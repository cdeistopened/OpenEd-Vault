## Notes

**CONTEXT:** Major voice in homeschool/unschooling world. Podcast done with Isaac Morehouse. NYT commentary request. Author of "Unschooled."

**CHALLENGE:** She writes about this stuff ALL THE TIME. Need to find a fresh angle she hasn't covered much.

**ACTION NEEDED:**
- Find topic that's fresh for her
- Could be something tangential to her usual beat
- Or a provocative take she hasn't published yet

**POTENTIAL ANGLES (need fresh ones):**
- Something she hasn't written about extensively
- Intersection of unschooling with new trends (AI, ESAs, microschools?)
- "What I Got Wrong About Unschooling" (contrarian reflection)
- Research-based piece on outcomes

**PODCAST:** Already done - can mine for article content
