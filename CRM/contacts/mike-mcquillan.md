## Notes

**CONTEXT:** BEcamp = "Business Education for Non-Business Majors" - a business education startup that partners with liberal arts colleges and high schools. They offer experiential in-person workshops - basically a "mini-MBA" with career exploration focus.

Target: Help non-business majors prepare for work and life. 10 modules covering Business Strategy, Marketing, Sales, Finance, Entrepreneurship, etc.

Partners include: Wellesley, Colby, CSW (Cambridge School of Weston)

**RELEVANCE TO OPENED:**
- Could be great for homeschool families wanting business education for teens
- Entrepreneurship education angle
- Career prep for non-traditional students

**ARTICLE ANGLES:**
- "Business Education for Homeschoolers: What Every Teen Should Know"
- "The Mini-MBA for High Schoolers"
- Encyclopedia entry on "Business Education" or "Career Preparation"

**STATUS:** Partnership pitch went cold (Dec 2024). Worth revisiting if we want to cover business education for teens.
