## 5 Questions with Tuttle Twins Creator Connor Boyack

### Libertas Institute

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Connor Boyack, founder of the Libertas Institute and creator of the 6-million-selling Tuttle Twins book series, believes our entire educational approach is backward.
> [...]
> **What's the driving philosophy behind your work with the Libertas Institute, Tuttle Twins, and other initiatives?**
> [...]
> **You've developed what appears to be a three-pronged approach through storytelling, entrepreneurship, and policy reform. Did you always have this vision?**
> 
> I have to tell them, when I started, there was no vision. I got my start in policy work, starting Libertas Institute as a state-based think tank in Utah. That was the tiny little vision.

### Tuttle Twins

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Connor Boyack, founder of the Libertas Institute and creator of the 6-million-selling Tuttle Twins book series, believes our entire educational approach is backward.
> [...]
> When my son was five years old, I found myself wanting to share with my kids what dad does as a "freedom fighter," changing laws and helping people. I looked on Amazon for children's books that would help me teach about free markets and property rights and entrepreneurship. There was nothing. So I partnered with my buddy, Elijah, who's our illustrator, and we launched the Tuttle Twins.
> 
> Again, there was no vision at the time. We literally created one book and we're like, "We don't know if this will sell. There's nothing like this on the market at all. Maybe this will be a dud,” but people liked it.
> 
> They wanted more. So we did a second and a third. Now we have like three dozen books under the Tuttle Twins brand for kids of all ages. We've sold 6 million copies. That then led to a cartoon series with Angel Studios that I never would have imagined before.

### Skip College (Book)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **You often talk about intentionality in education. What exactly do you mean by that?**
> 
> You'll remember this Isaac. You contributed a chapter to the book we did a few years ago, Skip College. Though provocatively titled, most people assume the co-authors are anti-college and want everyone to stop going. The thesis of the book was never to say college is inherently bad. It was to do precisely what you're saying.

### Praxis

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Let's be intentional. If you're intentional about going to college, there are often much better, cheaper and faster ways to get that degree. Or it may be that that's not your path and you need to go to Praxis, or a trade school, or some other model.

### Angel Studios

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Now we have like three dozen books under the Tuttle Twins brand for kids of all ages. We've sold 6 million copies. That then led to a cartoon series with Angel Studios that I never would have imagined before.

## College-for-All Is Breaking. What Replaces It?

### BuildWithin

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Michelle Rhee:** I spent most of my career in K–12—running nonprofits, leading D.C. Public Schools, and then advocacy. [...] A colleague called about a software company focused on apprenticeships—BuildWithin—and I realized I could pursue the same goal more directly by helping people build skills on the job. That’s how I moved into workforce development.

> [...]
> **Michael Horn:** Map energy drivers. In our Job Moves research, a good job puts you just over 50% in flow—there’s always some “suck.”

### Crash (Startup)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Isaac:** I started on the career side. [...] I launched a college alternative: a short bootcamp and then six-month paid apprenticeships. It worked at small scale. I tried to scale the “signal” piece with a startup called Crash—it crashed.

### Future.me

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Michael Horn:** [...] Teens should reflect on what activities energize or drain them, in detail (“leading the huddle,” “bouncing ideas,” not just “working with people”). Most graduates don’t know this about themselves. Tools like Future.me try to build that self-knowledge from actual experiences.

## Episode 001 - Students Aren't Standard

### OpenEd / My Tech High

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Matt Bowman is the ultimate education innovator. [...] If you don't know him, Matt is the founder of OpenEd (formerly My Tech High), a platform that partners with schools to provide personalized, flexible education options for K-12 students.
> [...]
> **Matt**: Open Ed started when we realized our children all needed different educational approaches. We thought, "Other parents must need this too." So we decided to help families access world-class education at no cost to them by contracting with school districts or charter schools.
> 
> We started with 92 pioneer students, focusing on tech and entrepreneurship. When I asked parents about their favorite curriculum providers, we got 92 different answers. That's when I thought, "Could our model be 'choose your own adventure' for curriculum by subject, course, child, and grade level?" Instead of standardization, we decided to partner with every best curriculum provider out there.

### Praxis

## Episode 002 - When someone asks if you homeschool...

### OpenEd / My Tech High

**Full Transcript Section:**

> In our conversations with families over the years, we've noticed this growing trend of educational experiences that defy traditional categorization. It's one of the key reasons we're evolving from My Tech High to OpenEd – to better capture the amazing ways families like yours are already customizing your children's education.
> [...]
> **Isaac:** Many parents don't realize what's possible in education today. I hear stories of families building custom entrepreneurship courses at home or combining online classes with in-person band lessons. Most parents don't know these options exist.
> 
> **Matt:** Hey everyone, Matt Bowman and Isaac Morehouse here. We're excited to discuss the transition from My Tech High to OpenEd.

### Southern New Hampshire University

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Take the story of one student who reached out to Matt on LinkedIn. She described herself as "a homeschooler enrolled in OpenEd (which partners with a public school).”
> 
> “I also split-enroll in my local school for band class,” she said, “and I'm pursuing a competency-based associate degree through Southern New Hampshire University."

### Praxis

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Isaac:** [...] I once read an article by James Currier, a tech founder with a VC firm called NFX. When I was raising funds for Praxis to build a tech platform, he told me, "What you're building is a job-seeker platform. That's distinct from Praxis and needs its own name."
> [...]
> **Isaac:** [...] When we started Praxis, it was aimed at those after high school graduation, whether they'd been in college for a few years and didn't like it, were deciding if they wanted to go to college, or maybe even graduated but needed career help.

> [...]
> **Isaac:** Today I'm joined by Aaron Osmond, CEO of Knowledge Pillars, one of our curriculum partners at OpenEd. Aaron has over 25 years of experience as a leader in IT training and certification.
> [...]

### WordPress Certified Editor Course

**Full Transcript Section:**

> And if your child is interested in their WordPress Certified Editor course, let them know we’re always hiring ;-)
> [...]
> **Links and resources:**
> - WordPress Certified Editor course

### GitHub

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Whether it's a GitHub repository full of personal projects or a WordPress site you built for a local business, these real-world examples speak louder than any resume bullet point.
> [...]
> **Aaron:** [...] That's why building your own portfolio of skills and proven projects - whether websites, e-commerce capabilities, or technical skills demonstrated on GitHub - is super important to employers right now.

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Isaac:** Let's move from networking to your experience in tech companies. Before Knowledge Pillars, you worked at places like Amazon Web Services and WordPerfect.

### WordPerfect / DataPerfect

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Isaac:** [...] Aaron, I heard you started your career without what most people think you need - a degree. Yet you got a job at WordPerfect, which was the predecessor to modern word processors.
> 
> **Aaron:** [...] I had the benefit of a mother working at WordPerfect in their customer support division. I got a job as a receptionist. But what I did next is what really matters. I dove in and started self-teaching, building my skills around DataPerfect, a database coding software.

## Episode 004 - The End of One-size-fits-all

### From Reopen to Reinvent (Book)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Matt:** Welcome to this edition of the OpenEd podcast. We're excited to have you join us. Our guest today is Michael Horn, one of the world's most respected thought leaders in education. Michael has a long and impressive bio, but in essence, he's deeply involved in every aspect of education.
> 
> I'd like to give a special shout-out to his most recent book, "From Reopen to Reinvent," which features My Tech High, now OpenEd, as one of the highlighted providers. Thank you, Michael, for joining us today. We're really looking forward to our conversation.
> 
> **Michael:** It's great to be with you guys. I was chuckling at your introduction, Matt. You said "one of the most respected" and so on. I'd say I'm most respected in your corner of the world, but I'm not exactly wandering the halls of Congress anytime soon. So who knows?
> 
> **Isaac:** Matt, which page was it that My Tech High was mentioned in the book?
> 
> **Michael:** You guys are mentioned a few times in there.

### My Tech High / OpenEd (Program)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Matt:** We're so glad to have you, Michael. Let me share a personal story that you might not even remember. Back in 2015, I had been running My Tech High, now OpenEd, for several years and reading everything you were writing. I thought, "I've got to chat with this guy somehow." So I responded to one of your blog posts, challenging something you said. You actually responded, and I was incredibly impressed by that. We ended up having a dialogue, and I've been honored to be connected with you ever since.
> 
> What I shared was that our model had been following the disruptive innovation cycle to a T. We found non-consumers of the public education system, i.e., homeschoolers. We then innovated around the edges of regulation, without crossing legal boundaries. We predicted that regulators would attempt to catch up and edit regulations, even if they weren't changing the law. All of those things were in your disruptive innovation cycle. I thought it was fascinating that you nailed it so precisely.

### Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) (Service/Policy)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Michael:** I think a lot of people are worried about the transaction costs on parents. I am too, but I think parents have always dealt with this stress in coordinating after-school activities, figuring out who's gonna care for their kid in summer, and so forth. So I think it's less of an add-on than we think.
> 
> And frankly, to your point, policy is starting to catch up in some meaningful ways.
> 
> Somewhere between 13 and 19 states now have education savings accounts type policies (ESAs). I think it's very significant. You obviously have figured out how to partner with districts and help them stand up alternative schooling options in some pretty neat ways. My belief is that this competitive pressure is a good thing because districts are going to have to find increasing ways to offer a portfolio of options and get out of the one-size-fits-all mindset.
> 
> [...]
> 
> **Michael:** The ESA movement is fundamentally different from vouchers, and that's important. A voucher is essentially a ticket for one thing—it's still one-size-fits-all to some degree. An ESA, on the other hand, says, "Here's a pool of money. How do you want to distribute it across various options?" If you don't use it all, it rolls over to the next year, expanding your future choices. It's a very different mindset.
> 
> [...]
> 
> **Matt:** I just want to add a couple thoughts. The Wall Street Journal comment around ESAs being just vouchers—what's interesting is that the data from these ESA providers shows that still 90% of ESAs are going to a single provider: private school.
> 
> Except the forecast in Utah is 50%. People in the market are projecting Utah's usage to be 50% because My Tech High—OpenEd now—has been around for 15 years, showing that there's a way to "à la carte" your child's education.
> 
> I find it fascinating that as other states adopt ESAs, and even you've said it in articles, the adoption over time goes from a single-payer voucher to an à la carte model. We see that happen over years of an ESA, and Utah's ESA just started August 7th. It's the first in the market right now, and they're projecting people are going to use it more à la carte than any other state.

### Outschool (Platform)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Michael:** This is a crucial point because markets and investments thrive on certainty. Out School, as you know, conducted research through their foundation, entering various markets and essentially giving away money.
> 
> To Isaac's point, distributing funds is straightforward, but encouraging families to spend it is challenging. It requires social trust, recommendations, and guidance—not in a top-down manner, which often raises red flags, but through grassroots social trust. It's about families saying, "Oh, that provider is trustworthy, and you've used them? Alright, I'll give it a try."

### Odyssey (ESA Platform)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Michael:** I completely agree. I've made this argument to my friend Joe Connor, who runs Odyssey, one of these ESA transaction platforms. I've suggested that ultimately, he's going to need to become the guidance function because he'll need a way to represent value. I hesitate to use the word "quality," but let's say "value" in varied ways, because people aren't going to think about value in a monolithic way.

### ALEKS math (Curriculum)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Matt:** That is the challenge because sometimes we'll get feedback from parents that say, "Hey, my child loves ALEKS math," or "My child doesn't love ALEKS math." Parents ask, "Well, what's the difference? Describe your child."
> 
> So now it needs context in this ratings and review system of what type of child was using this. Then, you know, based on that, it was a 4 out of 5 for this type of child, but a 1 out of 5 for this other type of child, and that's complex.

### Trust Radius (Service)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Isaac:** This conversation reminds me of my experience in the B2B SaaS startup world. We had a podcast where we explored the concept of the "Infocalypse" - there's too much information out there, and trust in typical sales and marketing tactics is breaking down.
> 
> We interviewed the founder of Trust Radius, a software review site. He shared fascinating insights about the limitations of traditional review systems. Other sites like G2 suffer from what we call "4.7 star syndrome." Everyone has figured out how to game the system. If you have 5 stars, it looks fake. If you have less than 4.7, you don't look good. So everybody aims for 4.7, and the ratings lose meaning.

### Khan Academy (App/Platform)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Isaac:** My oldest son, he's just not a math guy. He doesn't really like it. He's very analytic, very philosophical, very artistic. So he was just way behind in math. At various points, we tried to kind of get him to do it and be really structured and fight with him. But for the most part, we kind of threw up our hands for several years.
> 
> Well, then all of a sudden he wanted to go to school. It was like a two-day-a-week school when he was, I think, 13 or 14. So over the summer, we said, "Well, to go there, you have to take math, and if you want to be in math with other kids your age, some of your friends, you've got to know the level of math that they're doing."
> 
> He's like, "Oh, so I'll just start at the beginning." So that summer, he literally started Khan Academy as a 13-year-old. He was like, "I'll just start at kindergarten," and he just went through the entire Khan Academy until he caught up to like algebra or whatever they were at. He did it in like a month or two just by himself.

## Episode 005 - she almost gave up on education

### OpenEd (Program)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Isaac Morehouse:** Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. I'm Isaac Morehouse, and today I'm joined by Andrea Fife, who is the head of learning at OpenEd. I've only been working with Andrea for a couple of months, but I can honestly say that in my 20 years in and around education, I don't think I've ever met someone with such genuine intensity and passion for helping families get the best possible education they can.
> 
> [...]
> 
> **Andrea Fife:** Fortunately, I found this program that's built on the idea of being able to maximize everything for every learner. The passion has always been there, but it definitely became more noticeable during my time in the classroom.

### CLEP tests (Service)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Andrea:** I came back the next year and changed majors to English, against my mother's advice. I made it about six or eight weeks before calling my parents and saying, "I'm coming home. I don't know what I'm doing here."
> 
> After coming home, I got a job at a real estate company where I discovered a passion for graphic design. That's when I decided I wanted to go back to school to learn more about it. I found a different, non-traditional program where classes were only five weeks long, you take one class at a time, and it was interest-based. They had opportunities to test out of classes or take CLEP tests. It was much more personalized.

### AP World History (Curriculum/Course)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Andrea:** I have a great story that relates to that. My son, who's a senior in high school this year, was complaining about his AP World History class. I said, "Okay, don't go." He was shocked and said he had to go or he'd fail. I asked him who cares if he fails, and who says he has to graduate.
> 
> We got through to the end of this conversation, and he said, "I just wanted to complain, Mom. I want to go to history. I want to do well in this class." I told him that was great, but I wanted to make sure he knew that the struggles he was having were a result of a choice he made to take that class.

## Episode 006 - Deschooling Your Mind with Hannah Frankman

### Praxis (Program)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Isaac:** First, I've got to ask you, I know how passionate you are about alternatives to education and your own homeschool experience, your experience with Praxis, which is a college alternative. When and how did you decide, "I've got to be loud about this. I've got to be a voice about this and get Rebel Educator off the ground"? What's the goal of Rebel Educator, and how did that come about?
> 
> **Hannah:** I launched Rebel Educator a little over two years ago. But I've been talking about alternative education long before that. Working at Praxis is actually where I got my start in education commentary. I was writing blog posts for the marketing team, partly about my experience being homeschooled and then not going to college and starting to work in startups instead.

### Deschooling Society by Ivan Illich (Book)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Hannah:** I think you hit on a really important point in teeing up this question, which is that we live in a very schooled society. There's a great little book by Ivan Illich called "Deschooling Society" that everyone should read. The schooled mindset is a very cultural phenomenon. I was homeschooled first grade through 12th grade, barely set foot inside any normal education institution for my entire childhood, and I still had all kinds of mindsets that I'd picked up from the culture that I had to unlearn.

### Dumbing Us Down by John Taylor Gatto (Book)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Hannah:** There's a really great book by John Taylor Gatto called "Dumbing Us Down." For those who are not yet familiar, Gatto was a public school teacher in New York City for 30 years. He worked in every type of school imaginable and won Teacher of the Year two years in a row. The second time he won, he accepted his nomination and resigned from his position all at the same time in the pages of the New York Times. He wrote this amazing piece about why he felt like he was doing more harm than good as a school teacher, and if he really wanted to help the youth, he had to find something else to do.

### Phonics (Method)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Hannah:** It's kind of like how schools stopped teaching kids phonics and started teaching kids how to read by just recognizing words - the "look-say" method. You're stripping kids of the cheat code that is the alphabet, which allows you to decode any words you could ever come across, not just in the English language, but in other languages too. You're not teaching kids the code anymore. You're just saying, "Look at a word and recognize it. And if you don't recognize it for sure, guess what it is based on the clues of the rest of the sentence."

### Hume's guillotine (Mental Model/Method)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Hannah:** Let me share a couple more philosophical razors. There's one called Hume's guillotine, which is such a great name for a mental model. You should teach that one to your sons because they're going to love it. It states that a cause must be sufficiently able to produce the effect assigned to it. Which is a good measure of like, okay, if we're saying that this thing happened, like X happened because of Y, is Y actually powerful enough to cause X? Or actually capable enough to cause X?

### Newton's flaming laser sword / Adler's razor (Mental Model/Method)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Hannah:** There's one more that's really funny. Just the name. It's called Adler's razor, but it has another name, which is Newton's flaming laser sword, which is also a good one to teach your kids because again, the name is really funny. It states that if something can't be settled by experimentation and reason, it's not worth debating. If you can't produce sufficient evidence or sufficient rational arguments to make and debate your point, it's not worth the other person's time.

### Khan Academy (App/Platform)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Isaac:** My oldest son, he's just not a math guy. He doesn't really like it. He's very analytic, very philosophical, very artistic. So he was just way behind in math. At various points, we tried to kind of get him to do it and be really structured and fight with him. But for the most part, we kind of threw up our hands for several years.
> 
> Well, then all of a sudden he wanted to go to school. It was like a two-day-a-week school when he was, I think, 13 or 14. So over the summer, we said, "Well, to go there, you have to take math, and if you want to be in math with other kids your age, some of your friends, you've got to know the level of math that they're doing."
> 
> He's like, "Oh, so I'll just start at the beginning." So that summer, he literally started Khan Academy as a 13-year-old. He was like, "I'll just start at kindergarten," and he just went through the entire Khan Academy until he caught up to like algebra or whatever they were at. He did it in like a month or two just by himself.

## Episode 007 - 5 Building Blocks of Open Education with Isaac Morehouse

### Tom Sawyer (Book)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Isaac:** A lot of people who actually would enjoy reading Tom Sawyer end up not enjoying it because we all kind of have that rebellious independent thing in us for better or worse. And you're like, "Well, that was forced on me." I mean, how many people think of the classic books that everyone's forced to read in school as stuff you're supposed to read? They don't think of those as "Oh, let's check this out. Maybe this is cool. Maybe it's not."

### Bob books (Books)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Isaac:** For us, knowing that the approach - I didn't know what approach to take, so I was like, "Forget it, I'm just gonna go hands-off for a while." I don't even know what to do because everything was creating conflict.
> 
> We tried reading the little Bob books, we tried flashcards, we tried different stuff. And it was just like, "No, I don't want to do this." Not always even in a bratty way, but just hard. It wasn't clicking. We were just butting heads.

### Calvin and Hobbes (Books/Comics)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Isaac:** And then we used to read him Calvin and Hobbes comics every night before he went to bed. One night it was really late, he went to bed late for some reason, and I was like, "No, it's too late. I'm not going to read you a story tonight." And he's like, "Please." I'm like, "Nope." And then I walked by the room later and he's in there reading it to himself.

### Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) (Service)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Isaac:** You're seeing an explosion of education savings accounts where states are saying instead of giving the money to the school, we'll give money to the parents and they can use it not just for tuition at a private school, they can use it for their own customized education. They can do co-ops and courses and all these different things. Fifteen states passed those just last year.

### Acton Academy (Program)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Isaac:** There have been people doing this for a really long time, homeschooling and things like that. But you've had this proliferation of approaches and different models. You've got Acton Academy out there. You've got all the Montessori schools that have been around for a while. You've got unschooling, world schooling, people who are permanently remote, who are doing like taking their kids with them to travel around if they have a remote job. It's incredible.

### Montessori (Method)

## Episode 008 - MARK HYATT

### Falcon AeroLab (Program)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> [00:00:00] **Isaac:** Welcome back to the open ed podcast, everybody. I am the sometimes host Isaac Morehouse. And today I'm joined by Mark Hyatt, who is the founder of Falcon arrow lab. And this is, I'm so excited about this conversation because I, I met Matt. Uh, sorry, Mark through Matt Bowman not that long ago and hearing Mark talk about the stuff that he's doing with Falcon AeroLabs, which is one of one of our partners here at Open Ed.
> 
> It got me so excited. We talk a lot on this podcast about different ways to think about education and different unique approaches to learning. Every kid needs different things and whether it be approaching a similar subject in a new way or approaching a subject you never thought of. This conversation is going to be really cool because Falcon AeroLabs, let's just get to the punchline.
> 
> You're getting middle school and high school kids up in airplanes sometimes.

### Introduction to Aerospace / Over the Horizon (Course)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> [00:19:34] **Mark Hyatt:** Yes, and one of them we actually partnered with OpenEd, and, uh, it's, I think it's Introduction to Aerospace, where they, they can get one flight, get two if they really like it, and they do an online course, uh, it's called Over the Horizon, that we broadcast out and it's virtual. And, you know, we, we, uh, We, we put that into Oregon and Utah and, uh, actually worked a little bit with TechTrap over there in Idaho too.
> 
> But, uh, bottom line is, uh, it's a survey course, almost a Smithsonian survey course. And we bring in astronauts and the weather presenters from TV to talk about meteorology. And we bring in mechanics and we bring in people that have flown the coolest airplanes.

## Episode 009 - Daniella Park of Baketivity

### Baketivity (Service/Subscription Box)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Charlie Deist:** Daniella, I get the sense that you're wearing multiple hats at Baktivity, including, appropriately, a chef's hat. Can you tell us a bit more about what Baktivity is and your role there?
> 
> **Daniella Park:** That's the glorious thing about Baktivity. It's a family-run company, and when you join, you think you'll do one thing, but it evolves. I came in as their spokesperson, but now I'm the chef behind the scenes, creating recipes for the boxes. I also help film how-to videos, manage the team, and connect STEM learning to the recipes.
> 
> [...]
> 
> **Charlie:** You mentioned the boxes, which seem to be at the core of what you offer. It's a subscription service, right? And I think you have a lot of customers in the homeschooling community or people building their own à la carte educational experience. Can you tell us more about what people actually get in these boxes?
> 
> **Daniella Park:** I love this because everything you need to learn, have fun, and create family memories comes in a box. But Baktivity is completely thinking outside the box, which I always find funny because it comes in a box!
> 
> You get pre-measured ingredients, which means less mess and fuss for parents. This allows you to focus on learning. Whether it's for a child interested in cooking, which is really popular right now, or to incorporate STEM learning, we've got it covered.

## Episode 010 - Relax and trust the process

### Sudbury Valley School (Method/School)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Isaac:** I always like to say, when somebody is obsessing over one thing and diving really deep into it and mastering it, take something that feels unrelated to your typical academic disciplines, like piano. If a child does nothing but piano for months at a time and just obsesses over it and masters it, at the end of that time, what have they learned? It's not just piano. They've learned piano too, but they've learned how to learn, how to be obsessed, how to go deep on something.
> 
> I think that often gets missed when you get into the world of work, of value creation. The ability to say, "Here's a problem, and I need to obsess over it and go deep and solve it." That's really hard for people who have always just sort of been tracked on 50-minute segment fits.
> 
> So don't worry so much about what the subject is. I remember reading some stories from the Sudbury Valley School, which is like a very unschooled school. It's been around for a long time. One kid spent an entire year doing nothing but fishing and just learning how to fish, doing everything, obsessing over different lures. That's all he cared about, and they just let him do it. Then one day he got interested in math and he learned math really quickly because he applied that same obsessive deep-dive mentality to it. So they're learning how to learn as well.

### Minecraft (App/Game)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Isaac:** Screen time: friend, foe, or frenemy? I'm gonna quickly say frenemy. I think it's easy to treat anything that's fairly new like it's utterly unlike anything that's come before. And there are elements of that that are true. In some sense, the internet is utterly unlike things that have come before. But in other senses, the patterns hold.
> 
> Any new technology, any new thing that sort of disrupts the norms of human behavior and societal behavior—they're always hard. They always bring challenges, and they always bring opportunities and risks. Screen time absolutely can have negative effects. I have seen it with my own kids. We started out way too loosey-goosey about screen time. We're like, "Ah, he's playing Minecraft. He's learning. It's all good." And then we're like, "Wow, why is he acting so rude and impatient and like a zombie?" Oh, the screen time thing needs limits, needs parameters.

### Bob books (Books)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Matt:** And then the other thought is maybe they do have a little bit of nervousness about it. Like your son did, start them at a kindergarten book, right? And let them feel really confident. Have it be funny or a nursery rhyme or rhythmic or something and have them just start small. And then just add up instead of saying you're at third grade or fourth grade, you need to be reading this level. Here's a book, read it. That's not how to excite kids about reading.

### Screenplays (Resource)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Matt:** You know, one other idea just to do a quick plug for an Open Ed resource. Screenplays are one of our partners that we work with and they have dozens, if not many dozens of screenplays of all the famous movies. So, Harry Potter, or Star Wars, or whatever, go read the screenplay of your favorite movie. And just see what the director's cut says and where they show Harry Potter walking through the woods or whatever. What does the screenplay show? It's a fascinating way to get a hook into kids' interest into reading.

> 
> Hey everyone, welcome to the Open Ed podcast. I'm Charlie Deist, and today, we're departing from our usual one-guest format. We have six people here from a program called Nature Kids Connect. It’s a community-based outdoor enrichment program. It’s not a full-time school, right?
> 
> **Nature Kids Connect**:
> 
> Yes.
> 
> **Charlie**:
> 
> Annalise, can you describe how the program works and what a typical day looks like?
> 
> **Annalise**:
> 
> People either get dropped off or gather in the parking lot. We start with a nature-related game, then go on a hike to our sit spots for quiet reflection for about 30 minutes. After lunch, we have a themed activity, usually related to nature, followed by free time to explore.
> 
> **Charlie**:
> 
> How often does this program take place?
> 
> **Nature Kids Connect**:
> 
> It happens every Friday from 10:30 AM to 2:30 PM throughout the school year.

## Episode 013 - Sidekick to Hero

### Sidekick to Hero (Program)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Charlie Deist:** Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm Charlie Deist, here today with Joey Masio of Sidekick to Hero. Joey, how are you doing?
> 
> **Joey Masio:** I'm doing fantastic. It's a beautiful day.
> 
> [...]
> 
> **Joey:** It also causes teens and adults everywhere to do things like procrastinate, self-doubt, and other counterproductive behaviors. It hit me during that time that there's no education, no class, no curriculum that really teaches self-development, resilience, or anything like that. We find this stuff as adults. We discover these books and love them, and we always say the same thing: "I wish I knew this when I was a teen."

### Deep Work by Cal Newport / Atomic Habits by James Clear (Books)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Charlie:** Exactly. I think it was actually the little postcard you were giving out that caught my eye, with the cover of "Deep Work" by Cal Newport and "Atomic Habits" by James Clear. He's got the perfect name for what he does. His whole thing is about how you don't lack motivation, you lack clarity. These are things that, if I had learned as a kid, could have saved me so many frustrated hours.
> 
> **Joey:** When teaching concepts from these books in my Sidekick to Hero curriculum, I've found that they're often way longer than they need to be. Many could really be pamphlets. The stories in books like "Atomic Habits" are great, but the concepts are what teens need at this point. They need them quicker and in video format with a lot of humor. That's what I do.

### The Anxious Generation by Jonathan Haidt (Book)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Charlie:** Have you followed any of the discussion around Jonathan Haidt's new book, "The Anxious Generation"?
> 
> **Joey:** No, I haven't read that one, but I've read one of his other books. Can you give me the pamphlet version?
> 
> **Charlie:** Sure. Haidt presents data showing a sharp increase in mental health issues, including suicides, coinciding with the advent of smartphones, particularly around 2012 with the introduction of the front-facing camera and the rise of social media platforms. This led to people constantly comparing themselves to others, resulting in different but equally concerning problems for both boys and girls.

### Growth Mindset / The Infinite Game / Antifragile / Own Your Own Mind / Total Money Makeover (Books)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Charlie:** Let's play a quick improv game called One Sentence Summaries. I'll give you the title of a book you teach, and you give me the pamphlet version in as few words as possible. Ready?
> 
> 1. Carol Dweck, "Growth Mindset" **Joey:** You do not have to stay stuck.
> 2. Simon Sinek, "The Infinite Game" **Joey:** Play like the game never ends.
> 3. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, "Antifragile" **Joey:** When you break, you get stronger.
> 4. Napoleon Hill, "Own Your Own Mind" **Joey:** Don't let your thoughts control you. You control them.
> 5. Dave Ramsey, "Total Money Makeover" **Joey:** Stop spending money!

## Episode 014 - Stop Outsourcing Your Child's Education

### Apogee Strong / Apogee Schools

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Matt Beaudreau**:
> Sure, I differentiate education and schooling. Schooling is like a religion, but education is about humans getting better and designing their lives. I was a really good student but ended up not knowing who I was. I worked at Stanford University, public and private schools, and eventually realized the traditional system wasn’t for me. I launched my own campuses and started consulting for Fortune 500s. Now, we have our own K-12 campuses under the Apogee umbrella, mentorship programs, and a university system on the way. I even run a farm now—so I'm never short of things to do!
> 
> ...
> 
> **Ela Richmond**:
> Why did you start Apogee as a mentorship program? What gap were you trying to fill?
> 
> **Matt**:
> People often don’t know where to start. We provide a roadmap and walk alongside them, offering experiences and mentorship from experts in various fields. It’s about giving direction and support as they figure out their own path.

### Socratic Conversations / Discussions

> ### **[37:00] Socratic Conversations at Home**
> 
> **Ela Richmond**:
> You mentioned having Socratic discussions at your dinner table. How do you promote that at home?
> 
> **Matt**:
> We make reading fun and encourage open conversations about books. We ask thought-provoking questions, put the kids in scenarios, and have them defend their choices. It’s a fun way for the whole family to engage in meaningful discussions.

### Morning Basket / Menu

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Charlynn**:
> It unfolded gradually over the first couple years. At first, I stuck pretty closely to curriculum and tried to replicate a school-like schedule. The next year was more flexible. Then we bought a house that needed remodeling, which forced us to adjust how we were educating.
> 
> I saw so much value in the kids learning hands-on life skills as they helped with the remodel. They were learning the value of hard work, gaining confidence, and developing skills that would truly serve them in life - in many ways, more than another curriculum lesson would have at that age.
> 
> Now, in our third and fourth year, I feel like we've found more of a middle ground. We do a morning basket and menu with certain things we want to cover daily. But we also do a lot of following their interests and learning as we go. I wouldn't consider myself an unschooler, but I'm more eclectic in taking ideas from different approaches.

> OpenEd partners with school districts so you can access funding to make the most of your kids' education. It gives me access to those educational tax dollars so I can be reimbursed for many educational expenses. Instead of trying to do everything on a tight budget, I can really maximize educational opportunities through classes, field trips, curriculum, and supplies.

## Episode 017 - From Classroom Teacher to Homeschool Mom

### OpenEd / My Tech High

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Jamie Lesko (00:46.947) That was a great question. So our family started in a charter school right off. had a neighborhood charter school that many neighbors went to and highly recommended. So when my oldest was in kindergarten, we applied and got into an amazing charter school and really enjoyed it. And then each child successively started joining that charter school. then
> 
> Once my youngest was in kindergarten, I took the opportunity to go back to work and sought out to see if they needed any support at that charter school. Turns out they did. They had a shortage of special education teachers. And so I was able to work there part time and from there was able to be with my kids at the same charter school for the first, man, eight years. We were there for about eight years.
> 
> ...
> 
> Jamie Lesko (02:47.083) so that we could be in the same neighborhood and learn together. And, you know, we had such a great education. I wasn't going to break anything. You know, I wasn't going to fix anything that wasn't broken, I guess is what I meant to say. And, however, when really the push came to shove and we thought about all that learning from home gave to us, the opportunities that it gave to us, the flexibility that it was giving to us.
> 
> We really discovered a lot about all the opportunities that are out there regarding education and, you know, having that control and being able to dictate what we learned, how we learned, and when we learned. I can tell you a little bit more about that, that experience. But it just really opened up our eyes to maybe there is a different way. Maybe there is more that we can provide our students here. And
> 
> So I took the opportunity to work from home. We gave our kids the chance. Did they want to return back to the charter school or did they want to continue learning from home? They all opted to give homeschool a go. And so we went that route for a little, or we started on that. We launched right into that. And we discovered a lot of things. A few things that we discovered is that I have
> 
> a child who really likes to do math at 10 30 at night. And if we were in the charter school, that would have been completely irresponsible for me to let her do that. We had to get up early in the morning every day. We had to start school or start our day at seven o 'clock in the morning. Because like I said, I was a teacher at that school, so I had to be there before students arrived. And as a special education teacher, my meetings were after school, so we were there.
> 
> relatively late as well. And that meant that my kids were in tow. They left when I left, they arrived when I arrived, and they had to stay, you know, afterwards. And even though I encouraged them to do their homework while we were in the school setting, they always tended to keep their homework for when we got home. So coming home late meant dinner activities, homework, lessons, practices, everything happened.
> 
> Jamie Lesko (05:11.875) between 5 p and hopefully before 10 p so that we could actually get to bed at a decent time. so, you know, allowing my child to do homework, math homework at 1030 at night was not something we would have been able to allow with a schedule like that. So that was definitely really eye -opening for our family and something that we meant.
> 
> Ela Richmond (05:32.961) Mm -hmm.
> 
> Jamie Lesko (05:40.951) that we decided was worth exploring more.

### Saxon Math

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Jamie Lesko (20:59.297) Yes. So when we first started homeschooling, because I was so nervous about it and just wanted to just try and keep things to what I already knew and I didn't want to throw too many changes on my kids. That's where I started. I started with what curriculum are they using at their charter school? Because I knew that that worked. It was something my kids were accustomed to. We didn't have to create new processes around
> 
> new curriculum, we were able to just insert and plug and play is what I is what I used to just call it. We should just be able to plug it in and go. And so I did I utilized I utilized Saxon math because that was the program, the math program that my that our charter school utilized. So it was something that my kids are really familiar with. They knew how to do it. They knew what the expectations were. And we could just plug and play.

### The Good and the Beautiful

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Jamie Lesko (20:59.297) ...The writing program was one that the Charter School actually designed. And so I wasn't able to just go and purchase that curriculum. So I had to do some research. And like I said, I relied on the homeschool community that already existed around me. And I just said, what do you suggest? So they suggested The Good and the Beautiful. So I said, all right, I'm going to do some exploring there and see how we feel about it.
> 
> The Good and the Beautiful was a fantastic program that worked really well for my, for my girls. My son struggled. He struggled really badly with it.

### Acellus Academy

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Jamie Lesko (23:19.179) ...But then the next year, it was a matter of sitting down and just saying, Okay, what do you what do you need?
> 
> Jamie Lesko (23:19.179) What you know we don't have to do this curriculum, we can do any curriculum and there's a ton out there. What would you like to try? You know, so then we tried an online curriculum. We've tried to sell us Academy that has been a great curriculum for my students in some areas, but we also found that it wasn't the best curriculum for all my students in all the areas.

## Episode 018 - Is It Really Dyslexia?

### Orton-Gillingham

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Krystle**:
> I was at the point where I thought I needed to start making a list of trades for her that didn't involve reading, writing, spelling, or math because she couldn't do those things no matter how hard I tried. I was doing school with her year-round, not traditional public school where we'd do it for so many weeks out of the year and then take the summer off. I was doing school with her every single day except Sunday, and sometimes even on Saturday. And nothing. She wasn't progressing at all.
> 
> I did all of the Orton-Gillingham programs for dyslexia, and nothing was working. So I was going to start listing trades she could learn to help her succeed in life as an adult. But then I thought, that's not good enough. I felt like I was giving up on her daughter.
> 
> ...
> 
> **Krystle**:
> Orton-Gillingham is basically the mainstream program for dyslexia. There are all sorts of curricula founded on the Orton-Gillingham-based program to help kids with true cognitive dyslexia learn to read. However, when they don't have cognitive dyslexia, and it's an ocular motor issue, they're stuck at a standstill. They can only get so far, and people think, "I guess this is it. I guess this is all they can achieve." But a lot of times, it's more because it's an ocular motor issue instead of a cognitive issue.

Being a research scientist and working with the human body, I took that knowledge into play and worked with different specialists like medical massage therapists and reading scientists. From there, I developed exercises and this reading program. My daughter was essentially my guinea pig.
> 
> I had a mentor at the time who was guiding me, saying, "Let's try this with her." There were things I implemented that even surprised him. He asked, "How are you getting her to progress so quickly? What are you doing?" And I explained the methods I was using.
> 
> ### The Birth of Vision Reading Academy [04:40]
> 
> That's how Vision Reading Academy was born - out of the desperation of trying to help my own child. Now, she's 13 years old, reading at college level at over 800 words per minute. She can read a 600-page book in two days, and that's while doing her schoolwork and hanging out with friends. She's not just sitting there with the book in front of her face the entire time. She reads tremendously fast.
> 
> ...
> 
> ### The Vision Reading Academy Program [14:14]
> 
> **Krystle**:
> When they come and onboard onto the program, we assign them to a one-on-one coach because we want to make sure that coach is watching them and ensuring they're progressing properly throughout the program. We start with base exercises. Just like you're not going to go to the gym and pick up a 110-pound weight and try to curl it right off the bat, we start with base exercises to get the eyes used to working properly.
> 
> As we continue to awaken those muscles and help them grow, we start adding more exercises. The program is set up so that students meet with a certified coach twice a week for 30 minutes. We don't want to tire out their eyes or get them overstimulated or frustrated. We want to make sure we're growing them but not pushing them to the level of frustration every single time.
> 
> Every three weeks for the first 12 weeks, an assessor will evaluate their eyes to see how that growth is happening with those muscles. It's very clear when students are doing their eye exercises because there are monumental changes in how their eyes move. You'll also see the difference in the reading program side of it, where their ability to read and their frustration level with reading completely changes.

### Minecraft

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Krystle**:
> Now we've got screens in our school systems, screens at home, kids doing their homework on screens, playing video games like Minecraft. While these games might help with coding and other skills, I believe they're a huge detriment to the actual function of their eyes as a whole.

## Episode 019 – Q&A: ADHD, Social Skills, & Making Hard Choices in Alternative Education

### Open Ed Daily

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Isaac: Oh, I love it. I love getting these questions and we get questions, we get stories. Uh, so keep those coming by the way.
> 
> Uh, you can, you can email us. Market at open ed. co. you can go subscribe to the open ed daily as well. We're always soliciting questions. We're going to jump in the first question. I've got a surprise secret weapon, that we're going to have help us with an answer.

### Chat GPT / AI

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Isaac: I love it. What an amazing answer. I feel like I have learned so many things I didn't know or had never thought of before. I'm curious. You mentioned the technology tools. Have you ever tried or your kids ever tried? Using a chat GPT or something and saying, Hey, can you take this complex task and break it into really small tasks for me or for someone with ADHD?
> 
> Andrea: Uh, yes, absolutely. absolutely. Uh, the emergence of, of AI is huge for people with ADHD. you know, you can go straight to the source with a tool like chat GBT, or there's some really great apps that are actually there's. There's a lot of great housework apps. Most people with ADHD struggle with chores, and there's a lot of ones that are actually designed to break your chores down into manageable steps.

### How to ADHD (YouTube Channel)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Andrea: so I'll leave you with one parting thought, one of my favorites, ADHD YouTuber, Jessica McCabe of How to ADHD. She's got this cute little song I love. it says, try different, try again. and so that would be my, my parting thought when you're working with your children on these skills.

### Sudbury Valley School / Free to Learn (Book)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Isaac: I started off pretty much in the same place. And then at one point I got like much more radical. Yeah. I was reading about the Sudbury Valley school and reading a free to learn and just like, Hey, don't make them do anything. Just let them pick whatever. And, and while theoretically.
> 
> I think there's actually some really strong cases there. And I don't think it's impossible for that to work. I found it too stressful to be that fully hands off. so like, I think I've come down to basically the same place. Okay. Reading, writing, and basic math.

### Khan Academy / Code.org / Scratch

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Matt: no, that's great. And, you know, many states have actually adopted computer science as replacement for math credit. And what I like about that is that, uh, learning to code using code. org or whatever Khan Academy type tools are out there for free, helping your child or scratch is a great intro to, to programming is a great math instruction.
> 
> And so if, you find your child that's struggling with traditional math curriculum, try some, you know, to Andrea's point, just don't try harder. Try different. And try something like coding or scratch or whatever and help them learn those principles, which are very mathematically based. And that's really great math.

## Episode 020 - The Secret to Not Ruining Your Homeschool Kids | Veteran Mom's 20-Year Journey

### Sandy Grant's Guide to Homeschooling

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Ela: Sandy has six kids and began homeschooling in 2004, so she's been doing this for a very long time. She's a veteran in this field. Five of your kids are done with homeschool, and now you just have one more, correct?
> 
> Sandy: Yes, he's 16 and a junior this year.
> 
> Ela: That's awesome. You're very involved in the homeschool world. You have a guide that's absolutely incredible for new homeschool parents that you share liberally. You're embedded in different Facebook groups and communities. What has that journey been like for you, getting started in homeschool and then becoming as involved as you are now?
> 
> Sandy: ...I found I was answering the same questions repeatedly, so I created a document that I share to help answer all the beginning questions—things that work, things that don't, and whatever tips I can give that might be helpful.

### Joy Hakim's "History of US" / Liberty Kids / American Ride

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Sandy: I do most of my planning during the summer. Once school starts, I don't have time to make lesson plans. I try to determine what we're going to do during the school year and how much I want them to get done each day. During summer, I look at each subject and how each kid can meet those requirements.
> 
> Some years we'll do history all together as part of our morning routine. Other years we'll all cover US history but differently—one using a public school textbook, one reading Joy Hakim's "History of US" books, and one watching Liberty Kids. You meet them where they are and try to cover the subject. Some years we go light on history and heavier on science, and some years we really focus on read-alouds.
> 
> Every year I ask, "Where do I want our focus to be this year?" And it changes every year. One year, all we did for history was watch an episode of American Ride during lunch, and that was our history for the year.

### Scratch

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Sandy: I try to keep our core schoolwork simple. I want to ensure they have a broad base—understanding the basic timeline of history, concepts of biology and physics, and so on. But I don't want to fill their whole day with assigned work and leave no time for their own interests.
> 
> I aim to keep formal schoolwork to about four hours, so they're done by early afternoon and have plenty of time for their own pursuits. Whether they use that time is up to them—I've got dinner to make and other things to do. My son has loved computer programming since he was 10-12, making things on Scratch, and that's what he grew up to be—a computer programmer.

### ParentLink

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Ela: Let's end with some rapid-fire questions. First, what advice would you have for a new OpenEd parent at any grade level?
> 
> Sandy: Number one, read ParentLink because it answers many of your questions. There's a large learning curve, especially with custom-built programs. Don't be afraid to ask questions, even if people say, "Have you read ParentLink?" Yes, reading it first will eliminate some basic questions, but there are no stupid questions—people will help you either way.

## Episode 021 - Why We Left School (The Red Flags She Wishes She Saw Earlier)

### Home Centered Learning

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Ela: Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. I'm Ela, your sometimes host, and today I'm so excited because I'm joined by Cassie Shepard. How are you doing today?
> 
> Cassie: I'm doing great. Thank you so much for having me on.
> 
> Ela: Yeah. So a little bit about you - you have four kids, you've Utah based, and you've been doing homeschool for a little while. And you also have a really popular Instagram channel.
> 
> Cassie: That's right. I'm over at Home Centered Learning on Instagram and that's my main platform. I have a website as well, [homecenteredlearning.com](http://homecenteredlearning.com). It's been a great way to connect with other homeschooling families and something I've been really passionate about. It's been a fun creative outlet for me to have that space and also create a community of like-minded mothers and families who embrace this lifestyle.

### The Good and the Beautiful

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Cassie: ...Now I'm very eclectic in what I use. I started with The Good and the Beautiful and still love it because it's easy, but instead of rigidly following lessons, I use it more as a guide and bring in other books and activities. We love using literature - my older girls love to read. This year we're excited to do more art and creative projects. I have one son who loves Legos and engineering, so we give him lots of opportunities to build and draw.

### Morning Time / Devotional

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Cassie: ...As for teaching four kids - you have to constantly adjust rhythms. Instead of a rigid schedule like public school, we have rough outlines. I'm more structured than some homeschool families because I feel it's good for kids to know what to expect, but I stay flexible.
> 
> We always start with morning time - a devotional where everyone's together. We set the stage for the day, discuss schedules, extracurriculars, or address any family issues. Then I work youngest to oldest.

## Episode 022 - How This Working Mom Ditched Homework & Transformed Her Kids' Education

### Montessori / Waldorf

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Keri Mae (03:34.217) ...My 10 year old and six year old both attend a Montessori charter school. So that's where we ended up. I love the Montessori method. It's near and to my heart as an early childhood educator, that and Waldorf. And so I searched high and low and I found this charter school. It's a public charter school. So it's free, right? Because as a single mom, there's financial constraints. And it's been phenomenal. They don't have bells actually. So it's like, it's a very gentle approach to education.
> 
> ...
> 
> Keri Mae (14:54.979) ...which is a very much like Montessori approach. It's like you create the space for them to learn, but then they choose for themselves where they're going to spend their time. And so I think it's helped that they are at a Montessori school because they already have that mentality for themselves that they are independent learners and that the adult is learning with them or is a resource to help them expand their learning, but they're responsible for their own learning.

### Simply Piano

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Keri Mae (14:54.979) ...And I don't have to do a whole lot on my end. I just provide the environment, which
> 
> Ela Richmond (15:35.954) Mm.
> 
> Keri Mae (15:35.954) ...which is a very much like Montessori approach. It's like you create the space for them to learn, but then they choose for themselves where they're going to spend their time. And so I think it's helped that they are at a Montessori school because they already have that mentality for themselves that they are independent learners and that the adult is learning with them or is a resource to help them expand their learning, but they're responsible for their own learning.
> 
> So when we're at home, it's like I provide things like music books and we use like Simply Piano, you know, as an online, you know, that's on a tablet that my son can pull up and he'll spend like two hours just sitting at the piano, like playing the Simply Piano stuff.

### 4D Learning Academy

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Keri Mae (12:30.551) ...And then he's enrolled in an academy. So it's called 4D Learning Academy and they do science, technology and math with him. So it's three hours.
> 
> Ela Richmond (12:08.01) That's cool.
> 
> Keri Mae (12:30.551) ...and he goes in with them and gets those subjects covered. So right now they're doing like earth sciences and space science, which has been pretty cool.

### Rosebud and Thorn

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Keri Mae (25:10.857) ...But also, like conversations with my kids. That's really important, right? We just have a dialogue every single day. We do like Rosebud and Thorn. So it's like, what was your favorite thing in the day?
> 
> What are you looking forward to tomorrow? So the rose is favorite, is tomorrow and thorn is what was your least favorite part of your day. And we just talk about those three things every day.

## Episode 023 - The Apogee Approach to Modern Education: A Former Teacher's Journey to Microschooling

### Apogee Utah

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Ela: You're a mom of two who recently opened Apogee in Utah this September. Before we discuss that, I'd love to hear your story – you were a public school teacher for 12 years.
> 
> ...
> 
> Peggy: At Apogee, we've spent our first eight weeks "unschooling" kids from traditional systems. We teach them autonomy – they don't need to ask permission for basic needs like using the restroom or getting water. They just need to be respectful.
> 
> We give them an hour for lunch and play. They can eat, play, come back to eat more – following their natural rhythms. We're teaching them to listen to their bodies while maintaining respectful behavior.
> 
> ### Daily Structure at Apogee [26:36]
> 
> The day begins with students working on their interests – some work on RC cars, others read or build with materials. We then do our "physiology first" workout outside. During our work cycle, we focus on individualized learning at appropriate levels.
> 
> After lunch and outdoor time, we do project-based learning with themes that integrate core academics. We end the day with character call-outs, gratitude, meditation, reading, and cleaning our space together.

### Socratic Discussions

**Full Transcript Section:**

> ### Socratic Discussions [36:49]
> 
> Peggy: We often use "would you rather" questions to help students develop confidence in expressing and defending their viewpoints. It's challenging for many to disagree with friends or stand firm in their opinions, but these skills are crucial for development.

> 
> Uh, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, North Carolina. Tennessee, Georgia, Louisiana, Colorado, New Mexico, and Hawaii.
> 
> **Isaac:** That is a very interesting mix in terms of like the political environments you're probably dealing with there.
> 
> **Derrell Bradford:** well, and we, we think that's a feature of the model, not a defect. Um, and, uh, and one of the things that we work, uh, really hard to do other than working across the aisle to, uh, uh, you know, implement solutions that are best for kids, Is, um, sharing ideas that we get, you know, in, in one state and, uh, uh, in another state.
> 
> And so, um, I've been here for a long time at this point. I used to run our New York campaign. I live in, uh, [00:02:00] New Jersey. So I know sort of a lot about, um, this region and I work on all kinds of school choice, um, A very strong charter school supporter. I've worked on, uh, tax credit scholarships and vouchers and, uh, and I'm, I'm very excited about the growth of ESAs and care a lot about open enrollment and a whole bunch of those, uh, those other things.

### The Cartel (Movie)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Derrell Bradford:** Yeah. You, you, uh, you're sort of two things you get on onto here that are super important and a friend of mine, he did a movie [00:07:00] back in, back in the way back called the cartel, um, which is like, you know, kind of peak, peak education fight in New Jersey. Uh, and, uh, he covered a charter school lottery at an extraordinary charter school here in the city of Newark called Northstar.
> 
> Um, and. It is devastating to watch, right? Because, um, everyone knows what, what is at stake. I mean, this is a school that, that already does exist. It has like an outrageous track record and the joy and the sadness, like it's really kind of, um, uh, painful.

### State of Educational Opportunity in America (Survey/Study)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> ## State of Educational Opportunity in America
> 
> **Isaac:** So I know you guys had a study that you put out recently. Um, I think it was the state of educational opportunity in America.
> 
> **Derrell Bradford:** Yep.
> 
> **Isaac:** I would love, like, give me a quick rundown of the study. And what do you think are some of the most intriguing findings?
> 
> **Derrell Bradford:** Yeah.
> 
> ## Introduction to the Project
> 
> **Derrell Bradford:** So, um, this thing was a nightmare to do and I'm pretty, I'm pretty pumped. It wasn't, it wasn't my direct project. Um, although my, my team did all the design and stuff with it. So, so we, um, you know, we're a multi issue organization and we kind of, we have like a vision. This basically like the five things we think a family, like a kid should be able to have.
> 
> Right. So, um, we had the education is right for you. That's our school choice. Pillar school finance pillar. We had a [00:23:00] tutoring and care for all things. We think tutoring is about a powerful lever, but that's also where the people are. And that certainly mental health is a real issue after the pandemic, right?
> 
> Um, we have an open and connected learning pillar because we think you should, we should reward learning no matter where it happens. Um, we have a pillar that we call a parent's right, right to know, which is about information and transparency. And then college and career. And so we were trying to figure out a way to define success under that umbrella.
> 
> That wasn't just that we lobbied successfully and passed a new policy.
> 
> ## Survey Methodology and Execution
> 
> **Derrell Bradford:** And we kicked around a bunch of stuff and we decided to do a survey instead. And so we surveyed 20, 000 American families.
> 
> **Isaac:** That's a big survey.
> 
> **Derrell Bradford:** It is. It is. It's huge. Um, I mean, like we went, sorry, it's awesome. Edge research. Actually, they did the phone calls and every and everything like that.
> 
> We didn't have the staff 50 [00:24:00] can call 20, 000 families. Um, and since the sample so large, you got all kinds of, uh, information about from all kinds of different demographics of families, like something you never see that the sample size was so large. And we basically mapped all of the questions. Against our little rubric.
> 
> And so we got kind of like school satisfaction, uh, out of school and tutoring, uh, information and engagement, uh, college and career readiness and kind of student wellness.
> 
> ## Key Findings from the Survey
> 
> **Derrell Bradford:** And so, uh, I would just say that, like, let me give you some of the top line, uh, uh, findings out of it. So, um, what we found is that sort of like, in a lot of respects is about, uh, the surveys about inequality.
> 
> Um, but our approach to this is that everybody should have what the people who are really balling out have, um, other people take the opposite approach. They're like, the people are really balling out. Those guys are getting too much. We need to [00:25:00] take something from that. We're not we're going the other way.
> 
> Right. So, um, so, uh, what we found is that, like, rich families and sort of, like, the best students, like a students or whatever, they are getting the most in school and the most out of school. Right? So they're going to museums, they're going on trips, they're volunteering, they're doing all these other things.
> 
> And in school, they're getting sort of the best thing they can get. And as you track income, you find that like, um, uh, kids with less Household incomes do less of those things. It's, it's pretty, um, sort of extraordinary. That's the first thing. The second thing is that there's unmet demand for all of it.
> 
> The gap between people who say, Hey, I'd really like that. And people who are getting it is huge at all income levels, right? So there's a, um, if you're in advocacy world, you might say there's a huge constituency. That is interested in these things that doesn't have them available. And so that's [00:26:00] the second thing.
> 
> Um, the third one is that this is not just a story about like, uh, high income people and low income people, middle income people are getting squeezed to death to. Because the financial pressures are are broadly felt, right? So they're, um, uh, you know, not just, uh, free and reduced lunch, whatever, but like, well up into what people would consider middle income families is still saying, I want these things and can't afford it.
> 
> So that's the other thing.
> 
> ## Parental Involvement and Satisfaction
> 
> **Derrell Bradford:** Uh, the fourth thing is that there are why there are large differences in school type by, uh, sorry, in school satisfaction by school type. And you could read that in another way. The more a parent is aware that they chose a school or the more they're invested in it, be it financially or sort of, uh, uh, uh, from a, like a vision mission standpoint, the higher their satisfaction is.
> 
> So that, uh, so that's one, um, [00:27:00] uh, transitions matter a great deal. So like one of the slides is about mental health. It's like super important. The. The drops in student mental health are precipitous in fourth grade and ninth grade. So if we're thinking about like the best way to, to, you know, help students or, or when to intervene, that might be, those might be the kind of best times to do it.
> 
> And then the, the last kind of big finding, and there are tons of other ones, like the survey is huge and you can download it, load it. Our state, we did it for all 50 states. You can get state breakout or the whole thing at 50can. org. We have this like, we have, we got graphs. Fancy, you know, drawings, what we call the beach ball, which you'll figure out when you get there.

## From Viral Ads to Revolutionary Education: A Conversation with Benton Crane

### Bro School / Junior Bros

**Full Transcript Section:**

> ## The Rise of "Bro School"
> 
> **Isaac:** Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm Isaac Morehouse, and today I'm joined by Benton Crane. Benton is the co-founder of VidAngel, former CEO of Harmon Brothers, executive producer of the Tuttle Twins TV series, and now working on Young Washington, coming soon from Angel Studios.
> 
> So, Benton, I'm going to jump right in—Matt Bowman mentioned something to me, and I have to ask: What is Bro School?
> 
> **Benton:** My teenagers—a 16-year-old daughter and a 14-year-old son—joined a group of other teenage boys this past school year. They basically dropped out of high school and started homeschooling together. They called themselves Bro School. One of the dads posted about it on LinkedIn, sharing everything the boys had done that year. I read the post to my daughter—she was 15 at the time—and she said, "I need to be a part of that. That sounds amazing."
> 
> So I texted Johnny to ask if it was open to others—could girls join Bro School? He didn't get back to me right away; apparently, he got bombarded with texts after that post. My daughter took matters into her own hands and filmed an application video, making her case for why Bro School needed her. I sent it to Johnny, he shared it with the bros, and she became the first girl to join Bro School. The video hit home.
> 
> Then my son and some of the younger brothers started Junior Bros. The kids would get together a few times a week, focusing on life skills and apprenticeships. Each kid handled their own academics, but together they did things like wilderness survival (with a hired coach), gourmet cooking (with a chef), and job shadowing entrepreneurs. It was a really neat alternative. I'm not sure if it'll continue, but it was a super fun year for my kids.

### Tuttle Twins TV series

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Now, as executive producer of both the hit Tuttle Twins TV series and the upcoming film "[Young Washington](https://angel.com/youngwashington)," Crane is applying those same disruption principles to entertainment and education.

### Young Washington (Movie)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> ## Young Washington: From Failure to Legend
> 
> **Isaac:** Here's my segue to your current movie. If you look at young people's knowledge and interest in history, nobody thinks it's in a great spot. If you approach it like an engineer, you might collect data and try to change curricula. But you're making a movie—you're telling a story. Stories just work better. I remember almost nothing from textbooks, but I remember the movies that moved me. Rather than fighting over curriculum, you're going over the top and telling a story people want to watch. Tell me about Young Washington.
> 
> **Benton:** Most people don't know this story. Before he was president or a general, 22-year-old George Washington was sent to the Ohio territory to tell the French to leave. The interaction went horribly wrong—he made massive mistakes and accidentally set off a global war: the French and Indian War. It was a career-destroying blunder. But then, in a character-defining moment, he led a retreat under fire, had horses shot out from under him, bullet holes in his coat, but survived and saved hundreds of lives. That's the beginning of the legendary Washington.
> 
> We're telling this story on the big screen with Angel Studios, releasing nationwide on July 4th, 2026—the 250th anniversary of the country. John Erwin is directing—he's an award-winner and a history buff. Not only is the movie going to be amazing, but we're doing something unique: opening ticket pre-sales a year in advance. That's normal for concerts, but not for movies. The reason is, July 4th is a competitive time—blockbusters everywhere. To get on as many screens as possible, we need to signal demand to the industry. If people buy tickets early, we can go toe-to-toe with the big studios and get this story out there.

### Angel Studios / Angel Guild

**Full Transcript Section:**

> ## The Future of Storytelling
> 
> **Isaac:** There's an absolute hunger for inspiring stories—about people doing good and the right thing. Entertainment has focused on anti-heroes and darkness, but real heroism matters. So, tickets go on presale July 4th, 2025?
> 
> **Benton:** Yes, and as a thank you, every ticket is an entry to win a vintage Ford F-250 truck. We're also giving away hats. It's not normal to buy a ticket early, but you're going to anyway—so why not now?

> 
> Here's how it works:
> 
> - Build a bridge entirely from food items (crackers, pasta, candy - get creative!)
> - Design it to span a 24-inch gap and support a die-cast car like a Hot Wheels
> - Test its strength by adding water bottles until it breaks
> - Film your creation and the testing process
> - Submit your video using hashtags #CreatorsCraftChallenge1 and #GingerbreadBridge
> 
> "I wanted to create something that anyone could do, regardless of age or access to tools," Jack explains. "Through this simple challenge, kids learn structural engineering principles through hands-on experimentation without a textbook in sight."

## How to Raise Kids Who Actually Care About Others

### The Gift of Charity Wrapped in a Korowai of Love (Book)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Ela Richmond:** First off, let's plug your book. What is it called?
> 
> **Kerry:** It's called *The Gift of Charity Wrapped in a Korowai of Love*, and it's by Kerry Owen and Lisa Norton.
> 
> **Ela Richmond:** I love it. Where can people find it?
> 
> **Kerry:** You can find it on Amazon, Cedar Fort Publishers, and Deseret Books.
>
> [...]
>
> **Kerry:** Well, I was just going to say the book, *The Gift of Charity*, is exactly touching on that point because I had this epiphany at the end of my journey with Feed the Need in New Zealand—my goodness, this wasn't just a gift for the receiver, this was also a gift for the giver. This has just been such a privilege, and I can get emotional about it. I always do because I realize that having all these interactions with all these different children and learning about different cultures and having all this love for the people we served has just enriched my life. I'll never forget them and I'll always be grateful for those experiences. So yeah, you're right.

### Reach Out Today (Charity)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Kerry:** I think if you just have that desire, that's enough. And as parents, we can help our children and give them opportunities. With my children, I include them in the charity work. Over here, I direct a charity called Reach Out Today. We've been here eight years. I'll take my kids along to events and things we're doing. For example, we do these pop-up hair salons. I'm not a hairdresser or hairstylist, but that was a request from one of the schools—could we do a pop-up hair salon with hairstylists and volunteers to give these children who need a little bit of TLC an opportunity to have their hair washed with shampoo and warm water and have a hairstylist give them attention they've never had before? I've brought my kids along to help—sweep up hair, give out hair care kits, assemble hair care kits. My daughter has assembled a lot of kits: food packs, hygiene packs, clothing packs, hair care kits.

### Feed the Need (Charity)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Kerry:** It was really that second dream that spurred me on. From then on, I set up this charity, Feed the Need, and ended up delivering food into schools. Back then, New Zealand didn't have a food system at school. Kids who didn't come with a packed lunch would just go hungry. There were other charities doing things like granola bars, muesli bars, some bread in the freezer at schools—emergency snacks. But I wanted to give them proper food, proper home-cooked food that would be nutritious. That's where it began. We did a pilot in a school.
> 
> We had a lot of mistakes and problems with food and cooking and delivery. But we learned a lot, and that was educational in a different way. Then we ended up doing two more schools, and each year it expanded until we ended up building a big commercial kitchen within the Salvation Army building.
>
> [...]
>
> **Kerry:** I think once you delve into the needs in your community, wherever you are, it's never ending. For example, in New Zealand, we were doing this food in schools, but then the communities would come asking, "Can you do something for our youth? We have youth that have been kicked out of school who are getting into crime."
> 
> So we ended up doing a youth engagement program where these kids that had been kicked out of school, we employed in the kitchens while we were making food for those children going without. It was amazing to see these youth who often themselves had gone hungry. It was incredible because they actually felt they were part of something. They were part of something big. They were solving something in their community.

### Salvation Army

**Full Transcript Section:**

> ## 15:43 Building Community Partnerships: The Salvation Army Connection
> 
> **Kerry:** That was a great partnership because they're all about helping those in need. We were able to cook and deliver from that building. In fact, they lent us their delivery van when ours broke down. It was just great having that community support with like-minded people.

### JustServe (Website/Service)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Kerry:** Yeah, I think you can go online. for example, JustServe, I don't know if you've heard of that, but people can go online and look for, okay, they can look for service opportunities on JustServe. And so I'll have people coming to my door and it can be whole families coming to donate. And so it could be like a kit for a child entering foster care or it could be Christmas gifts for a child in DCFS and so I love that some families do it together, some youth groups do it together and I love that communities are looking for ways to buy and serve and you know I'm sure that there's plenty other websites that you can go to to seek out ways that you can serve and involve your kids.

### DCFS / Utah Foster Care (Services)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Kerry:** Well, just one of the things that I was thinking is that when we moved here, I wanted to understand about children in foster care and like, you know, could we do something to help these children that are in foster care? And then, you know, talking to, you know, why is there homelessness? Like, what can we do to prevent homelessness? And so all these kind of questions were coming into my mind. So then I went to DCFS, you know, who deal with, you know, child protection and so on. And so, yeah, just asking people. Then I went to like Utah Foster Care and all those organizations that are out there doing that. you know, before I actually did anything of significance, it was asking those questions and just talking to them and trying to understand what the issues were.

### Hold On to Your Kids: Why Parents Need to Matter More Than Peers (Book)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> That rethinking led her to the work of Dr. Gordon Neufeld and Gabor Maté, and their seminal book, *Hold On to Your Kids: Why Parents Need to Matter More Than Peers*. It was here she found the intellectual framework for what she was feeling intuitively: the modern family structure was broken.
> 
> The book’s central thesis is a radical one: for the first time in human history, children are turning to their peers, not their parents, for guidance, identity, and connection. Neufeld and Maté call this “peer-orientation,” and argues it’s the root cause of everything from bullying and gang culture to the epidemic of teenage anxiety and depression.

### YouTube (Learning Resource)

It can incorporate anything that fits your child's needs, including public school, private school, and micro-schooling, as well as real-world experiences, self-directed learning, traditional homeschooling, and project-based learning. Matt wrote a whole book about it, so he wouldn't have to keep explaining himself when he gave parents what seemed like crazy advice.

Organizations like the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA.org) can help you understand your specific state's laws. And for families wanting to explore open education, OpenEd offers a free tuition program in eight states and growing that handles all the compliance and paperwork for you, so you're free to focus on what matters most—your child's learning.

## She Did Everything Right - Her Daughter Still Couldn't Read

### Everyday Reading (Blog/Instagram)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Janssen Bradshaw had every advantage a parent could want when it comes to raising readers.
> 
> She grew up in a home where her mom - an English major - read aloud every single day. Even in high school, they'd sit together with two copies of *Pride and Prejudice*, taking turns page by page. Janssen became an elementary school librarian. She started [Everyday Reading](https://everyday-reading.com/), a blog and [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/everydayreading) dedicated to books. Her house has somewhere between 2,000 and 5,000 books in it.

### Savvy Learning (Service/Platform)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> That experience - Janssen watching her daughter transform through consistent, personalized, short-burst instruction - eventually became [Savvy Learning](https://savvylearning.com/), the company she co-founded with her husband and another couple. They launched in fall 2020, hoping for 10 sign-ups. They got over 100.
>
> [...]
>
> **How to Help a Struggling Reader**
> 
> If you're seeing the signs - the resistance, the frustration, the bright kid who just isn't clicking with reading - here's where to start:
> 
> **Get a baseline.** Know where your child actually stands. [Savvy Learning](https://savvylearning.com/) offers a free 15-minute reading assessment that shows exactly where kids are and what they need. It's a starting point, not a sales pitch - you'll get actionable information either way.

### Orton-Gillingham (Method)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Structured literacy approach.** Systematic, explicit phonics instruction - often called Orton-Gillingham based methods - that builds skills sequentially rather than expecting kids to just "pick it up."

### Audiobooks (Resource)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> One more thing helped during those difficult years: audiobooks. Janssen's daughter still loved stories - she just couldn't decode them herself yet. Audiobooks kept her engaged with books, kept her vocabulary growing, kept her comprehension developing even while they worked on the mechanics.
> 
> "When she did start getting the reading help she needed, she could put those parts together pretty quickly," Janssen said. "Because she understood the fundamentals of how stories and words and vocabulary all work."

## Stop Limiting Your Child's Screen Time (Do This Instead)

### Outschool (Platform/Marketplace)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Isaac: Let's start with the Outschool elevator pitch for those who are not familiar.**
> 
> **Amir: **Absolutely. Outschool is a marketplace of live online classes for kids. Teachers teach the classes that they always wanted to teach, everything from core subjects to enrichment of all types, and offer classes to their design for kids aged 3 through 18. These classes take place in small groups or one-on-one over video chat.
> 
> You can access a learning group and a teacher from anywhere in the country or the world that exactly fits your child's needs. And that's the point. By offering tremendous variety of classes, both direct to parents, as well as through partnerships and institutions, we hope to offer unlimited customizability in education and true personalization.

### Minecraft (App/Game)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Isaac: I've got my own Outschool story with my son. He's almost eight and loves Minecraft. I'm not technical at all, unlike you—I'm not a coder. So he plays Minecraft, and we have limits around screen time, with a continuum from consuming content to creating. The more creative, the less worried I am about screen time. He said, "I want to learn how to make mods," and I was immediately stressed because I don't know how to do that but wanted to say yes to him. After trying some options that didn't work well, we found an Outschool class—every Friday for six weeks with a great instructor. Now he can make custom blocks, and he knows more than I do about this.**
> 
> **Amir:** That's so funny. I had exactly the same experience. I can program, but I still can't learn Minecraft. It's very complicated unless you invest significant time. I don't know how much money I spent on a Minecraft tutor of all things. He had one-on-one tutoring sessions to learn some specific things. And now he's in a group class.

## The 200-Year-Old Trap: Breaking Down Part One of "Open Education"

### Open Education: How to Reimagine Learning, Ignite Curiosity, and Prepare Your Kids for Success (Book)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Isaac Morehouse:** Yeah, this is amazing. We just launched the brand new book, "Open Education: How to Reimagine Learning, Ignite Curiosity and Prepare Your Kids for Success." Really, this is Matt's book and I just sort of sneak a few things in there and slap my name on the front. This comes from Matt's years, decades even, of experience and passion in the education space.

### Praxis (Program)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Isaac:** That's one side of open education that doesn't get enough attention. Not only is this better for learners, but teachers have a much better experience too. When you're there with someone who's engaged with you, that's amazing.
> 
> When did you first come across the concept of competency-based education or "mastered and not yet"? Did you stumble on it yourself or find it through books and thinkers in education?
> 
> **Matt:** It goes back to my teacher preparation program. When I first started teaching in the 90s, I'd been trained to build rubrics — this idea of transparency where you have a clear rubric showing exactly what your project will be judged on. Project-based learning was big then.
>
> [...]
>
> **Isaac:** It's funny, when I first created the Praxis program, I stumbled upon this concept because I was trying to combine theory and practice. When it came to demonstrating competency, I had people create projects or do oral exams with a simple "you mastered it or you didn't." If you weren't there, you could do it again as many times as you wanted.

### Southern New Hampshire University (Competency-Based Program)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Matt:** I implemented project-based rubric assessments in 1994 when I first started teaching. It's interesting to see how that's entered mainstream education vernacular, with Southern New Hampshire University doing a whole college degree program that's interdisciplinary, project-based, and competency-based.

## EPISODE 1: The Genius We Engineer Away

### Thiel Fellowship

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Gibson previously served as Vice President of Grants at the Thiel Foundation, where he helped run the [Thiel Fellowship](https://thielfellowship.org/)—Peter Thiel's radical program that pays brilliant young people $200,000 to drop out of college and build something instead.
> 
> The Thiel Fellowship has a better track record than Y Combinator at finding founders of so-called "unicorn" companies—those rare billion-dollar startups that venture capitalists spend their careers hunting for (and sometimes never once finding).
> 
> Consider Dylan Field, the Thiel Fellow who dropped out of Brown University to build Figma. [The design software company recently went public in a deal that valued it at over $20 billion](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/figma-ceo-now-worth-5-151742597.html). Field was 19 when he started the company. If he had stayed in school, graduated, maybe gotten an MBA, he would have been 26 or 27 before he even started building. In technology, those years matter. They might have been the difference between creating the next generation of design tools and arriving too late to a market already dominated by others.

### 1517 Fund

**Full Transcript Section:**

> The man who [shared that story](https://www.instagram.com/p/DOd-ZaEERUB/) on our podcast was [Michael Gibson](https://x.com/william_blake?lang=en)—an Oxford grad school dropout and self-described "academic apostate" who has built a venture capital firm ([the 1517 Fund](https://www.1517fund.com/)) around a very specific, very contrarian bet. 
> 
> [...]
> 
> Now Gibson continues that contrarian mission through his venture capital firm, [the 1517 Fund](https://www.1517fund.com/), providing grants and investments to young, brilliant minds who have chosen to build things outside of traditional university structures.
> 
> Through 1517, Gibson is betting on the same philosophy that made the Thiel Fellowship so successful: that genius flourishes best in the wild, outside the very institutions we've built to certify it. In other words, Michael doesn't just tell the story of George Dantzig; his fund actively searches for the next one. He is betting his career on the idea that genius flourishes best in the wild, outside the very institutions we've built to certify it.
> 
> [...]
> 
> Here's what I've learned from watching Michael's work at 1517: Our job as parents and educators is to give our kids the tools to navigate the wilderness, not to pave the road for them.

## EPISODE 2: The Hollywood Veterans Teaching Kids to Break Into Film

### Sneak on the Lot / Sneak On

**Full Transcript Section:**

> That realization led to [Sneak on the Lot](https://sneakonthelot.com/) in 2000. Today, Fletcher and his business partner Chet Thomas run an educational program that has evolved from teaching filmmaking basics into a genuine Hollywood pipeline—complete with a virtual 3D backlot where students audition for real productions.
> 
> [...]
> 
> "All we knew how to do was make movies," Fletcher admits, reflecting on those early days of Sneak on the Lot. "Which on the surface might seem pathetic—'You're just entertainers.' But when you realize what it takes to make a movie, you can employ every single classroom of a high school."
> 
> This became Sneak on the Lot's core philosophy: filmmaking isn't just for film students.
> 
> "It takes the creative kind who maybe aren't accepted by others as much in high school," Thomas explains. "It takes the analytical person who's great at math—we'll slide you right in as a line producer. There's a place for that super social person on the marketing team."
> 
> [...]
> 
> Fletcher and Thomas always envisioned a digital space that would teach students how Hollywood works simply by navigating it. Twenty years after starting with basic web tools, they've built "Sneak On" using [Unity](https://unity.com/)—a 3D virtual backlot where students create avatars, walk around studio lots, and learn from virtual mentors.
> 
> "You can upload your movie, watch others' movies, and hear about opportunities," Fletcher describes. Students post marketing posters and—crucially—audition for real productions.
> 
> "For people in Hollywood, it's strange," Thomas admits. "'What? It's a game? I have to upload my audition in this environment with avatars?' We say, 'Trust us. We might be ahead of our time, but that's okay. We've always been ahead of our time.'"
> 
> [...]
> 
> While the virtual backlot is still in beta, the casting potential is real. They cast their production *Mystic Hollow* through the platform and plan to source all talent for their upcoming slate—six or seven television series at Angel Studios—the same way.

> "We've got our eye on a couple of students who've proven themselves," Fletcher says. "That's what Sneak On is built to do—filter out and find the best of the best."

## EPISODE 3: The Lost Art of Play

### SKOLA

**Full Transcript Section:**

> But three years later, that Post-it note would become the founding document of [SKOLA](https://skolamicroschool.com/): a microschool where children spend three hours outside every day, where there are no letter grades (even in middle school), and where boredom is celebrated as the gateway to discovery.
> 
> [...]
> 
> After opening SKOLA with their three guiding principles—more time outside, meeting students where they are, and building genuine community—Kristin and Ginger had to figure out what "more time outside" actually meant in practice.
> 
> [...]
> 
> For children who transfer from traditional schools to places like SKOLA or Prenda's microschools, there's a process Kristin calls "the undoing."

### Prenda

**Full Transcript Section:**

> On January 3, 2018, Smith sat at his kitchen table with his son and six neighborhood children, launching what would become [Prenda](https://www.prenda.com/), now the largest network of microschools in the country.
> 
> The results speak for themselves. According to [New Hampshire Department of Education data on Prenda microschools](https://www.americafirstpolicy.com/issues/state-policy-actions-to-support-microschools-another-option-for-families), 54% of struggling students showed at least one full grade level of growth in English language arts, and 62% showed similar growth in mathematics.
> 
> What makes Prenda's approach work? The same principle Kristin and Ginger discovered: when you give children real freedom and autonomy, when you trust them with unstructured time, they become more focused and productive during structured learning. Play doesn't steal time from learning; it creates the conditions that make deep learning possible.

## EPISODE 4: The School-to-Prescription Pipeline: Ben Somers on How We Medicate Kids Who Don't Fit the Mold

### Recess

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Today, Ben is building the alternative. His platform, [Recess](http://recess.gg/), lets kids choose their own classes, meet friends who share their interests, and learn in an environment that adapts to them—not the other way around. It's what he wishes had existed when he was that 11-year-old who just needed to move.
> 
> [...]
> 
> Ben's platform, Recess, is built around the two insights that shaped his journey: kids need friends, and kids need choice.
> 
> Kids browse a marketplace of classes taught by YouTubers and professionals. When they find something that excites them—how to build a trapdoor in Minecraft, how to write a short film—they request it from their parent. The parent can approve or deny. If approved, the kid joins the class with other kids who chose to be there.
> 
> After class, Recess suggests those kids as friends. They get a Discord-style chat to stay connected, see what classes their friends are taking, and organize to learn together.
> 
> Things trend on the platform the way they trend in real life—one kid gets into engineering, their friend joins, another friend joins, and suddenly you've got a wave of motivation spreading through actual friendships. Not because anyone was forced or medicated into compliance. Because they genuinely wanted to.
> 
> It's the opposite of the system that medicated Ben at age 11.

### Synthesis School

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Ben dropped out of high school, eventually worked his way into education technology, and spent several years at Synthesis School—the school originally built for SpaceX employees' kids. These days, he runs a platform called Recess that's trying to solve the problems he experienced firsthand.
> 
> [...]
> 
> At Synthesis School, they spent roughly $10 million a year on educational content. They hired the best game designers. They built complex team simulation games. They iterated constantly based on data.

## EPISODE 6: What Happens When a Teacher Tells Teens to Stop Going to School

### The Teenage Liberation Handbook

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Ken was six years into teaching eighth-grade U.S. history when a fellow teacher, Joshua Hornick, pushed a copy of *The Teenage Liberation Handbook* into his hands. He ignored it—until the day he couldn’t. One particularly infuriating afternoon in 1995, Ken opened the book, expecting fringe theory. Instead, he found case studies of teens who had left school, learned on their own terms, and turned out fine. Better than fine. They learned what interested them, went deep, and built adult lives without the anxiety spiral of GPA culture.

### North Star

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Ken and Joshua resigned, rented a small space in western Massachusetts, and founded North Star, a community center for unschooling teens. It's not a school—Ken is emphatic about this. It's a hub where teens could write a legal homeschooling plan, connect with other students and mentors, and rebuild a life outside of compulsory classrooms.
> 
> ## North Star’s Homeschool Community Model
> 
> North Star has a physical building with couches, classrooms, a kitchen, and a front desk that greets about 60 teens on any given week. Families file their homeschool paperwork with the state (North Star walks them through it), then use the center like a gym or coworking space. The structure is light but intentional:
> 
> - Drop-in hours Monday through Thursday
> - A weekly advisory meeting with one of nine staff members
> - A menu of classes, tutorials, clubs, and field trips
> - Optional community-college courses, apprenticeships, or jobs woven into the week

> 
> [...]
> 
> One of the coolest things with my daughter over the last six months since we opened Lily Lake is that we also have a toddler play cafe in a second building, and she has learned how to basically run the cafe herself.

## EPISODE 9: What to Do When Your Students Don't Respect You (Michelle Rhee's Story)

### Waiting for Superman (Documentary)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Featured prominently in the groundbreaking documentary ["Waiting for Superman"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_for_%22Superman%22), Rhee became the face of education reform by challenging the status quo and proving that dramatic improvement is possible even in the most challenging environments.

### Looping (Method)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> ### 3. The Looping Advantage
> 
> Perhaps most importantly, Rhee and her partner decided to "loop" with their students—teaching the same group for multiple years. "That second year, that's when we saw massive acceleration. We didn't have to spend the first month of school learning each other."
> 
> For homeschoolers, this is a natural advantage. You're already positioned to provide the continuity that research shows is crucial for academic success. As Rhee notes: "People who have done it, both on the family side and on the teacher side, they swear by it."

## EPISODE 10: What's behind the annual spike in youth anxiety & depression

### Free to Learn (Book)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Dr. Peter Gray has been watching this pattern for decades. He's a biopsychologist and the author of [*Free to Learn*](https://a.co/d/hR3YGmG), published in 2013—a book that became foundational for parents questioning how we educate children.

> [...]
> 
> **Dr. Peter Gray** is a biopsychologist and author of [*Free to Learn*](https://a.co/d/hR3YGmG)*: Why Unleashing the Instinct to Play Will Make Our Children Happier, More Self-Reliant, and Better Students for Life* (Free Press, 2013).

### Sudbury Valley School

**Full Transcript Section:**

> It's interesting to me also in this regard that I've been very long involved with a radically alternative school called the Sudbury Valley School, where children are not watched. They're free to roam around the campus and in the woods as part of the campus without adults following them. The youngest children they will accept is four because they don't believe three-year-olds generally are capable of managing themselves, but four-year-olds are.
> 
> [...]
> 
> **Peter Gray:** I did a study of the graduates and there were some of the graduates who had never been to a typical school. They had never taken what we would call a school course. They had never taken an exam until maybe they took the SAT exam, which they prepared for. Then they went on to college, they got into college, and they did well in college.

### The Gardener and the Carpenter (Book)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Peter Gray:** One book that I kind of regularly suggest to parents is Alison Gopnik's book *The Gardener and the Carpenter*. Do you know that book? Alison Gopnik is a leading developmental psychologist who studies the cognitive abilities of little children and publishes these amazing—children are so much more logical than we think they are and able to solve problems and so on and so forth.
> 
> But she wrote this book that is really aimed at parents called *The Gardener and the Carpenter*. She talks about sort of two different approaches to being a parent. The carpenter approach is the approach that you're sort of sculpting your child, you're creating, you're building your child. Your child is your product, just like if you were a carpenter making a table or a chair, that would be your product. She argues that this is the wrong way to think about being a parent.

### How to Raise an Adult (Book)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> **Peter Gray:** There's another book—I'm having difficulty right at this moment thinking of the name of the author. The title is something like *How to Raise an Adult*. Do you know this book?
> 
> **Ela Richmond:** I think so. It's by a woman—
> 
> **Peter Gray:** It is by a woman who was formerly the dean of freshmen at Stanford University.
> 
> **Ela Richmond:** It's Julie Lythcott-Haims.
> 
> **Peter Gray:** That's exactly who it is. That's right. There you go.
> 
> She's talking about her experience as the dean of freshmen. Stanford is of course one of the elite colleges, and parents would love to get their kids into. Her experience as dean of freshmen is that so many kids were suffering and so many kids were not prepared for college. Not because they weren't academically prepared, but they weren't emotionally and developmentally prepared.

### Common Core (Curriculum Standard)

**Full Transcript Section:**

> While the US implemented Common Core—limiting teacher flexibility, increasing standardized testing, and ramping up academic pressure—European educational systems maintained more balanced approaches.
> 
> [...]
> 
> **Peter Gray:** I said before that there are some countries that, like the United States, also showed an increase in anxiety, depression, and suicide. One of them being the UK. They are countries which, like the United States, underwent a major so-called reform in education. In our country, it was Common Core, which initiated a so-called common curriculum that limited what teachers could do in the classroom by way of accommodating to children's real needs. There's no question that school became far more anxiety-provoking as a result of Common Core than it had been before. It was already anxiety-provoking, but it became more anxiety-provoking after Common Core.
> 
> I'm convinced that it's the initiation of Common Core that led to that spike of anxiety, depression, suicide that began around 2010. That's when Common Core began. It was in full effect in most states, either Common Core or similar thing, by 2013. Over that period of time, school became more stressful.

## Why Students Quit Online School—Until This Stanford Pioneer Made One Radical Change

### Stanford Online High School

**Full Transcript Section:**

> But here's the twist: After 30 years pioneering online education—from those expensive CD-ROMs to founding Stanford Online High School—Ravaglia has concluded that technology was never the point. In fact, technology might be the least important part of online education. It's a conclusion he's explores in his book "Bricks and Mortar: The Making of a Real Education at the Stanford Online High School" and his Forbes education columns, where he regularly challenges Silicon Valley's assumptions about learning.
> 
> [...]
> 
> In 2005, Ravaglia made a decision that seemed to go against everything Silicon Valley believed about education technology. When he founded Stanford Online High School, he made it synchronous. Students would have to show up at specific times. Teachers would have to teach live. Classes would meet together via video conference, even if students were scattered across the globe.
> 
> [...]
> 
> Ravaglia's first students at Stanford Online High School weren't choosing between online and traditional school. They had no good options at all.
> 
> [...]
> 
> "They weren't comparing Stanford Online High School to Phillips Exeter. They were comparing it to nothing."

## Why a Public School Principal Told Me to Homeschool My Kids

### OpenEd

**Full Transcript Section:**

> They joined local co-ops, stacked library cards, and slid toward full-time homeschooling. To be precise, they slid toward unschooling. “If it looked anything like school, we threw it out,” Dave said. “Schooling and education are different things.” They stopped worrying about grade-level benchmarks and started chasing curiosity. The kids picked their own homeschool curriculum piecemeal: a welding class at the district’s ALC here, a debate league there, water polo with the local high school, mock trial sponsored by OpenEd.

### BYU Independent Study

**Full Transcript Section:**

> Dave’s day job now is at BYU Independent Study, where he helps families stitch together custom learning plans without surrendering structure. The program has 215 middle and high school courses — everything from STEM to nine different language tracks to niche PE like cycling. But the secret sauce is a design framework he calls KSA: Knowledge, Skills, Attributes. “In biology, for example, they still learn the standards, but they also practice critical thinking and explore resilience,” he explained. Students can even earn micro-credentials for going deeper, a digital badge they can attach to scholarship apps or resumes. It’s the opposite of conveyor-belt schooling. It’s an à la carte menu for families who want academic rigor without losing flexibility.
