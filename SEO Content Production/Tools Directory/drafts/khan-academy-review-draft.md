"Review of Khan Academy for homeschooling. See pricing, key features, who it's best for, pros and cons, and parent feedback."

*By Isaac Morehouse*

My oldest son is not a math guy. He's analytical, philosophical, artistic—but numbers? Not his thing. For years, we tried everything: structure, fights, cajoling. Nothing worked. Eventually, we threw up our hands and let it go.

Then, at 13, he wanted to attend a two-day-a-week school with his friends. There was just one problem: he'd need to know algebra to be in their math class.

His response? "I'll just start at the beginning."

That summer, he opened Khan Academy, clicked on kindergarten math, and worked his way through—every level, every concept—until he caught up to algebra. It took him about two months. By himself. No nagging, no fights, no tears.

That's when I realized: Khan Academy isn't magic. But when a kid has a reason to learn, it's one of the best tools you can hand them.

## **Quick Verdict**

Khan Academy is the Swiss Army knife of free education. It won't replace everything, but it fills gaps better than almost anything else out there—especially for self-motivated learners who can work at their own pace.

**The highlights:**

- **100% free.** No ads, no paywalls, no subscriptions for core content
- **Massive scope.** Math from counting to calculus, plus science, history, test prep, and more
- **Self-paced mastery.** Kids move forward when they actually understand, not when the calendar says so
- **Real progress tracking.** Parent dashboard shows exactly where they are and how long they're spending
- **Works as supplement or catch-up.** Perfect for filling holes in a primary curriculum

## **Who It's Best For**

**Age/Grade:** Pre-K through adult (Khan Academy Kids for ages 2-8, main platform for K-12+)

**Learning style:** Visual learners who can absorb information from video. Self-directed kids who don't need constant hand-holding.

**Teaching time:** Low. Once set up, most kids can navigate independently. You're monitoring, not teaching.

**Budget:** Can't beat free. If you're homeschooling on a tight budget, this should be in your toolkit.

**Best fit:**

- Behind-grade kids who need to catch up fast
- Gifted kids who want to push ahead
- Families supplementing a primary curriculum
- Parents who need a backup plan for "those days"
- Kids prepping for SAT, AP, or other standardized tests

**Not ideal for:**

- Kids who need lots of hands-on manipulation
- Students who require extensive repetition (limited practice problems in some areas)
- Families wanting a complete, all-in-one curriculum with lesson plans
- Kids who struggle with screen-based learning

## **What It Covers and How It Works**

**Core subjects:**

- Math (early math through calculus and statistics)
- Science (biology, chemistry, physics)
- English Language Arts (grammar, reading comprehension)
- Social Studies (history, civics)

**Test prep:** SAT, LSAT, AP exams

**Special features:**

- Khan Academy Kids (ages 2-8): early literacy, basic math, social-emotional learning
- Khanmigo AI tutor: interactive assistance across subjects ($4/month or $44/year)

**How it works:**

Students watch short video lessons with whiteboard-style explanations, then complete practice exercises with instant feedback. The system tracks mastery—you can't just click through. You have to demonstrate understanding before moving on.

The parent dashboard shows time spent, topics completed, and areas where kids are struggling. You can assign specific content or let them explore freely.

## **What Parents Say**

Khan Academy has earned a devoted following among homeschool families—not as a complete curriculum, but as the go-to supplement when explanations aren't clicking.

"We use Saxon as our primary math curriculum, and use Khan Academy as a supplement when the explanations in the text and from me just aren't cutting it." — Homeschool parent on Reddit

"I used it to completely relearn math... I went from having a terrible, almost nonexistent math education to being pretty darn good at math." — Homeschool parent on Reddit

For younger kids, Khan Academy Kids gets particularly strong reviews:

"Our preschooler willingly selects Khan Academy when we give him screen time. He actually stays engaged for long periods of time and has fun doing it." — App Store review

The main criticism? It's not comprehensive enough to be your only resource:

"In second grade math, it only has 4 units and maybe 15 minutes worth of problems in each. This means all of second grade math can be covered within an hour or two... I don't really think it should be relied upon as a core curriculum." — Reddit user

## **Top Alternatives to Khan Academy**

- **IXL** — More practice problems, but subscription-based (~$10-20/month)
- **Math-U-See** — Hands-on manipulatives with video instruction
- **Teaching Textbooks** — Self-grading with more structure
- **CTC Math** — Similar video format, Australian curriculum
- **Prodigy Math** — More gamified, less comprehensive

## **FAQs**

**Is Khan Academy enough for homeschool math?** For some kids, yes—especially motivated self-learners. Most families use it as a supplement to a primary curriculum.

**What ages is Khan Academy for?** Khan Academy Kids covers ages 2-8. The main platform works for elementary through adult learners.

**Is Khan Academy religious or secular?** Secular. No religious content.

**How long does Khan Academy take per day?** Varies by student. Most families report 15-45 minutes per subject.

**Can Khan Academy replace a tutor?** For video explanations, often yes. The new Khanmigo AI adds interactive tutoring for $4/month.

**Does Khan Academy give grades or transcripts?** It tracks mastery and completion, but doesn't issue formal grades or transcripts. Parents would need to create those separately.
