The cost can vary widely depending on how it\u2019s obtained (school license vs. homeschool subscription), but it generally follows a <strong id=\"\">subscription or per-student license model</strong>.<br><br><strong id=\"\">School/District Licenses:</strong> Schools typically purchase Edmentum through contracts or consortium pricing. This often involves a <strong id=\"\">per-student or per-seat license fee</strong> for a given period (semester or year). Prices are usually negotiated (\u201cGet a Quote\u201d model). For reference, some public data shows prices on the order of a few hundred dollars per student per year for large implementations.<br><br><strong id=\"\">Homeschool/Individual Subscriptions:</strong> Individual families cannot buy directly from Edmentum Inc., but several authorized resellers and academies offer <strong id=\"\">homeschool packages</strong> that give a student access to the Courseware curriculum. These are usually priced per student for a set duration. For example, Funcation Academy charges about <strong id=\"\">$425 per year (or $40 per month)</strong> for a 6th\u201312th grade membership that grants access to Edmentum Courseware\u2019s full catalog.<br><br><strong id=\"\">Single-Course Purchase:</strong> Some providers allow enrolling in just one course (useful if a student only needs, say, an AP Chemistry class). A single-yearlong course via Edmentum Courseware might cost roughly <strong id=\"\">$300\u2013$350</strong> through a reseller.<br><br><strong id=\"\">Additional Services:</strong> Edmentum also has a fully accredited virtual school option called <strong id=\"\">EdOptions Academy</strong>, where students can take Courseware classes with Edmentum-provided teachers and grading. This is a different product, usually priced higher because certified teacher support is included. Those costs can be several hundred dollars per course (often akin to private online school tuition).<br><br><strong id=\"\">Free Trial:</strong> Some homeschool vendors offer a short free trial (Funcation Academy offers 10 days free). This lets families try the platform before committing. But after the trial, payment is required; there is no long-term free usage of Edmentum Courseware.<br><br><strong id=\"\">Budget Consideration:</strong> Edmentum is in the mid-to-high range for homeschool curricula. A few hundred dollars a year is a significant cost, but note this typically covers all subjects for that student. Compared to hiring a private online school or buying full curriculum kits for each subject, an Edmentum subscription can be cost-competitive. Some providers offer <strong id=\"\">payment plans</strong> to break up the fee into monthly installments (often with a small service charge). Discounts may be available (e.g., multi-student family discounts or military discounts).</p>",
