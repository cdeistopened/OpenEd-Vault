# Tools Directory Project

**Goal:** Parent-reviewed curriculum/tool database as an SEO play with real voices.

**Q3 Target:** Launch with 20+ initial tool reviews

---

## Strategic Intent

Most curriculum review sites are:
- Generic aggregations of other review sites
- Written by nobody (or ChatGPT)
- No real perspective or experience

Ours will be:
- Written by named parents (their byline, their perspective)
- Based on actual interviews (Ella's pipeline)
- Real opinions, not hedged everything-is-great reviews
- SEO-optimized but authentically human

---

## Key Decision: Author Model

**Option A: One author per tool (SELECTED)**
- Each review has a named parent author
- Their byline, their portfolio piece
- Better for SEO (real author, E-E-A-T signals)
- Better for community (parents become contributors)

**Option B: Multiple reviews per tool** (future phase)
- User-generated reviews
- Rating aggregation
- Requires account system
- Save for v2

---

## The Ella Interview Pipeline

Ella does interview-style meetings (not podcasts) to gather source material.

**Per interview yield:** ~5 tool reviews

### Interview Template (send to Ella)

**Opening:**
- How long have you been homeschooling?
- How many kids, what ages/grades?
- What's your general approach? (Classical, Charlotte Mason, eclectic, etc.)

**For each curriculum/tool:**
1. What is it? (Name, subject, grade level)
2. How long have you used it?
3. What made you try it?
4. What do your kids think of it?
5. What works well?
6. What doesn't work or who is it NOT for?
7. How does it fit into your daily/weekly routine?
8. Would you recommend it? To whom specifically?
9. Anything you wish you'd known before starting?

**Closing:**
- What's the one tool you couldn't homeschool without?
- Any tools you tried and abandoned? Why?
- What's on your wishlist to try next?
