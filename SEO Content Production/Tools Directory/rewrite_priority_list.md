## Workflow for Rewrites

Based on PROJECT.md guidelines:

1. **Pull existing CMS content** from Webflow
2. **Extract podcast transcript sections** from audit file
3. **Identify potential author** (guest who discussed it, or Ella to interview)
4. **Draft review** following the template:
   - Bottom Line
   - What We Loved
   - What Didn't Work
   - Who This Is For / Who Should Skip
   - Daily/Weekly Implementation
   - Verdict

5. **Send to author** via Google Docs for approval/expansion
6. **Publish** to Webflow with byline
