## The Questions

1. **Family snapshot:** Kids' ages, years homeschooling, your overall approach (classical, Charlotte Mason, eclectic, etc.)
2. **Walk me through a typical day** - what time do you start, what does the rhythm look like?
3. **What's the most "controversial" thing about how you homeschool?** (Late starts, lots of screens, no grades, etc.)
4. **Name 3-5 curricula or tools you actually use and love.** For each one: what ages, what do your kids think, what specifically works?
5. **What have you tried and quit?** What didn't work and why?
6. **For your favorites:** What do you NOT like about them? Who is it NOT for?
7. **The one tool you couldn't homeschool without?**
8. **Your "village"** - co-ops, tutors, classes, anything that's not just you teaching?
9. **A time you threw out the plan** - what happened and what did you learn instead?
10. **Anything you wish you'd known when you started?**

## What We Need (Remind Them)

- **Be opinionated** - we don't need what's on the website, we need YOUR take
- **Specific ages and details** - "my 7-year-old hated the videos but my 10-year-old loved them"
- **Honest downsides** - every curriculum has them, and readers trust honesty
- **Real stories** - the bathroom remodel that became a math lesson, the meltdown that made you switch
