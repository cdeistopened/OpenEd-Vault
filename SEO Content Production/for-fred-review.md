# SEO Content Drafts for Fred's Review

Hey Fred - 

We're working on scaling SEO content production across two categories. Before we go further, want your input on structure, headers, and optimization.

## What's Here

**1. State Page:** Oregon "Homeschool Programs" guide
**2. Versus Page:** IXL vs Exact Path comparison

Both drafts pull real quotes from our Slack (teacher recommendations, parent feedback). The goal is content that couldn't exist on any generic homeschool blog—it's grounded in actual OpenEd experience.

---

## Questions for You

1. **Header structure** — Are we optimizing for the right things? H1/H2/H3 hierarchy?
2. **Title tags** — What would you recommend for these?
3. **Featured snippets** — Any structural changes to capture comparison tables or FAQ snippets?
4. **Internal linking** — What should we link to/from?
5. **Anything we're missing?**

## Draft 1: Oregon State Page

**Target keyword:** "homeschool programs in Oregon" / "how to homeschool in Oregon"
**Current SERP position:** opened.co/oregon ranks ~#2-3

**File:** `State Pages/Oregon/draft-v1.md`

### Structure:
- Quick facts table
- How to start (traditional vs flexible program)
- Programs comparison table (OpenEd, Fossil DLP, Connections Academy, etc.)
- Oregon laws
- Curriculum recommendations (with teacher quotes)
- Local resources (Options for Education featured)
- Parent testimonials (Brettani Shannon, Charlynn Chambers, Amanda Schenkenberger)
- FAQ

### Open questions:
- Should we add more FAQ questions based on People Also Ask?
- Is the programs comparison table structured for snippets?
- How do we position against Fossil DLP (very similar offering)?

---

## Draft 2: IXL vs Exact Path

**Target keyword:** "IXL vs Exact Path"
**Estimated volume:** Medium (parents actively confused about difference)

**File:** `Versus/ixl-vs-exact-path/draft-v2.md`

### Structure:
- Lead with teacher quotes
- Quick comparison table
- "When to Use" sections (quotes woven in)
- "Why Not Both?" workflow
- Pros/cons table
- OpenEd advantage (both free in marketplace)

### Open questions:
- Title tag recommendations?
- Is this structure snippet-friendly?
- Should we add schema markup for comparison?

---

## Next Steps

Once you give feedback, we'll:
1. Apply your recommendations to both drafts
2. Scale the template to 3 more versus pages (Saxon vs Math-U-See, Khan vs IXL)
3. Scale the state page template to Utah, Nevada, Indiana

Let me know what you think!
