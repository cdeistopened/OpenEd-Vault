# Guest Contributor Pipeline (Nearbound Strategy)

**Goal:** Leverage trusted voices in homeschool/open education space to publish on OpenEd, driving traffic and subscribers through their existing audiences.

**Q3 Target:** 20 pitches → 5+ published pieces

---

## Why Nearbound Works

Nearbound leads yield 41% better win rates and 43% larger deals. When trusted voices point to OpenEd, we get warmer subscribers who stick around.

The flywheel:
1. Contributor publishes on OpenEd (their byline, big plug for their platform)
2. They share with their audience → traffic + subscribers
3. We build relationship → future collaborations, podcast guests
4. Social proof → "We've worked with Lenore Skenazy, Claire Honeycutt..."
5. Next pitch is easier

## The Process

### 1. Identify Target (Rolodex Mining)
Prioritize by:
- Audience size (bigger = more leverage)
- Alignment with OpenEd values
- Existing relationship warmth
- Content overlap (do they have stuff we can adapt?)

### 2. Draft First (The Charlie Ghostwriter Method)
Don't ask them to write. Instead:
- Review their existing content (podcasts, newsletters, blog posts)
- Identify 1-2 concepts that fit OpenEd audience
- Write 80% complete draft using their voice
- Pitch: "Here's something based on your [X]. If you like the direction, minimal work to finish."

### 3. Pitch
Template in `Outreach Templates/Initial_Pitch.md`

Key elements:
- Reference specific work of theirs
- Explain the concept we drafted
- Emphasize minimal work required
- Big plug for their platform/service
- Social proof if we have it

### 4. Collaborate
- Share draft via Google Doc or direct file
- One round of feedback max
- Handle all formatting, images, internal links
- They just approve or add voice touches

### 5. Publish + Amplify
- Publish on OpenEd blog
- Create social assets (LinkedIn posts, Twitter thread)
- Notify contributor for sharing
- Track traffic from their promotion
