Hey Robin,

I've been following what you're doing at Surge Academy - the Homeschool Tech Creators Program looks like exactly what a lot of our OpenEd families are searching for. (Plus, it's nice to work with someone local in Utah!)

I wanted to reach out about a guest contributor opportunity. We're seeing a lot of interest from homeschool parents asking questions like:

- "How do I teach coding to my kid if I don't know how to code?"
- "Is game design a 'real' subject or just play?"
- "At what age should kids start learning programming?"

You're in the trenches answering these questions every week. Would you be interested in writing a guest article for OpenEd on one of these topics?

Here's how it works: You share your expertise (bullet points, a voice memo, or a quick call), and I'll ghostwrite the full piece. You get the byline and final approval before we publish. It's exposure for Surge Academy to our audience of homeschool families, and we get expert content our readers actually need.

A few angles that could work well:

1. **"How to Teach Coding to Your Homeschooler (Even If You're Not Technical)"** - Practical starting points for non-techy parents
2. **"Why Every Kid Should Learn Game Design"** - The case for game dev as serious education
3. **"From Scratch to Python: A Coding Pathway for Homeschoolers"** - How to progress from beginner to intermediate

What sounds interesting to you? Or if there's a topic you're passionate about that I haven't mentioned, I'm all ears.

Best,
Charlie
