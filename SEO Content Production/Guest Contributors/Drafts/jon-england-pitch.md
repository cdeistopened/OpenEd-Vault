Hey Jon,

I've been following Libertas's work on microschool policy - the Senate Bill 13 work especially. You're making it genuinely easier for parents to start small schools, and our OpenEd audience is exactly the group asking "how do I actually do this?"

I want to pitch you a guest article opportunity. Microschools are one of the hottest topics in our world right now, and you're one of the few people who understands both the policy side AND the practical "how to get started" side.

Here's what I'm thinking:

**"How to Start a Microschool: A Parent's Guide"**

The piece would cover:
- What a microschool actually is (and isn't)
- The regulatory landscape (especially in Utah, but applicable elsewhere)
- Practical first steps for parents considering this
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Resources and next steps

Here's how it works: You share your expertise (bullet points, a quick call, or whatever's easiest), and I'll ghostwrite the full article. You get the byline and final approval. It's exposure for Libertas's work to families actively looking for alternatives, and we get expert content our readers need.

This is a win-win: parents find out about your work, and OpenEd gets authoritative content on a topic families are actively searching for.

Interested?

Best,
Charlie
