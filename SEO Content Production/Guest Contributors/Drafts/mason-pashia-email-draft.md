Hey Mason,

Wanted to circle back on our marketplace conversation. We've been tracking some interesting patterns in what homeschool families are actually searching for, and I think there's a story here that would resonate with the Getting Smart audience.

A few angles we could explore:

1. **Data piece**: We could co-publish something on marketplace trends - what's rising, what's falling, what's surprising. We have real search and enrollment data that would add credibility beyond the typical "state of homeschooling" think pieces.

2. **Guest contributor swap**: If you have someone at Getting Smart who wants to reach the homeschool parent audience, we'd love to feature them. And I'd be happy to contribute something to Getting Smart if there's a topic that fits.

3. **Original research**: If there's a specific question you're curious about, we could potentially survey our user base and give you first look at the findings.

What sounds most interesting to you? Happy to jump on a quick call to brainstorm.

Best,
Charlie

- Last exchange was Dec 16, 2025 - still fresh
- They initiated 3 responses to your 2, so they're engaged
- Getting Smart is Tom Vander Ark's org - major ed-tech thought leadership
- Focus on DATA angle - that's what the convo was about
- Win-win: they get exclusive data, we get exposure to their audience
