# Email Draft: Kathleen Ouellette Follow-up (VictoryXR)

Hey Kathleen,

Wanted to follow up on our contributor conversation from last summer. I know it's been a few months, but we're still very interested in featuring VR education content on OpenEd.

The reason I'm reaching out now: we're seeing increased interest from homeschool families asking about VR and immersive learning. Your expertise at VictoryXR would be perfect for helping parents understand what's actually possible (and practical) with VR education at home.

Here are a few angles that could work well:

1. **"Is VR Education Ready for Homeschoolers?"** - An honest assessment of where VR is today, what works, what doesn't, and what's coming. Parents appreciate candor over hype.

2. **"A Parent's Guide to Immersive Learning"** - What VR/XR actually means for education, what equipment you need, and how to get started without breaking the bank.

3. **"Beyond the Headset: What VR Education Actually Looks Like"** - Demystify what a VR lesson looks like in practice.

The process is simple: you share your expertise (bullet points, voice memo, or a quick call), and I'll ghostwrite the piece. You get the byline and final approval before we publish.

Would any of these work for you? Or if there's a different angle you're excited about, I'm all ears.

Best,
Charlie
