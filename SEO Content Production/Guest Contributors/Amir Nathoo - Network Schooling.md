## Network Schooling: Why One School Can Never Be Enough

*By Amir Nathoo, CEO of Outschool*

The debate between "school" and "homeschool" has always been a false choice.

Think about how you actually live your life. You have work friends and weekend friends. You belong to a gym and a church and maybe a book club. Your professional network overlaps with your personal network in some places and diverges in others. You are a member of multiple communities, each serving different parts of who you are.

Why would we expect children to be any different?

My son goes to a microschool in San Francisco. He also spends significant time on Outschool taking live online classes. He has memberships in other learning communities too. His education is an ecosystem, not a single institution.

I've started calling this approach "network schooling" - the idea that children can be members of multiple learning networks simultaneously, each serving different interests, needs, and aspects of their identity.

### The Box Is Finally Opening

For generations, education meant one thing: a child went to one school, all day, every day. The box was closed.

That model made sense in an era when information was scarce, logistics were hard, and economies of scale demanded standardization. But we don't live in that world anymore.

COVID accelerated what was already happening. Families discovered that their children could learn from teachers anywhere in the world. They realized that a struggling student in one environment might thrive in another. They experienced what happens when you mix and match approaches based on what actually works.

The box is open now. You can't close it again.

Anyone doing two or more educational approaches simultaneously has already made a fundamental shift. They may have the box open just a crack - maybe their kid is in traditional school but takes an online art class on weekends. Or they may have thrown it wide open - combining a microschool, multiple online platforms, private tutoring, and real-world apprenticeships.

Either way, they've crossed a threshold. They're no longer asking "which single school is best?" They're asking "which combination of resources serves my child?"

### Why Networks Match Human Nature

Network schooling works because it reflects how humans actually are.

We have different parts to ourselves - different interests, different identities. These aspects of who we are intersect in complex ways. A child might love both competitive chess and creative writing. They might need structured math instruction but thrive with unstructured science exploration. They might be an introvert who still craves social connection, just in smaller doses.

No single institution can serve all of these needs optimally. The assumption that it should - that one school should be everything to every child - has always been the problem.

Think about adults. We don't expect to get everything we need from a single source. We have doctors and therapists and coaches and mentors and friends and colleagues. We belong to professional associations and hobby groups and religious communities. Our lives are networked by design.

Children deserve the same richness. Network schooling gives it to them.

### What Network Schooling Looks Like in Practice

A network-schooled child might:

- Attend a small microschool three days a week for core academics and in-person community
- Take live online classes on Outschool for specialized interests like coding Minecraft mods or learning Japanese
- Work with a private tutor for SAT prep
- Participate in a homeschool co-op for science labs and group projects
- Join a sports league at the local public school
- Apprentice with a local business owner one afternoon a week

The specific combination matters less than the mindset. Parents become educational architects, designing a learning environment around their specific child rather than hoping their child fits a pre-designed environment.

This requires more intentionality than dropping a kid off at the neighborhood school. But parents are discovering that the payoff is worth the effort. A child who is engaged, curious, and growing - rather than bored, anxious, or falling behind - is worth the extra coordination.

### The Rise of Creative Entrepreneurial Teachers

Network schooling also liberates teachers.

In the traditional system, teachers face enormous constraints. Curriculum mandates, standardized testing, administrative bureaucracy, and one-size-fits-all pacing all limit what a passionate educator can do. Teachers who want to innovate often find themselves fighting the system instead of serving students.

In a networked model, teachers can specialize. They can teach exactly what they're passionate about, to students who actively want to learn it. They can design their own curriculum, set their own pace, and build their own community of learners.

At Outschool, we aim to treat all of our teachers as creative entrepreneurial professionals - which is what teaching truly is. We've seen what happens when you remove the roadblocks: teachers who were burned out in traditional schools come alive when given the freedom to teach the way they always wanted to.

What could happen if a generation of children is educated by a generation of creative entrepreneurial teachers who are genuinely passionate about their subjects? That sounds like the future to me.

### Not All Screen Time Is Created Equal

Parents often worry about technology in education. This concern is valid but misses an important distinction.

Just watching videos on YouTube is completely different from building a virtual world, learning a tool, or collaborating with others on a creative project. The great thing about kids interacting and building virtual worlds is that, ultimately, they want to build in the real world. But when you're young, it's not always safe or practical to do real-world building. Virtual environments let children practice skills they instinctively want to learn - the powerful tools of adult society - in a safe context.

You can see the difference in a child's face. A kid who has spent an hour passively watching videos has a different look - maybe edgy, maybe glazed over. But a child who comes away from an interactive class brimming with creativity and excitement? That's not a problem. That's education working.

Technology is one of the most powerful tools of our civilization. Restricting children from accessing it entirely does them a disservice. The question is not whether to use technology, but how to use it well.

### The Pragmatist Revolution

We've crossed the chasm.

For a long time, alternative education attracted ideological true believers - parents with strong convictions about one approach being superior. But since COVID, something shifted. The pragmatists arrived.

These are parents who don't have a strong ideological position on homeschooling versus traditional schooling. They're not making a political statement. They simply noticed that their child was miserable in a particular class or school, and they needed something better.

Pragmatists don't care about purity. They care about results. They'll take what works from anywhere and leave what doesn't. This is the mentality that makes network schooling possible - and inevitable.

### How to Start Building Your Child's Network

If this resonates with you, here's how to begin:

**1. Audit what's working and what isn't.** Where does your child thrive? Where do they struggle? What interests are going unexplored?

**2. Identify one gap to fill.** You don't have to redesign everything at once. Start with a single class, tutor, or experience that addresses one unmet need.

**3. Experiment freely.** Try things. Drop what doesn't work. Keep what does. Network schooling is iterative, not fixed.

**4. Connect with other families.** You'll learn faster by talking to parents who are already mixing and matching. They'll share resources you never knew existed.

**5. Trust your child.** They often know what they need. Listen to their excitement and their resistance. Both contain information.

The binary of school versus homeschool served a world that no longer exists. Your child doesn't live in one box. Their education shouldn't either.
