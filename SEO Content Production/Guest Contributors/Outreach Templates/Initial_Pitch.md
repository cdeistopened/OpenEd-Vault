## Template

Hi [Name],

I've been following your work on [specific piece/platform] - [specific thing you liked about it, not generic praise].

I'm the content lead at OpenEd, and I think there's a concept from your [podcast/newsletter/book] that would resonate with our audience of homeschool parents: [one-sentence concept].

I took the liberty of drafting something based on your existing writing - nothing you need to create from scratch. If you like the direction, it would take maybe 15 minutes of your time to polish.

In exchange:
- Full byline as the author
- Big plug for [their platform/service/book] with links
- We handle all formatting, images, and promotion
- You can share it with your audience (we'll provide social assets)

We've done this with [social proof names if available] - makes it easy for everyone.

Want me to send over the draft?

Best,
Charlie

## Follow-up (7 days, no response)

Subject: Re: [Original subject]

Hi [Name],

Just floating this back up - I drafted something based on your [X] that I think your audience would love, and it would introduce you to ours.

Happy to send it over if you're curious. No pressure either way.

## Notes on Personalization

- **Reference specific work:** Not "I love your content" but "Your episode with [guest] on [topic] changed how I think about [X]"
- **Match their tone:** If they're casual, be casual. If they're formal, match it.
- **Make the ask small:** "Want me to send the draft?" not "Would you like to write for us?"
