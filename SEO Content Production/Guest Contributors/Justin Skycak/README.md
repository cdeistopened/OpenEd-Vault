## About Justin

**Role:** Chief Quant and Director of Analytics at Math Academy  
**Blog:** [justinmath.com](https://www.justinmath.com)  
**Background:** Math + CS degrees, ML masters from Georgia Tech, former tutor of 300+ students

**Core Expertise:**
- Learning science (spaced repetition, retrieval practice, automaticity)
- Math education & acceleration
- Foundational skills / prerequisite mastery
- EdTech critique (why most apps fail to produce learning)
- Talent development frameworks
- Knowledge graph / adaptive learning system design

---

## Previous Relationship with OpenEd

Justin was featured prominently in our **AI Adaptive Learning Guide** (`/open-education/ai-adaptive-learning`). Key quotes used:

- "Maximizing Learning vs Other Things" (on why testing/repetition became dirty words)
- "Which Cognitive Psychology Findings are Solid" (laws of physics in learning)
- "Why is the EdTech Industry So Damn Soft?" (serious vs engagement-optimized products)
- Work on Fractional Implicit Repetition

Math Academy is positioned in that article as "THE example of cognitive science-based adaptive learning done right."

An initial outreach email was drafted (see `OpenEd Daily/2026-01-07 - Learning Science/JUSTIN_OUTREACH_EMAIL.md`) but focused on reviewing the AI article, not a guest contribution.

## Proposed Article

### Title
**"The Case for Serious Math: What Middle Schoolers Are Actually Capable Of"**

### Thesis
Typical honors students can complete all of high school mathematics plus calculus during middle school (grades 6-8) without extra study time—they just need efficient instruction. Justin's data from Math Academy's Eurisko program proves this.

### Why This Works for OpenEd

1. **Speaks to ambitious homeschool families** - our core audience chose homeschooling for flexibility
2. **Research-backed** - Justin cites Lubinski/Benbow longitudinal studies on acceleration
3. **Provocative & shareable** - challenges assumptions about what kids can do
4. **Natural Math Academy plug** - demonstrates the platform's approach
5. **Links to existing content** - connects to our AI/adaptive learning article

### SEO Alignment

Targets keywords:
- "accelerated math homeschool"
- "advanced math homeschool"
- "gifted homeschool math"
- "math acceleration for kids"

   - URL: https://www.justinmath.com/what-happens-when-middle-school-is-put-to-good-use/
   - Key claim: Top 10% can learn all high school math + calculus in middle school
   - Evidence: Eurisko program data—students at 90th percentile (not exceptional) completing AP Calc BC by 8th grade with perfect scores
   - Downstream benefits: NASA research, solo-authored papers in high school

## Outreach Email (Draft)

**Subject:** Guest article for OpenEd?

Hi Justin,

We featured Math Academy in our AI adaptive learning guide a few weeks back (the one where we cited your "dirty words" observation about testing and repetition). The response was strong—parents asking how to evaluate math tools, how to know if their kid has gaps, whether acceleration is realistic.

That got me thinking: would you be interested in writing something original for us?

**The pitch:** "The Case for Serious Math: What Middle Schoolers Are Actually Capable Of"

Your Eurisko data is remarkable—typical honors students doing calculus by 8th grade. I think you could make a compelling case to homeschool parents that their kids might be more capable than they assume. We have the flexibility that schools don't; your data shows what's possible when that flexibility is used well.

We'd pay a contributor fee, promote heavily across newsletter/social/podcast (50k+ subscribers), and link to Math Academy throughout.

Interested? Happy to discuss the angle or adjust based on what you'd want to write about.

Charlie
