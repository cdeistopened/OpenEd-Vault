# Grade Level Guides

**Status:** Q3 2026 Priority
**Location:** Lives within Open Education Hub (`opened.co/openeducation`)
**Priority:** High - can execute quickly (1 day per guide)

---

## Vision

"OpenEd Recommended" full curriculum stack for each grade level. A parent lands on the K guide, sees exactly what to use for Math, Reading, Science, History - all from marketplace partners. Clear, opinionated, actionable.

Not "here are 50 options" but "here's what we recommend, and why."

---

## Why This Matters

- **For parents:** Decision fatigue is real. Give them a complete answer.
- **For OpenEd:** Drives enrollment (marketplace partners) and newsletter signups
- **For SEO:** "kindergarten homeschool curriculum" = high intent keyword
