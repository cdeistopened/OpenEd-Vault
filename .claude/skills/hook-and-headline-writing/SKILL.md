# Hook and Headline Writer

## Purpose

This skill creates hooks and headlines that **stop the scroll and compel action** using systematic frameworks, not guesswork.

**Core Philosophy:** 80% of content performance comes from the hook. Spend 25% of your time crafting it. Generate volume (10+ options), then select best using proven criteria.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Write newsletter subject lines that get opens
- Craft social media thread hooks that stop the scroll
- Create LinkedIn post first lines that compel "see more"
- Optimize headlines for blog posts or articles
- Generate multiple hook variations for A/B testing

**Use in conjunction with:**
- `daily-newsletter-workflow` (Phase 3: subject line generation)
- `weekly-newsletter-workflow` (Phase 3: subject line generation)
- `social-content-creation` (Phase 3: optimizing post hooks)

**Do NOT use for:**
- Long-form body copy (use `conversion-copy-creation` instead)
- Product descriptions or landing page copy (use `conversion-copy-creation` instead)

## Key Principles

### The 3-Sentence Rule for Social Hooks
- Maximum 3 sentences for social media hooks
- First sentence MUST be short
- Each sentence's goal is to get reader to the next

### The 25% Rule
How to allocate time:
- 25% ideation (identifying what to say)
- 25% hook/headline (crafting how to say it)
- 50% content (writing the rest)

### Volume → Selection
- Generate 10+ variations minimum
- Select best using systematic criteria (not gut feel)
- The first option is rarely the best option

### Story Structure for Context
**Story = Problem + Goal + Path**

This equation equals value. Use it to identify what transformation your hook promises.

---

## The 3-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Generate Hook Ideas (Ideation)

**Goal:** Identify the core benefit, transformation, or insight your hook will promise

#### Step 1: Use the "Start Questioning" Method

Ask who/what/where/when/why/how about your topic. Then dig deeper by asking multiple times on the same answer.

**Example:**
- **Topic:** Microschools
- **What?** "What are microschools?" → Small schools with 5-15 students
- **Why?** "Why do parents choose them?" → Personalization, community, flexibility
- **Why (deeper)?** "Why does that matter?" → Kids who actually want to learn vs being forced
- **How?** "How do they start?" → 8-12 families, no credentials needed
- **Impact angle discovered:** "You don't need permission to start a school"

**Quality Check:**
- [ ] Asked who/what/where/when/why/how
- [ ] Dug deeper at least 2-3 times on promising angles
- [ ] Identified a specific, impactful aspect to share (not just surface-level info)

#### Step 2: Identify the Transformation

Use the **Story = Problem + Goal + Path** framework:

**Problem:** What struggle/pain does the audience face?
**Goal:** What result do they want?
**Path:** What's the journey between them?

**Example:**
- **Problem:** Parents feel trapped in school systems that don't fit their kids
- **Goal:** Find educational freedom and see kids thrive
- **Path:** Discover microschools as accessible alternative

**Your hook should promise movement along this path.**

#### Step 3: Identify Headline Elements

Extract these 6 elements from your content:
1. **Problem** - What pain/struggle exists?
2. **Goal** - What result does reader want?
3. **Benefit** - What will their life look like after?
4. **Concept** - What idea/principle applies?
5. **Example** - What story/data illustrates this?
6. **Process** - What steps lead to the result?

You'll combine these in Phase 2 to generate variations.

**Example for "Dave Hoffman Unschooling" story:**
- **Problem:** Parents fear unschooling will leave gaps in education
- **Goal:** Raise confident, successful, independent kids
- **Benefit:** Kids who out-earn parents, solve real problems
- **Concept:** Initiative matters more than algebra
- **Example:** Public school principal who unschooled 6 kids (all successful)
- **Process:** Let kids pursue interests, treat geography as curriculum, focus on learning to learn

#### Step 4: "Become the Reader" Check

Before moving to Phase 2, review from audience perspective:
- **Ask:** "What's in it for me?"
- **Check:** Is this too abstract? (If you can't picture it, neither can they)
- **Verify:** Would I stop scrolling for this?

---

### Phase 2: Select Hook Type & Formula

**Goal:** Match your idea to proven frameworks that amplify it best

#### The Headline Element Combination System

**Combine 2 of the 6 elements** to create headline structure:

**Common Powerful Combinations:**

| Combination | Formula | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Problem + Process** | "How to [Solve Problem] in [Steps]" | "How to Overcome Writer's Block in 5 Steps" |
| **Benefit + Timeframe** | "[Achieve Benefit] in [Time]" | "Double Your Productivity in 30 Days" |
| **Concept + Target Audience** | "[Concept] for [Specific People]" | "Minimalism for Busy Professionals" |
| **Goal + Benefit** | "[Achieve Goal] to [Get Benefit]" | "Build an Audience to Earn Money While You Sleep" |
| **Example + Process** | "[Specific Result] using [Method]" | "How I Hit 100K Followers Using 3 Simple Rules" |
| **Problem + Benefit** | "Stop [Problem] and Start [Benefit]" | "Stop Trading Time for Money and Start Building Passive Income" |

**How to use:**
1. Review your 6 elements from Phase 1
2. Try 5-10 different combinations
3. Select 2-3 that feel most powerful for your concept

#### Hook Type Selection

**Choose the hook type that best matches your content goal:**

**1. Curiosity Hooks** (create information gap)
- State what and why, leave out how
- State start and end, leave out middle
- Make bold claim, leave out data/proof

**Examples:**
- "I turned 33 today. I weighed in at 337lbs this week. Here's what happened and how I'll lose 140lbs in the next 18 months:"
- "10 years in SEO. Here's what every new digital marketer should know:"

**When to use:** Content that reveals process, method, or surprising insight

---

**2. Transformation Hooks** (show before → after)
- Personal transformation stories
- Skill development timelines
- Business/financial progress

**Formula:** "[Before State] → [After State]. Here's how:"

**Examples:**
- "100 followers when I started. Last week, hit 10k. Here's how I did it:"
- "I quit my 9-5 in 6 months. The key? Mastering one high-income skill."

**When to use:** Content showing how to achieve a desirable change

---

**3. Authority Hooks** (leverage expertise/results)
- Share years of experience
- Highlight specific achievements
- Borrow authority from others

**Formula:** "[Credentials/Results]. Here's what [audience] should know:"

**Examples:**
- "I've built and sold 3 startups. Here are 17 learnings for your entrepreneurial journey:"
- "I coached @TaylinSimmonds to $40,000/month writing tweets. If you want to make $10K/month as a ghostwriter, read this:"

**When to use:** You have credentials/results that establish credibility

---

**4. Problem Callout Hooks** (identify pain immediately)
- Name the specific struggle
- Call out the mistake/gap
- Challenge common practice

**Formula:** "Are you making these [number] [topic] mistakes?"

**Examples:**
- "98.9% of people are still unaware of ChatGPT's full potential. Here are 10 advanced prompts:"
- "The costly mistake 90% of writers make"

**When to use:** Audience has clear pain point they're aware of

---

**5. Target Callout Hooks** (speak directly to specific audience)
- Name the audience explicitly
- Address their specific context
- Use "you" language

**Formula:** "[Audience name]... [Action/insight they need]"

**Examples:**
- "Digital Writers... Stop committing these 4 headline mistakes"
- "Attention Bloggers: Your headlines are costing you readers"

**When to use:** Niche content for specific audience segment

---

**6. Bold Claim Hooks** (pattern interrupt)
- Make counterintuitive statement
- Challenge conventional wisdom
- Present surprising data

**Formula:** "[Surprising/controversial claim]. Here's why:"

**Examples:**
- "AI will create millionaires. Here's how you can be part of it:"
- "Forget everything you know about headline writing"

**When to use:** You have a contrarian or surprising angle

---

#### Apply Sticky Sentence Techniques

Enhance your hook using these literary devices:

**1. Alliteration** - Same starting sounds
- "Specificity is the secret"
- "The best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed"

**2. Symmetry** - Parallel structure
- "Read for awareness. Write for understanding."
- "It's not 10,000 hours. It's 10,000 iterations."

**3. Contrast** - Opposing ideas
- "To be everywhere is to be nowhere"
- "Be clear, not clever. Concise, not complex."

**4. Rhyme** - Similar ending sounds
- "Tell a story or lose your glory"
- "Slip and stick"

**5. Rhythm** - Pleasing cadence
- "When you can't wait to share it, they can't help but read it"
- "Make your sentences sing"

**Combining techniques:** For maximum stickiness, combine multiple techniques
- "Anger prepares us to fight. Fear prepares us to flee." (Symmetry + Alliteration)

**Full templates:** `references/thread-hook-templates.md`

---

### Phase 3: Optimize & Select Best

**Goal:** Generate 10+ variations and select the best using systematic criteria

#### Step 1: Generate Volume (10+ Variations)

Using different combinations from Phase 2:
- Try 3-4 different hook types
- Apply 2-3 different headline formulas
- Test with/without sticky sentence techniques
- Vary element combinations

**Minimum output:** 10 hook variations

**Example for "Microschools Scale Story":**

1. "1.5 million students are in microschools now. The same number as Catholic schools. This isn't fringe anymore."
2. "What has 95,000 locations, 1.5M students, and 76% parent satisfaction? Not public schools. Microschools."
3. "Microschools just matched Catholic school enrollment: 1.5M students. Here's what changed:"
4. "The question isn't whether microschools work. It's whether one works for YOUR family."
5. "1.5M students. 95K schools. 76% satisfaction. The microschool movement is here."
6. "Most people still think microschools are fringe. But 1.5 million students are already enrolled."
7. "When policy fails, people build anyway. 1.5M students in microschools prove it."
8. "Catholic schools: 1.5M students. Microschools: 1.5M students. One difference: 76% vs 42% satisfaction."
9. "Are you making this mistake? Thinking microschools are fringe when 1.5M students are already enrolled."
10. "Forget everything you know about school size. 1.5M students are in schools of 5-15 kids."

#### Step 2: Apply the 10 Commandments of Engagement

Optimize your top 5-7 variations using this checklist:

**1. Numbers and Statistics**
- [ ] Uses specific numbers (not "many" or "several")
- [ ] Includes percentages, dollar amounts, or timeframes
- Example: "1.5 million" not "many," "76% satisfaction" not "high satisfaction"

**2. Negativity Bias**
- [ ] Highlights potential loss or mistake
- [ ] Warns of consequences
- Example: "The costly mistake 90% make" or "What you're missing about microschools"

**3. Pattern Interrupt**
- [ ] Challenges common belief
- [ ] Surprises or contradicts expectations
- Example: "Forget everything you know about..." or "Most people think X, but actually Y"

**4. Target Callout**
- [ ] Directly addresses specific audience
- [ ] Names them explicitly when appropriate
- Example: "Homeschool parents:" or "If you're considering alternatives to public school"

**5. Problem Callout**
- [ ] Identifies common pain point immediately
- [ ] Names the struggle specifically
- Example: "Tired of [specific problem]?" or "Struggling with [exact issue]?"

**6. Confidence and Conviction**
- [ ] Uses strong, assertive language
- [ ] Eliminates hedge words (maybe, might, could, probably, possibly)
- [ ] Speaks in absolutes when accurate
- Example: "This is how" not "This might help," "You need" not "You might want"

**7. Aesthetics**
- [ ] Visually clean and scannable
- [ ] Line breaks in right places
- [ ] Not a wall of text
- Example: Use line breaks between sentences for social media hooks

**8. Potential Benefit**
- [ ] Clearly states what reader will gain
- [ ] Focuses on outcome, not just process
- Example: "Learn how to 10x productivity" not just "Learn productivity tips"

**9. Social Proof**
- [ ] Leverages authority or popularity when relevant
- [ ] References results, credentials, or third-party validation
- Example: "I coached @Person to $40K/month" or "Used by 10,000+ marketers"

**10. Warning and Caution**
- [ ] Creates urgency or importance
- [ ] Suggests reader might be missing out
- Example: "Before you [make decision], read this" or "Warning: [common mistake]"

**You don't need all 10 in every hook.** Aim for 4-6 for strong performance.

**Full explanations:** `references/10-commandments-checklist.md`

#### Step 3: Test with The 4 U's

Evaluate your top 3-5 options against this compound framework:

**The 4 U's:**
1. **Useful** - Does it offer clear value?
2. **Urgent** - Does it compel immediate action/attention?
3. **Unique** - Does it stand out from similar content?
4. **Ultra-specific** - Is it concrete (not vague)?

**Example of all 4 U's working together:**
"7 Little-Known SEO Tricks to Boost Your Traffic by 204% in Just 30 Days"

- ✅ Useful: SEO tricks that boost traffic
- ✅ Urgent: "Just 30 days" creates timeframe
- ✅ Unique: "Little-known" implies non-obvious tactics
- ✅ Ultra-specific: "204%" (not "increase traffic"), "7 tricks" (exact number)

**Quality threshold:** Your hook should score 3/4 or 4/4 on the U's.

#### Step 4: Final Selection Using Anatomy Criteria

Evaluate your finalists against these 5 criteria:

**1. Clarity** - Main point immediately clear?
**2. Specificity** - Concrete information or promise?
**3. Urgency** - Compels immediate action/interest?
**4. Uniqueness** - Stands out from competitors?
**5. Relevance** - Aligns with target audience's interests?

**Scoring:**
- Rate each criterion 1-5
- Minimum passing score: 20/25 total
- Aim for: 22-25/25 for high performance

#### Step 5: "Become the Reader" Final Check

Before finalizing, ask yourself:
- [ ] **"What's in it for me?"** - Is the benefit crystal clear?
- [ ] **Too abstract?** - Can I picture what this promises?
- [ ] **Would I stop scrolling?** - Honest answer
- [ ] **Does it make sense standalone?** - Or does it need more context?

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Ideation Issues
❌ **Surface-level questioning** - Stopping at first "why" without digging deeper
❌ **Too abstract** - Can't visualize what you're promising
❌ **Missing transformation** - No clear before → after

### Formula Issues
❌ **First-match bias** - Using first formula that fits without exploring options
❌ **Formula drift** - Starting with formula then abandoning structure
❌ **Overcomplication** - Trying to say too much in one hook

### Optimization Issues
❌ **Skipping volume generation** - Writing 2-3 options instead of 10+
❌ **Hedge words** - "Maybe," "might," "could" (kills conviction)
❌ **Generic promises** - "Boost productivity" vs "Double your output in 30 days"
❌ **No specificity** - "Many people" vs "1.5 million students"

### Selection Issues
❌ **Gut-based selection** - Picking favorite without systematic evaluation
❌ **Ignoring "What's in it for me?" test** - Benefit unclear to reader
❌ **Clickbait** - Promise you can't fulfill (destroys trust)

---

✅ **Passes 4 U's test** - Useful, Urgent, Unique, Ultra-specific (3/4 minimum)
✅ **Applies 4-6 Commandments** - Optimized using engagement principles
✅ **Scores 20+ on Anatomy** - Clarity, Specificity, Urgency, Uniqueness, Relevance
✅ **Survives "Become the Reader" test** - "What's in it for me?" is clear
✅ **Uses proven formula** - Not generic, follows structure
