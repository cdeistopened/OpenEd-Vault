# OpenEd Daily 10/27/25 - FINAL

**SUBJECT**: Schools teach what AI does best. That's the problem.

**PREVIEW**: The honest gaps conversation, the 3 skills that make you irreplaceable, and why creation beats consumption. Plus: What's a bandwagon anyway?

---

Greetings!

Last week we shared Dave Hoffman's story—a public school administrator who unschooled all six kids. His take? Critics obsess over homeschool "gaps," but traditional school has worse gaps. This week, a Reddit post offers something rare: an honest homeschooler sharing the real gaps they experienced. Plus, [what makes you irreplaceable in an AI world](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2025/09/16/3-human-skills-that-make-you-irreplaceable-in-an-ai-world/), and why a 3D printer might be your best parenting investment.

Let's dive in.

## THE HONEST HOMESCHOOL CONVERSATION

An adult homeschooler posted on Reddit this week sharing ["5 gaps homeschooling left in my education."](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1nvcvt9/5_gaps_homeschooling_did_leave_in_my_education/) The list? Not what critics usually fear.

The gaps weren't calculus or lab science. They were things like navigating bureaucratic institutions, understanding classroom dynamics, and developing certain social scripts. Real gaps—but not the ones people obsess over.

The question isn't "Will there be gaps?" It's "Which gaps can you live with? Which can you fix later?"

Being honest about trade-offs doesn't mean admitting failure. It means choosing intentionally.

Every educational path leaves gaps. Traditional school teaches you how to navigate institutions—but often kills the very initiative you need once you leave them. Homeschooling might leave you less familiar with bureaucratic hoops, but preserves the creative spark those institutions tend to extinguish.

The honest homeschool conversation isn't defensive. It's mature. It says: We see the trade-offs, we chose them anyway, and we're prepared to address what comes.

## WHAT MAKES YOU IRREPLACEABLE?

[Ed Elson](https://www.gettingsmart.com/author/ed-elson/), host of the Prof G Markets podcast, asked a question worth sitting with: ["What would make me irreplaceable in an AI world?"](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2025/09/16/3-human-skills-that-make-you-irreplaceable-in-an-ai-world/)

The answer, according to researchers and educators watching this shift: **Curation, Curiosity, and Connectivity.**

**[Curation](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2025/09/16/3-human-skills-that-make-you-irreplaceable-in-an-ai-world/)** isn't just scrolling and reposting—it's authorship. It's choosing the tone and frame of a message. It's developing taste.

**Curiosity** builds creative range. It's the willingness to explore outside your lane, to chase ideas that don't have an immediate payoff. It's what lets you connect dots others don't see.

**Connectivity** means showing up with warmth and follow-through. Being the person who brings the group together, who makes others feel smarter when they work with you. That trust is hard to earn and impossible to automate.

Here's the problem: Schools teach what AI does best—standardized knowledge, recall, following instructions. The 3 C's? They can't be standardized. They can't be tested. So schools struggle to teach them.

The real educational divide isn't about who has credentials versus who doesn't anymore. It's about who has curiosity and agency versus who just follows instructions.

And here's the thing: families pursuing personalized education have been prioritizing these skills all along. Not because they predicted AI, but because they understood what makes humans actually thrive.

## CREATION BEATS CONSUMPTION

A parent on Reddit tried everything to pull their son away from screens. [Sports didn't stick. Clubs didn't stick. Art classes didn't stick.](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1o0rgb5/how_a_3d_printer_surprisingly_helped_my_kid_spend/)

Then they bought a 3D printer.

Not as a screen time solution—just as a creative tool. They downloaded free models, printed toys, figured out the basics. Then the parent started designing custom models their son could paint.

That changed everything.

Now the kid spends 1-2 hours daily painting 3D models. He's proud of every piece. He hasn't asked for store-bought toys in months. The phone? Still there. But it's no longer the default.

The shift wasn't about removing technology—it was about redirecting it. Creation beats consumption every time.

Our CEO Isaac has a rule in his house: Make a YouTube video before you watch YouTube. Create before you consume. Contribute before you take.

Tech isn't the enemy. Screens aren't inherently bad. But there's a massive difference between using technology to create versus using it to scroll.

A basic 3D printer costs $200-300. Entry-level modeling software is free. And suddenly, your kid isn't a passive consumer—they're a maker.

## WORD OF THE DAY

**BANDWAGON**

Last week we told you to "hop on the bandwagon" and invite friends in our new states to apply to OpenEd. But let's be honest—nobody actually knows what a bandwagon is.

Here's the deal: A bandwagon was a decorated wagon that carried a circus band through town. Politicians in the 1800s would literally jump on the bandwagon during parades to get attention and ride the wave of popularity.

"Jump on the bandwagon" came to mean joining a popular movement, often without thinking too critically about it.

But we're reclaiming it. Get on the OpenEd bandwagon—but do think critically first. Question the fences. Build gates. Choose your trade-offs intentionally.

And now you know what you're actually hopping onto.
