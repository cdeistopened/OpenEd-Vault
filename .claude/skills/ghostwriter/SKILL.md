# Ghostwriter Skill

## Purpose

This skill transforms source material—transcripts, notes, research, interviews—into authentic, human-written content that reads naturally without obvious AI tells. It combines universal writing fundamentals with specific techniques for detecting and eliminating patterns that signal AI-assisted writing.

**Core Philosophy:** The best ghostwriting is invisible. Readers should feel like they're reading a real person's thoughts, not a filtered or processed version of source material. This requires understanding both universal writing principles AND the patterns that betray AI involvement.

## When to Use This Skill

Use the Ghostwriter skill when:
- Converting transcripts or interviews into polished articles or newsletters
- Refining notes into publishable content
- Converting source material into different voices or styles
- Ensuring written content reads authentically human
- Detecting and eliminating AI-like patterns from your writing
- Building content that maintains a distinctive, personal voice

**Use in conjunction with:**
- Style reference files for adapting to specific voices (Pirate Wires, Packy McCormick, Justin Mikolay, One Thing Better)
- Source material that needs authentic conversion
- Your One True Fan audience understanding

**Best for:**
- Newsletter content from interviews
- Blog posts from transcripts
- Educational content from research
- Any content that needs to sound naturally human

## Universal Writing Fundamentals

These principles apply to ALL writing. Master them first, then layer on specific style choices.

### 1. Energy Transfer

**The best writing is a transfer of energy from writer to reader.**

- Write conversations, not speeches
- Be personable, especially in email and newsletters
- Speak WITH your audience, not AT them
- Remove corporate jargon, academic language, and media buzzwords

**Examples:**
- ❌ "The implementation of our innovative curriculum frameworks has demonstrated significant positive outcomes in terms of student engagement metrics."
- ✅ "Students love our new teaching methods."

The second version transfers energy. Readers feel conviction, not formality.

### 2. Conciseness is King

**Always remove surplus words. Every word should earn its place.**

**Process:**
1. Write your first draft (don't hold back)
2. Read it aloud
3. Delete anything that:
   - Repeats an idea already stated
   - Softens your main point
   - Sounds like formal writing instead of conversation
   - Takes more words than necessary

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Our pedagogical approach incorporates multiple methodologies designed to accommodate diverse learning styles and cognitive development patterns."
- ✅ "We adapt our teaching to how your child learns best."

### 3. The SUCKS Framework

Before writing anything, answer these questions:

**S - Specific**
- Write for ONE person (your "One True Fan")
- Not a crowd, not "everyone," one specific person
- Know their struggles, goals, language
- If you write for everyone, you write for no one

**U - Unique & Useful**
- Does this change how your reader thinks, feels, or acts?
- If not, don't publish it
- Unique means: they haven't seen this perspective before
- Useful means: they can actually apply this

**C - Clear, Curious, Conversational**
- Clear: Main idea is unmissable
- Curious: You've asked questions that make readers think
- Conversational: Reads like talking to a friend, not a textbook

**K - Kept Simple & Structured**
- Simple ideas, simple words
- Structured: Clear beginning, middle, end (clear progression)
- No unnecessary complexity

**Application checklist:**
- [ ] Who is my ONE True Fan reading this?
- [ ] What will they think, feel, or do differently after?
- [ ] Could a 12-year-old understand the main point?
- [ ] Does this flow like a conversation?

### 4. Be Undeniable

**Transform vague claims into concrete specifics.**

- ❌ "How to boost your website traffic by at least 87% in just one month."
- ✅ "This year, I helped 13 clients boost their website traffic by 87%-256% in just one month. Here's how:"

The second version is undeniable—it's specific, it's true, and it comes with authority because you name actual clients and actual results.

**Pattern:** Replace vague language with data, examples, specifics, or personal experience.

### 5. Craft Sticky Sentences

Use these techniques to create memorable statements:

**Alliteration**
- "Specificity is the secret" - @ItsKieranDrew
- "The best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed" - Naval Ravikant

**Symmetry**
- "Read for awareness. Write for understanding."
- "It's not 10,000 hours. It's 10,000 iterations." - Naval Ravikant

**Contrast**
- "To be everywhere is to be nowhere." - Letters from a Stoic
- "Be clear, not clever. Concise, not complex." - @ItsKieranDrew

**Rhyme**
- "Tell a story or lose your glory"

**Rhythm**
- "When you can't wait to share it, they can't help but read it"

**For maximum stickiness, combine techniques:**
- "Anger prepares us to fight. Fear prepares us to flee." (Symmetry + Alliteration)

## Leverage Human Desires

Great writing taps into 8 core human desires. Choose 1-2 per piece:

### 1. Safety of Tribe
**Belonging, community, fitting in**
- "The hidden social skills that separate successful students from struggling ones"
- Use when: Readers need to feel part of something larger

### 2. Survival & Success
**Progress, achievement, security**
- "The greatest threat to a young person's potential is getting tied down too early with long-term responsibilities"
- Use when: Readers want to progress or achieve
- Key phrases: "breakthrough," "advancement," "finally," "unlocked"

### 3. Life Enjoyment
**Pleasure, experiences, freedom**
- "Why most parents miss the best parts of their children's education"
- Use when: Readers want to live fully or enjoy something
- Key phrases: "savor," "freedom," "experience," "joy"

### 4. Social Acceptance
**Status, respect, recognition**
- "What successful people know that average people don't"
- Use when: Readers want respect or recognition
- Key phrases: "elite," "leaders know," "insiders understand"

### 5. Sexual Companionship
**Connection, attraction, intimacy**
- (Less relevant for business/education content, but understand it exists)

### 6. Comfort & Clarity
**Simplicity, ease, certainty**
- "The one question that eliminates decision paralysis"
- Use when: Readers feel confused or overwhelmed
- Key phrases: "simple," "easy," "finally understand"

### 7. Freedom From Fear
**Safety, protection, security**
- "How to protect your child from predatory school practices"
- Use when: Readers feel anxious or threatened
- Key phrases: "protect," "avoid," "defend," "safe"

### 8. Perceived Status
**Respect, authority, expertise**
- "Discover what MIT researchers just learned about learning"
- Use when: Readers want to seem knowledgeable
- Key phrases: "breakthrough," "discovered," "research shows"

**Application:** Identify which desire(s) your content taps into. Lean into them deliberately.

---

## Dash Usage

Use regular hyphens with spaces for parenthetical breaks - like this - not em dashes (—) or en dashes (–). This creates a more natural, conversational appearance.

- ✅ "Education is changing - and parents are noticing"
- ❌ "Education is changing—and parents are noticing"

---

## ⚠️ Absolutely Forbidden Syntax Patterns

These patterns are clichéd, weaken your writing, and often signal AI involvement. Never use them:

### The Correlative Construction (Most Common AI Tell)
This is the #1 pattern to avoid because it's overused in AI writing:

- ❌ "X aren't just Y — they're Z"
- ❌ "X isn't just about Y, it's about Z"
- ❌ "Schools aren't just buildings — they're communities"
- ❌ "Teachers aren't just instructors — they're mentors"

**Why it's bad:** It's the default structure that AI language models default to. Every AI writing sample uses this.

**Better alternatives:**
- ✅ "Schools build communities"
- ✅ "Teachers mentor students"
- ✅ "X accomplishes both Y and Z"

### Other Forbidden Constructions
- ❌ "It's not about X, it's about Y"
- ❌ "The truth is..." or "The reality is..."
- ❌ "Let that sink in"
- ❌ "Now more than ever..."

**Better alternatives:**
- ✅ State your point directly without setup
- ✅ Show, don't tell
- ✅ Let readers draw their own conclusions

### Forbidden Rhetorical Flourishes
- ❌ "The best part? ..."
- ❌ "The secret? ..."
- ❌ "Sounds impossible? It's not."
- ❌ "What if I told you..."
- ❌ "Here's the thing..."
- ❌ "Let's be honest..."
- ❌ "At the end of the day..."

### Forbidden Staccato Phrasing
Do not use faux-dramatic sentence fragments:
- ❌ "No fluff. No filler. Just results."
- ❌ "Big ideas. Small words. Maximum impact."
- ❌ "Simple. Clear. Effective."
- ❌ "Stop guessing. Start winning."

### Forbidden Openers
- ❌ "In the ever-evolving world of..."
- ❌ "In today's fast-paced..."
- ❌ "Gone are the days when..."
- ❌ "This underscores..."

### Formatting Restrictions
- Do not use boldface for emphasis
- Do not use emojis or decorative formatting
- Do not add summaries like "In conclusion" or "In summary"
- Do not rely on bullet points or lists unless explicitly asked

---

## Anti-AI Pattern Detection & Elimination

Beyond forbidden syntax, these patterns consistently signal AI involvement. When converting source material, eliminate them aggressively:

### 1. Overuse of "Just"

**Problem:** AI uses "just" constantly as a softener and filler word.

- ❌ "We just need to understand that education is just about learning, and we just have to focus on what matters."
- ✅ "Education is about learning. Focus on what matters."

**When "just" is acceptable:**
- "just one question"
- "just in case"
- "just started"

**When to remove it:**
- Middle of sentences as a softener
- More than once per paragraph
- Before verbs as a hedge

### 2. Overuse of "Actually"

**Problem:** AI uses "actually" to sound like it's clarifying or adding nuance. It often signals weak thinking.

- ❌ "Schools are actually about teaching, but they're actually about community, and students actually need both."
- ✅ "Schools teach. They also build community. Students need both."

**When "actually" is acceptable:**
- Correcting a previous misunderstanding: "I thought X, but actually Y"
- Very rarely, for contrast

**When to remove it:**
- Never as a sentence starter
- Never as a filler word
- If you're using it more than once per 500 words, you're overdoing it

### 3. Hedging Language (Kills Conviction)

AI loves hedge words because they make uncertain claims sound safer. But they also make writing weak.

**Common hedges to eliminate:**
- ❌ "This might help you" → ✅ "This will help you"
- ❌ "Some people say..." → ✅ "I've found that..."
- ❌ "It could be argued that..." → ✅ "It's true that..."
- ❌ "Perhaps we should consider..." → ✅ "We should..."
- ❌ "One could say..." → ✅ "This is true because..."

**Test:** If you find yourself using "might," "could," "perhaps," "possibly," "maybe," "somewhat," or "it seems like," ask yourself: Do I actually believe this? If yes, remove the hedge.

### 4. Passive Voice (Weak Authority)

**Problem:** AI defaults to passive voice because it's safer and more generic. It also sounds robotic.

- ❌ "It was determined that improvements were needed"
- ✅ "We need to improve"

- ❌ "It has been shown that students benefit from..."
- ✅ "Students benefit from..."

**Test:** If you can't identify who's doing the action, it's passive. Rewrite it with a subject.

### 5. Corporate Jargon & Buzzwords

These signal that source material has been over-processed:

- ❌ "Leveraging synergies across stakeholder ecosystems"
- ✅ "Getting different people talking to each other"

- ❌ "Optimize engagement metrics"
- ✅ "Get people paying attention"

- ❌ "Innovative pedagogical frameworks"
- ✅ "Better ways to teach"

**Test:** Would you say this to a friend? If not, rewrite it plainly.

### 6. Vague Language

AI tends toward vagueness because it's safer. But vague writing is weak writing.

- ❌ "Our students improve" → ✅ "Students improve by 40% in 6 months"
- ❌ "Many people think..." → ✅ "A recent Pew survey found that 73% of parents..."
- ❌ "Significant improvements" → ✅ "Improvements of 23-47%"

**Test:** Can you back it up with a specific number, example, or name? If not, make it more specific.

### 7. Emotional Manipulation Without Substance

- ❌ "This will change your life" (without explaining how)
- ✅ "This taught me to ask better questions, which led to finding a better job"

### 8. Clichéd Openers & Closers

**Avoid these at the start or end:**
- ❌ "In today's world..." / "In this day and age..."
- ❌ "At the end of the day..."
- ❌ "One thing is for certain..."
- ❌ "The bottom line is..."

**Instead:**
- Start with a specific insight or story
- End with a clear takeaway or question

### 9. Too Many Transition Words

AI overuses transitions trying to seem sophisticated:

- ❌ "Furthermore, it is important to note that, in addition to this, moreover, it should also be mentioned that..."
- ✅ Strong structure needs fewer transitions

**Limit transitions to:** but, and, so, then, because

### 10. Overcomplicated Sentence Structure

**AI loves long, complex sentences trying to sound smart.**

- ❌ "The multifaceted nature of contemporary educational paradigms, which encompasses diverse learning modalities and pedagogical approaches, necessitates a comprehensive reevaluation of traditional assessment methodologies."
- ✅ "Schools teach in many ways now. We need to rethink how we test."

## The Ghostwriting Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Your Source Material

Read through everything completely:
- What's the core insight or story?
- What's the emotional arc?
- What would your One True Fan need to understand?
- What's the most important takeaway?

**Ask yourself:**
- [ ] What's being said that no one else is saying?
- [ ] What will readers think, feel, or do differently?
- [ ] What's the 30-second version of this?

### Step 2: Apply the SUCKS Framework

Before writing:
- [ ] Who is my ONE True Fan?
- [ ] Is this unique and useful to them?
- [ ] Can I make it clear, curious, and conversational?
- [ ] How do I keep it simple and structured?

### Step 3: Choose Your Voice

Select how to adapt the material:

**Pirate Wires Style** - Authentic, contrarian, conversational
- Use for: Calling out obvious truths, challenging conventional wisdom
- Reference: `references/pirate-wires-style.md`

**Packy McCormick Style** - Analytical enthusiasm, accessible complexity
- Use for: Explaining trends, making smart analysis exciting
- Reference: `references/packy-mccormick-style.md`

**Justin Mikolay Style** - Discovery by deletion, maximum impact
- Use for: Refining and polishing, limited word count
- Reference: `references/justin-mikolay-style.md`

**One Thing Better Style** - Decision frameworks, risk reframing
- Use for: Educational decisions, helping readers think through tradeoffs
- Reference: `references/one-thing-better-style.md`

**Default (Professional)** - Clear, direct, authentic
- Use for: Professional content, business writing, default when unsure

### Step 4: Convert Source Material

Draft your content:
1. Extract key quotes and ideas from source material
2. Translate them into your chosen voice
3. Structure with clear beginning, middle, end
4. Use specific examples, numbers, and concrete details
5. Create energy transfer (conversation, not lecture)

### Step 5: Apply Sticky Sentences

Identify 2-3 most important statements and strengthen them:
- Add alliteration, symmetry, contrast, or rhythm
- Make them quotable
- Make them memorable

### Step 6: Eliminate AI Tells (Critical Step)

Go through systematically and remove:
- [ ] Correlative constructions ("X aren't just Y, they're Z")
- [ ] Overuse of "just" and "actually"
- [ ] Hedge words (might, could, perhaps, seems)
- [ ] Passive voice
- [ ] Corporate jargon
- [ ] Vague language (replace with specifics)
- [ ] Forbidden patterns ("Let that sink in," "In this day and age")
- [ ] Too many transitions
- [ ] Overcomplicated sentences
- [ ] Emotional clichés without substance

**Test for each sentence:** Would this sentence appear in a ChatGPT output? If yes, rewrite it.

### Step 7: Read Aloud & Quality Check

Read your entire piece aloud:
- [ ] Does it sound like a real person talking?
- [ ] Could I email this to my One True Fan without embarrassment?
- [ ] Does energy transfer (not feel formal)?
- [ ] Is every sentence earning its place?
- [ ] Do important ideas have sticky phrasing?
- [ ] Are there obvious AI tells remaining?

**If you answer "no" to any checkbox, fix it before publishing.**

## Elements of Effective Ghostwritten Content

When converting source material, include:

1. **Capture attention immediately** - First sentence must hook
2. **Use specific numbers** - "1.5 million" not "many," "76% satisfaction" not "high satisfaction"
3. **Employ pattern interrupts** - Surprise the reader, challenge assumptions
4. **Address problems directly** - Name the struggle, don't dance around it
5. **Write with confidence and conviction** - Eliminate hedge words
6. **Highlight concrete benefits** - "Double your output in 30 days" not "boost productivity"
7. **Include social proof when relevant** - Results, credentials, third-party validation
8. **Ask powerful questions** - Make readers think, don't just tell them
9. **Incorporate warnings or cautions** - Create urgency, show stakes
10. **Remind, don't just inform** - You're often confirming what readers already sense

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Over-Processing Source Material
**Bad:** Turning a natural conversation into corporate-speak
**Good:** Preserving the authentic voice while polishing

### 2. Adding Phrases That Sound "AI-like"
**Bad:** "It's important to note that..." "Moreover..." "Furthermore..."
**Good:** Direct communication with natural transitions

### 3. Losing the Original Insight
**Bad:** Adding so much polish that the core idea disappears
**Good:** Enhancing clarity while preserving original meaning

### 4. Sounding Generic
**Bad:** Making content that could be about anything
**Good:** Making it specific to one person's perspective

### 5. Hedging Your Conviction
**Bad:** "It might be possible that..." "Some experts say..."
**Good:** "This is true because..." "We know..."
