Clip 1 | Dr. Amy (12:32.406): "You're yelling at them and it looks like they're ignoring you. Honestly, they're struggling to hear the words that you're saying when you're yelling, because they're in fight or flight."

Clip 2 | Ela (12:45.25): "Interesting."

Clip 3 | Dr. Amy (12:32.406): "Intelligently designed to only be able to hear low frequency sounds like that tiger rustling in the bush behind us, not mom's voice yelling at us."

Clip 4 | Ela (27:26.445): "Interesting."

Clip 5 | Dr. Amy (12:59.2): "Everything that comes out of your mouth either strengthens the connection with our child or weakens the connection with our child."

Clip 6 | Ela (37:06.499): "Wow."

Clip 7 | Dr. Amy (18:12.566): "We have to learn how to regulate our nervous system so that we can be that calm, regulated parent." [CLIFFHANGER - STOP]

**YouTube Description**: You think your child is ignoring you when you yell. But Dr. Amy Moore reveals the shocking neuroscience: their brain literally can't process language during fight-or-flight. It's not defiance. It's auditory exclusion.

**[POLISHED TRANSCRIPT SECTION]**

Ela Richmond (00:00)
Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. I'm your host, Ella. And today I'm joined by Dr. Amy Moore. So I'm going to jump straight into it. What led you to education?

Dr. Amy Moore (00:17)
That's a great question. My undergraduate degree is in psychology. I wasn't sure where to go to grad school, so I took a job as a teacher's assistant at a preschool. I fell in love with working with kids...

# Why Your ADHD Kid Can't Hear You (And Why That Changes Everything)

I had a realization recently, sitting across from Dr. Amy Moore while recording this podcast. She said something so simple, so obvious once you know it—yet so contrary to everything I'd been assuming as a parent—that I had to stop her and ask her to repeat it.

"When you yell at your kid," she said calmly, "their brain literally cannot process language. It's not defiance. It's neurology."

Dr. Amy Moore is a cognitive psychologist and host of the Brainy Moms Podcast. She has her PhD in psychology and spent years working with neurodivergent kids and families. What she found is both surprising and hopeful. But first, let me tell you about her own journey.

## The Personal Connection (Why This Matters)

Dr. Amy was a struggling student. Not because she couldn't do the work—she did well academically—but because her brain worked differently. She'd spend more time in the hallway than in class. She'd fail college twice.

"It wasn't until I was in college that my mom said, 'I think you have ADHD,'" Dr. Amy told me. "This was in the 80s, when we were mainly diagnosing hyperactive boys. But she saw the symptoms."

Medication changed her life. College became possible. Her life got back on track.

But as she worked with children in educational settings, she kept running into the same wall. Kids with ADHD that nobody was catching. Kids whose potential was being buried under frustration and misunderstanding.

"I thought," she said, "we're missing something."

## The Myth That's Costing You (The Counterintuitive Insight)

Here's the thing that changed my whole perspective: **We've been diagnosing ADHD wrong.**

When a kid with ADHD is struggling, we say: "They can't focus."

But Dr. Amy's research—spanning 5,000+ ADHD brains—shows something different.

"Our brain shifts attention four times a second," she explained. "That's normal brain function. Your brain focuses on a task, scans the environment for threats, comes back to the task."

So if attention isn't the problem, what is?

"Attention was not the weakest cognitive skill in our research," Dr. Amy said. "Working memory, long-term memory, and processing speed all fell below the 38th percentile. Attention? Average."

We've been training attention when we should be building working memory. We've been solving the wrong problem.

## Why Yelling Backfires (The Auditory Exclusion)

But the insight that really shook me came when she explained what happens when you yell at your ADHD child.

"When you yell at them, they're in fight-or-flight," Dr. Amy said. "And when we're in fight-or-flight, our brain is designed to hear only low-frequency sounds—like a tiger rustling in the bush behind us. Not mom's voice yelling at us. They're not ignoring you. They literally cannot hear you."

This is auditory exclusion. An evolutionary survival mechanism. Your child's brain is doing exactly what it's supposed to do—protecting them from danger by narrowing their sensory focus.

And here's the consequence: "Everything that comes out of your mouth either strengthens the connection with our child or weakens the connection. So yelling at our child is going to weaken that bond."

## What You Can Do Instead (The Path Forward)

So what do you do if your child truly can't hear you when you yell? You regulate yourself first.

This is where Dr. Amy brings in neuroscience's coolest finding: mirror neurons. Your child's nervous system mirrors yours. When you're dysregulated, your child becomes dysregulated. Your calm is contagious.

"My emotions as a mom are contagious to my child," Dr. Amy said. "That's neuroscience."

The framework is elegant: **Don't accommodate the weakness. Remediate it.** Build the cognitive skills instead of just working around them. The brain is plastic.

She told me about a kid who couldn't spell his own name in fifth grade. By ninth grade, he was getting A's in college English. Same ADHD diagnosis. Different development trajectory.

## Why This Matters for Homeschooling Families

For homeschooling parents, this is the real advantage: you're not locked into a classroom structure. You can actually remediate these skills.

"Why accommodate when we can remediate?" Dr. Amy said simply.

You can slow down for working memory. You can break tasks into pieces for processing speed. You can build the cognitive muscles instead of just reducing the load.

The "bucket theory" is this: your job isn't to fix your child's bucket. Your job is to make the bucket as big as possible. Then the struggle seems smaller by comparison.
