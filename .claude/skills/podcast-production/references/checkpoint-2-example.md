## CHECKPOINT 2 OUTPUT FORMAT

### Cold Open Script

**Format:** Verbatim clips arranged in narrative sequence (not chronological)

**Requirements:**
- Duration: 15-60 seconds total
- All quotes must be verbatim (exactly as spoken)
- Arranged for narrative impact (building tension/momentum)
- Ends with unresolved cliffhanger
- Include speaker labels and approximate timestamps

**Example:**

```
(00:00-00:05)
PETER: We have convinced children that how they're doing a school
is a measure of them. That they are constantly being judged.
They're constantly being assessed. They're being compared to others.

(00:05-00:13)
PETER: Every year, this has been true for a long time. Every year,
the rate of suicide and the rate of admission into mental hospitals,
emergency admissions for pediatric mental health emergencies plummets.
It goes way down. Every summer, school closes and the kids are doing
better. School opens up and it gets worse again.

(00:13-00:15)
PETER: School is a direct cause of anxiety and depression.

(00:15-00:28)
ELA: So when they asked teenagers what's stressing them out...

PETER: 83% Check school. Nothing else came close.
```

**Quality Gates:**
✅ Passes 4 out of 5 quality tests (Stranger, Itch, Stakes, Tease, Emotion)
✅ Ends with unresolved cliffhanger
✅ All clips are verbatim
✅ Arranged for narrative tension (not chronological order)
✅ Duration 22-35 seconds

- Complementary to clip content (not redundant)
- Works standalone without audio
- White/light text on semi-transparent dark background

**Example (for each social clip):**

```
Clip 1: "Summer = kids get better. School = kids get worse. Every year. Without exception."

Clip 2: "Your kid's gaming habit might be the healthiest thing they're doing."

Clip 3: "We'd rather blame TikTok than admit the truth about school."
```

**Design Notes:**
- Font: Sans-serif, bold weight
- Placement: Lower 1/3 of frame (doesn't obstruct speaker)
- Duration: On-screen for entire clip
- Testing: Readable at 280px width (mobile phone)

---

### Approved Social Clips

**Format:** 3 distinct clips with complementary angles and on-screen hooks

**Clip Structure:**
- Clip title
- Duration
- On-screen hook (2-4 words)
- Full verbatim transcript
- Platform recommendations
- Best use case (what emotion/action it drives)

**Example Clip:**

### Clip 1: School as a Measuring Stick

**Duration:** 1:15 | **On-Screen Hook:** Summer = kids get better. School = kids get worse. Every year. Without exception.

```
PETER: We have convinced children that how they're doing a school is a measure of them.
That they are constantly being judged. They're constantly being assessed. They're being
compared to others. They're being made to feel like, if I am a failure at school, I'm a
failure as a human being.

And it's no surprise that every year, this has been true for a long time. Every year, the
rate of suicide and the rate of admission into mental hospitals, emergency admissions for
pediatric mental health emergencies plummets. It goes way down. Every summer, school
closes and the kids are doing better. School opens up and it gets worse again, it even
plummeted during the COVID lockdown, suicides, anxiety, depression, mental health,
admissions, all went down. They didn't go back up again. Even when schools opened online,
they didn't go back up again until school opened up in person.

School is a direct cause of anxiety and depression.
```

**Platform:** YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok

**Best for:** Parent guilt/validation

---

### Clip 2: Computer Games Are Real Play

**Duration:** 1:20 | **On-Screen Hook:** Your kid's gaming habit might be the healthiest thing they're doing.

```
PETER: Now kids had a new way they could do it on the computers, they could play
computer games. And computer games are real play people. Adults wanna demonize them. But
the truth of the matter is this is real play. And the kids enjoyed them. They're creative,
they're interactive. Once you had an internet connection and they were multiplayer games,
they were interactive.

And so I went back and reviewed the research from those times, and the research is
unequivocal those kids who were on computers and playing computer games, even if you
control for background factors like socioeconomic category and so on. We're doing better
psychologically than those who weren't on computer games. So, and this was, this is true
for every age group. It's true for young kids as well as for teenagers.

So the computer was kind of a saving grace.
```

**Platform:** YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels

**Best for:** Permission + research credibility

### Clip 3: Why We Blame the Wrong Thing

**Duration:** 1:10 | **On-Screen Hook:** We'd rather blame TikTok than admit the truth about school.

```
PETER: The story that a lot of people wanna believe, which I do not believe. Is that what
accounted for getting worse is social media. The iPhone became increasingly popular. Kids
were kids, had smartphones. They were on smartphones a lot. And it's very tempting for
adults to look at kids on smartphones and say, oh, they're addicted to it. Or, this is
why they're not getting together in person is because they're spending all their time on
smartphones.

This whole story that has been around for a while is not supported by science. Uh, the
scientific research does not support this story. There have been actually literally
hundreds of studies looking at correlation between smartphone use, social media use, and
mental, uh, health among young people, uh, which all in all show no, no meaningful
correlation.

So we, as a culture, we would far rather blame social media than blame school. School
has a halo around it.
```

**Platform:** YouTube, LinkedIn

**Best for:** Contrarian + shareable

## CLIP SELECTION GUIDELINES

**Choose 3 clips that:**
✅ Have distinct emotional angles (not repetitive)
✅ Tell complementary stories (together they build a case)
✅ Are 1:00-1:30 in duration (long enough to feel complete, short enough to hold attention)
✅ Have clear beginning, middle, end (narrative arc)
✅ Stand alone compelling (work without context from full episode)
✅ Feature compelling on-screen hooks (2-4 words max)
✅ Appeal to target audience (homeschool parents)
✅ Feature direct quotes, not summaries (verbatim only)

---

## QUALITY GATES FOR CHECKPOINT 2

Before moving to Checkpoint 3, verify:

✅ **Cold Open Quality:**
- ✓ Stranger: Opens with surprise/contradiction
- ✓ Itch: Creates curiosity that demands answer
- ✓ Stakes: Makes listener care about the outcome
- ✓ Tease: Ends with unresolved question (doesn't answer it)

✅ **Cold Open Technical:**
- ✓ Duration: 22-35 seconds
- ✓ All clips verbatim (no paraphrasing)

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ Cold open that resolves the tension (always cut before the answer)
❌ Paraphrased quotes (must be verbatim)
❌ Clips that don't work standalone (need context from episode)
❌ On-screen text longer than 4 words (not readable on mobile)
❌ On-screen text that repeats what the video already shows (redundant)
❌ All clips making the same point (should have distinct angles)
❌ Cold open longer than 35 seconds (loses audience)
❌ Missing platform recommendations (social team needs to know best use)
