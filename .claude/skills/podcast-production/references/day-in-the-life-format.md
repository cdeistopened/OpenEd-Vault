# Day-in-the-Life Blog Post Format

## Overview

A Day-in-the-Life post shows how a specific homeschool family structures their learning, with enough detail that readers can visualize themselves doing it. It's part memoir, part practical guide, and ends with a concrete inventory of tools and resources.

## Structure

### 1. Opening Hook + Philosophy Statement
- Start with something counterintuitive or specific about their approach
- State the educational philosophy in 1-2 sentences
- Example: "Our school day doesn't start until 10:00 AM. We spend weeks studying 'Pet Adoption' or 'Bigfoot.' This isn't a compromise. It's Open Education—and it's completely intentional."

### 2. The "Controversial" Choice Section
- Address the thing that would raise eyebrows in traditional schooling
- Explain why they chose it and what they were escaping
- Frame it as intentional, not lazy
- Example: Late starts, no grades, screen time, unschooling elements, etc.

### 3. The Core Approach (Their "Secret Weapon")
- What makes their homeschool unique
- Specific methodology or curriculum philosophy
- Include concrete examples with names, tools, and anecdotes
- Show flexibility and pivots

### 4. The Tech Stack / Village Section
- What they can't or won't teach themselves
- How OpenEd funding enables this
- List of specific tools, classes, and outside resources
- The "village" of people who help

### 5. The "Master Plan + Life Happens" Section
- How they plan the year/week
- A specific example of when they threw out the plan
- Frame flexibility as feature, not bug

### 6. Closing Line
- Return to the philosophy
- Something memorable and quotable

### 7. Inventory Section
- Organized by category (Planning, Core Curriculum, Enrichment, etc.)
- Each item includes: Name, link, brief description, how they use it
- Mention what's OpenEd reimbursable where relevant

## What Makes It Work

1. **Specificity**: Real names of curricula, real times, real anecdotes
2. **Permission**: Validates choices that might feel "wrong" in traditional schooling
3. **Practicality**: Readers can implement pieces immediately
4. **Personality**: The family's unique voice and values come through
5. **Inventory**: Concrete takeaways they can shop/research
