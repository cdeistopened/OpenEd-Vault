## How to Use These References

### Before You Write
1. Read the full SKILL.md to understand the workflow
2. Read one of the example blog posts all the way through
3. For that example, read the "Study Guide" section at the end
4. Identify the patterns they follow

### While You Write
5. Keep `ela-voice-guidelines.md` open
6. After each section, read it aloud
7. Check: Does this sound like Ela?
8. Review the header strategy against SEO guidelines in SKILL.md

### Before You Submit
9. Compare your structure against the examples
10. Check that you've followed the 3-phase workflow
11. Verify headers are specific to homeschooling challenges
12. Confirm the guest is introduced naturally in the opening
13. Audit quote usage: Is each verbatim quote necessary?

## Quick Reference: The 5 Core Principles

### 1. One Angle, Explored Deeply
Not a summary of everything. One counterintuitive insight with a clear narrative spine.

### 2. Guest Introduced Early and Naturally
Not a separate bio section. Woven into the story: "Here's who this is, here's why they're credible, here's what they noticed."

### 3. SEO Headers Specific to Homeschooling
Not: "Understanding Motivation"
Instead: "Why Homeschooling Parents Should Rethink How They Grade Child-Led Learning"

### 4. Mostly Paraphrased, Strategic Quotes
20% verbatim quotes (for vivid, surprising, specific lines that can't be paraphrased)
80% paraphrased and contextualized

### 5. Narrative Structure with Personal Story
Abstract idea → Guest's story → Why it matters → What to do instead

## Common Questions

**Q: How long should the blog post be?**
A: 1,100-1,200 words (body content, not including header or bio)

**Q: Should I cover everything from the episode?**
A: No. Pick one angle and go deep. Readers should want to listen to the full episode.

**Q: How many direct quotes should I use?**
A: 3-5 per post. Use them for vivid, surprising, or specific lines only.

**Q: How do I decide which angle to pursue?**
A: Pick the most counterintuitive idea that's most helpful for homeschooling parents and supported by a guest story.

**Q: What if the guest didn't tell a personal story?**
A: Use a specific example they discussed as the narrative spine. Or focus on the paradox they're highlighting.

**Q: Should I mention the full podcast episode?**
A: Yes. Include a CTA to listen to the full conversation at the end.

## The Brenna Clarke Gray Blog Post as Example

The blog post you just read (`Brenna_Clarke_Gray_Blog_Post.md`) is the test case for this skill.

It demonstrates:
- Introducing Brenna naturally in the opening (educator + researcher + parent)
- One clear angle (how grading passion kills motivation)
- SEO headers specific to homeschooling:
  - "Why Homeschooling Parents Should Rethink How They Grade Child-Led Learning"
  - "How External Standards Kill Child-Led Interests in Homeschool"
  - "How Unstructured Time and Boredom Actually Build Lifelong Learners"
  - "Stop Forcing the Homeschool Timeline: Why Learning Doesn't Follow Your Schedule"
- Strategic quote usage (the Etsy effect, intrinsic motivation definition, etc.)
- Personal story as spine (son's mythology obsession, grading kills it)
- Practical alternatives (protect the space, provide access not direction, etc.)
- Proper closing with links to Brenna's work

Use this as a reference for what a finished blog post looks like.

## Integration with Podcast Production Workflow

This skill is part of the broader podcast production workflow:

1. **Phase 1:** Create and polish transcript (transcript-polisher skill)
2. **Phase 2:** Create cold opens, clips, titles, thumbnails (podcast-production skill)
3. **Phase 3:** Create YouTube & social assets (podcast-production skill)
4. **Phase 4 (NEW):** Create blog post (THIS SKILL)

Use the blog post to:
- Drive SEO traffic to the episode
- Give guests a written resource to share
- Create a permanent, searchable record of the episode
- Build authority in specific topic areas
