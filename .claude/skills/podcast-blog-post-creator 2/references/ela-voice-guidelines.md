# Ela Richmond's Voice & Tone Guidelines

This document captures the distinctive voice that makes OpenEd blog posts resonate with the audience. Ela's style combines personal authenticity, intellectual rigor, and genuine curiosity about her guests' ideas.

## Core Voice Characteristics

### 1. **Conversational, Not Academic**

**Avoid:** "The phenomenon of extrinsic motivation replacing intrinsic motivation suggests a fundamental restructuring of the child's relationship to autonomous learning."

**Instead:** "The moment you add a grade to something your kid loves, something shifts. They're no longer learning for themselves."

**Why it works:** The reader feels like Ela is talking *to* them, not *at* them. It's accessible without being dumbed down.

### 2. **Curious, Not Didactic**

Ela doesn't position herself as the expert telling readers what to think. She positions herself as someone who learned something surprising and wants to share that discovery.

**Avoid:** "Parents must understand that intrinsic motivation is superior to extrinsic motivation."

**Instead:** "I've been thinking about that observation since our conversation ended. The idea that good intentions can backfire in this specific way."

**Why it works:** Readers feel like co-explorers, not students. They're more likely to be persuaded by "I discovered this" than "you need to know this."

### 3. **Specific, Not Generic**

Ela uses concrete details and vivid examples rather than abstract principles.

**Avoid:** "It's important to provide children with unstructured time."

**Instead:** "Brenna's son didn't develop an interest in mythology through a unit study. It emerged from a child with free time, access to books, and nothing else to do. He was three, just starting to read, and he had time to figure stuff out."

**Why it works:** Readers can visualize this. They can see their own children in the scenario. It's memorable.

### 4. **Vulnerable, Not Authoritative**

Ela admits when she doesn't know something, when she was wrong, when she's still figuring it out. This builds trust.

**Examples from Brenna post (implied):**
- She notices the paradox about good intentions backfiring
- She reflects on how easily this happens
- She acknowledges the tension between wanting to support and needing to step back

**Why it works:** Readers trust that this isn't ideology. It's genuine observation grounded in her own experience as a parent and educator.

### 5. **Narrative, Not Prescriptive**

Rather than saying "Here are the steps you should follow," Ela tells the guest's story and lets readers extract their own insights.

**Avoid:** "To preserve intrinsic motivation, follow these three steps..."

**Instead:** "Her breakthrough came when she realized something: her good intentions, her desire to scaffold and structure, had functioned as poison to what she was trying to nurture."

**Why it works:** Readers feel like they're discovering the insight themselves, not being told what to do.

## Voice Patterns to Emulate

### The Observational Opening
Ela often opens by noticing something unexpected or contradictory:

> "We've accepted a cultural script that says teenagers will inevitably pull away from their parents. Janae Daniels challenges that script."

> "When your child becomes obsessed with something—mythology, coding, ancient Egypt—your instinct as a parent is immediate: *Let me support this.* Make it part of their curriculum. Turn it into a learning opportunity. Structure it. Grade it."

**Pattern:** Assumption → Guest's Counter-Observation → Your Discovery

### The Personal Connection
Before explaining why something matters, Ela shows why *she* found it interesting:

> "I've been thinking about that number since Ben and I spoke."

> "I'd always been intimidated by the idea of homeschooling because I pictured myself standing at a whiteboard, personally teaching every subject, forever."

**Pattern:** "I noticed..." or "I realized..." or "I've been thinking about..."

### The Vivid Metaphor
When a guest provides a metaphor that captures an abstract idea, Ela uses it repeatedly:

Brenna's "Etsy effect" → "Everybody who's good at a craft, then opens an Etsy store and hates that craft."

Janae's "Piano Tuner" moment → The turning point where learning suddenly came alive

**Pattern:** Introduce metaphor → Use it to explain principle → Return to it in closing

### The Surprising Fact
When a guest shares a statistic or finding that contradicts assumptions, lead with it:

> "At Synthesis School, they spent roughly $10 million a year on educational content. They hired the best game designers. They built complex team simulation games. And you know what turned out to be the number one predictor of whether a kid stuck around? Whether they had a friend in their class."

**Pattern:** Setup (high stakes) → Expectation (obviously X matters most) → Subversion (actually Y matters)

### The Question That Reveals Insight
Sometimes Ela asks a genuine question (not rhetorical) to invite the reader into thinking alongside her:

> "What's one thing you loved before you had to monetize it, grade it, or prove you were competent at it?"

**Pattern:** Question + Long pause → Guest's answer → Readers' own reflection

## Tone Shifts & When to Use Them

### 1. **Serious/Somber** (For stakes)
Used when describing a problem or consequence:

> "That's when it hit her. This was learning. Not the forced compliance she had been trying to replicate, but a genuine fire of curiosity sparked by a real-world expert."

**When:** Describing what's at stake or what's being lost

### 2. **Warm/Affirming** (For connection)
Used when talking about parents or children doing their best:

> "She didn't do anything wrong. She was being a good parent, trying to support his interests, trying to create learning opportunities."

**When:** Acknowledging that good intentions led to unexpected consequences

### 3. **Playful/Wry** (For absurdity)
Used when acknowledging something that's obviously true but we all pretend not to notice:

> "Of course homeschooling is becoming high-status in San Francisco. Of course the city known for tech wealth and optimization culture has turned alternative education into a status symbol."

**When:** Observing cultural ironies or contradictions

### 4. **Reflective/Thoughtful** (For implication)
Used when pulling back to see the bigger picture:

> "The irony is profound: in trying to formalize and structure a child's interest, we crush the very thing that made the interest worth supporting in the first place."

**When:** Ending a section or moving toward the deeper insight

### Punctuation for Voice

Ela uses em-dashes, italics, and line breaks to create rhythm and emphasis:

> "The moment it becomes a school project, even a *supported* school project, even a school project about something they love—the mechanism shifts."

> "And the brain, quite reasonably, checks out."

> "That's when it hit her. This was learning."

**Use em-dashes** to show a thought expanding or shifting

**Use italics** to emphasize key concepts or phrases the guest provided

**Use short sentences** for impact and emphasis

**Use line breaks** to create pauses for reader reflection

## What to Avoid

### ❌ Academic Jargon
Avoid: "The neuroplastic potential of the adolescent brain"
Use: "Middle school kids' brains are as thirsty for information as toddlers"

### ❌ Abstract Principles
Avoid: "Autonomy is a fundamental human need"
Use: "My kid doesn't want to do school projects about mythology just because he loves it"

### ❌ Prescriptive Language
Avoid: "Parents should create unstructured time"
Use: "What Brenna found was that the best thing she could do was get out of the way"

### ❌ Hedging Language
Avoid: "It could be argued that..." or "Some might say..."
Use: "This is how you kill what made the learning beautiful"

### ❌ "So" as a Connector
Avoid starting sentences with "So" (too conversational/casual)
Use: "And that's why..." or "This is why..." or "Here's what this means..."

### ❌ Rhetorical Questions
Avoid: "Isn't it obvious that grades kill motivation?"
Use: "Grades kill motivation. Here's why."

## Reading Aloud Test

The best way to check if your voice matches Ela's: **Read it aloud.**

Does it sound like:
- A person talking to another person? ✅
- Or someone reading from a script? ❌

Does it have:
- Natural pauses and breath breaks? ✅
- Or long, complex sentences? ❌

Would you:
- Continue listening if this were a podcast? ✅
- Or want to skip ahead? ❌

If it passes the "read aloud" test, it's probably Ela's voice.

## The Underlying Philosophy

Ela's voice works because it follows one core principle: **good writing is a transfer of energy.**

She's genuinely curious about her guest's ideas. She's genuinely interested in how this relates to her readers' lives. She's genuinely willing to revise her thinking based on what she learns. And that genuine curiosity, interest, and openness transfers to the reader.

Write like you're talking to a friend who you respect, about an idea that genuinely changed how you think about something. That's Ela's voice.
