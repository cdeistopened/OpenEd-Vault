# Example Blog Posts: Analyzing the Style & Structure

These examples demonstrate the voice, structure, and narrative approach used in OpenEd podcast blog posts. Study these to understand how to weave expertise with storytelling, how to introduce guests naturally, and how to use SEO-optimized headers while maintaining Ela's conversational tone.

## Example 1: "Why Middle School Matters"

**Guest:** Jean Eddy, Executive Chair of American Student Assistance

### Key Structural Elements

**Opening Hook (The Setup)**
> "Middle school kids have brains that are as thirsty, as willing to take in information as toddlers." Jean Eddy, Executive Chair of American Student Assistance, isn't making this up.

- Opens with a surprising quote
- Immediately introduces guest with credentials
- Grounds the claim: "She's talked to faculty at UVA and NYU, read the research..."
- Establishes credibility before diving into ideas

**Primary Angle**
The window of neuroplasticity during ages 11-14 is being wasted by school structures that prioritize pressure over exploration.

**Header Strategy: SEO + Narrative**
- "School Kills What Middle School Brains Need Most" (specific, problem-focused)
- "The College Obsession Wastes the Window" (stakes + problem)
- "How to Use the Window Before It Closes" (solution-focused)

Each header is specific to what parents/educators are actually searching for, while advancing the narrative.

**Quote Usage**
Verbatim quotes are used for:
- Surprising claims that stand alone: "A young person who was like 13 years old is not totally wedded to what his friends say. But wait until he's 15 and the story changes."
- Vivid descriptions: "Girls who thought they hated science end up mentoring other students, connecting with NASA scientists, building mock space stations."
- Policy observations: "Parents feel as though if they don't get their kids to college that they've failed."

Most of the piece paraphrases, providing context and explanation around the quotes.

**Practical Solutions**
Instead of generic advice, specific tools are mentioned:
- "ASA offers free digital tools like Futurescape where kids explore careers through games and assessments."
- "The simplest tool costs nothing: genuine curiosity about what makes your child come alive."
- "Try asking: 'What excited you today?' instead of 'How was school?'"

**Closing**
Ends with the guest's reflection on the long view: "Trust me when I say that level of interest pays out, it always pays out."

Then links to their organization and tools.

## Example 2: "We Cannot Parent Children Whose Heart We Don't Have"

**Guest:** Janae Daniels (School to Homeschool podcast)

### Key Structural Elements

**Opening Hook (The Paradox)**
Opens with cultural assumption, then immediately challenges it:
> "We've accepted a cultural script that says teenagers will inevitably pull away from their parents."
>
> Janae Daniels challenges that script.

Guest introduction is embedded in the narrative:
> "Janae is not the person you'd expect to deliver this message. She's not a lifelong, crunchy homeschooler. She was a K-12 licensed public school teacher, a fierce advocate for the system. Now, she hosts the popular podcast and YouTube channel, School to Homeschool."

Notice: Credentials establish surprise/credibility. Shows she's not ideologically biased, which makes her critique more powerful.

**Narrative Spine: The Personal Story**
Rather than abstract education theory, the piece unfolds through Janae's own journey:
1. She was a public school teacher
2. COVID hit
3. A moment in church (the "divine intervention")
4. First day of homeschool was a disaster
5. The piano tuner arrives—the turning point
6. She discovers Neufeld's work
7. Everything changes

This story structure makes abstract concepts memorable.

**Key Quote Early**
The title itself IS the pull-quote: "We cannot parent children whose heart we don't have."

This becomes the spine of the piece. Everything builds toward understanding what this means.

**Weaving Theory with Story**
Janae discovers Neufeld's concept of "peer-orientation" and the piece breaks it down:
- The natural order (parent-led)
- How school broke the model
- How peers filled the void
- The result: a generation adrift

But each point is illustrated with Janae's specific story and observations, not abstract theory.

**Headers with Narrative Logic**
- "The Piano Tuner to the Rescue" (specific, story-based)
- "Reclaiming Your Child's Heart" (emotional, solution-focused)
- "The Natural Order is Parent-Led" (principle-based, then explained)

Notice these don't just present information—they advance the story.

**Vulnerability**
The author (Ela) admits her own fear:
> "I'd always been intimidated by the idea because I pictured myself standing at a whiteboard, personally teaching every subject, forever."

This creates connection with readers. It's not "here's an expert telling you what to do." It's "I was scared too, and here's what I learned."

**Practical Reframing**
The biggest insight isn't a new principle—it's a reframe:
> "You're not supposed to be the teacher of everything. You're the education designer."

This single reframe opens up possibility. Suddenly it's not about doing everything yourself; it's about thoughtfully assembling resources and support.

## Example 3: "When Medication Becomes the Default"

**Guest:** Ben Somers (Recess platform)

### Key Structural Elements

**Opening with Specific Detail**
> "Ben Somers was 11 when they put him on methamphetamines. Not street meth, obviously—the prescription kind. Concerta. Seventy milligrams of it, to be exact, for a kid who weighed about 100 pounds."

This specific detail (70mg for 100lb child, specific drug name) makes it immediately real, not abstract. Readers can visualize this.

**The Crime**
> "His crime? He was a foot tapper. A wiggler."

Reframe what seems like ADHD diagnosis as actually just "being an 11-year-old boy." This simple perspective shift is the whole insight.

**Early Guest Introduction**
Shows Ben's journey, not just his credentials:
- He was medicated at 11
- He dropped out of high school
- He worked in ed-tech
- He now runs Recess
- The platform is his answer to what he needed

This arc makes his authority clear without needing a credentials list.

**The Shocking Statistic**
> "In his town that year, almost a quarter of all the boys were on stimulants."

This one number grounds the problem in a specific place and becomes the jumping-off point for the bigger conversation.

**The $10 Million Lesson**
The post pivots to research with a specific finding:
> "The number one predictor of whether a kid stuck around and actually learned anything? Whether they had a friend in their class."

Then lists what didn't matter:
- Teacher credentials
- Quality of games
- Curriculum

This is powerful because it's specific research finding presented as a surprising discovery, not generic advice.

**The Reframe**
> "You're not the teacher of everything. You're the education designer."

Same as Janae's story, but this time it comes from Ben and lands in a different way because of the context.

**Addressing the Elephant: Privilege**
The author doesn't shy away from the reality:
> "I'm self-aware enough to recognize that this can sound—and in some cases, is—deeply elitist. Not every family has the flexibility to reorganize their lives around their children's education."

But then offers a counter-insight:
> "The real privilege isn't being able to do it all yourself. The real privilege is recognizing that you don't have to."

This honesty strengthens credibility.

**Practical Example**
Shows HOW the Recess platform works:
- Kids browse classes
- They request what interests them
- Parent approves/denies
- Kid joins with peers who chose the same thing
- The platform suggests friendships
- Trends emerge naturally through real interest

This concrete example makes the abstract concept tangible.

**Full Circle Ending**
> "Ben was medicated at 11 to fit the system. Now he's building platforms where the system fits the child. That's not a revolution. It's just common sense."

Returns to the opening image, shows how Ben transformed his experience into a solution.

## Patterns Across All Examples

### 1. **Guest Introduction is Embedded, Not Separate**
- Not "Meet Jane Doe, who is X"
- But "Jane Doe noticed something. She has spent 20 years studying this. Here's what she's found..."
- Introduction is woven into the narrative, not separate from it

### 2. **The Angle is Narrow and Deep**
- Not "here's everything this episode covers"
- But "here's one insight that changes how you think about [topic]"
- All supporting material connects back to that one angle

### 3. **Personal Story is the Spine**
- Concept → Guest's Story → Why It Matters → What to Do Instead
- Abstract ideas are grounded in specific, lived experience

### 4. **Quotes are Preserved for Impact**
- When something is vivid, surprising, or specific, quote it directly
- When it's explanatory or context, paraphrase
- Roughly 20% direct quotes, 80% paraphrased

### 5. **Headers are Specific and Searchable**
- Not "Education Philosophy" but "Why Middle School Matters"
- Not "Mental Health" but "When Good Parenting Backfires"
- Headers answer a question or promise an insight that a parent would search for

### 6. **The Practical Path is Concrete**
- Not "create learning environments"
- But "ask 'what excited you?' instead of 'how was school?'"
- Not generic principles, but specific actions

### 7. **Vulnerability Creates Connection**
- Author (Ela) acknowledges her own struggles or assumptions
- "I was intimidated by this too..."
- "I didn't understand this until..."
- This makes readers trust the piece isn't preachy

### 8. **Full Circle Structure**
- Opens with an image or question
- Explores through guest's story
- Returns to that opening image with new understanding

## Study Guide

When preparing to write a blog post:

1. **Read one of these examples** all the way through
2. **Identify the primary angle** - What is the single insight?
3. **Find the narrative spine** - What story does the guest tell that illustrates this?
4. **Locate the verbatim quotes** - Why did the author choose these specific quotes?
5. **Notice the header strategy** - Would a parent searching for this topic find these headers?
6. **Observe the paraphrasing** - How does the author explain concepts without quoting?
7. **Find the vulnerability** - Where does Ela admit her own uncertainty or growth?
8. **Check the ending** - How does it return to the opening while moving forward?

Apply these patterns to your own blog post.
