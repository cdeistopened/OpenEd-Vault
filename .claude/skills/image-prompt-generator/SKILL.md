# Image Prompt Generator

Generate professional, non-generic images using Nano Banana Pro (Gemini API).

## Workflow Overview

1. **Brainstorm Concepts** - Generate 4-6 high-level visual ideas
2. **Select Direction** - User picks the concept they like
3. **Optimize Prompt** - Refine into a strong, detailed prompt
4. **Style Variations** - Adapt to 2-3 different visual styles
5. **Generate Images** - Run via Gemini API

## Step 1: Brainstorm Concepts

When the user provides a topic or use case, generate 4-6 high-level visual concepts. Each concept should be:

- **One sentence** describing the visual idea
- **Concrete and immediate** - you can picture it instantly
- **Conceptual but not abstract** - a clear object/scene with meaning
- **Non-generic** - avoid cliches (no lightbulbs for ideas, no books for education)

**Format:**

```
1. **[Short label]** - One sentence description of the visual concept and why it works.

2. **[Short label]** - One sentence description...
```

**Example for "newsletter about self-directed learning":**

```
1. **Compass with crayon needle** - A compass where the needle is a crayon, suggesting direction comes from the learner's own hand.

2. **Path that branches into many paths** - A single dirt path splitting into dozens of colorful trails, each heading somewhere different.

3. **Empty frame on an easel** - A blank canvas on an easel in a field, suggesting the learner creates their own picture.

4. **Backpack with roots** - A school backpack sitting on grass, but roots are growing out the bottom into the soil - learning that plants itself.
```

Wait for user to select before proceeding.

## Step 2: Optimize the Prompt

Once the user selects a concept, develop it into a full prompt. Structure:

```
Create a [style type] illustration of [subject].

CONCEPT: [Expand the one-sentence idea into a clear visual description]

STYLE: [Artistic approach - load from references/styles/ if brand-specific]

COMPOSITION: [Framing, focal point, negative space, balance]

COLORS: [Palette - describe by name, not hex codes which may render as text]

TEXTURE: [Surface qualities, analog/digital feel]

AVOID: [What should NOT appear - be specific]

FORMAT: [Aspect ratio]
```

**Key principles:**
- Natural language, full sentences - no tag soup
- Describe colors by name (burnt orange, sky blue, near-black) not hex codes
- Maximum 2-3 elements - if it feels busy, remove something
- Favor metaphor over literal depiction

## Step 3: Style Variations

Adapt the optimized prompt to 2-3 different styles from `references/styles/`:

- **opened-editorial.md** - Conceptual, brand colors, editorial wit
- **minimalist-ink.md** - High-contrast black and white, crosshatching
- **watercolor-line.md** - Ink linework with watercolor washes, warm

Present all variations to user so they can choose which to generate, or generate all.

## Step 4: Generate via API

### Setup

The Gemini API key is stored in the vault root `.env` file. The script looks for `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

### Running the Script

```bash
# Load key from root .env and generate
export $(grep GEMINI_API_KEY "/path/to/OpenEd Vault/.env") && \
python scripts/generate_image.py "prompt here" --model pro --aspect 16:9

# Save to Generated_Images folder
python scripts/generate_image.py "prompt" --output "Content/Generated_Images" --name "my_image"
```

**Options:**
- `--model flash` (faster, cheaper) or `--model pro` (higher quality)
- `--aspect 16:9`, `1:1`, or `9:16` (aspect ratio config only works with pro model; for flash, include ratio in prompt text)
- `--variations N` - generate N versions
- `--output ./path` - save location
- `--name prefix` - filename prefix

**Output location:** Save images in the same folder as the content they belong to - not a generic images dump. For example, an unschooling article image goes in `Content/Open Education Hub/Unschooling/`, a podcast episode image goes alongside that episode's assets.

## Step 5: Iterate

After user reviews generated images:
- **80% good?** Request specific edits conversationally rather than regenerating
- **Composition off?** Adjust framing or element placement in prompt
- **Wrong style?** Try a different style reference
- **Too busy?** Simplify to fewer elements
- **Colors wrong?** Be more explicit about palette

## Prompting Principles

### Write Like a Creative Director

Brief the model like a human artist. Use proper grammar, full sentences, and descriptive adjectives.

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| "Cool car, neon, city, night, 8k" | "A cinematic wide shot of a futuristic sports car speeding through a rainy Tokyo street at night. The neon signs reflect off the wet pavement and the car's metallic chassis." |

**Be specific about:**
- **Subject:** Instead of "a woman," say "a sophisticated elderly woman wearing a vintage chanel-style suit"
- **Materiality:** Describe textures - "matte finish," "brushed steel," "soft velvet," "crumpled paper"
- **Setting:** Define location, time of day, weather
- **Lighting:** Specify mood and light source
- **Mood:** Emotional tone of the image

### Provide Context

Context helps the model make logical artistic decisions. Include the "why" or "for whom."

**Example:** "Create an image of a sandwich for a Brazilian high-end gourmet cookbook."
*(Model infers: professional plating, shallow depth of field, perfect lighting)*

### Keep It Simple

- One clear focal point
- Maximum 2-3 elements total
- Generous negative space
- If it feels busy, remove something

### Avoid the Generic

- No lightbulbs for "ideas"
- No stacks of books for "education"
- No happy children raising hands
- No glossy AI aesthetic

## Advanced Capabilities

### Text Rendering & Infographics

Put exact text in quotes. Specify style: "polished editorial," "technical diagram," or "hand-drawn whiteboard."

**Example prompts:**

```
Earnings Report Infographic:
"Generate a clean, modern infographic summarizing the key financial highlights from this earnings report. Include charts for 'Revenue Growth' and 'Net Income', and highlight the CEO's key quote in a stylized pull-quote box."
```

```
Whiteboard Summary:
"Summarize the concept of 'Transformer Neural Network Architecture' as a hand-drawn whiteboard diagram suitable for a university lecture. Use different colored markers for the Encoder and Decoder blocks, and include legible labels for 'Self-Attention' and 'Feed Forward'."
```

### Character Consistency & Thumbnails

Use reference images and state "Keep the person's facial features exactly the same as Image 1." Describe expression/action changes while maintaining identity.

**Example prompt:**

```
Viral Thumbnail:
"Design a viral video thumbnail using the person from Image 1.
Face Consistency: Keep the person's facial features exactly the same as Image 1, but change their expression to look excited and surprised.
Action: Pose the person on the left side, pointing their finger towards the right side of the frame.
Subject: On the right side, place a high-quality image of a delicious avocado toast.
Graphics: Add a bold yellow arrow connecting the person's finger to the toast.
Text: Overlay massive, pop-style text in the middle: 'Done in 3 mins!'. Use a thick white outline and drop shadow.
Background: A blurred, bright kitchen background. High saturation and contrast."
```

### Advanced Editing & Restoration

Use semantic instructions - no manual masking needed. Describe changes naturally.

**Example prompts:**

```
Object Removal:
"Remove the tourists from the background of this photo and fill the space with logical textures (cobblestones and storefronts) that match the surrounding environment."
```

```
Seasonal Control:
"Turn this scene into winter time. Keep the house architecture exactly the same, but add snow to the roof and yard, and change the lighting to a cold, overcast afternoon."
```

### Dimensional Translation (2D to 3D)

```
Floor Plan to Interior Design:
"Based on the uploaded 2D floor plan, generate a professional interior design presentation board in a single image.
Layout: A collage with one large main image at the top (wide-angle perspective of the living area), and three smaller images below (Master Bedroom, Home Office, and a 3D top-down floor plan).
Style: Apply a Modern Minimalist style with warm oak wood flooring and off-white walls across ALL images.
Quality: Photorealistic rendering, soft natural lighting."
```

### Storyboarding & Sequential Art

```
Commercial Storyboard:
"Create an addictively intriguing 9-part story with 9 images featuring a woman and man in an award-winning luxury luggage commercial. The story should have emotional highs and lows, ending on an elegant shot of the woman with the logo. The identity of the woman and man and their attire must stay consistent throughout but they can and should be seen from different angles and distances. Please generate images one at a time. Make sure every image is in a 16:9 landscape format."
```

### Structural Control & Layout

Upload sketches to define text/object placement. Use wireframes for UI mockups.

```
Sketch to Ad:
"Create an ad for a [product] following this sketch."
```

```
Sprite Sheet:
"Sprite sheet of a woman doing a backflip on a drone, 3x3 grid, sequence, frame by frame animation, square aspect ratio. Follow the structure of the attached reference image exactly."
```
