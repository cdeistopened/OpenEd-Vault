Greetings Eddies!

Quick question: when you picture homeschooling, what do you see?

If it's barefoot kids doing worksheets at the kitchen table while mom juggles a toddler, you're not alone. That's the stereotype.

Today's story is the opposite of that. It's a household that runs tighter than most schools I've visited.

Let's dive in.

## THE 7-TO-7 SCHOOLHOUSE

[Tamela Gill Davis](https://www.businessinsider.com/im-married-to-nfl-player-heres-why-homeschool-our-kids-2025-12) is married to Demario Davis, a linebacker for the New Orleans Saints. She has six kids, ages 1 to 12. She homeschools all of them.

Her setup: **school runs 7am to 7pm. The kids wear uniforms Monday through Thursday.** She hired a second teacher who works with the older kids while Tamela handles the younger ones, then they switch.

Why uniforms? "It's a way of teaching professional development," she says. "It's very important to show up in the world in a way that reflects who you are."

Before meeting her husband, Tamela was planning a career in education—teacher, principal, superintendent. That training now runs her home. She didn't stumble into homeschooling. She engineered it.

Even during football season, the family has dinner together four nights a week. The message to the kids is constant: **"We're the team."**

The freedom to homeschool isn't about having zero structure. It's about having the *right* structure.

## THE 250K QUESTION

[New York state lost](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2025/12/k-12-enrollment-falls-aging-nys-charter-schools-gain) a quarter-million K-12 students over the past decade. Almost 90% of districts shrank.

Where did they go?

**Charter school enrollment more than doubled**, now at 6.5% of students statewide. **Homeschooling doubled too**, to 1.8%. Private school ticked up slightly. New York City alone lost 187,000 students from traditional public schools—a 19% drop.

Cornell demographers say the big driver is demographic: "An aging population, people having fewer children, and at later ages."

But the shift in *how* remaining kids are educated is harder to explain away. Families aren't just having fewer kids. They're making different choices about where those kids learn.

## STRUCTURE AS A GAME

If your kid resists structure, [Habitica](https://habitica.com) might be the workaround.

It's a free app that turns tasks and routines into an RPG. Complete your math lesson? Earn gold. Finish your chores? Level up your character. Skip your responsibilities? Your avatar takes damage.

**Why it works for resistant kids:**
- Novelty — ADHD brains crave it, and Habitica delivers daily
- Visible progress — XP bars and achievements make effort tangible
- Social accountability — you can join parties where everyone's progress affects the group

The app was originally designed for adults struggling with productivity, but homeschool families have discovered it's perfect for kids who need external motivation baked into the system.

It won't replace parenting. But it might replace nagging.

**Cost:** Free (premium features available but not necessary)

That's all for today!
