Greetings Eddies!

Here's something that doesn't get said enough: homeschooling can go badly.

Not because the method is flawed. Not because parents aren't qualified. But because one critical ingredient is easy to miss—and when it's missing, kids feel it.

Let's dive in.

## TWO OUTCOMES

A [recent Connecticut story](https://www.governing.com/policy/connecticut-debates-adding-oversight-to-homeschooling) featured two adults reflecting on being homeschooled their entire lives. Their experiences couldn't be more different.

Annaliese Harper, 21, participated in co-ops, took classes with other families, and never felt she was missing out. Her assessment: **"The best education I could have imagined."**

Beau Triba, 24, was also homeschooled K-12. But his family's community controlled textbooks and limited outside interaction. He taught himself most subjects. His assessment: **"I have never felt more alone than I did while being homeschooled."**

Same method. Opposite outcomes.

The difference wasn't curriculum or parent qualifications. It was whether the community opened doors—or closed them. Annaliese's co-ops connected her to people outside her household. Beau's community kept the walls high.

Homeschooling isn't the variable. The kind of community is.

## THE 143% SURGE

[South Dakota just logged](https://yournews.com/2026/01/01/5820982/homeschool-enrollment-surges-across-south-dakota/) the highest homeschool growth rate in the nation over the past decade: **143%.**

The top reasons families cite: school environment concerns, academic quality, and the ability to tailor learning to each child.

The pandemic accelerated the trend—enrollment jumped 1,300 students in a single year—but the growth didn't reverse when schools reopened. Families who tried it kept going.

The pattern is national. Florida saw a 46% jump. Maine's numbers are up. New York lost 250,000 students from traditional public schools in a decade.

Something shifted. And it's not shifting back.

## THE ANTI-ISOLATION PLATFORM

If isolation is the risk, [Outschool](https://outschool.com) is the instant antidote.

It's a marketplace of live online classes taught by real teachers—over 140,000 classes on everything from Pokemon math to AP Chemistry to "How to Draw Anime Eyes." Kids show up on video, interact with peers, and build friendships around shared interests.

**Why it works for isolated families:**
- No geographic limits — your kid's people might be three states away
- Interest-driven — classes form around what kids actually care about
- Low commitment — try a one-time class before committing to anything recurring

The classes aren't free (typically $10-25/hour), but many state ESA programs cover them. And for families in rural areas or tight-knit communities that feel too tight, it's a pressure valve.

You don't have to move to find your kid's people. You just have to log on.

That's all for today!

P.S. If your kid has found their people through Outschool (or something like it), I'd love to hear about it. Hit reply.
