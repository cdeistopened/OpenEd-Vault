Greetings Eddies!

What does success look like for your kids?

It's a question worth revisiting. Because a lot of parents are answering it differently than they did five years ago.

Let's dive in.

## THE HAPPY QUESTION

I've been reading parent testimonials from states debating homeschool oversight. The reasons people give for leaving traditional school are the usual suspects—safety, flexibility, academic fit.

But one mom's reason stopped me cold.

When asked why she homeschools, she said: **"I want them to be happy—not Fortune 500."**

That's it. Not gifted programs. Not competitive admissions. Not optimization.

Just: I want them to be happy.

It sounds almost rebellious. We've been trained to think education is about maximizing outcomes—test scores, college acceptances, career trajectories. The whole system is built on the assumption that more credentials = better life.

But what if that assumption is wrong?

What if the goal isn't to produce Fortune 500 executives, but to raise people who actually like their lives? People who know what they're good at, what they care about, and how to spend their days well?

That's not lowering the bar. That's changing what the bar measures.

## THE 89% SHIFT

Here's a stat that should make universities nervous:

A [new survey from Penn Foster](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/economy/2025/12/24/college-or-training-ai-future/87898126007/) found that **89% of parents now say their child can build a successful long-term career without a four-year degree.**

89 percent.

Just a few years ago, 84% of these same parents assumed their child would pursue college. Now 37% say AI has changed that expectation.

And they're not just rethinking—they're redirecting:
- 50% are encouraging technical and digital skills
- 41% prefer apprenticeships or immediate workforce entry
- 22% are actively exploring certificates instead of degrees

The four-year degree isn't dying. But it's no longer the default. Parents are asking: what skills will actually matter? And they're finding answers that don't require $200K and four years.

The unbundling has begun.

## FREE MATH THAT WORKS

Speaking of skills that matter: let's talk about [Zearn](https://www.zearn.org/).

Zearn is a free digital math curriculum serving 1 in 4 elementary students in America. It combines video lessons with adaptive practice—and unlike most "educational" games, it's backed by serious research.

**The stat that got my attention:** A RAND study found students using Zearn gained the equivalent of **11 additional weeks of math learning per year.**

Eleven weeks. That's nearly three extra months of growth—for free.

**What makes it work:**
- Visual lessons with virtual manipulatives (not just worksheets)
- Adaptive practice that adjusts to each student
- Teacher/parent dashboard to track progress
- Aligned to major curricula, easy to integrate

The catch? There isn't one. As founder Shalinee Sharma puts it: "Teachers and families can access our full library for free."

If you've been hunting for a math solution that's rigorous, engaging, and doesn't cost a dime—this is it.

That's all for today!

P.S. "Happy, not Fortune 500." I can't stop thinking about it. What does success look like for your family? Hit reply—I read every response.
