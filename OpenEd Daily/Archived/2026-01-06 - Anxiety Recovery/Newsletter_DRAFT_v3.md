## THE GETTING BY TRAP

Lisa Jones wrote [a piece for HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alternative-educational-models-neurodivergent-kids_n_69332ad5e4b06a47b6d3db7a) that should make every parent uncomfortable.

Her 14-year-old daughter Maya has dyslexia, dyscalculia, and ADHD. On paper, she was "getting by." Report cards looked fine. No teacher raised concerns.

Meanwhile: daily nausea. Morning vomiting. Complete nervous system burnout before ninth grade.

The school system didn't identify any of it. Not once. Lisa had to chase diagnoses herself while Maya smiled and masked her way through each day.

The morning Lisa found her daughter pale and shaking on the bathroom floor - again - she made a call. They were done.

Maya now does first aid certification, barista training, and travels for real-world learning. The stomach aches stopped. She asks "what's next?" instead of dreading tomorrow.

The system works for some kids. It didn't work for hers. Lisa trusted her gut over the report card.

## 83% OF PARENTS AGREE

A [new poll from Mott Children's Hospital](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/29/most-parents-think-their-kids-mental-health-is-getting-worse.html) dropped this week: 83% of American parents believe kids' mental health is getting worse. 69% say physical health is declining too.

The top concerns? Social media and screen time.

This tracks with Jonathan Haidt's research in The Anxious Generation. Average teen screen time: 8-10 hours per day, not including school. "We have to roll that back if we want any hope for them to grow up healthy."

A [CDC study from 2025](https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2025/24_0537.htm) connected the dots: higher screen time correlates with depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, irregular sleep, and less physical activity.

Parents aren't imagining things. The data backs up what they're seeing at home.

## TOOL: CHOMPSAW

Speaking of getting kids off screens - [ChompSaw](https://chompshop.com/) is a kid-safe power tool for cutting cardboard. No blades, no spinning parts. Kids ages 5+ can build whatever they want from delivery boxes.

The founders ran a Kickstarter in 2023. Goal: $50,000. They hit it in 23 minutes. Final raise: over $1.1 million.

At $249, it's an investment. But one Amazon reviewer said their kid "used it for two hours on his first day and asks to use it everyday."

Cardboard is free. Screens are everywhere. Sometimes the antidote is just giving kids real tools and getting out of the way.
