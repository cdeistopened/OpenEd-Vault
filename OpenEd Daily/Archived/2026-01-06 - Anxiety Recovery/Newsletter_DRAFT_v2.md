**PREVIEW:** The system didn't flag any of it.

## THE GETTING BY TRAP

{We don't really care about who Lisa Jones is necessarily unless we actually have more context or details on who she is. Like you know a parent recently wrote in the Huffington Post something more like that}

Lisa Jones wrote [a piece for HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alternative-educational-models-neurodivergent-kids_n_69332ad5e4b06a47b6d3db7a) that should make every parent uncomfortable.

Her 14-year-old daughter Maya has dyslexia, dyscalculia, and ADHD. On paper, she was "getting by." Report cards looked fine. No teacher raised concerns.

Meanwhile: daily nausea. Morning vomiting. Complete nervous system burnout before ninth grade.

The school system didn't identify any of it.~~ Not once.~~ {This little thing I know you're trying to vary the sentence length but this is a bit much.} Lisa had to chase diagnoses herself while Maya smiled and masked her way through each day.

The morning Lisa found her daughter pale and shaking on the bathroom floor - again - she made a call. They were done.

Maya now does first aid certification, barista training, and travels for real-world learning. The stomach aches stopped. She asks "what's next?" instead of dreading tomorrow.

The system works for some kids. It didn't work for hers. Lisa trusted her gut over the report card. {I like this last paragraph but overall we need to shorten the whole thing}

## THE 8-YEAR EXPERIMENT

A kid started piano at eight. Mediocre. Switched to guitar. Mediocre. Ukulele. Back to piano. Eight years of showing up, paying for lessons, and not practicing.

Then at 16 he walked in and said: "I bought a bass."

Something clicked. He practiced hours daily. Found his thing.

Deborah Pratt runs a music school with 150+ students. She shared this story on [our podcast this week](https://opened.co/blog?type=podcast) and called it the Practice Paradox.

"If I had been on him about practicing, or if his parents had required practice to have lessons, he would never have reached this."

He needed music to exist in his life long enough for him to grow into it.

Most parents have patience backwards. Patient with actions (skipping practice), impatient with results (why aren't you better?). Flip it. Be impatient with actions - keep showing up. Be patient with results - it took this kid eight years.

## TOOL: HOFFMAN ACADEMY

If you're in the practice wars, [Hoffman Academy](https://www.hoffmanacademy.com/) came up repeatedly in our research. Video-based piano lessons that remove you as the enforcer.

One Reddit parent: "My daughter loves Hoffman Piano online... she is doing this willingly after lots of struggles."

Bonus reframe that actually works: stop calling it "practice." Call it "piano time." Small language shift, big difference in how kids receive it.

That's all for today!
