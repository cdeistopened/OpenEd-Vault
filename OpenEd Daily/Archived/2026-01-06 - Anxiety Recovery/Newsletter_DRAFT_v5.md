**SUBJECT:** Her report card looked fine. Her body was telling a different story.
**PREVIEW:** The system didn't flag any of it.

## THE GETTING BY TRAP

A parent [wrote in HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alternative-educational-models-neurodivergent-kids_n_69332ad5e4b06a47b6d3db7a) about her 14-year-old.

Dyslexia, dyscalculia, ADHD. On paper, she was "getting by." Report cards looked fine. Teachers never raised concerns.

Meanwhile: daily nausea. Morning vomiting. Nervous system burnout before ninth grade. The school didn't catch any of it.

She pulled her out. Now the kid does first aid certification, barista training, real-world learning. Stomach aches gone.

The system works for some kids. It didn't work for hers.

## 83% OF PARENTS AGREE

New [poll from Mott Children's Hospital](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/29/most-parents-think-their-kids-mental-health-is-getting-worse.html): 83% of American parents think kids' mental health is getting worse. 69% say physical health too.

Social media and screen time top the list.

Jonathan Haidt's been saying this for years. Average teen screen time is 8-10 hours a day, not including school. A [CDC study](https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2025/24_0537.htm) from 2025 connects the dots: more screens, more depression, more anxiety, worse sleep.

Parents aren't making this up.

## TOOL: CHOMPSAW

[ChompSaw](https://chompshop.com/) is a kid-safe power tool for cutting cardboard. No blades, no spinning parts. Ages 5+.

The Kickstarter goal was $50,000. They hit it in 23 minutes. Final raise: $1.1 million.

It's $249, which is real money. But cardboard is free, delivery boxes pile up, and kids actually want to use it. One Amazon reviewer: "used it for two hours on his first day and asks to use it everyday."

Real tools. Real materials. Kids figure it out.

That's all for today!
