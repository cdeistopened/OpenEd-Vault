Greetings Eddies!

Here's a pattern I keep noticing: the people most skeptical of homeschooling are often the ones who end up doing it best.

Today's story is a perfect example.

Let's dive in.

## THE EXPERT AT HOME

Melissa Barryman was an assistant principal and teacher in Alachua County, Florida. She never thought she would homeschool.

But when her oldest son needed more academic challenge in first grade, the school moved him up to second grade. Still not enough. So Melissa—the educator, the administrator, the person trained to believe the system works—[brought him home](https://www.wusf.org/education/2025-12-06/homeschooling-on-the-rise-across-florida-families-seeking-flexibility).

Now all three of her children are homeschooled.

Here's what struck me: Melissa didn't leave because she was anti-school. She left because she understood how schools work—and knew that some kids don't fit the mold.

Her oldest, now 12, is in his second year of dual enrollment at Santa Fe College. Both he and her youngest have autism. Her youngest also has dyslexia. At home, they do therapy during the school day. They've traveled to see the solar eclipse in Texas. They've done hands-on learning in Washington D.C.

"I love that learning can take place anywhere," Melissa says.

The irony isn't lost on me: sometimes the experts come home.

## FLORIDA'S 46%

Florida homeschooling is up **46% since 2020.**

That's 155,532 students learning at home in 2024—and the numbers keep climbing.

The reasons, [according to Pew research](https://www.wusf.org/education/2025-12-06/homeschooling-on-the-rise-across-florida-families-seeking-flexibility):
- 83% cite concerns about school environment (safety, drugs)
- 75% want to provide moral instruction
- 72% cite dissatisfaction with academic instruction
- 72% want to emphasize family life

The pandemic accelerated the trend, but it didn't create it. These concerns were simmering long before 2020. The pandemic just gave families permission to act on them.

And once they did, most didn't go back.

## FREE READING THAT WORKS

If you're teaching reading at home, you need to know about the [UFLI Foundations Toolkit](https://education.ufl.edu/ufli/resources/).

It's a comprehensive phonics curriculum from the University of Florida Literacy Institute—and it's **completely free.**

**What you get:**
- 138 scripted lessons (no guessing what to say)
- 8-step routines that build consistency
- Coverage of 128 essential phonics skills
- Research-backed methodology from reading scientists

The scripted format is key. You don't need to be a reading specialist. You just follow the lesson. The scripts tell you exactly what to say, what to show, and how to correct mistakes.

**Who it's for:**
- Parents teaching early reading (ages 4-7 typically)
- Kids who need phonics intervention
- Anyone who wants a systematic approach without the price tag

Most comparable programs cost $200-500. UFLI costs nothing.

The University of Florida built one of the best early reading programs in the country—then gave it away. If you're teaching reading, start here.

That's all for today!

P.S. Have you used UFLI or another scripted phonics program? I'd love to hear how it's working. Hit reply.
