## THE RESEARCH ISN'T NEW

[Spaced repetition](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10229024/). Retrieval practice. Deliberate practice. This stuff has been studied since the 1900s. Not controversial. Just... not how schools are set up.

[Justin Skycak](https://www.justinmath.com/maximizing-learning-vs-other-things/) makes an interesting point: many educators don't actually disagree that testing works. They just don't think maximizing learning is the main goal. His argument - schools are also trying to be fun, low-friction, high-engagement. Testing is none of those things. So it gets deprioritized.

Whether that trade-off is reasonable depends on what you think school is for. But the research itself? Settled for decades.

## 80% BETTER RETENTION

Here's what the data shows: students who test themselves [retain up to 80% more](https://zipdo.co/learning-retention-statistics/) than those who just re-read material. One of the most replicated findings in cognitive psychology.

The classic study: [Roediger and Karpicke](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395691861) had students either study material four times, or study once and test three times. The testers retained more. Across time. Across subjects.

[Corral and Carpenter](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395691861) confirmed it again in 2025 - practice tests boost both retention and transfer to new problems.

Without reinforcement, [70% of learned information](https://zipdo.co/learning-retention-statistics/) is gone within 24 hours. That's not a bug in your kid's brain. That's how memory works.

## WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE ACTUALLY BUILDS IT

[Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/how-our-ai-works) is what you get when someone takes the research seriously. Spaced repetition, adaptive diagnostics, knowledge graphs. The founder? That same Justin Skycak.

The clever part: [Fractional Implicit Repetition](https://www.mathacademy.com/how-our-ai-works). Traditional flashcard apps treat every topic as independent. But math is hierarchical. Practicing algebra implicitly reviews arithmetic. Their system tracks this, reducing total review time.

It's $49/month. Not cheap. [Some users love it](https://jonathanwhitmore.com/posts/2024-09-10-MathAcademy-after-2000-points/) for building genuine fluency. Others want more conceptual explanation than it provides.

Worth noting: the fact that this exists as a separate product - outside the school system - tells you something.

That's all for today!
