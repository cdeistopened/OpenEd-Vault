## Recommendations:

**Top 3:**

1. **"THE 80% RETENTION HACK"** - Specific, actionable, implies there's a trick
2. **"TESTING BEATS STUDYING"** - Simple, direct, controversial (people think studying is "better")
3. **"61% VS 40%: ONE WEEK LATER"** - Uses the study's actual numbers, creates intrigue

**My pick:** #2 "TESTING BEATS STUDYING"

It's the clearest articulation of the finding, and it's counterintuitive enough to hook readers. Also parallels the structure of "TESTING BACKWARDS" and "BUILT DIFFERENT" - all two-word + verb constructions.

**Alternative if you want more specific:** #1 "THE 80% RETENTION HACK"
