**SUBJECT:** Schools Banned the Wrong Kind of Testing
**PREVIEW:** The testing crisis isn't too many tests. It's testing for the wrong things. Here's what actually works (and why schools won't touch it).

## SCHOOLS BANNED THE WRONG KIND OF TESTING

American schools are drowning in standardized tests, state assessments and, benchmark exams. Practice tests for the real tests. Testing has become synonymous with accountability theater—measuring schools, not helping students learn.

As a result "testing" has became a dirty word. [Justin Skycak](https://www.justinmath.com/maximizing-learning-vs-other-things/), who leads curriculum development at Math Academy, explains: "Testing" and "repetition" have become dirty words in education—yet practice testing and distributed practice are "widely understood by researchers to be two of the most effective practice techniques."

But here's what got thrown out with the bathwater: **self-testing**. The kind where students quiz themselves to pull information from memory. Not for a grade. Not for a metric. Just to learn.

Schools overindex on external testing (prove something to the state) and underindex on self-testing (actually learn the material). 

We're not talking about filling in bubbles for some accountability metric. We're talking about retrieval practice—the act of recalling information from memory, which forces your brain to strengthen the neural pathways that store that information.



The result? Students do the mathematical equivalent of playing kickball during class, then are expected to do backflips by year-end. When they can't, we blame the students—or we blame testing itself. But we're testing for the wrong things.

The irony: if schools used the type of testing that actually builds learning, students would ace the accountability tests without even trying.

## THE 80% BOOST THEY'RE IGNORING

Students who test themselves retain [up to 80% more](https://zipdo.co/learning-retention-statistics/) than those who just re-read material. This finding has been replicated across decades and disciplines.

The classic study: researchers gave students material to learn. Some studied it four times. Others studied once and tested themselves three times. The students who tested more retained more—across time, across subjects.

[Recent research from 2025](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395691861) confirmed it again. Practice tests don't just boost retention. They help students transfer what they learn to new problems.

Without reinforcement, about [70% of learned information](https://zipdo.co/learning-retention-statistics/) disappears within 24 hours. That's how memory works.

This research has existed since the early 1900s. Teachers know it exists. Schools choose not to use it.

Why? Because it doesn't optimize for what schools actually optimize for: engagement, compliance, entertainment. Effective learning techniques often feel repetitive or boring, so they get dropped in favor of approaches that keep students, parents, and administrators happy.

Whether that tradeoff makes sense depends on what you think school is for.

## WHEN SOMEONE ACTUALLY BUILDS ON THE RESEARCH

[Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/how-our-ai-works) is what you get when you build a platform around cognitive science instead of engagement metrics.

It uses spaced repetition, adaptive diagnostics, and knowledge graphs. The interesting innovation is called Fractional Implicit Repetition.

Traditional flashcard apps treat every topic as independent. Math doesn't work that way. When you practice algebra, you're implicitly practicing arithmetic. Math Academy tracks these relationships and reduces total review time by not redundantly quizzing you on foundations you're already reinforcing through advanced work.

[Some users](https://jonathanwhitmore.com/posts/2024-09-10-MathAcademy-after-2000-points/) report building genuine fluency through repetition. Others wish it had more conceptual explanation. At $49/month, it's not cheap—but it's built on research that actually works.

The fact that this exists as a separate product, outside the school system, says something.

That's all for today!
