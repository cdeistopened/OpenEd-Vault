**SUBJECT:** Why Schools Resist What Actually Works
**PREVIEW:** Testing and repetition have been proven effective since the 1900s. Schools still won't use them. Here's why—and what you can do about it.

## THE RESEARCH EVERYONE IGNORES

Spaced repetition. Retrieval practice. Deliberate practice. 

These techniques have been studied and replicated since the early 1900s. Researchers have proven they work. Teachers know the research exists. Schools choose not to use them anyway.

[Justin Skycak](https://www.justinmath.com/maximizing-learning-vs-other-things/), who leads curriculum development at Math Academy, explains the disconnect: "Testing" and "repetition" have become dirty words in education—yet practice testing and distributed practice are "widely understood by researchers to be two of the most effective practice techniques."

The debates about these methods aren't scientific. They're philosophical. 

Many educators simply don't agree that maximizing learning should be the main goal. Students want school to be fun and entertaining. Teachers face pressure to use "easy, fun, low-accountability" approaches that keep students, parents, and administrators happy. Effective learning techniques often feel punitive or boring, so they get dropped.

Skycak's point: schools optimize for multiple things—engagement, compliance, entertainment. Learning competes with all of them.

Whether that tradeoff makes sense depends on what you think school is for.

## WHAT THE DATA ACTUALLY SHOWS

Students who test themselves retain [up to 80% more](https://zipdo.co/learning-retention-statistics/) than those who just re-read material. This finding has been replicated across decades and disciplines.

In the classic study: researchers gave students material to learn. Some studied it four times. Others studied once and tested themselves three times. The students who tested more retained more—across time and subjects.

[Recent research from 2025](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395691861) confirmed it again. Practice tests don't just boost retention. They help students transfer what they learn to new problems.

Without reinforcement, about [70% of learned information](https://zipdo.co/learning-retention-statistics/) disappears within 24 hours. That's how memory works. The question is what you do about it.

## THE KICKBALL PROBLEM

Skycak uses a sports analogy that cuts to the heart of the issue:

Math is hierarchical—like sports or music. Advanced skills require fluency in simpler skills. Getting fluent takes lots of practice over time, and you have to keep practicing to maintain ability.

"When students do the mathematical equivalent of playing kickball during class, and then are expected to do the mathematical equivalent of a backflip at the end of the year, it's easy to see how struggle and general negative feelings can arise."

Nobody expects every gym student to do a backflip by year-end. But schools DO expect most students to master algebra, often calculus, sometimes higher. That expectation requires what Skycak calls "talent development"—the intentional, measured practice used in sports and music.

Most schools skip it. Students fall behind. Gaps compound. Eventually they give up on math entirely.

The research on how to prevent this has existed for a century. Schools know it exists. They choose not to use it.

## WHAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT

[Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/how-our-ai-works) is what you get when someone builds a platform around this research instead of around engagement metrics.

It uses spaced repetition, adaptive diagnostics, and knowledge graphs. The interesting innovation is called Fractional Implicit Repetition.

Traditional flashcard apps treat every topic as independent. Math doesn't work that way. When you practice algebra, you're implicitly practicing arithmetic. Math Academy tracks these relationships and reduces total review time by not redundantly quizzing you on foundations you're already reinforcing through advanced work.

[Some users](https://jonathanwhitmore.com/posts/2024-09-10-MathAcademy-after-2000-points/) report building genuine fluency through repetition. Others wish it had more conceptual explanation. At $49/month, it's not cheap—but it's built on research that actually works, not on what keeps engagement metrics up.

The fact that this exists as a separate product, outside the school system, tells you something about the system's priorities.

That's all for today!
