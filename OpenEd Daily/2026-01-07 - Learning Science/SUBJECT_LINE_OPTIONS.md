## Current:
**Testing: Good and Bad**

---

## Option Set A: Contrarian Angle
1. **We need more testing (not less)**
2. **The testing paradox**
3. **Schools test everything except learning**
4. **80% retention boost. Schools won't touch it.**
5. **Testing works. Schools banned it anyway.**

---

## Option Set B: Curiosity Gap
1. **The one kind of testing schools won't do**
2. **Why students forget 70% in 24 hours**
3. **The testing method schools refuse to use**
4. **What if schools tested the right way?**
5. **The research schools have ignored for 100 years**

---

## Option Set C: Direct/Specific
1. **Self-testing beats studying by 80%**
2. **Testing yourself > re-reading (80% better)**
3. **Study 4x or test 3x? The data is clear.**
4. **The difference between testing and self-testing**
5. **Practice tests work. Here's the proof.**

---

## Option Set D: Problem/Solution
1. **Your kid forgets everything. Here's why.**
2. **Why retention is terrible (and how to fix it)**
3. **Students forget 70% overnight. One fix works.**
4. **The memory problem schools won't solve**

---

## Option Set E: Statement + Proof
1. **Testing beats studying. Here's the study.**
2. **80% better retention (one simple change)**
3. **Self-testing: 80% boost, 100 years of proof**

## Recommendations:

**Top 3:**

1. **"The one kind of testing schools won't do"** - Creates curiosity gap, hints at paradox
2. **"Self-testing beats studying by 80%"** - Specific, actionable, data-driven
3. **"We need more testing (not less)"** - Most contrarian, will get opens from disagreement

**My pick:** #1 or #2

The current "Testing: Good and Bad" is clear but lacks punch. It tells rather than intrigues.
