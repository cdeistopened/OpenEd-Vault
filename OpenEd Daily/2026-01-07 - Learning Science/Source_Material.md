## Item 1: Justin Skycak on Why Educators Resist Effective Learning

**Type:** THOUGHT
**Source:** https://www.justinmath.com/maximizing-learning-vs-other-things/

**Key quotes:**
- "Lots of people in education disagree with the premise of maximizing learning."
- "Testing" and "repetition" have become dirty words in education - yet practice testing and distributed practice are "widely understood by researchers to be two of the most effective practice techniques."
- Disagreements about effective learning techniques stem not from scientific debate, but from fundamental disagreement about education's purpose.
- Many educators and students prioritize "fun, entertainment" and "easy, fun, low-accountability" approaches over actual learning.

**Angle notes:**
- Contrarian take: the research is clear, educators just don't want to hear it
- The gap between what works and what schools do
- "Testing" became a dirty word - but retrieval practice is one of the most effective techniques

## Item 2: The Testing Effect Research

**Type:** TREND
**Sources:**
- https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10229024/
- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395691861
- https://zipdo.co/learning-retention-statistics/

**Key data:**
- Testing improves retention by 80% vs passive review
- Students who actively recall retain twice as much as passive review
- 70% of learned info forgotten within 24 hours without reinforcement
- Retrieval practice boosts retention by up to 50% over passive review
- Corral and Carpenter (2025): practice tests foster both retention AND transfer

**Classic study (Roediger & Karpicke):**
- SSSS (study 4x) vs SSST (study 3x, test 1x) vs STTT (study 1x, test 3x)
- Students who tested more retained more over time
- "One of the most consistent findings in cognitive psychology"

**Angle notes:**
- The science is settled - testing works
- Schools moved away from testing for ideological reasons, not scientific ones
- This research has been replicated since the 1900s

## Item 3: Math Academy

**Type:** TOOL
**Source:** https://www.mathacademy.com/how-our-ai-works
**Related:** https://jonathanwhitmore.com/posts/2024-09-10-MathAcademy-after-2000-points/

**What it is:**
- AI-powered math learning platform built on learning science
- Created by Justin Skycak (same person from Item 1)
- Uses spaced repetition, knowledge graphs, adaptive diagnostics

**Key innovation - Fractional Implicit Repetition (FIRe):**
- Traditional spaced repetition treats topics as independent flashcards
- Math is hierarchical - practicing advanced topics implicitly reviews prerequisites
- E.g., multiplying 2-digit numbers implicitly practices 1-digit multiplication
- This reduces total review load while maintaining retention

**How it works:**
- Adaptive diagnostic identifies student's "knowledge frontier"
- System selects tasks at the boundary of what they know/don't know
- Spaced repetition consolidates into long-term memory

**User feedback:**
- Praised for building genuine fluency through repetition
- Some criticism: less conceptual explanation than textbooks
- $49/month - some debate about value vs free alternatives

**Angle notes:**
- This is what happens when someone actually builds on the research
- Not "AI" in the marketing sense - expert system based on learning science
- Connects directly to the Thought (Skycak built this because schools won't)

## Bundle Assessment

**Unifying theme:** The science of learning is clear. Schools ignore it. Here's what actually works.

**Orthogonality check:**
- THOUGHT: Why educators resist (philosophy/critique)
- TREND: The research itself (data/evidence)
- TOOL: Practical application (what to do about it)

These are related but not repetitive. Each serves a different function.
