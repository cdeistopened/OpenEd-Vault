## THE CENTURY-OLD SECRET

[Justin Skycak](https://www.justinmath.com/maximizing-learning-vs-other-things/) runs Math Academy, an online learning platform. He also writes about why schools don't use methods that actually work.

His argument: the techniques aren't new. Spaced repetition. Retrieval practice. Deliberate practice. Researchers have been studying this stuff since the 1900s. It's not controversial.

It's just not how schools are set up.

Skycak's point isn't that educators are villains. It's that maximizing learning isn't the only thing schools are trying to do. Maybe not even the main thing. They're also trying to be fun, low-friction, engaging. Testing is none of those. So it gets deprioritized.

The research is settled. The implementation isn't.

## 80% BETTER RETENTION

Here's what the data shows: students who [test themselves](https://zipdo.co/learning-retention-statistics/) retain up to 80% more than those who re-read material. One of the most replicated findings in cognitive psychology.

The classic study: [Roediger and Karpicke](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395691861) gave students material to learn. Some studied it four times. Others studied once, then tested themselves three times. The testers retained more - across time, across subjects.

[Confirmed again in 2025](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395691861). Practice tests boost both retention and transfer to new problems.

Without reinforcement, 70% of what you learn disappears within 24 hours. Not a flaw in your kid's brain. That's just how memory works.

## TOOL: MATH ACADEMY

[Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/how-our-ai-works) is what you get when someone actually builds on this research. Spaced repetition. Adaptive diagnostics. Knowledge graphs. The founder is that same Justin Skycak.

The clever part: something called Fractional Implicit Repetition. Traditional flashcard apps treat every topic as independent. But math is hierarchical - practicing algebra means you're also practicing arithmetic. Their system tracks this and reduces total review time.

It's $49/month. Not cheap. [Some users](https://jonathanwhitmore.com/posts/2024-09-10-MathAcademy-after-2000-points/) love it for building real fluency. Others want more conceptual explanation than it provides.

The fact that this had to be built as a separate product - outside the school system - tells you something.

That's all for today!
