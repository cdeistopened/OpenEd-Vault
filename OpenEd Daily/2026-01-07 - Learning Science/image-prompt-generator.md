# Image Prompt Generator Workflow

## Step 1: Initial Concepts

### Concept 1: Classic Flight Path
A clean, minimalist banner showing a paper airplane's dotted flight path that transforms from a simple loop into an elegant spiral, with soft gradient sky background.

### Concept 2: Learning Ecosystem  
An abstract garden scene where different plants represent different learning stages - seeds, sprouts, and blooming flowers connected by flowing lines suggesting knowledge transfer.

### Concept 3: Neural Pathways
Stylized brain synapses forming elegant patterns, with nodes lighting up in a sequence, suggesting the formation of new connections through spaced practice.

## Step 2: Concept Selection and Optimization

**Selected Concept**: Concept 1 - Classic Flight Path

### Original Concept
A clean, minimalist banner showing a paper airplane's dotted flight path that transforms from a simple loop into an elegant spiral, with soft gradient sky background.

### Optimized Prompt

**Full Prompt**:
"Create a minimalist newsletter banner header image, 1200x300 pixels, featuring a white paper airplane following a dotted flight path. The path starts as a simple loop on the left side and gradually transforms into an ascending spiral pattern on the right. Use a soft gradient background transitioning from light sky blue (#E6F3FF) at the top to warm peach (#FFE8DC) at the bottom. The dotted line should be subtle dark gray (#4A5568). Add very light, abstract cloud shapes in the background for depth. The overall design should be clean, professional, and optimistic, suitable for an educational newsletter header. No text or typography needed. Flat design style with subtle shadows."

### Key Optimizations Made:
1. **Specified exact dimensions** (1200x300) for banner format
2. **Added color specifications** with hex codes for consistency
3. **Clarified the transformation** (loop to spiral) with directional guidance
4. **Added subtle design elements** (clouds) for visual interest without clutter
5. **Specified style preferences** (flat design, subtle shadows)
6. **Excluded text** to keep it versatile for newsletter headers
7. **Emphasized professional tone** suitable for educational content
