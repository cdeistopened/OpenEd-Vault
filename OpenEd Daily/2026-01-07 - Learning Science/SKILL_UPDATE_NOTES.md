# Skill Update Notes - Captured During 1/7 Session

## Insight 1: Angle Generation Spectrum

**What we learned:** Generating 3-4 angles per segment at different boldness levels (Safe → Moderate → Bold → Spicy) helps find the right register. But "bold" doesn't mean "dunking on schools."

**The right framing:**
- Pirate Wires je ne sais quoi = seeing clearly, saying the obvious truth
- Not accusatory. Curious. "Huh, isn't that interesting."
- Best takes make reader think "that's obviously true, why didn't I see it"
- Let the reader fill in conclusions

**Example of right register:**
> "We've known what works for a century. Nobody's hiding it. The research is public. And yet."

That's not blaming teachers. It's just noticing.

**Add to skill:** Stage 2 sub-agent should generate angle spectrum, but calibrate "bold" as "clear-eyed observation" not "attack."

## Insight 2: Continuous Learning Bracket

**Pattern to implement:**

At specific workflow checkpoints, the orchestrator should:
1. Surface any proposed skill updates based on session learnings
2. Present them as incremental refinements (not overhauls)
3. Get user approval before applying
4. Apply in a non-ad-hoc way (batch updates at session end, or at natural pause points)

**Checkpoints where this makes sense:**
- After Checkpoint 1 approval (angle/substance learnings)
- After draft revision cycle (voice/style learnings)
- At session end (workflow/process learnings)

**Format:**
```
## SKILL UPDATE PROPOSAL (Optional)

**What we learned this session:**
[1-2 sentence observation]

**Proposed change:**
[Specific, incremental edit to skill]

**Affects:** [Section name]

[ ] Approve and queue for end-of-session
[ ] Skip
```

## Insight 3: Voice Calibration

**From the 1/6 session (carry forward):**
- "The vibe" = smart person to smart person, no performance
- Trust the reader - don't tell them how to feel
- Say less - cut redundancy ruthlessly
- No fake questions ("The top concerns?")
- Avoid AI tells (correlative constructions, rhetorical setups)

**New addition from 1/7:**
- Curious > accusatory
- "Noticing" > "blaming"
- Let reader draw conclusions

## Next Steps

1. Update Checkpoint_1.md with refined angles (curious register)
2. Proceed to Stage 3 draft
3. At session end, propose consolidated skill updates
