## SCHOOLS BANNED THE WRONG KIND OF TESTING

American schools drown in standardized tests. State assessments. Benchmark exams. Testing became synonymous with accountability theater—measuring schools, not helping students learn.

[Justin Skycak](https://www.justinmath.com/maximizing-learning-vs-other-things/), who leads curriculum development at Math Academy, nails it: "Testing" and "repetition" have become dirty words in education—yet practice testing and distributed practice are two of the most effective learning techniques.

Schools threw out the baby with the bathwater. Self-testing—where students quiz themselves to pull information from memory—actually works. Not for grades. Not for metrics. Just for learning.

The irony: if schools used testing that builds learning, students would ace accountability tests without trying.

## THE 80% BOOST THEY'RE IGNORING

Students who test themselves retain [up to 80% more](https://zipdo.co/learning-retention-statistics/) than those who just re-read material.

The classic study: Give students material. Some study it four times. Others study once and test themselves three times. The self-testers win. Every time.

Without reinforcement, [70% of learned information](https://zipdo.co/learning-retention-statistics/) disappears within 24 hours. That's how memory works.

This research existed since the early 1900s. Teachers know it. Schools choose not to use it.

Why? It doesn't optimize for engagement, compliance, or entertainment. Effective learning often feels repetitive, so it gets dropped for approaches that keep everyone happy.

Whether that tradeoff makes sense depends on what you think school is for.

## WHEN SOMEONE ACTUALLY BUILDS ON THE RESEARCH

[Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/how-our-ai-works) built a platform around cognitive science instead of engagement metrics.

They use something called Fractional Implicit Repetition. Traditional flashcard apps treat every topic as independent. Math doesn't work that way. When you practice algebra, you're implicitly practicing arithmetic. Math Academy tracks these relationships and reduces total review time.

[Some users](https://jonathanwhitmore.com/posts/2024-09-10-MathAcademy-after-2000-points/) report genuine fluency through repetition. Others want more conceptual explanation. At $49/month, it's not cheap—but it's built on research that works.

The fact this exists as a separate product, outside schools, says something.

That's all for today!
