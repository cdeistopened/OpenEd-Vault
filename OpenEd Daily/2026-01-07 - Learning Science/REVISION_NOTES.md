# Newsletter Revision Notes - Jan 7, 2026

## What Was Wrong with the Original Draft

### 1. **Weak Opening - Too Much Setup, Not Enough Substance**

**Original:**
> ""Testing" and "repetition" have become dirty words in education." - says Justin Skycak, founder of the adaptive online learning platform [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/) - he's been [writing about](https://www.justinmath.com/maximizing-learning-vs-other-things/)... but he makes a persuasive argument that not all testing is problematic. In fact <To the substance here. >

**Problems:**
- Spent entire first paragraph introducing Justin instead of stating the point
- "makes a persuasive argument" = weak framing (what's the argument?)
- Never actually got to the substance
- Too much attribution, not enough claim

**Fixed:**
> "Testing" and "repetition" have become dirty words in education.
> 
> That's the observation from Justin Skycak, who runs [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/). He's been [writing about](https://www.justinmath.com/maximizing-learning-vs-other-things/) why schools resist methods that actually work.
> 
> Here's the thing: The science isn't new. Spaced repetition and retrieval practice (testing yourself to pull information from memory) have been studied since the 1900s. The research is settled. These techniques work.
> 
> Schools just don't want to use them.

**Why this works:**
- Opens with the claim (testing = dirty word)
- Attributes to Justin but doesn't dwell
- Gets to substance immediately (the paradox)
- Short sentences land the point
- Builds tension: science is settled → schools ignore it

---

### 2. **Deleted Paragraph Was Redundant**

**Deleted:**
> ~~Skycak's point isn't that educators are villains. It's that maximizing learning isn't the only thing schools are trying to do, and maybe not even the main thing. They're also trying to be fun, low-friction, engaging. Testing is none of those, so it gets deprioritized.~~
> 
> ~~The research has been settled for decades. The implementation is another story.~~

**Why it was cut:**
- Repeated the same point (schools prioritize other things)
- Already covered in revised opening
- Slowed down the pace
- "The implementation is another story" = vague throat-clearing

**Where substance went instead:**
Folded into opening paragraph:
> Skycak's argument is that this isn't about ignorance. Educators know the research. But maximizing learning isn't the only thing schools optimize for - they're also trying to be fun, easy, low-friction. Testing feels punitive. Repetition feels boring. So they get dropped, even though they're two of the most effective learning techniques we have.

More concrete, tighter, keeps momentum.

### 3. **Academic Citation Killed the Flow**

**Original:**
> Roediger and Karpicke {  let's just make it more generic. We don't need to really cite this. This is for parents not researchers or academics.} ran the classic version of this experiment.

**Problem:**
- Parent readers don't care who Roediger and Karpicke are
- Sounds like a research paper, not Morning Brew
- Creates distance instead of engagement

**Fixed:**
> The classic experiment works like this: Give students something to learn. One group studies it four times. Another studies it once, then tests themselves three times. The students who tested more remembered more - and the effect lasted for days, even weeks.

**Why this works:**
- Describes the finding, not the researchers
- Active voice, present tense (more immediate)
- Focuses on what parents care about: the result
- Still gives context ("classic experiment") without namedr

### 4. **Weak Lead-In to the 80% Stat**

**Original:**
> <we live in a world of often made-up statistics yet there is one yet this finding stands out something like that > Students who [test themselves](https://zipdo.co/learning-retention-statistics/) retain up to 80% more...

**Problem:**
- Placeholder showed you knew it needed something
- Stats need credibility before you drop them
- 80% is BIG - needs setup

**Fixed:**
> ## THE 80% BOOST
> 
> In a world of made-up statistics, this one actually holds up.
> 
> Students who [test themselves](https://zipdo.co/learning-retention-statistics/) retain up to 80% more than those who just re-read material. It's one of the most replicated findings in cognitive psychology.

**Why this works:**
- Title teases the number
- "In a world of made-up statistics" = acknowledges skepticism
- "this one actually holds up" = builds credibility
- "most replicated findings" = gives weight
- Now you can drop the stat with confidence

---

### 5. **Didn't Say What Matters from the Study**

**Original:**
> { let's say what matters here from the study. Read the study if you have to}

**Fixed:**
> [Recent research from 2025](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395691861) confirmed it again. Practice tests don't just boost retention. They help students transfer what they learn to new problems.

**Why this works:**
- Answers: "Why does this matter beyond memorization?"
- Transfer to new problems = practical benefit parents care about
- Recent (2025) = shows ongoing research, not just 1900s stuff

---

### 6. **Factual Error Fixed**

**Original:**
> <<{https://www.justinmath.com/}.  Justin actually isn't the founder >>
> 
> [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/how-our-ai-works) is what you get when someone actually builds on this research - spaced repetition, adaptive diagnostics, knowledge graphs. The founder is that same Justin Skycak from above.

**Problem:**
- Said Justin founded it when he didn't
- Conflicting information

**Fixed:**
> [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/how-our-ai-works) is what you get when someone actually builds a platform around this research.

**Why this works:**
- Removed the factual error
- "builds a platform" = vague enough to be accurate
- Justin still associated but not as founder
- Focus stays on the tool, not the person

---

## Style Improvements: Morning Brew Approach

### Original Style Issues

1. **Too much attribution**
   - "Skycak says..." "Roediger and Karpicke ran..."
   - Feels academic, not journalistic

2. **Weak connectors**
   - "His argument is interesting."
   - "The techniques aren't new..."
   - Throat-clearing instead of substance

3. **Unclear structure**
   - Jumped between points
   - Didn't build momentum

### Morning Brew Style Applied

**Morning Brew characteristics:**
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Punchy openers
- "Here's the thing" / "Here's what matters" directness
- Data with context
- "So what?" answered quickly
- Personality without performance

**Examples in revised version:**

**Opening with claim:**
> "Testing" and "repetition" have become dirty words in education.
> 
> That's the observation from Justin Skycak...

**Building tension:**
> The science isn't new. [...] The research is settled. These techniques work.
> 
> Schools just don't want to use them.

**Handling stats:**
> In a world of made-up statistics, this one actually holds up.

**Landing insights:**
> The gap isn't in the science. It's in priorities.

**Natural transitions:**
> Here's the uncomfortable part: [stat about forgetting]
> 
> The question is what you do about it.

---

## Key Principles Applied

### 1. **Get to the Point Fast**
- First sentence = the claim
- Second sentence = who said it
- Third sentence = the substance

### 2. **Trust the Reader**
Don't tell them:
- "This is interesting"
- "You should pay attention"
- "Here's why this matters"

Show them:
- The paradox
- The data
- The gap

### 3. **Short Sentences Create Momentum**
Compare:

**Sluggish:**
> His argument is interesting because the techniques aren't new, including spaced repetition, retrieval practice, and deliberate practice, which researchers have been studying since the 1900s even though it's not controversial.

**Momentum:**
> The science isn't new. Spaced repetition and retrieval practice have been studied since the 1900s. The research is settled. These techniques work.

### 4. **Specificity Over Vagueness**

**Vague:**
> "The implementation is another story."

**Specific:**
> "Schools just don't want to use them."

**Vague:**
> "The founder is that same Justin Skycak from above."

**Specific:**
> Removed entirely (not essential, created confusion)

### 5. **Natural Voice, Not Performance**

**Performance:**
> "Skycak makes a persuasive argument that not all testing is problematic."

**Natural:**
> "Testing feels punitive. Repetition feels boring. So they get dropped."

## Word Count Comparison

| Version | Word Count |
|---------|------------|
| Original (with strikethroughs) | ~465 words |
| Revised | ~498 words |
| Change | +33 words |

**Note:** Added substance without adding fluff. Economy of words, but natural flow.

---

## Remaining Opportunities

### Could tighten further:

**Current:**
> Here's the uncomfortable part: Without reinforcement, about 70% of what you learn disappears within 24 hours. That's not a flaw in your kid's brain. That's just how memory works.

**Tighter option:**
> Without reinforcement, 70% of what you learn disappears within 24 hours. Not a flaw. That's just how memory works.

But keeping the longer version for readability and flow.

---

### Could add more concrete examples:

**Opportunity:**
After describing the testing effect, could add:
> Your kid reads a chapter on the Revolutionary War. Next day, they've forgotten most of it. But if they quiz themselves - "What caused the war?" "Who were the key figures?" - retention jumps to 80%.

But this might slow down the pace. Current version keeps moving.

## Bottom Line

**Original draft problems:**
1. Too much setup, not enough substance (opening)
2. Redundant paragraph (deleted)
3. Academic tone (citations)
4. Weak stat setup
5. Missing "what matters" from research
6. Factual error (founder claim)

**Revised version:**
1. Opens with substance
2. Cuts redundancy
3. Makes research accessible
4. Sets up stats with credibility
5. Explains practical benefit (transfer)
6. Fixes factual error

**Style shift:**
- Academic → Journalistic
- Performance → Natural
- Setup → Substance
- Vague → Specific

**Morning Brew influence:**
- Short paragraphs
- Punchy openers
- "Here's the thing" directness
- Data with context
- Natural voice

Result: Tighter, punchier, more substance, better flow.
