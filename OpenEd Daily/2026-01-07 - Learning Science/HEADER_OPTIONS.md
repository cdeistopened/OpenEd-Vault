## Recommendation:

I'd go with either:

**Option A** (most Pirate Wires-y - contrarian with specificity)
- Strong hook: "plot twist" signals you're going against conventional wisdom
- "Century of ignored research" has that knowing, savvy quality
- "$49 rebellion" is specific and provocative

**OR Option B** (most aggressive)
- "Scam" is strong language that earns attention
- The period after "80% better results" adds punch
- "Ignore engagement metrics" names the actual problem

**Current v7 is actually pretty good** - it's clear, specific, and has the contrarian angle without being too cute.

What's your gut reaction to these?
