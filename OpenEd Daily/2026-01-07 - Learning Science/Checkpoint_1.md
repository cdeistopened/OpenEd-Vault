# Checkpoint 1 - Selected Segments

## SELECTED SEGMENTS

### THOUGHT: Justin Skycak on Why Educators Resist Effective Learning
**Angle:** The research isn't new. Spaced repetition, testing effect, deliberate practice - studied since the 1900s. Not controversial. Just... not how schools are set up. Skycak's point isn't that educators are villains. It's that maximizing learning isn't the only thing schools are trying to do. Maybe not even the main thing. Let the reader notice this without being told what to conclude.

### TREND: The Testing Effect Research
**Angle:** 80% better retention from testing vs passive review. One of the most replicated findings in cognitive psychology. The interesting part isn't the data - it's wondering why this isn't standard practice everywhere. Present the research, let the reader sit with the gap.

### TOOL: Math Academy
**Angle:** Math Academy is just... the research, implemented. Spaced repetition, adaptive practice, knowledge graphs. What's notable is that someone had to build it as a separate product. That tells you something. $49/month - acknowledge the price, don't oversell.

## UNIFYING THEME

**The science of learning is clear. Schools ignore it. Here's what you can do about it.**

This bundle tells one coherent story: learning science has proven what works (Trend), the education establishment rejects it for ideological reasons (Thought), and at least one person built a tool that actually implements the research (Tool). Sarah can leapfrog the system by using methods her kids' former school abandoned.

## ORTHOGONALITY CHECK

**Thought and Trend are distinct:** YES

- THOUGHT = philosophical critique (why educators resist)
- TREND = empirical evidence (what the research shows)
- They're related but serve different functions: one explains *why* schools fail, the other proves *what works*. The Thought is about institutional psychology; the Trend is about cognitive science.

**Aligns with OpenEd beliefs:**

- **"Parents are the best designers of their children's education"** - This bundle arms parents with research the system ignores, positioning them as better informed than institutions
- **"Mastery Over Measurement"** - Retrieval practice is about building genuine mastery, not teaching to standardized tests
- **"Learning is natural. The system broke it. You can fix it."** - Core message of this bundle
- **"Your child's uniqueness isn't a problem. It's the point."** - Adaptive tools like Math Academy adjust to each child vs. one-size-fits-all classrooms

## QUESTIONS FOR USER

1. **Tone calibration:** The Skycak piece is fairly contrarian/critical of educators. How aggressive should we be in the Thought section? Options:
   - Full contrarian (educators prioritize "fun" over learning)
   - Moderate (the system has different incentives than parents)
   - Sympathetic (teachers know this but are constrained by the system)

2. **Math Academy disclosure:** Should we flag this as an unsolicited review, or have we had any contact with them? (Affects how we position it)

3. **Testing language:** Do we want to use "testing" throughout, or substitute "retrieval practice" / "self-quizzing" to avoid negative connotations Sarah might have from school experience?
