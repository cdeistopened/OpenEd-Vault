# OpenEd Daily - Tuesday 1/7/26

**SUBJECT:** Testing: Good and Bad
**PREVIEW:** Students who test *themselves* retain 80% more. Researchers have known this since the 1900s. Schools still don't do it. PLUS: an app that does.

## THE CENTURY-OLD SECRET

"“Testing” and “repetition” have become dirty words in education." -  says Justin Skycak, founder of the adaptive online learning platform [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/) - he's been [writing about](https://www.justinmath.com/maximizing-learning-vs-other-things/)... 
... but he makes a persuasive argument that not all testing is problematic. In fact <To the substance here. >

The techniques aren't new - spaced repetition, retrieval practice, deliberate practice. Researchers have been studying this stuff since the 1900s and it's not controversial. It's just not how schools are set up.

~~Skycak's point isn't that educators are villains. It's that maximizing learning isn't the only thing schools are trying to do, and maybe not even the main thing. They're also trying to be fun, low-friction, engaging. Testing is none of those, so it gets deprioritized.~~

~~The research has been settled for decades. The implementation is another story.~~

## 80% BETTER RETENTION

 <we live in a world of often made-up statistics yet there is one yet this finding stands out something like that >
Students who [test themselves](https://zipdo.co/learning-retention-statistics/) retain up to 80% more than those who re-read material. It's one of the most replicated findings in cognitive psychology.

Roediger and Karpicke {  let's just make it more generic. We don't need to really cite this. This is for parents not researchers or academics.} ran the classic version of this experiment. They gave students material to learn - some studied it four times, while others studied once and then tested themselves three times. The testers retained more, and the effect held across time and across subjects. [Corral and Carpenter confirmed it again in 2025](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395691861) - practice tests boost both retention and transfer to new problems.

Here's the uncomfortable part: without reinforcement, about 70% of what you learn disappears within 24 hours. That's not a flaw in your kid's brain. That's just how memory works. The question is what you do about it.

{ let's say what matters here from the study. Read the study if you have to}

## TOOL: MATH ACADEMY

<<{https://www.justinmath.com/}.  Justin actually isn't the founder >>

[Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/how-our-ai-works) is what you get when someone actually builds on this research - spaced repetition, adaptive diagnostics, knowledge graphs. The founder is that same Justin Skycak from above.

What makes it interesting is something called Fractional Implicit Repetition. Traditional flashcard apps treat every topic as independent, but math is hierarchical. When you practice algebra, you're also practicing arithmetic. Their system tracks this relationship and reduces total review time by not redundantly quizzing you on stuff you're already reinforcing.

It's $49/month, which isn't cheap. [Some users](https://jonathanwhitmore.com/posts/2024-09-10-MathAcademy-after-2000-points/) love it for building genuine fluency through repetition. Others want more conceptual explanation than it provides.

Worth noting: the fact that this had to be built as a separate product, outside the school system, tells you something.

That's all for today!
