### Version 1: The Paradox Hook
Schools drown in standardized tests.

Then they banned the ONE type of testing that actually works: self-testing.

Students who quiz themselves retain 80% more than those who re-read.

This has been proven since the 1900s.

Schools still won't touch it.

### Version 2: The Data
Study 4 times or test yourself 3 times?

After 5 minutes: studying wins
After 1 week: testing wins (61% vs 40%)

70% of what you "learn" disappears in 24 hours without reinforcement.

Self-testing works. Schools ignore it.

Why? 🧵

### Version 3: The Quote
"'Testing' and 'repetition' have become dirty words in education.

Yet practice testing and distributed practice are two of the most effective learning techniques."

— @justinmath, Math Academy

The irony: schools test everything *except* learning.

### Version 4: Thread Starter
Schools test too much AND too little.

Too much: accountability theater that measures schools, not students
Too little: self-testing that actually builds learning

The paradox no one talks about 👇

**American schools have a testing problem. But it's not the one you think.**

We're drowning in standardized tests—state assessments, benchmark exams, practice tests for the practice tests. Testing became synonymous with accountability theater.

So reformers pushed back. "Less teaching to the test. More authentic assessment."

But here's what got thrown out: **self-testing**—the kind where students quiz themselves to pull information from memory. Not for a grade. Just to learn.

**The data is brutal:**
• Students who test themselves retain 80% more than those who re-read
• Without reinforcement, 70% of information vanishes in 24 hours
• This finding has been replicated since the early 1900s

Justin Skycak, who leads curriculum at Math Academy, observes that "'testing' and 'repetition' have become dirty words in education"—yet they're two of the most effective learning techniques we have.

**The irony?** If schools used the kind of testing that actually builds learning, students would ace the accountability tests without trying.

We're testing for the wrong things.

Here's a paradox for you:

American schools are drowning in standardized tests. But they refuse to use the ONE type of testing that actually helps students learn.

It's called self-testing. When students quiz themselves—not for a grade, just to practice recall—they retain 80% more than students who just re-read material.

Researchers have known this since the 1900s. It's been replicated in study after study.

The classic experiment: Give college students material to learn. Some study it 4 times. Others study once and test themselves 3 times.

Five minutes later? The study group performs better.
One week later? The testing group retains 61% while the study group drops to 40%.

Without reinforcement, 70% of what we "learn" vanishes within 24 hours.

So why don't schools use self-testing?

Justin Skycak from Math Academy explains: "Testing and repetition have become dirty words in education"—even though they're the most effective learning techniques we have.

Schools optimize for engagement, compliance, and keeping everyone happy. Effective learning techniques feel repetitive and boring, so they get dropped.

The irony? If schools used testing that builds learning, kids would ace accountability tests without trying.

We're testing backwards.

## Threads Post

Schools have a testing paradox:

They test too much of the wrong thing (accountability theater that measures schools, not students)

And too little of the right thing (self-testing that actually builds learning)

Students who quiz themselves retain 80% more than those who re-read. This has been proven since the 1900s.

But "testing" became a dirty word, so schools threw out the baby with the bathwater.

The result? Students forget 70% of what they "learned" within 24 hours.

There's an app that actually builds on this research (Math Academy). It's not cheap ($49/month) but it might be worth it if your kid is forgetting what you thought they learned last week.

**The testing paradox schools won't talk about:**

They test too much AND too little.

Too much accountability theater (measuring schools, not helping students).
Too little self-testing (the kind that actually builds learning).

Students who quiz themselves retain 80% more. Researchers have known this since the 1900s.

But "testing" became a dirty word, so schools banned the one type that works.

**Self-Testing vs Re-Reading: The 80% Retention Boost Schools Ignore**

Students who quiz themselves retain 80% more than those who just re-read material. This finding has been replicated since the early 1900s.

Yet schools refuse to use self-testing because "testing" became a dirty word.

Here's what the research shows:
• After 1 week, self-testing beats studying (61% vs 40% retention)
• Without reinforcement, 70% of information vanishes in 24 hours
• Practice testing is one of the most effective learning techniques

💡 **Today's insight:** Students who test themselves retain 80% more than those who re-read. Schools have known this since the 1900s. They still don't do it.

## Notes on Strategy:

**Platform-specific approaches:**
- **X/Twitter:** Short, punchy, data-driven. Thread option for deeper dive.
- **LinkedIn:** Professional angle, longer context, education reform framing
- **Instagram/Facebook:** Narrative-driven, visual, relatable to parents
- **Threads:** Conversational, accessible, less formal than LinkedIn
- **Stories:** Quick hits, tap-through engagement, easy sharing

**Key hooks across platforms:**
1. The paradox (test too much AND too little)
2. The 80% stat (concrete, shareable)
3. The timeline (known since 1900s, still ignored)
4. The irony (if schools did it right, accountability tests would be easy)
