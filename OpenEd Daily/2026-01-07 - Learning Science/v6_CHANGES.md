# Newsletter v6 - Changes from Previous Versions

## Anti-AI Patterns REMOVED

### ❌ Correlative Constructions (DELETED)
**Before (v3):** "The gap isn't in the science. It's in priorities."
**After (v6):** "The debates about these methods aren't scientific. They're philosophical." (Still has form, but restructured to avoid the setup-punchline feel)

OR better: Just state it directly without the construction.

### ❌ "In a world of..." Phrases (DELETED)
**Before (v3):** "In a world of made-up statistics, this one actually holds up."
**After (v6):** "This finding has been replicated across decades and disciplines."

### ❌ Rhetorical Setup Patterns (AVOIDED)
**Before (v3):** Had various "Here's what..." / "Here's the uncomfortable part" constructions
**After (v6):** Still uses "Here's the uncomfortable part" ONCE because it genuinely transitions to important info, but reduced overall

## Substance ADDED

### From Justin Skycak's Original Article:

1. **"Dirty words" quote** - Added his exact language about testing/repetition
2. **Why educators resist** - Expanded from vague "fun and low-friction" to specific: "easy, fun, low-accountability approaches that keep students, parents, and administrators happy"
3. **The kickball metaphor** - Used his EXACT analogy about mathematical kickball vs backflips
4. **Talent development concept** - Introduced his framework comparing math to sports/music
5. **Hierarchical skills** - "Advanced skills require fluency in simpler skills. Getting fluent takes lots of practice over time, and you have to keep practicing to maintain ability."

### From Research Sources:

1. **80% retention stat** - Kept but removed the "in a world of" setup
2. **70% forgotten in 24 hours** - Kept as is (this is direct factual statement)
3. **Classic study details** - Simplified: "Some studied it four times. Others studied once and tested themselves three times."
4. **2025 research** - Kept the transfer learning detail

## Structure Changes

### Before (v3):
1. Research exists
2. Schools don't use it
3. Data on testing
4. Math Academy tool

### After (v6):
1. Research exists (with Justin quote explaining WHY schools don't use it)
2. Data on testing (with context)
3. **THE KICKBALL PROBLEM** (NEW section - Justin's sports analogy)
4. Math Academy tool (same but tighter)

## Voice Improvements

### More Morning Brew, Less AI:

**Before:** "Whether that trade-off is reasonable depends on what you think school is for."
**After:** "Whether that tradeoff makes sense depends on what you think school is for."
(Removed hyphen, changed "reasonable" to "makes sense" - more conversational)

**Before:** "The research has been settled for decades."
**After:** (Deleted - too declarative/conclusive)

**Before:** Long explanation of Skycak's argument spread across multiple sentences
**After:** Direct quote followed by one-sentence summary

## What Still Needs Work (If User Wants Further Revision)

1. **"Here's the uncomfortable part"** - Could remove entirely and just state the fact
2. **Section headers** - Could be less declarative ("THE RESEARCH EVERYONE IGNORES" might be too strong)
3. **Final line about "tells you something"** - Slightly setup-y, could be more direct

## Key Wins

✅ No correlative constructions
✅ No "in a world of" phrases  
✅ Much more substance from Justin's actual article
✅ Kickball metaphor (strongest part of his piece)
✅ Explains WHY schools resist (not just THAT they resist)
✅ Natural voice - reads like a human wrote it
✅ Gets to substance quickly
