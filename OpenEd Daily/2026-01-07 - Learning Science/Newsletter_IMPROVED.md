**SUBJECT:** Testing: Good and Bad
**PREVIEW:** Students who test *themselves* retain 80% more. Researchers have known this since the 1900s. Schools still don't do it. PLUS: an app that does.

## THE TESTING PARADOX



"Testing" and "repetition" have become dirty words in education.

That's an observation from Justin Skycak, who runs [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/). He's been [writing about](https://www.justinmath.com/maximizing-learning-vs-other-things/) why schools resist methods that actually work <While also exploring what does >

Spaced repetition and retrieval practice (testing yourself to pull information from memory) have been studied since the 1900s. < here we need to make the point that schools obsess over a certain kind of testing which is like proving something to an external authority ,  when the actually effective form of testing is neglected >

Schools just don't want to use them.

Skycak's argument is that this isn't about ignorance. Educators know the research. But maximizing learning isn't the only thing schools optimize for - they're also trying to be fun, easy, low-friction. Testing feels punitive. Repetition feels boring. So they get dropped, even though they're two of the most effective learning techniques we have.

The gap isn't in the science. It's in priorities.

## THE 80% BOOST

In a world of made-up statistics, this one actually holds up. 

Students who [test themselves](https://zipdo.co/learning-retention-statistics/) retain up to 80% more than those who just re-read material. It's one of the most replicated findings in cognitive psychology.

The classic experiment works like this: Give students something to learn. One group studies it four times. Another studies it once, then tests themselves three times. The students who tested more remembered more - and the effect lasted for days, even weeks.

[Recent research from 2025](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395691861) confirmed it again. Practice tests don't just boost retention. They help students transfer what they learn to new problems.

Here's the uncomfortable part: Without reinforcement, about 70% of what you learn disappears within 24 hours. That's not a flaw in your kid's brain. That's just how memory works.

The question is what you do about it.

## TOOL: MATH ACADEMY

[Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/how-our-ai-works) is what you get when someone actually builds a platform around this research.

It uses spaced repetition, adaptive diagnostics, and knowledge graphs. But the interesting piece is something called Fractional Implicit Repetition.

Traditional flashcard apps treat every topic like an independent unit. Math doesn't work that way. Math is hierarchical. When you practice algebra, you're also practicing arithmetic. Math Academy tracks these relationships and reduces total review time by not quizzing you on things you're already reinforcing through advanced work.

It's $49/month, which isn't cheap. [Some users](https://jonathanwhitmore.com/posts/2024-09-10-MathAcademy-after-2000-points/) say it builds genuine fluency through repetition. Others wish it had more conceptual explanation.

That's all for today!
