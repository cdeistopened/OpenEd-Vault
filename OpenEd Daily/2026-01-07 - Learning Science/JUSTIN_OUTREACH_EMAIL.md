**Subject:** Featuring Math Academy in our AI adaptive learning guide

**Body:**

Hi Justin,

Charlie from OpenEd here. We mentioned Math Academy in today's newsletter (50k+ homeschool parents), and we're now writing a comprehensive deep dive on AI adaptive learning for our blog.

I've pulled quotes from several of your posts:
- "Maximizing Learning vs Other Things" (on why testing/repetition became dirty words)
- "Which Cognitive Psychology Findings are Solid" (laws of physics in learning)
- "Why is the EdTech Industry So Damn Soft?" (serious vs engagement-optimized products)
- Your work on Fractional Implicit Repetition

We're positioning Math Academy as THE example of cognitive science-based adaptive learning done right. The article will compare different adaptive platforms and explain to parents how to evaluate quality vs hype.

Would you be open to:
1. Reviewing the section about Math Academy before we publish?
2. Adding an original quote or insight if something's missing?
3. Sharing the article with your audience when it's live?

We'll be promoting this heavily (newsletter, social, podcast mentions) and linking directly to Math Academy. Happy to send the full draft when it's ready.

No pressure if you're swamped. Either way, thanks for writing about this stuff publicly—it's made our job of educating parents much easier.

Best,
Charlie

Subject: **Re: Featuring Math Academy in our AI adaptive learning guide**

Justin,

Wanted to bump this in case it got buried. We're finalizing the deep dive article this week.

If you'd like to review the Math Academy section before it goes live, I can send a draft. Otherwise we'll proceed with what we have (all pulled from your public writing).

Either way works—just wanted to give you the opportunity.

Charlie
