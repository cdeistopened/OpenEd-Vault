Greetings Eddies!

Why do kids cry over homework?

It's rarely about the homework.

Let's dive in.

## THE TEARS AREN'T ABOUT WRITING

Evelyn was in fourth grade when her mom decided to homeschool. She'd spent two years in a masked classroom after missing weeks of school with Lyme disease. The exhaustion never fully lifted.

Her mom Alicia noticed something alarming: **"I was literally pulling out chunks of my hair,"** Evelyn [recalled](https://www.governing.com/policy/connecticut-debates-adding-oversight-to-homeschooling). **"It was definitely not a healthy environment with me."**

Now 13, Evelyn is thriving. She's part of a co-op where she learns alongside kids from nine other families. Her mom says the transformation was dramatic.

Here's what struck me: the stress wasn't about academics. It was about environment.

When kids melt down over writing assignments, or math worksheets, or reading logs—it's tempting to think the problem is the subject. So we buy new curriculum. We try different approaches. We push harder or pull back.

But often the tears aren't about the pencil. They're about the context.

Is the child exhausted? Overwhelmed? Feeling like they're being tested instead of taught? Do they trust that mistakes are okay?

Sometimes the fix isn't a new curriculum. It's a different environment. A different pace. A different voice saying "you're doing fine."

The tears aren't about writing. They're about trust.

## THE TRUST REBUILD

The pandemic broke something in a lot of kids. Two years of masks, isolation, and uncertainty left marks that didn't heal when schools reopened.

From the [Connecticut data](https://www.governing.com/policy/connecticut-debates-adding-oversight-to-homeschooling):
- Parents report pandemic aftershocks that persisted years later
- Kids who were "behind" stayed behind even after returning to normal
- School environment—not curriculum—drove many exit decisions

Evelyn's story isn't unique. Thousands of parents watched their kids struggle to recover and decided: maybe recovery needs to happen somewhere else.

The rebuild isn't quick. Alicia Teitelbaum pulled three daughters from school in 2022. By 2025, they're part of a thriving co-op where the families know each other deeply.

"They're all my kids," Teitelbaum says about the children in her community.

The trust rebuild takes time. It takes smaller communities. It takes adults who aren't grading you.

## NATURAL WRITING

If your child has a complicated relationship with writing, [Brave Writer](https://bravewriter.com/) might be the reset you need.

Julie Bogart built Brave Writer on a radical premise: **writing should be natural and joyful.**

Not painful. Not performative. Natural.

**The approach:**
- Start with talking—capture your child's spoken words before asking them to write
- "Freewriting" without judgment or correction
- Connection before correction (relationship with words matters)
- Parent as scribe first, editor last

**What makes it different:**
- No workbooks to fill out
- No formulaic essay structures for young kids
- Focus on voice and ideas, not mechanics
- Treats writing resistance as a trust problem, not a discipline problem

The philosophy: if your kid can talk, they can write. The barrier is usually psychological, not skill-based.

Brave Writer offers courses, coaching, and self-paced programs. But you can start with their free resources and see if the approach resonates.

For kids who've associated writing with red ink and criticism—this is the detox.

That's all for today!
