**SUBJECT:** Pro-child, not pro-homeschooling

**PREVIEW:** Late last year, the Times ran a viral essay on homeschooling gone wrong. Over the holidays, they published the rebuttals.

## THE LETTERS

Late last year, the New York Times published "[The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/opinion/home-school-isolation.html)" — a viral guest essay by novelist Stefan Merrill Block describing his experience being isolated by a parent in crisis. We published [our own response](https://opened.co/blog/you-can-do-this-what-the-new-york-times-misses-about-unschooling), pointing to the Nirvana Fallacy at the heart of the piece — a comparison between the author's real (and tragic) story and an imagined ideal.

While we were on break, the Times ran [a series of letters to the editor](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/opinion/letters-home-schooling.html) that made the counter-argument better than we could.

**Mason Ember**, a 16-year-old who spent over a year filming a feature-length documentary called *Against the Grade* about homeschooled teenagers:

> "In education we should be pro-child, not always pro-home-schooling, but certainly against 'one size fits all' institutionalism. Anyone can construct education around his or her beliefs, and dogma can come from anywhere: public schools, private schools and parents, too."

**Hicham Oumlil**, a Brooklyn father who pulled his 12-year-old son from school — not by choice:

> "His primary and middle schools were wholly unequipped to educate him. He was reading above grade level since kindergarten, yet was forced to read at the designated grade level... He learned best through play — building systems and structures, and obsessively studying transit and aviation — but none of this was allowed or recognized as learning."

His conclusion: the system "seemed to punish difference rather than cultivate potential."

**Elissa Kellner**, a Vermont homeschooler, pushed back on the assumption that standardized testing is the solution:

> "There are many of us who choose to home-school directly in response to the rise in standardized testing over the past 25 years. Much of public education now revolves around honing test-taking skills at the expense of actual learning."

She also challenged the isolation narrative: her homeschool community has "socially adept children who are enrolled in dance and art classes, team sports and community service programs, and who appear confident talking to their peers and adults — something that has become a rarity."

We applaud the Times for featuring the counter-argument. Block's experience was real, but it was one data point — not the whole picture.

We look forward to following Mason Ember's documentary, *Against the Grade*. A 16-year-old spending a year interviewing homeschooled teenagers and producing a feature film is, itself, a pretty good argument for the approach.
