## X/TWITTER THREAD

**Tweet 1 (Quote tweet original post about Block article):**
In case you missed it over the holidays — the Times ran a follow-up.

Four readers responded to "The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right." Their letters make the counter-argument better than we could.

**Tweet 2:**
Mason Ember is 16. He spent the last year making a feature documentary about homeschooled teens.

His take: "We should be pro-child, not always pro-homeschooling, but certainly against 'one size fits all' institutionalism."

**Tweet 3:**
Hicham Oumlil pulled his 12-year-old from school — not by choice.

"His schools were wholly unequipped to educate him... He learned best through play — building systems and structures — but none of this was allowed or recognized as learning."

**Tweet 4:**
Elissa Kellner on why her family homeschools:

"Many of us chose to home-school directly in response to the rise in standardized testing. Much of public education now revolves around honing test-taking skills at the expense of actual learning."

**Tweet 5:**
We applaud the Times for publishing the counter-argument.

And we'll be following Mason Ember's documentary, "Against the Grade" — coming 2026.

A 16-year-old spending a year interviewing homeschooled teens and producing a feature film is, itself, a pretty good argument for the approach.

## FACEBOOK POST

While we were on break, the New York Times published letters responding to "The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right."

This one hit home.

Hicham Oumlil didn't want to homeschool. He pulled his 12-year-old because the schools "seemed to punish difference rather than cultivate potential."

His son was reading above grade level in kindergarten — but was forced to read at grade level anyway. He learned best through play, building systems and studying transit and aviation. The school's response? None of that counted as learning.

"None of us like our current situation," he writes. "But we could not continue placing him in an environment that seemed to punish difference rather than cultivate potential."

Sound familiar?

Drop a comment if you were pushed into homeschooling by a system that couldn't (or wouldn't) meet your kid where they were.

## CAPTION FOR CAROUSEL

Late last year, the New York Times published "The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right" — a viral essay calling for mandatory registration and check-ins for all homeschoolers.

We published our response. (Link in bio.)

But while we were on break, the Times ran something better: letters from actual homeschool families.

A 16-year-old documentary filmmaker. A Brooklyn dad who pulled his gifted son from a system that "punished difference." A Vermont mom who left because public school had become test prep.

Swipe to read what they said.

The common thread? Pro-child. Not pro- or anti- any single approach.

We applaud the Times for publishing the counter-argument.
