Greetings Eddies!

There's a phrase that keeps coming up when I talk to homeschool families who've figured something out.

It's not about curriculum. It's not about schedules. It's about other people—and the strange magic that happens when a few families decide to do this together.

Today's story starts with a mom pulling out her hair. Literally.

Let's dive in.

## "THEY'RE ALL MY KIDS"

Alicia Teitelbaum was drowning. Her second-grader had a speech delay and had spent two years surrounded by masked faces. Her fourth-grader was still catching up after missing weeks with Lyme disease. **"I was literally pulling out chunks of my hair,"** her daughter Evelyn, now 13, [recalled](https://www.governing.com/policy/connecticut-debates-adding-oversight-to-homeschooling).

Teitelbaum had tried being involved at school—PTA, community garden, food-saving program. She felt the school didn't want parents' input. So she pulled her three kids.

But she didn't do it alone.

Three years ago, she founded the Evergreen Co-op Social Club with nine other families in Stamford, Connecticut. They meet at a local church. Classes include jewelry-making, circuits taught by a Navy electrician, and a "Model UN" where kids debate global issues.

When asked about the children in her co-op, Teitelbaum doesn't hesitate: **"They're all my kids."**

She calls it "the village mentality." It's not a phrase. It's how she actually operates.

## CO-OPS DOUBLED

In Maine, [faith-based homeschool co-ops have doubled](https://www.bangordailynews.com/2025/12/18/homestead/maine-homeschool-growth/) since the pandemic. The state now has 6.4% of students homeschooling—nearly double the national average.

The pattern is everywhere. Connecticut families packed the state Capitol 2,150 strong when lawmakers floated new oversight rules. South Dakota logged 143% homeschool growth over the decade. Florida saw 46% growth since 2020.

But the numbers don't capture the texture. What's actually happening is community formation. Families aren't just leaving schools—they're building alternatives together. Co-ops. Pods. Hybrid arrangements. Shared teaching.

The one-room schoolhouse never really died. It just moved to church basements and living rooms.

## MICROSCHOOL IN A BOX

Not everyone has Teitelbaum's energy. That's where [Prenda](https://prenda.com) comes in.

Prenda is a microschool platform that handles the hard parts: curriculum, administrative backend, guide training, and compliance. You provide the space and the kids. They provide everything else.

**How it works:**
- A "guide" (often a parent) hosts 5-10 kids in their home or community space
- Kids use Prenda's self-directed curriculum with guide facilitation
- Prenda handles reporting, legal structure, and ongoing support

Think of it as **"microschool with training wheels."** You get the village model without having to build everything from scratch.

It's not free—funding varies by state, and some families pay out of pocket—but for parents who want community without the full DIY burden, it's the closest thing to a turnkey solution.

The village doesn't have to be homemade. Sometimes it just needs assembly.

That's all for today!
