## X/TWITTER THREAD

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
This week's OpenEd Weekly:

• The 40-year tutoring problem AI might actually solve
• Why "normal" teenagers are actually dysfunctional  
• One word that predicts math success
• 37% of parents rethinking college because of AI

Thread with the highlights 👇

**Tweet 2 (AI Tutoring — Andreessen vs Honeycutt):**
@pmarca predicts every child will have "an AI tutor that is infinitely patient, infinitely compassionate, infinitely knowledgeable."

But @HippyMomPhD (neuroscientist) says: "AI can't think. It learned to predict what usually comes next."

Who's right? Both.

**Tweet 3 (Matt Bateman — Normal Teenagers):**
@mbateman (Guidepost Montessori) argues we've normalized dysfunction:

"What we call 'teenage rebellion' is often just the healthy desire to do real things crashing into systems that only offer fake things."

A developmentally healthy 15yo has a real job with real stakes.

**Tweet 4 (Math Vocabulary — Hechinger):**
New research via @hechingerreport:

Teachers who use more math vocabulary — "factors," "denominators," "multiples" — have students who score significantly higher.

The gap between top and bottom teachers: 4,480 additional math words per year.

---

**Tweet 5 (Justin Skycak — EdTech):**
@justinskycak on why most edtech disappoints:

"If you want to build a serious educational product, you can't be afraid to charge money for it."

Free platforms optimize for engagement. Effective learning often requires the opposite.

**Tweet 6 (Lenore Skenazy):**
Meanwhile, @FreeRangeKids shared this:

"With the best intentions, we often inundate our kids with commentary, limiting their sense of curiosity."

Sometimes the best thing you can do is step back.

---

**Tweet 7 (EdChoice — Debate):**
New from @edchoice:

80% of Americans want debate skills taught in school.

90% of parents agree.

Democrats and Republicans support it at equal levels.

Maybe the one thing we can all agree on.

## SINGLE-POST OPTIONS

**Option A — Math Vocabulary (viral potential):**
New research: Teachers who say "factors" and "denominators" instead of "put together" and "take away" have students who score significantly higher on math tests.

The difference between top and bottom teachers? 4,480 additional math words per year.

Talk nerdy to your kids.

---

**Option B — Matt Bateman (contrarian angle):**
What if "normal" teenagers — phone-addicted, school-hating, sleeping until noon — are actually showing symptoms of developmental dysfunction?

And the kids we call "gifted" are just... developmentally healthy?

@mbateman makes the case: [link]

---

**Option C — AI Tutoring (deep dive promo):**
In 1984, Benjamin Bloom proved tutored students outperform 98% of their peers.

For 40 years, we couldn't afford to tutor every kid.

AI might finally crack it — but only if you know which tools actually work.

We reviewed them: [link]
