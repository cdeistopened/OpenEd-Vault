**Title**: One word that predicts math success

If you're still shaking off the holiday rust, you're not alone.

The first full week back always feels like restarting a car that's been sitting in the cold. The engine turns over, but everything's a little stiff.

This week we're asking whether AI can finally crack the tutoring problem that's stumped educators for 40 years. We're also looking at research that found one surprisingly simple difference between good math teachers and great ones. (Spoiler: it's not experience or credentials.) And we've got a framework from a Montessori founder that might completely change how you see your teenager's "rebellion."

## Can AI Finally Solve the Tutoring Problem?

In 1984, education researcher Benjamin Bloom documented something almost too good to be true: students who received one-on-one tutoring performed two standard deviations better than those in traditional classrooms. The average tutored student outperformed 98% of their peers.

He called it the "2 Sigma Problem." The problem wasn't whether tutoring worked — it worked remarkably well. The problem was economics. You can't hire a personal tutor for every child.

For forty years, educators chased workarounds. None cracked it.

Now tech investor @pmarca predicts "every child will have an AI tutor that is infinitely patient, infinitely compassionate, infinitely knowledgeable." Platforms like Khanmigo, Synthesis, and Math Academy promise personalized instruction without the $100/hour price tag.

But the hype obscures important distinctions.

@HippyMomPhD, a neuroscientist who writes about learning science, puts it plainly: "From the outside, AI looks like it's thinking — but it's not. The creators of AI fed it human-created content. From those billions of words, AI learned to predict what usually comes next."

AI tutors excel at personalized pacing and endless patience. What they can't do is think. They can help your child practice multiplication until it's automatic. They cannot teach them when multiplication is the right tool for a problem they've never seen before.

@justinskycak, who leads curriculum at @_MathAcademy_, has a theory about why so much edtech disappoints: "If you want to build a serious educational product, you can't be afraid to charge money for it." Free platforms optimize for engagement — bright colors, dopamine hits, and low friction. But effective learning often requires the opposite.

## Trends We're Following

**37% of Parents Say AI Changed Their College Expectations**

A Penn Foster survey found that while 84% of parents once assumed their kid would go to college, more than a third have reconsidered thanks to AI. Meanwhile, 41% now prefer apprenticeships or immediate workforce entry over traditional degrees.

**What If "Normal" Teenagers Are Actually Dysfunctional?**

@mbateman (Guidepost Montessori) argues we've normalized dysfunction so completely that healthy teenagers look "gifted." 

His framework: the stereotypical teen — sleeps until noon, glued to phone, hates school, rebels against everything — isn't "just how teenagers are." It's a symptom. 

A developmentally healthy teen wakes up with things she wants to accomplish, asks uncomfortable questions, and by 15, has a real job with real stakes. 

"What we call 'teenage rebellion' is often just the healthy desire to do real things crashing into systems that only offer fake things."

**Talk Nerdy to Me: Math Vocabulary Predicts Student Success**

A Harvard/Stanford study (via @hechingerreport) found that teachers who used more mathematical vocabulary — words like "factors," "denominators," and "multiples" — had students who scored significantly higher on math tests. 

The boost amounted to about half the benefit of having a highly effective teacher. 

The top quarter of teachers used at least 28 more math terms per lesson than the bottom quarter. Over a school year, that's 4,480 additional math words.

**80% of Americans Want Debate Skills Taught in School**

New @edchoice polling found overwhelming support for teaching civil debate — using evidence, taking turns, arguing both sides — in middle and high school. 

Parents are even more on board: nearly 90% want it. Democrats and Republicans support it at equal levels.

## Tools Worth Bookmarking

**Two-Week Learning Sprints** — From the Open Education book: Create a Discovery Zone (wall, poster board, back of a door). Post five questions about interests and strengths. Give everyone colored sticky notes. Over one week, add thoughts whenever inspiration strikes. Then pick one interest per person for a two-week "learning sprint."

**Braided Learning** (via @Getting_Smart) — Use AI transcription to identify themes across student reflections in minutes. The AI doesn't replace your judgment — it gives you clarity about what students are actually thinking, in time to do something about it.

**AI Tutoring Tools Worth Trying:**
• Khan Academy (free) — starting point for most families
• Khanmigo ($4/mo) — conversational AI tutoring
• Math Academy ($49/mo) — serious acceleration
• Synthesis ($35/yr via OpenEd) — collaborative problem-solving
• Duolingo (free) — languages

**Ignoring My Kids Is My Love Language** — @FreeRangeKids shared this: "With the best intentions, we often inundate our kids with commentary, limiting their sense of curiosity." Sometimes the best thing you can do is step back.

## From the NYT Letters

While we were on break, the New York Times published letters responding to "The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right."

The counter-arguments were better than anything we could have written.

Mason Ember is 16 years old. He's spent the last year filming a documentary called Against the Grade (@againstthegrade on Instagram) about homeschooled teenagers. His letter: "In education we should be pro-child, not always pro-home-schooling, but certainly against 'one size fits all' institutionalism."

Hicham Oumlil, a Brooklyn father, didn't want to homeschool. He pulled his 12-year-old because the schools "seemed to punish difference rather than cultivate potential."

Elissa Kellner: "Many of us choose to home-school directly in response to the rise in standardized testing. Much of public education now revolves around honing test-taking skills at the expense of actual learning."

**Sound familiar?** Were you pushed into homeschooling by a system that couldn't meet your kid where they were? Reply — we'd love to hear your story.
