## OPENING LETTER

Greetings Eddies!

If you're still shaking off the holiday rust, you're not alone.

The first full week back always feels like restarting a car that's been sitting in the cold. The engine turns over, but everything's a little stiff.

Good news: Ed kept the content machine warm while we were away. This week we're asking whether AI can finally crack the tutoring problem that's stumped educators for 40 years. We're also looking at research that found one surprisingly simple difference between good math teachers and great ones. (Spoiler: it's not experience or credentials.) And we've got a framework from a Montessori founder that might completely change how you see your teenager's "rebellion."

Plus: the New York Times published letters responding to that viral homeschooling hit piece — and the counter-arguments practically wrote themselves.

Let's ease into it.

## DEEP DIVE: Can AI Finally Solve the Tutoring Problem?

In 1984, education researcher Benjamin Bloom documented something almost too good to be true: students who received one-on-one tutoring performed two standard deviations better than those in traditional classrooms. The average tutored student outperformed 98% of their peers.

He called it the "2 Sigma Problem." The problem wasn't whether tutoring worked — it worked remarkably well. The problem was economics. You can't hire a personal tutor for every child.

For forty years, educators chased workarounds. None cracked it.

Now tech investor Marc Andreessen predicts "every child will have an AI tutor that is infinitely patient, infinitely compassionate, infinitely knowledgeable." Platforms like Khanmigo, Synthesis, and Math Academy promise personalized instruction without the $100/hour price tag.

But the hype obscures important distinctions.

[Dr. Claire Honeycutt](https://www.clarified.life/), a neuroscientist who writes about learning science, puts it plainly: "From the outside, AI looks like it's thinking — but it's not. The creators of AI fed it human-created content. From those billions of words, AI learned to predict what usually comes next."

AI tutors excel at personalized pacing and endless patience. What they can't do is think. They can help your child practice multiplication until it's automatic. They cannot teach them when multiplication is the right tool for a problem they've never seen before.

[Justin Skycak](https://www.justinmath.com/), who leads curriculum at Math Academy, has a theory about why so much edtech disappoints: "If you want to build a serious educational product, you can't be afraid to charge money for it." Free platforms optimize for engagement — bright colors, dopamine hits, and low friction. But effective learning often requires the opposite.

The full guide breaks down what works, what doesn't, and how to build your own stack without spending Alpha School money ($30-65K/year). We cover math, languages, science, and why the $49/month option might actually be worth it in some cases.

## TRENDS WE'RE FOLLOWING

**37% of Parents Say AI Changed Their College Expectations**

[A Penn Foster survey reported by USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/economy/2025/12/24/college-or-training-ai-future/87898126007/) found that while 84% of parents once assumed their kid would go to college, more than a third have reconsidered thanks to AI. Meanwhile, 41% now prefer apprenticeships or immediate workforce entry over traditional degrees, and 55% feel anxious about whether their child is prepared for an AI-driven job market. The diploma credential is no longer the automatic answer.

**What If "Normal" Teenagers Are Actually Dysfunctional?**

[Matt Bateman](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-198-what-does-it-mean), a philosophy PhD who helped found Guidepost Montessori, argues we've normalized dysfunction so completely that healthy teenagers look "gifted." His framework: the stereotypical teen — sleeps until noon, glued to phone, hates school, rebels against everything — isn't "just how teenagers are." It's a symptom. A developmentally healthy teen wakes up with things she wants to accomplish, asks uncomfortable questions, and by 15, has a real job with real stakes. "What we call 'teenage rebellion' is often just the healthy desire to do real things crashing into systems that only offer fake things."

**Talk Nerdy to Me: Math Vocabulary Predicts Student Success**

[A Harvard/Stanford study covered by the Hechinger Report](https://hechingerreport.org/proof-points-math-vocabulary/) found that teachers who used more mathematical vocabulary — words like "factors," "denominators," and "multiples" — had students who scored significantly higher on math tests. The boost amounted to about half the benefit of having a highly effective teacher. The top quarter of teachers used at least 28 more math terms per lesson than the bottom quarter. Over a school year, that's 4,480 additional math words. Some teachers worry formal language will confuse students, but students ultimately need to understand how "put together" corresponds to addition.

**80% of Americans Want Debate Skills Taught in School**

[New EdChoice polling](https://www.edchoice.org/2025-your-kids-should-be-debating/) found overwhelming support for teaching civil debate — using evidence, taking turns, arguing both sides — in middle and high school. About half feel strongly about it. Parents are even more on board: nearly 90% want it, with two-thirds saying it's very or extremely important. The most popular approach? Integrating debate into existing required classes like reading or social studies. Democrats and Republicans support it at equal levels.

## TOOLS WE'RE BOOKMARKING

**[Two-Week Learning Sprints](https://opened.co/book)** — From the [*Open Education*](https://opened.co/book) book bonus material: Create a Discovery Zone (wall, poster board, back of a door). Post five questions about interests and strengths. Give everyone colored sticky notes. Over one week, add thoughts whenever inspiration strikes. Then pick one interest per person for a two-week "learning sprint." The hard part isn't the system — it's trusting your kid's curiosity over a pacing guide written for 30 strangers.

**[Braided Learning: AI as Teaching Assistant](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2026/01/05/braided-learning-how-ai-can-enhance-what-educators-already-do-well/)** — In this [Getting Smart piece](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2026/01/05/braided-learning-how-ai-can-enhance-what-educators-already-do-well/), Sarah teaches AP Environmental Science. Her students recorded 28 video reflections after a field study. In previous years, she'd watch all 28 in one exhausting evening. This year, she used AI transcription to identify themes in minutes. The AI didn't replace her judgment — it gave her clarity about what students were actually thinking, in time to do something about it.

**Pick a Curriculum and Stick With It** — [A Reddit mom of five](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1q3asc1/considering_homeschooling_warning_insanely_long/) (two now in college with 4.0 GPAs) shares her hard-won advice: "Bouncing around and changing every year opens you to gaps." Her other wisdom: If you must go to a homeschool expo, only go to one — and only when you're already established as a homeschooler. Don't try to do it all.

**[Ignoring My Kids Is My Love Language](https://www.todaysparent.com/family/ignoring-my-kids-love-language/)** — [Lenore Skenazy](https://x.com/FreeRangeKids/status/2008565614097657856) shared this [Today's Parent piece](https://www.todaysparent.com/family/ignoring-my-kids-love-language/): "With the best intentions, we often inundate our kids with commentary, limiting their sense of curiosity." Sometimes the best thing you can do is step back.

**AI Tutoring Tools Worth Trying** — From this week's Deep Dive: [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) (free) is the starting point for most families. Add [Khanmigo](https://www.khanmigo.ai/) ($4/month) for conversational AI tutoring. [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/) ($49/month) is for serious acceleration — users report compressing multiple grade levels. [Synthesis](https://www.synthesis.com/) ($35/year via OpenEd) focuses on collaborative problem-solving. For languages, [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) is the obvious free option; [Studycat](https://studycat.com/) ($8/month) works well for ages 3-8.

## ED'S STABLE

While we were on break, the New York Times published [letters responding to "The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right"](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/opinion/letters-home-schooling.html) — the viral essay from December that called for mandatory registration and check-ins for all homeschoolers.

The counter-arguments were better than anything we could have written.

Mason Ember is 16 years old. He's spent the last year filming a feature-length documentary called [*Against the Grade*](https://www.againstthegrade.com/) about homeschooled teenagers in the New York City area. His letter to the Times: "In education we should be pro-child, not always pro-home-schooling, but certainly against 'one size fits all' institutionalism."

Hicham Oumlil, a Brooklyn father, didn't want to homeschool. He pulled his 12-year-old because the schools "seemed to punish difference rather than cultivate potential." His son was reading above grade level in kindergarten but was forced to read at grade level anyway. He learned best through play — building systems, studying transit and aviation — but none of it counted as learning.

Elissa Kellner pushed back on the assumption that standardized testing is the solution: "Many of us choose to home-school directly in response to the rise in standardized testing. Much of public education now revolves around honing test-taking skills at the expense of actual learning."

We applaud the Times for featuring the counter-argument. And we're looking forward to seeing Mason's documentary when it comes out later this year.

**Sound familiar?** Were you pushed into homeschooling by a system that couldn't meet your kid where they were? Reply to this email — we'd love to hear your story.
