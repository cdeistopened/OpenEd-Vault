## Braided Learning: How AI Can Enhance What Educators Already Do Well (1)

Sarah teaches AP Environmental Science. Last week, after a field study at the local creek, her students recorded video reflections on their phones about what they noticed, what surprised them, and what questions emerged. In previous years, Sarah would have watched all 28 videos in one exhausting evening, taking notes and planning follow-up conversations she’d never quite have time for.

This year, she tried something different. She used a free AI transcription tool to capture what students said, then asked an AI assistant to identify themes across the reflections, looking for patterns or misconceptions. Within minutes, Sarah had a summary. Six students noticed equity issues around creek access. Twelve connected water quality to the policy unit they’d studied in the fall. Four expressed frustration with data collection methods and wanted to redesign their approach.

Sarah didn’t hand this summary to students as “the answer.” She used it to inform the next day’s seminar. She asked the equity-focused group to lead a discussion. She connected the policy students with the local environmental council’s youth board. She gave the four frustrated learners time to redesign and retest their methods.

The AI didn’t replace Sarah’s judgment. It gave her something she rarely has: clarity about what 28 students were actually thinking, in time to do something about it.

This is braided learning. *Not AI instead of teachers.* AI woven together with what educators already do well (noticing, connecting, responding) to create something stronger than either strand alone.

## **Three Strands That Strengthen Each Other**

Think of braided learning as three interwoven strands, each essential, each amplifying the others.

### **Strand One: What Educators Do Best**

You already notice things AI cannot. The student who suddenly engages after weeks of silence. The moment when a skill clicks and transfers to a new context. You build relationships, create psychological safety, and help students see themselves as capable. 

These human capacities (empathy, pattern recognition across time, responsive teaching) are irreplaceable. They can also be constrained by time, energy, and the reality of working with many students simultaneously.

### **Strand Two: What AI Does Easily**

AI excels at tasks that are tedious for humans: transcribing conversations, organizing information, identifying patterns across large sets of data, suggesting connections between ideas. It works instantly, tirelessly, without judgment.

AI can transcribe 28 video reflections in minutes. It can track which students have demonstrated specific skills and which haven’t. It can flag when a student’s writing suggests frustration or confusion. It can surface connections between a student’s creek study and their earlier policy research.

But AI doesn’t know your students. It can’t read the room. It doesn’t understand context the way you do. It suggests; it doesn’t decide.

### **Strand Three: What Emerges When You Braid Them**

When you weave AI’s organizational power together with your expertise, something new becomes possible. You spend less time on logistical tasks and more time on the high-value work only humans can do. Students receive more timely, specific feedback. Patterns that would take you hours to notice become visible in minutes. Learning becomes more connected across contexts because you have the cognitive space to help students make those connections.

This isn’t about AI transforming education. It’s about AI handling routine cognitive tasks so you can focus on transformational teaching.

### **A Practical Cycle: Where to Braid AI Into Your Current Practice**

You don’t need a comprehensive AI strategy or new infrastructure. You can start with one phase of learning you already facilitate. Here’s a simple cycle showing where AI might enhance what you already do.

### **Preparing for Learning**

- **What you already do:** Activate prior knowledge, set learning intentions, help students prepare mentally and emotionally for challenging work.
- **Where AI could help:** Generate discussion prompts tailored to individual readiness levels. Provide adaptive practice that adjusts to student responses. Transcribe student goal-setting conversations so you have a record of their intentions.
- **What students experience:** More personalized entry points into new content. Clear connections between what they already know and what they’re about to learn.

**Example**: Before a unit on data analysis, students voice-record their current understanding of statistics and their anxieties about math. AI transcribes these reflections and identifies common concerns. You design your introduction to address those specific worries, and you follow up individually with students who expressed the most anxiety.

### **Learning in Context**

- **What you already do:** Create opportunities for students to practice skills in authentic situations like projects, discussions, field work, and presentations.
- **Where AI could help:** Observe and document what happens during application (when you can’t be everywhere at once). Track which skills students demonstrate in different contexts. Provide real-time resource suggestions when students get stuck.
- **What students experience:** Less waiting for feedback. More awareness of which skills they’re using. Better documentation of their learning process, not just final products.

**Example:** During a group project, students document their process with photos and brief voice notes. AI organizes these into a timeline showing collaboration moments, problem-solving strategies, and skill demonstrations. You review the timeline and notice one student consistently mediating conflicts, maybe a leadership skill she hasn’t recognized in herself yet. Your feedback helps her see this pattern.

### **Making Learning Visible**

- **What you already do:** Ask students to reflect on what they learned, how they learned it, and what it means for future learning. Help them recognize growth and develop metacognitive awareness.
- **Where AI could help:** Transcribe reflections so you can analyze themes across multiple students. Identify emotional language that suggests frustration, breakthrough moments, or confusion. Track growth over time by comparing current reflections to earlier ones.
- **What students experience:** Conversations about their reflections that show you actually engaged with their thinking. Surprise and pride when you show them how much they’ve grown since earlier reflections.

**Example**: After completing projects, students record video reflections. AI transcribes them and flags moments when students express pride, frustration, or uncertainty. You notice eight students expressed frustration with the same aspect of the project. In the next class, you address this directly, validating their experience and teaching a strategy you realize you hadn’t made explicit.

### **Planning Next Steps**

- **What you already do:** Help students set goals, choose new challenges, connect current learning to future opportunities.
- **Where AI could help:** Synthesize a student’s demonstrated skills and interests to suggest relevant next opportunities. Connect current work to future contexts where those skills matter. Create a *running record* of competencies students can use to advocate for themselves.
- **What students experience:** A clearer picture of what they can do and where they might go next. Connections between seemingly separate projects or skills.

**Example:** A student has demonstrated strong data analysis in science and written compelling arguments in English. AI surfaces this pattern, analytical thinking across contexts, and suggests she might be interested in the school’s policy debate team or the city council’s youth advisory board. You have a conversation with her about how her skills could translate to civic engagement. She applies, using documentation from both classes to show her readiness.

## **Starting Small: A First Experiment**

You don’t need to braid AI into all four phases at once. Pick one place where you’re already stretched thin.

- **If grading reflections feels overwhelming:** Try having students submit voice or video reflections instead of written ones. Use free AI transcription, then have AI summarize themes across all students. Use this summary to inform a class discussion rather than grading each reflection individually.
- **If tracking skill development across projects is difficult:** At the end of each project, have students identify which skills they demonstrated. Collect these self-assessments in a shared document. Ask AI to create a simple matrix showing which students have demonstrated which skills across time. Use this to spot gaps and plan differentiation.
- **If students struggle to connect learning across classes:** When students complete significant work, have them briefly describe what skills they used. Periodically ask AI to look across these descriptions and identify patterns—which skills appear repeatedly, which contexts bring out different capabilities. Share these patterns with students to help them see themselves as transferring skills, not just completing assignments.
- **If you want better discussions but need help preparing:** Before a discussion, have students submit one question or observation. Ask AI to group similar ideas and identify interesting tensions or disagreements. Use this structure to design the discussion arc, ensuring you’re building on what students are actually thinking about.

## **What to Watch For: Braiding vs. Offloading**

As you experiment, you’ll notice when braiding strengthens your teaching and when it starts to replace essential human judgment.

**Braiding looks like:****Offloading looks like:**You have more time for the students who most need your attention.
Feedback becomes more timely and specific.
Patterns you suspected become visible and actionable.
Students receive more personalized support.
You feel less overwhelmed by logisticsStudents receive AI-generated feedback without your review.
You trust AI insights without checking against your own observations.
Learning feels more standardized, not more personalized.
You spend less time actually talking with students.
Assessment becomes about what AI can measure rather than what matters.

The goal isn’t efficiency for its own sake. It’s reclaiming your time and attention for the irreplaceable work of teaching, the *noticing*, the *relationship-building*, the magical moment when you help a student see what they’re capable of.

## **An Invitation, Not a Prescription**

This isn’t about adopting a comprehensive new system. It’s about finding one place where AI could handle a routine cognitive task so you can focus on what you do best. Try one small experiment. See what you notice. Adjust based on what serves your students.

The future of education isn’t AI versus teachers. It’s AI woven together with teaching expertise, creating space for more of the human work that transforms learning. The strands are stronger together than apart. Start with one thread. Then another. Then another.

### **Hey, y’all!**

This week from Austin Scholar...

1. What does it mean to be a “normal” kid?
2. Scholar’s Sources: My 2026 reading list

I can’t believe it’s 2026! Looking back on last year, I feel that I explored learning about a multitude of interests (investing, documentaries, sports analytics, etc.). However, I want to spend this next year focusing more on doing things, even if I’m not yet an expert. For example, I’ve been really anxious about starting to invest even a little bit of my money because I don’t think I know everything possible about investing. But this year, I want to work through that anxiety and just do it. My sister said this is my Nike year, so that’s going to be my motto for the year, as cheesy as it sounds.

### What does it mean to be a “normal” kid?

Throughout my winter break, I’ve been obsessing over [this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Anau5CFyeos) by Matt Bateman that forces parents to rethink how they interact with and view their kids. Over the next three weeks, I’m going to walk you through his framework for understanding child development, starting with teenagers today, then rewinding to elementary kids, and finally looking at early childhood. By the end, you might realize that everything you’re worried about with your kid is actually a sign they’re developing perfectly – and that everything you think is fine might be the real problem.

Before we dive in, let me tell you why you should care what Matt Bateman thinks about your teenager.

Matt’s a philosophy PhD from UPenn who walked away from academia to actually figure out how kids should grow up. For the past decade, he’s been deep in the Montessori world.

He helped found Higher Ground Education and their network of [Guidepost Montessori](https://guidepostmontessori.com/) schools, and now he’s working with [Montessorium](https://montessorium.com/) and [Alpha School](https://alpha.school/). Matt has two young kids of his own, so he’s also living this experiment in real-time.

His presentation basically asks: What if we’ve been thinking about “normal” backward this entire time?

Picture this: It’s 1955. You walk into a restaurant and half the people are smoking. Your best friend smokes. Your kid’s teacher smokes. Your doctor smokes.

Smoking used to be completely normalized. The people saying “maybe we shouldn’t fill our lungs with poison” were the weird ones.

Fast forward to today. Can you imagine smoking in a restaurant? In a school? The thought is absurd. Yet in the 1950s, it was completely normal.

This distinction of “normal” is important. There are two kinds of normal: normal as in “healthy” (lungs with no smoke damage), and normal as in “typical” (lungs with smoke damage, as of the 1950s). When smoking went out of vogue, the actual normal (healthy lungs) and the typical normal intersected. We collectively realized we’d been calling poison normal and health weird.

Matt’s argument? We’re living in 1955 when it comes to child development. We’ve normalized dysfunction so completely that when we see a healthy teenager, we think they’re “gifted” or “exceptional” or that their parents must be tiger-momming them into submission.

When you think about a stereotypical teenager, these things probably come to mind:

- Sleeps until noon
- Fights about everything
- Glued to their phone
- Hates school
- Eye-rolls as primary communication
- Anxious about everything
- Rebels against any structure

When explaining this behavior, something like “That’s just how teenagers are. Their brains aren’t fully developed” is pretty common.

But Matt points out that these “typical” teenage behaviors are actually symptoms of developmental dysfunction. Here’s how Matt explains what a developmentally healthy teenager looks like:

She wakes up with things she wants to accomplish. Not because someone’s making her, but because she’s genuinely excited about her projects. Maybe she’s building an app that people actually use. Maybe she’s writing stories that strangers on the internet read. Maybe she’s teaching herself calculus because she needs it for the game she’s designing.

When she’s 13, she starts asking uncomfortable questions like: “Why am I spending seven hours a day in school if I could learn this faster on my own?” Or “Is watching Netflix actually making me happy?” Or my personal favorite: “What’s the point of doing fake problems when real problems exist?”

By 15, she has an actual job. Not volunteer hours for college applications. Not helping out at dad’s office. A real job where she can get fired, where she deals with difficult customers, where she learns that showing up late has consequences way more educational than detention.

She still makes mistakes, of course. Tons of them. She’s awkward sometimes. She fails at things. But here’s the key difference: She’s failing at real things with real stakes, not fake assignments with fake deadlines.

It turns out, what we call “teenage rebellion” is often just the healthy desire to do real things crashing into systems that only offer fake things.

Think about it. Your teenager spends seven hours in school doing practice problems, writing essays that only teachers read, doing “group projects” that have zero impact on the world. Then they come home to more fake work (homework), followed by fake extracurriculars (activities done for college apps, not genuine interest).

And then we wonder why they’re “rebellious.” They’re not rebelling against authority, they’re rebelling against artificiality. They know, deep in their bones, that they should be doing something that matters. And we keep telling them to wait, be patient, it’ll matter someday when you get to college, when you get a job, when you’re an adult.

But Matt explains that teenagers who do real things now become adults who thrive. Teenagers who do fake things become adults who... need therapy to figure out what they actually want.

Alright, enough theory. Let’s get practical. Here’s exactly how to help your teenager become actually “normal:”

**Action Item #1: Just do it**

Help your teenager start something real – something that they value.

Sit down with your teen one weekend. Ask:

- What problems do you notice that bug you?
- What do you wish existed that doesn’t?
- What are you naturally doing when procrastinating?
- What YouTube rabbit holes do you fall into?

Together, research whether their interest can become real:

- Can they find an audience for this? (Search Reddit, Discord, TikTok)
- What’s the smallest version they could create this week?
- Who’s already doing something similar? (This is good—it means there’s demand)

Help them create Version 0.1:

- Writer? Set up a Substack and publish one post
- Coder? Put one simple tool on GitHub
- Artist? Post one piece on Instagram with relevant hashtags
- Musician? Upload one song to SoundCloud
- Gamer? Stream one session on Twitch

The quality doesn’t matter. The audience size doesn’t matter. What matters is that it’s real and visible to actual humans who aren’t their parents or teachers.

If they enjoyed their time, expand the project:

- Set a consistent schedule (every Sunday, every other day, whatever’s sustainable)
- Track real metrics (views, comments, users)
- Iterate based on actual feedback (not theoretical rubrics)

If they didn’t love this project, try again with something new.

**Action Item #2: Getting a job**

Stop thinking “they’re too young to work.” They’re not. Here’s your 30-day plan:

Start by helping them list everything they can do:

- Tech skills (yes, being good at TikTok counts)
- Academic strengths they could tutor
- Physical abilities (sports, music, art)
- Things adults find annoying to do themselves

Then research together: What do people pay for these skills? Check Fiverr, TaskRabbit, local Facebook groups.

Then make it real:

- Write an actual resume (even if it’s short)
- Take a professional photo (not a school photo)
- Set up a basic website or at least a LinkedIn
- Draft a standard intro email

Don’t do this for them. You can sit beside them and be a guide, but they have to do the typing.

Then, apply to 5 real opportunities:

- 2 “stretch” jobs they probably won’t get
- 2 “match” jobs they’re qualified for
- 1 “safety” job they’re overqualified for

For teenagers under 16: Start with neighbors (tutoring, tech help, pet care), then expand to local businesses (many will hire at 14-15 with work permits).

For 16+: Retail, food service, and internships are all game.

When they get hired (and they will):

- Open a real bank account
- Set up direct deposit
- Download the bank app on their phone
- Discuss taxes
- Let them decide how to spend their first paycheck

**Action Item #3: Respect their time**

When your teenager says something is “a waste of time,” don’t dismiss it as teenage attitude. Engage with it seriously. They’re developing the ability to evaluate whether activities align with their goals. Of course, sometimes you have to establish authority as a parent and make sure they go to church or to dinner with their grandparents, but other times it’s important to work through how they’re spending their time with them.

### How to help The Anxious Generation (without ignoring innovation)

Jonathan Haidt’s [*The Anxious Generation*](https://www.amazon.com/Anxious-Generation-Rewiring-Childhood-Epidemic/dp/0593655036) has parents everywhere rethinking their kids’ relationship with technology. The book argues that the “Great Rewiring” of childhood between 2010 and 2015 (when smartphones and social media became ubiquitous) fundamentally broke something in how kids develop.

The data is, unfortunately, clear: rates of depression and anxiety among teens, particularly girls, skyrocketed around 2012, coinciding precisely with the mass adoption of smartphones.

Haidt’s solution is essentially to turn back the clock. No smartphones before high school. No social media before 16. Phone-free schools. More unsupervised outdoor play. His argument rests on the idea that screens are inherently harmful to development, and that the virtual world can never replace what the physical world offers. As a teen in the smartphone era (who has written extensively about social media and mental health), but also a teen at a school that uses almost entirely screens (and who has written about that too), I have complicated thoughts on the matter.

There’s a fascinating tension between Haidt’s hypothesis and what works at Alpha School (and in innovative education more broadly). Haidt sees technology as a problem, but programs like Alpha prove that it can actually be the most powerful learning accelerator ever created when used correctly.

Haidt identifies four foundational harms caused by a phone-based childhood: social deprivation (kids spending less time face-to-face), sleep deprivation (the blue light special that keeps everyone scrolling past midnight), attention fragmentation (hundreds of notifications daily destroying focus), and addiction (apps designed like slot machines to maximize engagement).

He’s particularly concerned about what he calls the shift from “discover mode” to “defend mode.” When kids engage in risky outdoor play such as climbing trees or navigating conflicts on the playground, they operate in “discover mode,” building resilience and confidence as they take risks and explore the world around them. But constant digital stimulation and social comparison online keeps them stuck in “defend mode,” anxious and reactive. This teaches kids to primarily focus on safety, hindering their learning and growth.

The gender differences he identifies are also important to recognize. Girls suffer more from social media’s visual comparison culture and relational aggression, while boys retreat into video games and online spaces, experiencing what Haidt calls “failure to launch,” unable to transition to real-world adulthood.

Haidt explains how allowing kids unlimited screen time is like sending them to colonize Mars without considering how the alien environment will affect their development. The low gravity (lack of real-world resistance) and high radiation (toxic online culture) create a generation of kids who look human but have been fundamentally altered by their environment.

Here’s where Alpha’s 2 Hour Learning approach diverges radically from Haidt’s diagnosis. There’s no disagreement that screen time can be harmful, and that mindless scrolling, comparison-driven social media, and addictive gaming absolutely damage kids’ development. But condemning all technology because of bad technology is like banning all books because some are poorly written.

At Alpha, students spend their mornings on AI-powered learning apps that adjust in real-time to their exact knowledge level, turning what used to take 6-8 hours of traditional schooling into 2 hours of focused learning. But this isn’t the “attention fragmentation” Haidt warns about; it’s the opposite. It’s deep, personalized engagement with material that meets students exactly where they are.

The difference comes down to intentionality and design. Social media apps are engineered to maximize engagement at any cost, using what Haidt correctly identifies as “variable-ratio reinforcement schedules,” which is the same psychological mechanism that makes gambling addictive. But educational technology can be designed with completely different incentives: mastery instead of engagement, growth instead of comparison, creation instead of consumption.

Consider how Alpha students use AI tools. They’re not passively consuming content – they’re actively creating, researching, and problem-solving. When a student uses AI to explore their interest in marine biology or accelerate their understanding of calculus, they’re in ultimate “discover” mode, just digitally enhanced rather than digitally impaired.

The real insight isn’t choosing between Haidt’s no-tech childhood and Alpha’s tech-enabled learning. It’s understanding that different types of technology serve radically different purposes, and that age-appropriate implementation matters enormously.

Haidt’s absolutely right about several things:

- Young kids need massive amounts of unstructured, physical play. The sensory integration, risk assessment, and social negotiation that happens on playgrounds can’t be replicated on screens. This is why Alpha’s 2 Hour Learning model is so powerful – it frees up 4-6 hours daily for exactly the kind of real-world exploration Haidt champions.
- Social media before 16 is largely destructive. The adolescent brain, especially during what Haidt calls the “sensitive period” of puberty, is uniquely vulnerable to social comparison and peer pressure. Instagram at 13 is like giving a kid the keys to a psychological torture chamber they’re neurologically unequipped to escape. That’s why it’s critical to teach your kid [how to use social media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpfEpWq6-V8).
- Attention fragmentation is real. The constant interruptions from notifications, the switching between apps, the shallow engagement with multiple streams of content…this genuinely impairs deep thinking and focus development.

But here’s where I disagree with Haidt: technology can also solve these problems when deployed thoughtfully.

Drawing from both Haidt’s research and Alpha’s experience, here’s how to create the best of both worlds:

## Considering homeschooling? (Warning, insanely LONG post) : r/homeschool (1)

More and more people are considering homeschooling and I hear the same thing frequently: I want to/my child wants to/it would be better for them..buuuuuut.....I'm not smart enough, I'm not social enough, I'm not patient enough, I'm not organized enough, I'm not whatever enough.

Let me tell you about me. I'm not organized. I'm sanguine ADD. I'm a poor planner and pretty much live behind the 8-ball. Every day I'm surprised at 6pm when it's time for dinner and I'm suddenly trying to thaw a 10lb roast to have ready for dinner at 7. I'm a night owl and would prefer to live back side of the clock.

But I am successfully homeschooling. Of my 5 homeschooled, 2 have graduated and are in excellent state universities and both have a 4.0 (one is a second year, and the other is a 3rd year). My next is on track for attending a prominent state school in the fall. They are all well socialized, are engaged in friend groups, work groups, church groups, and extracurricular activities. They are all super close with each other and have beautiful relationships between themselves.

Most considering homeschooling think you have to be darn near perfect. You must be in every homeschool group, extracurricular activity, playdates a few times week and every weekend, library day, nature walk day, art camp day, etc, etc. No! Stop the insanity!

Here are some things I recommend, and things my children replied with when I asked what they love(d) and hate(d) about homeschool.

My recs (in my squirrel-brained, no particular order):

- Pick a curriculum and stick with it. Bouncing around and changing every year opens you to gaps.

- If you must go to a hs expo, only go to one...and only when you are already established as a homeschooler.

- Do not do foreign language on your own. Pay for an in-person or live online class.

- If you are able, enroll in an accredited program. This sets up college-bound children better and makes your life easier.

- Pick and choose your activities but be consistent and do *not* try to do it all. Children do not need to be out of the house every day of the week doing a different activity, esp those with siblings.

- Do what works for you and your family - Not what works best for your friend who homeschools, or the co-op leader's hs, or your own hs if you grew up hs'd. Every situation, every schedule, every family, every scenario is unique. Embrace the uniqueness and don't worry about what everyone else does. Get ideas and then see how they play into or improve your hs. Throw out what doesn't work for you. Don't force a "good idea" if it doesn't work in your situation.

- From the instant your child(ren) can sit in your lap and listen, even if it's only for one minute at first, read to them! Every.single.day. Without fail. You will not struggle nearly as much teaching phonics and reading. And, the time together is precious and invaluable.

My children's comments:

- they appreciate that I never spoke to them like babies. I used normal words, oftentimes "big" words, and their vocabulary shows it.

- they appreciate that I was honest - in everything. My weaknesses and faults, what I thought about a subject or a required book, etc.

- they appreciate the discussions that school always led to, even if it got us behind.

- the love the time we spend as a family and some of their best times were when we would all curl up in bed and have story/reading time at nights and/or on rainy, cold days, or when we were all too tired to do actual schooling.

-they hated trying to learn foreign language from a book and mp4s. I switched the younger ones to live online.

- they had a love/hate relationship with the constantly changing or lack of schedule. They think it made them more flexible as older children/adults, but eating dinner at 9 and going to bed at 11 and then getting up at 7 or 8 or 9 - depending on what we had going on was difficult.

- they wish they'd had more structure (this from the older ones. I've improved on this a bit for the ones still at home)

- they hated having school when their friends had snow days lol

- and another one built on that and said, yeah, and when we are sick we still have to do school in bed!

- they say that they didn't love hanging out with kids in the hs groups. They all found these groups and meetups to be awkward and forced. Ultimately they preferred organic relationships developed with people they met/know from church, from the neighborhood, and from extracurricular activities.

If you made it to the end of this post, wow! I don't think I could have!! lol But I hope something I wrote helps someone considering this journey.

## Waking up??? Structured daily wake up time or naturally waking up? : r/homeschool (1)

I’m curious to know your thoughts on waking up. Do you have a structured daily wake up time or do let your kids wake up naturally?

I know the real answer is “whatever works best for your family.” However, I’m struggling with this. I want them to wake up naturally for their cognitive health, but I also want them to have a consistent routine and be ready for the “real world.”

Our info:

-We started home educating 3 months ago

-I work from home with a flexible schedule

-10 and 12 y/o

-They attend an online private school, self-paced

-They have a bedtime since DH has to get up early

Thoughts?

## What are you teaching outside of academia? : r/homeschool (1)

What are you doing that you wouldn’t typically see done in public school? Since we have so much extra time now, we want to really take advantage of the time and the eagerness to learn. 11 years old. Super active, and no co-ops. Certifications, safety, all kinds of things to learn that could be helpful, even some other fun extras. Our homeschooling scholarship covers $10k a year of educational products, supplies and classes/extracurriculars.

## Your Kids Should Be Debating (1)

![](https://www.edchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AdobeStock_561870135-1520x957.jpeg)

The window between Thanksgiving and Christmas is an essential time to brush up on your debate skills. Whether your Thanksgiving conversations were about the best type of pie for the holiday (it’s pumpkin) or less serious topics like politics, you have about a month between family gatherings to prepare for the next lively discussion at Christmas dinner. But are the kids in your family also preparing accordingly?

Well, Americans and parents agree they should be.

In our [November polling](https://edchoice.mcdatahub.com/edchoice/Reports/Adults_Aug_Nov_25.pdf), we asked new questions about teaching debate skills in school. EdChoice and Morning Consult fielded this nationally representative survey of adults (N = 2,253) and parents (N = 1,303) from November 14 to 16.

We asked how important it is that students learn civil debate skills at school. For context, we provided examples of core debate skills that students could learn, like using evidence, taking turns in a debate, and learning how to argue both sides of an issue.

The vast majority of Americans (about 80%) say it’s important for students to learn civil debate skills as part of their school curriculum in middle school and high school. About half feel strongly about this, saying that it’s very or extremely important.

Parents are even more on board. Almost 90% of parents want students to learn debate skills at school, with about two-thirds saying it’s very or extremely important.

![](https://www.edchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/a9ceee68-db59-4677-b634-b4e67a22684b_1125x662-1.png)

As a follow up, we asked how schools should teach debate and civil discourse. Where does debate best fit in the curriculum?

By far, the most popular approach is integrating opportunities to learn debate skills into existing required classes, like reading or social studies. About a third of Americans and parents support that approach.

Roughly a quarter of respondents support a stand-alone elective course that students can choose to take, particularly at the high school level.

![](https://www.edchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/761616b2-9fc2-494f-adbf-f91368562a89_1141x660.png)

In whatever form it takes, people see a clear need for students to learn the skills to debate ideas and have civic discussions in a civil way.

It’s not hard to imagine why. This year, the news has been dominated by political commentary and debate. But—going back to our core debate skills taught in schools – it’s often debate conducted without evidence, with little regard for taking turns, and with apathy or disdain for trying to understand both sides of issues. In other words, our civil discourse has not been very *civil*.

On a brighter note, teaching students how to engage in civil discourse is a bipartisan priority. Our survey found that Democrats and Republicans both support teaching civil debate skills—and, compellingly, they support it at equal levels.

If we can teach our students civil discourse at a formative age, hopefully they can carry those skills with them into the adult world—and we can start to have more civil discussions.

Here’s hoping that your holiday gatherings are very happy, and full of good conversation.

## Do Parents Really Know What’s Best for Their Kids? (1)

![](https://www.edchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AdobeStock_277450642-1520x1013.jpeg)

*Based on the new podcast series:* Tough Questions with Robert Enlow 

One myth has lingered in education circles for decades: *Can parents actually be trusted to make good decisions about their children’s schooling?*

Some argue that experts, administrators, or “the system” know better. Others insist that parents should remain the primary educational decision-makers. In the latest episode of *Tough Questions with Robert Enlow,* we tackled this head-on.

https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F2226271298&show_artwork=true&maxheight=750&maxwidth=500

**Parents Are, and Always Have Been, the First Educators**

In 1925, the Supreme Court affirmed a foundational truth that “the child is not the mere creature of the State” (*Pierce v. Society of Sisters*). Parents have the primary right to guide their children’s upbringing and education.

That’s not just legal precedent, it’s common sense. Parents make every major decision for their kids: doctors and medical care; food, health, and safety; faith and values; and daily routines. Education is no different.

Parents are the ones who see their child’s struggles, strengths, anxieties, and dreams up close. School choice simply aligns policy with reality: families know their kids best.

**The “Parents Can’t Be Trusted” Narrative Has Problematic Roots**

Doubting parents isn’t new. Historically, this mindset emerged from:

- **A system that centralized decision-making**: As public education consolidated, from 50,000+ school districts in the mid-20th century to just 13,000 today, families gradually lost local control. Choice narrowed to one option: the school tied to your ZIP code.
- **A belief that government experts always know best**: When one system dominates, people often assume it must be the only correct one.
- **A more troubling history**: Opponents of school choice often direct the “parents don’t know best” critique toward low-income families and families of color. Milton Friedman called this argument what it is: a gratuitous insult_._

Families do not lack capacity. They often lack power and information, and school choice helps restore both.

**What Does the Research Say? Parents Make Good Decisions and Outcomes Improve**

When parents gain the ability to choose:

- **Kids perform slightly better academically**: Long-term research shows modest but meaningful gains in achievement, especially after students adjust to their new environment.
- **Kids experience stronger long-term success**: Students in choice programs:
    - Graduate at higher rates
    - Enter college at higher rates
    - Persist in college at higher rates
- **Kids experience stronger social and civic outcomes**: This may be the most underreported discovery in education research: Students in private choice programs tend to be more tolerant, more civically knowledgeable, and more engaged.
- **Parents become more involved in their children’s learning**: When parents choose, their engagement increases: meetings, communication, teacher interaction, and monitoring progress.
- **Public schools improve, too**: Even researchers who oppose school choice acknowledge that competition often leads to faster improvement in public schools.

This is what a *win-win-win* looks like.

**The Bottom Line**

The idea that parents can’t be trusted with educational decisions isn’t supported by research, common sense, history, or lived experience.

When parents are empowered:

- Kids thrive academically
- Kids grow socially and civically
- Public schools improve
- Communities strengthen

When parents gain agency, they don’t choose recklessly. They choose *responsibly*, *thoughtfully*, and often *sacrificially*.

## Talk nerdy to me: Teachers who use math vocabulary help students do better in math (1)

![](https://hechingerreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/proof-math-vocab-010226-scaled.jpg)

https://everlit.audio/embeds/artl_xPk5YCb9RWK?client=wp&client_version=2.6.0

Students, parents and school principals all instinctively know that some teachers are better than others. Education researchers have spent decades trying — with [mixed success](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ismail-Aslantas/publication/347514070_The_Stability_Problem_of_Value-added_Models_in_Teacher_Effectiveness_Estimations_A_Systematic_Review_Study/links/5fdfcd2192851c13fea95412/The-Stability-Problem-of-Value-added-Models-in-Teacher-Effectiveness-Estimations-A-Systematic-Review-Study.pdf) — to calculate exactly how much better.

![](https://i0.wp.com/hechingerreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/mindshift.png?fit=200%2C67&ssl=1)

This story also appeared in [Mind/Shift](http://ww2.kqed.org/mindshift/)

What remains far more elusive is why.

A [new study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0013189X251393232) suggests that one surprisingly simple difference between stronger and weaker math teachers may be how often they use mathematical vocabulary, words such as “factors,” “denominators” and “multiples,” in class.

**Related: Our free [weekly newsletter](https://hechingerreport.org/proofpoints/) alerts you to what research says about schools and classrooms.**

Teachers who used more math vocabulary had students who scored higher on math tests, according to a team of data scientists and education researchers from Harvard University, Stanford University and the University of Maryland. The size of the test score boost was substantial. It amounted to about half of the benefit researchers typically attribute to having a highly effective teacher, which is among the most important school-based factors that help children learn. Students with highly effective teachers can end up months ahead of their peers. 

“If you’re looking for a good math teacher, you’re probably looking for somebody who’s exposing their students to more mathematical vocabulary,” said Harvard data scientist Zachary Himmelsbach, lead author of the [study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0013189X251393232), which was published online in November 2025.

The finding aligns with a growing body of research suggesting that language plays a critical role in math learning. A [2021 meta-analysis](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/712504) of 40 studies found that students with stronger math vocabularies tend to perform better in math, particularly on multi-step, complex problems. Understanding what a “radius” is, for example, can make it more efficient to talk about perimeter and area and understand geometric concepts. Some math curricula explicitly teach vocabulary and include glossaries to reinforce these terms.

**Related: [Three reasons why so few eighth graders in the poorest schools take algebra](https://hechingerreport.org/proof-points-eighth-grade-algebra/)**

But vocabulary alone is unlikely to be a magic ingredient.

“If a teacher just stood in front of the classroom and recited lists of mathematical vocabulary terms, nobody’s learning anything,” said Himmelsbach. 

Instead, Himmelsbach suspects that vocabulary is part of a broader constellation of effective teaching practices. Teachers who use more math terms may also be providing clearer explanations, walking students through lots of examples step-by-step, and offering engaging puzzles. These teachers might also have a stronger conceptual understanding of math themselves.

It’s hard to isolate what exactly is driving the students’ math learning and what role vocabulary, in and of itself, is playing, Himmelsbach said.

Himmelsbach and his research team analyzed transcripts from more than 1,600 fourth- and fifth-grade math lessons in four school districts recorded for research purposes about 15 years ago. They counted how often teachers used more than [200 common math terms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1acNLeOvUjW1-29p2K05BNN_Mtx_SfbNf/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116671581412148583978&rtpof=true&sd=true) drawn from elementary math curriculum glossaries.

The average teacher used 140 math-related words per lesson. But there was wide variation. The top quarter of the teachers used at least 28 more math terms per lesson than the quarter of the teachers who spoke the fewest math words. Over the course of a school year, that difference amounted to roughly 4,480 additional math terms, meaning that some students were exposed to far richer mathematical language than others, depending on which teacher they happened to have that year.

The study linked these differences to student achievement. One hundred teachers were recorded over three years, and in the third year, students were randomly assigned to classrooms. That random assignment allowed the researchers to rule out the possibility that higher performing students were simply being clustered with stronger teachers.

**Related: [A theory for learning numbers without counting gains popularity](https://hechingerreport.org/proof-points-subitizing/)**

The lessons came from districts serving mostly low-income students. About two-thirds of students qualified for free or reduced-price lunch, more than 40 percent were Black, and nearly a quarter were Hispanic — the very populations that tend to struggle the most in math and stand to gain the most from effective instruction.

Interestingly, student use of math vocabulary did not appear to matter as much as teacher use. Although the researchers also tracked how often students used math terms in class, they found no clear link between teachers who used more vocabulary and students who spoke more math words themselves. Exposure and comprehension, rather than verbal facility, may be enough to support stronger math performance.

The researchers also looked for clues as to why some teachers used more math vocabulary than others. Years of teaching experience made no difference. Nor did the number of math or math pedagogy courses teachers had taken in college. Teachers with stronger mathematical knowledge did tend to use more math terms, but the relationship was modest.

Himmelsbach suspects that personal beliefs play an important role. Some teachers, he said, worry that formal math language will confuse students and instead favor more familiar phrasing, such as “put together” instead of addition, or “take away” instead of subtraction. While those colloquial expressions can be helpful, students ultimately need to understand how they correspond to formal mathematical concepts, Himmelsbach said.

This study is part of a new wave of education research that uses machine learning and natural language processing — computer techniques that analyze large volumes of text — to peer inside the classroom, which has long remained a black box. With enough recorded lessons, researchers hope not only to identify which teaching practices matter most, but also provide teachers with concrete, data-driven feedback.

**Related: [A little parent math talk with kids might really add up](https://hechingerreport.org/a-little-parent-math-talk-with-kids-might-really-add-up/)**

The researchers did not examine whether teachers used math terms correctly, but they noted that future models could be trained to do just that, offering feedback on accuracy and context, not just frequency.

For now, the takeaway is more modest but still meaningful: Students appear to learn more math when their teachers speak the language of math more often.

**SUBJECT:** Pro-child, not pro-homeschooling

**PREVIEW:** Late last year, the Times ran a viral essay on homeschooling gone wrong. Over the holidays, they published the rebuttals.

## THE LETTERS

Late last year, the New York Times published "[The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/opinion/home-school-isolation.html)" - a viral guest essay by novelist Stefan Merrill Block describing his experience being isolated by a parent in crisis. We published [our own response](https://opened.co/blog/you-can-do-this-what-the-new-york-times-misses-about-unschooling), pointing to the Nirvana Fallacy at the heart of the piece - a comparison between the author's real (and tragic) story and an imagined ideal.

While we were on break, the Times ran [a series of letters to the editor](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/opinion/letters-home-schooling.html) that made the counter-argument better than we could.

**Mason Ember**, a 16-year-old who spent over a year filming a feature-length documentary called *Against the Grade* about homeschooled teenagers:

> "In education we should be pro-child, not always pro-home-schooling, but certainly against 'one size fits all' institutionalism. Anyone can construct education around his or her beliefs, and dogma can come from anywhere: public schools, private schools and parents, too."
> 

**Hicham Oumlil**, a Brooklyn father pulled his 12-year-old son from school - but not by choice:

> "His primary and middle schools were wholly unequipped to educate him. He was reading above grade level since kindergarten, yet was forced to read at the designated grade level... He learned best through play - building systems and structures, and obsessively studying transit and aviation - but none of this was allowed or recognized as learning."
> 

His conclusion: the system "seemed to punish difference rather than cultivate potential."

**Elissa Kellner**, a Vermont homeschooler, pushed back on the assumption that standardized testing is the solution:

> "There are many of us who choose to home-school directly in response to the rise in standardized testing over the past 25 years. Much of public education now revolves around honing test-taking skills at the expense of actual learning."
> 

She also challenged the isolation narrative: her homeschool community has "socially adept children who are enrolled in dance and art classes, team sports and community service programs, and who appear confident talking to their peers and adults - something that has become a rarity."

---

We applaud the Times for featuring the counter-argument. Block's experience was real, but it was just one data point - not the whole picture.

We look forward to following Mason Ember's documentary, [*Against the Grade*](https://www.againstthegrade.com/). A 16-year-old spending a year interviewing homeschooled teenagers and producing a feature film is, itself, a pretty good argument for the approach.

## FACEBOOK POST

While we were on break, the New York Times published letters responding to "The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right."

This one hit home.

Hicham Oumlil didn't want to homeschool. He pulled his 12-year-old because the schools "seemed to punish difference rather than cultivate potential."

His son was reading above grade level in kindergarten — but was forced to read at grade level anyway. He learned best through play, building systems and studying transit and aviation. The school's response? None of that counted as learning.

"None of us like our current situation," he writes. "But we could not continue placing him in an environment that seemed to punish difference rather than cultivate potential."

Sound familiar?

Drop a comment if you were pushed into homeschooling by a system that couldn't (or wouldn't) meet your kid where they were.

## CAPTION FOR CAROUSEL

Late last year, the New York Times published "The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right" — a viral essay calling for mandatory registration and check-ins for all homeschoolers.

We published our response. (Link in bio.)

But while we were on break, the Times ran something better: letters from actual homeschool families.

A 16-year-old documentary filmmaker. A Brooklyn dad who pulled his gifted son from a system that "punished difference." A Vermont mom who left because public school had become test prep.

Swipe to read what they said.

The common thread? Pro-child. Not pro- or anti- any single approach.

We applaud the Times for publishing the counter-argument.

# Previous issues from this Week:

## Is anyone else still recalibrating? | OpenEd (1)

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e31168e49f5b7e6f76f0e5/695d7d7d122c6c2f726716fb_Blog%20Post%20Thumbnail%20(55).png)

**Happy Tuesday!**

Is it just me, or does the first full week of January feel like trying to restart a car that's been sitting in the cold?

The holidays were wonderful. The return to routine? Still buffering.

So instead of pretending I have some brilliant new insight this week, I'm bumping up an old gem from the [*Open Education* book](https://opened.co/book) bonus material that might offer some inspiration for jumpstarting your learning journey in the new year.

—Charlie *(the OpenEd newsletter guy)*

# The Mars Approach

*From Matt Bowman, founder of OpenEd, in the* [*Open Education book](https://opened.co/book):*

"In 2012, NASA's Curiosity rover touched down on Mars. Before it could begin exploring, engineers had to solve a fundamental challenge: how do you design something to explore a world you've never visited?

They started with three essential questions: What does Mars need us to discover? What unique capabilities can we develop? What resources do we have?

Your child's education requires the same approach. Your child's educational landscape is an unmapped terrain waiting to be explored. You can't use someone else's map or calendar. You need to chart your own course."

# College Rethink

[A new survey from Penn Foster](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/economy/2025/12/24/college-or-training-ai-future/87898126007/) found that while 84% of parents once assumed their kid would go to college, **37% say AI has changed that expectation.**

More findings:

- **55%** feel anxious about whether their child is prepared for an AI-driven job market
- **41%** now prefer apprenticeships or immediate workforce entry over traditional college
- **50%** are actively encouraging technical and digital skills

This isn't to say skipping college is always the right move. But the diploma credential is no longer the automatic answer - and parents are waking up to that faster than institutions are.

[**Read full survey**](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/economy/2025/12/24/college-or-training-ai-future/87898126007/)

# Two-Week Sprints

Matt unpacks this fully in [*Open Education*](https://opened.co/book), but here's the quick version:

1. **Create a Discovery Zone** — a wall, poster board, or the back of a door
2. **Post five questions:**
    - What do I like to learn about?
    - What do I like to do in my free time?
    - What am I good at?
    - What would I like to get better at?
    - What do I genuinely dislike and have no interest in developing?
3. **Give everyone colored sticky notes** — one color per family member
4. **Over one week**, everyone adds thoughts whenever inspiration strikes. No judgment. No editing.
5. **Then**: pick one interest per person for a two-week "learning sprint"

It sounds simple because it is. The hard part is trusting that your kid's curiosity is a better compass than a pacing guide written for 30 strangers.

## Why your kid forgets what they learned last week | OpenEd (1)

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e31168e49f5b7e6f76f0e5/695c37b292375f820c8ec78c_Blog%20Post%20Thumbnail%20(54).png)

**THOUGHT:** Testing Backwards
**TREND:** Reinforcement Works
**TOOL:** Math Academy - Built Different

# TESTING BACKWARDS

American schools drown in standardized tests. Testing became synonymous with accountability theater—measuring schools, not helping students learn.

[Justin Skycak](https://www.justinmath.com/maximizing-learning-vs-other-things/), who leads curriculum at [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/), observes that "'Testing' and 'repetition' have become dirty words in education"

Yet he also notes that *self*-testing—where students quiz themselves to pull information from memory—is one of the most effective learning techniques.

The irony is that if schools used the kind of testing that actually builds learning, students would ace the accountability tests without trying.

[**Read Justin's full post**](https://www.justinmath.com/maximizing-learning-vs-other-things/)

# REINFORCEMENT WORKS

Students who test themselves retain [up to 80% more](https://zipdo.co/learning-retention-statistics/) than those who just re-read material.

The [classic experiment](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10229024/) went like this: Take college students learning prose passages. Split them into groups. One group studies the material four times (SSSS). Another studies three times and takes one test (SSST). A third studies once and takes three tests (STTT).

Five minutes later, the study-only group performs best. But check back in a week, and the test-heavy group retains 61% while the study-only group drops to 40%.

Without reinforcement, [70% of information](https://zipdo.co/learning-retention-statistics/) vanishes within 24 hours.

This is one of the most robust findings in education research. It's been replicated over and over since the early 1900s, and the [latest study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/395691861) confirmed it again: practice tests boost retention AND help students transfer knowledge to new problems.

**Tl;dr:** Self-testing beats studying for long-term retention.

# BUILT DIFFERENT

[Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/how-our-ai-works) built a platform around cognitive science instead of arbitrary test scores *or* feel-good approaches that shun testing altogether.

The core principle is 'Fractional Implicit Repetition.' Traditional flashcard apps treat every topic as independent. But math doesn't work that way. When you practice algebra, you're *implicitly* practicing arithmetic. Math Academy tracks these relationships and cuts total review time by skipping the redundant quizzing on foundations you're already reinforcing.

Users–including [a PhD datascientist](https://jonathanwhitmore.com/posts/2024-09-10-MathAcademy-after-2000-points/)–report extraordinary results. At $49/month, it's not cheap—but it might be worth it if your child is forgetting what you thought they learned last week.

## NY Times letters (1)“

**SUBJECT:** Pro-child, not pro-homeschooling

**PREVIEW:** Late last year, the Times ran a viral essay on homeschooling gone wrong. Over the holidays, they published the rebuttals.

---

## THE LETTERS

Late last year, the New York Times published "[The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/opinion/home-school-isolation.html)" - a viral guest essay by novelist Stefan Merrill Block describing his experience being isolated by a parent in crisis. We published [our own response](https://opened.co/blog/you-can-do-this-what-the-new-york-times-misses-about-unschooling), pointing to the Nirvana Fallacy at the heart of the piece - a comparison between the author's real (and tragic) story and an imagined ideal.

While we were on break, the Times ran [a series of letters to the editor](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/24/opinion/letters-home-schooling.html) that made the counter-argument better than we could.

**Mason Ember**, a 16-year-old who spent over a year filming a feature-length documentary called *Against the Grade* about homeschooled teenagers:

> "In education we should be pro-child, not always pro-home-schooling, but certainly against 'one size fits all' institutionalism. Anyone can construct education around his or her beliefs, and dogma can come from anywhere: public schools, private schools and parents, too."
> 

**Hicham Oumlil**, a Brooklyn father pulled his 12-year-old son from school - but not by choice:

> "His primary and middle schools were wholly unequipped to educate him. He was reading above grade level since kindergarten, yet was forced to read at the designated grade level... He learned best through play - building systems and structures, and obsessively studying transit and aviation - but none of this was allowed or recognized as learning."
> 

His conclusion: the system "seemed to punish difference rather than cultivate potential."

**Elissa Kellner**, a Vermont homeschooler, pushed back on the assumption that standardized testing is the solution:

> "There are many of us who choose to home-school directly in response to the rise in standardized testing over the past 25 years. Much of public education now revolves around honing test-taking skills at the expense of actual learning."
> 

She also challenged the isolation narrative: her homeschool community has "socially adept children who are enrolled in dance and art classes, team sports and community service programs, and who appear confident talking to their peers and adults - something that has become a rarity."

---

We applaud the Times for featuring the counter-argument. Block's experience was real, but it was just one data point - not the whole picture.

We look forward to following Mason Ember's documentary, [*Against the Grade*](https://www.againstthegrade.com/). A 16-year-old spending a year interviewing homeschooled teenagers and producing a feature film is, itself, a pretty good argument for the approach.

## FACEBOOK POST

While we were on break, the New York Times published letters responding to "The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right."

This one hit home.

Hicham Oumlil didn't want to homeschool. He pulled his 12-year-old because the schools "seemed to punish difference rather than cultivate potential."

His son was reading above grade level in kindergarten — but was forced to read at grade level anyway. He learned best through play, building systems and studying transit and aviation. The school's response? None of that counted as learning.

"None of us like our current situation," he writes. "But we could not continue placing him in an environment that seemed to punish difference rather than cultivate potential."

Sound familiar?

Drop a comment if you were pushed into homeschooling by a system that couldn't (or wouldn't) meet your kid where they were.

## CAPTION FOR CAROUSEL

Late last year, the New York Times published "The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right" — a viral essay calling for mandatory registration and check-ins for all homeschoolers.

We published our response. (Link in bio.)

But while we were on break, the Times ran something better: letters from actual homeschool families.

A 16-year-old documentary filmmaker. A Brooklyn dad who pulled his gifted son from a system that "punished difference." A Vermont mom who left because public school had become test prep.

Swipe to read what they said.

The common thread? Pro-child. Not pro- or anti- any single approach.

We applaud the Times for publishing the counter-argument.

# Can AI Finally Solve the Tutoring Problem?

**Meta Title:** AI Tutoring for Homeschool: An Honest Assessment (2026)
**Meta Description:** AI tutors and adaptive learning apps promise personalized learning without the $100/hour price tag. Here's where they deliver, where they fall short, and which platforms provide the most bang for the buck.
**URL:** /open-education/ai-tutors-homeschool

---

In 1984, education researcher Benjamin Bloom documented something that seemed almost too good to be true: students who received one-on-one tutoring performed two standard deviations better than those in traditional classrooms. The average tutored student outperformed 98% of their conventionally taught peers.

Bloom called it the "[2 Sigma Problem](http://web.mit.edu/5.95/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf)." The name stuck because the problem wasn't whether tutoring worked—it worked remarkably well. The problem was economics. You can't hire a personal tutor for every child. For forty years, educators have chased workarounds: smaller class sizes, differentiated instruction, personalized learning plans. None cracked it.

Tech investor Marc Andreessen now predicts that "every child will have an AI tutor that is infinitely patient, infinitely compassionate, infinitely knowledgeable, infinitely helpful." Platforms like [Khanmigo](https://www.khanmigo.ai/), [Synthesis](https://www.synthesis.com/), and [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/) promise personalized instruction without the $100/hour price tag. Early results from some programs—like Alpha Schools, where students reportedly complete academics in two hours and test in the 99th percentile—suggest something real is happening.

But the hype obscures important distinctions. Some of these platforms are genuinely good. Many are mediocre. And even the best have limits their marketing departments would prefer you not think about.

---

## What AI Can and Cannot Do

[Dr. Claire Honeycutt](https://www.clarified.life/), a neuroscientist and former academic who writes about learning science, puts it plainly: "From the outside, AI looks like it's thinking—but it's not. The creators of AI fed it human-created content: books, manuscripts, websites. From those billions of words, AI learned to predict what usually comes next."

Once you understand that, the strengths and weaknesses snap into focus.

AI tutors excel at personalized pacing. Platforms like [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) and Math Academy adjust difficulty based on performance, keeping kids in that productive struggle zone where real learning happens. They're endlessly patient—no sighing, no frustration, no "we've been over this." For kids who shut down the moment they sense adult disappointment, that neutrality matters. And they can re-explain concepts a dozen different ways: different analogies, step-by-step breakdowns, visual approaches. Sometimes a second voice is all it takes.

What they can't do is think. "AI can't have unique ideas," Honeycutt notes. "It cannot reason, create, or imagine without assistance from humans." AI can help your child practice multiplication until it's automatic. It cannot teach them when multiplication is the right tool for a problem they've never seen before.

This distinction—between drilling known material and developing genuine understanding—is where most AI tutoring falls apart.

---

## The Business Model Problem

[Justin Skycak](https://www.justinmath.com/), who leads curriculum development at Math Academy, has a theory about why so much edtech disappoints: "If you want to build a serious educational product, you can't be afraid to charge money for it."

The logic is uncomfortable but hard to argue with. Free or nearly-free platforms need massive user bases to survive. Massive user bases mean serving mostly casual users—kids who open the app because their parents told them to, not because they're genuinely trying to learn. To keep those users coming back, platforms optimize for engagement: bright colors, game mechanics, low friction, dopamine hits.

Effective learning often requires the opposite. Testing yourself instead of re-reading. Spacing out practice instead of cramming. Working at the edge of your ability instead of coasting through easy wins. These techniques are backed by a century of cognitive science. They also feel harder, which repels casual users.

"Most people are not serious about learning," [Skycak writes](https://www.justinmath.com/why-is-the-edtech-industry-so-damn-soft/), "and if you depend on a massive base of unserious learners, then you have to employ ineffective learning strategies that do not repel unserious students. Which makes your product suck."

Then there's gaming. Honeycutt warns that "programs that use AI tutors can be easily gamed. Kids learn the 'cheat codes,' racing to the right answer without real understanding." Research has confirmed this pattern: students using AI for practice problems often outperform peers during exercises—then bomb the actual tests. They learned to get answers, not to understand the material.

Teresa King, CEO of the [OpenEd Foundation](https://opened.co/), describes what good AI tutoring looks like: "Intelligent AI that can draw out and expand on skills that students have. From almost a tutoring perspective—not giving them the answers, right? But helping them get to answers."

The difference between AI that does the work and AI that guides the work is the whole ballgame. When evaluating platforms, watch for it: Does it let your kid get right answers without understanding why? What happens when they struggle—does the system route them to prerequisite skills, or mark it wrong and move on? And the simplest test: sit with your child while they use it. Are they learning, or clicking through?

---

## How Adaptive Learning Works

[Ben Somers](https://opened.co/podcast/the-school-to-prescription-pipeline-ben-somers-on-how-we-medicate-kids-who-dont-fit-the-mold), founder of [Recess](https://www.recess.app/) and former [Synthesis](https://www.synthesis.com/) team member, explains why traditional curricula often fail: "School treats all knowledge like it goes in a line. In reality, knowledge is not ordered in a straight line. It's ordered in a big complex graph of ideas that are connected to each other in different ways."

Adaptive platforms map this graph. When a child struggles with fractions, the system identifies whether the gap is in division, place value, or the concept of parts and wholes. It routes to the prerequisite before pushing forward.

Different platforms approach this differently:

**Adaptive practice systems** like [ALEKS](https://www.aleks.com/), [IXL](https://www.ixl.com/), and [DreamBox](https://www.dreambox.com/) continuously assess what students know and adjust in real-time. When gaps appear, they fill them before moving on.

**Conversational AI tutors** like [Khanmigo](https://www.khanmigo.ai/) and [Duolingo Max](https://www.duolingo.com/) go further. They explain concepts, answer questions, and engage in back-and-forth dialogue. When a student gets stuck, they ask follow-up questions rather than marking the answer wrong.

**Creative problem-solving platforms** like Synthesis focus on collaborative challenges—what education theorist Seymour Papert called "microworlds" where learning happens through exploration rather than instruction.

![knowledge_network_ink_20260106_093758_pro.png](attachment:92fbb572-8f52-48e8-b7cf-efe165e0a470:knowledge_network_ink_20260106_093758_pro.png)

The research behind these techniques isn't new. Spaced repetition has been studied since the 1900s. Retrieval practice—testing yourself rather than re-reading—produces dramatically better retention. Schools have largely ignored this research for decades. The good AI tutoring platforms are essentially packaging century-old cognitive science into software.

---

## What AI Cannot Replace

The strongest case against over-relying on AI tutors comes from someone who pioneered online education.

[Ray Ravaglia](https://opened.co/podcast/ray-ravaglia-online-school) founded [Stanford Online High School](https://onlinehighschool.stanford.edu/) and spent decades studying how students learn through technology. His conclusion is sobering: "Even gifted students in asynchronous, self-paced courses had attrition rates north of 30%. With synchronous, community-based classes, it fell dramatically."

His point: "The problem isn't access to information. It's not even personalization or pace. It's connection. It's mentorship. It's the irreplaceable experience of one human being caring whether another human being learns."

Ben Somers learned this the hard way at Synthesis. His team spent $10 million building games—collaborative problem-solving simulations that were genuinely innovative. Then they ran retention analysis.

"The number one predictor of retention was if the kid had a friend in their class," Somers says. "Not the games. Not the AI. Friendship—which is close to free."

AI handles routine practice and drill. It provides instant, patient feedback. It adjusts difficulty automatically. It generates endless practice material. But humans remain essential for teaching reasoning and critical thinking. For motivation when things get hard. For knowing when your kid has had enough. For values, wisdom, purpose. For social learning and real connection.

If you're [homeschooling a child with ADHD](https://opened.co/blog/homeschooling-a-child-with-adhd), the patience of an AI tutor can genuinely help. But the human relationship keeps them anchored.

---

## The Screen Time Tradeoff

Most parents hesitate here. If we've spent years limiting screens, why add more through AI tutoring?

[Amir Nathoo](https://opened.co/podcast/dont-limit-screentime), CEO of [Outschool](https://outschool.com/), draws a distinction: "Not all screen time is created equal. Just watching stuff on YouTube is completely different from building a virtual world or learning a tool."

There's passive screen time—scrolling, watching, consuming. And active screen time—creating, problem-solving, practicing skills with immediate feedback. Adaptive learning falls into the second category.

[Anjan Katta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anjankatta/), founder of [Daylight Computer](https://daylightcomputer.com/), is pragmatic: "It's unrealistic and probably not in the best interest of your child's development to be a Luddite—to completely get away with technology."

His framing of the value proposition: "The promise here is not 'my kid's gonna be a million times smarter.' It's that instead of four hours with more tantrums and more difficulty, it gets done in an hour or 45 minutes, they're engaged, and now there's more time."

More time for field trips. For projects. For play and conversation and unstructured exploration. That's the real tradeoff—not screens versus no screens, but what you're using screens for and what it frees you to do.

---

## The Alpha School Question

You may have heard of [Alpha School](https://alpha.school/)—an in-person private school with campuses in Austin and Miami that uses AI-powered adaptive learning to compress academics into roughly two hours a day. Students reportedly test in the 99th percentile nationally.

The price tag: roughly $30,000-65,000 per year. That's not realistic for most families.

But you don't need the all-in-one package. Alpha School isn't only using AI—their program includes human guides, real-world challenges, and community. The AI is one component. And the underlying adaptive technology is available across dozens of platforms at every price point, including free.

As Honeycutt notes, Alpha School "uses multiple AI bots" to prevent gaming the system—a smart approach you can replicate by combining different tools rather than relying on any single platform.

The question isn't whether you can afford the premium package. It's whether you can assemble something that works for your family using the tools available.

## Building Your Own Stack

Rather than one expensive solution, most homeschool families do better assembling tools that fit their specific needs. The goal is finding what works for your kid—and switching when it doesn't.

### Math

This is usually the best starting point. Math is well-suited to adaptive practice, and it's where many parents feel least confident teaching. (If math has been a struggle, see [math without the misery](https://opened.co/blog/math-without-the-misery).)

| Platform | Cost | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) | Free (+$4/mo for [Khanmigo](https://www.khanmigo.ai/)) | Starting point. Comprehensive coverage, solid adaptive practice. |
| [Synthesis Math](https://www.synthesis.com/) | $35/year via OpenEd | Conceptual understanding, collaborative problem-solving. |
| [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/) | $49/month | Serious acceleration. Compresses grade levels dramatically. |
| [DreamBox](https://www.dreambox.com/) | $13/month | Younger kids. Game-based with genuine adaptive algorithm. |
| [ALEKS](https://www.aleks.com/) | $20/month | Identifying and filling gaps. Strong knowledge mapping. |
| [Zearn](https://www.zearn.org/) | Free (premium options) | K-5 math. Blends video lessons with adaptive practice. |

| [IXL](https://www.ixl.com/) | $10-20/month | Comprehensive drill across subjects. Can feel repetitive. |

### Language Learning

| Platform | Cost | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) | Free (+$10/mo for Max) | Widely used. AI conversation practice at premium tier. |
| [Studycat](https://studycat.com/) | $8/month | Ages 3-8. Chinese, German, Spanish, French. Game-based. |

| [Spelling Safari](https://spellingsafari.com/) | Free | Spelling practice with adaptive game format. |
| [Freckle](https://freckle.com/) | School pricing | ELA plus other subjects. Strong differentiation. |

### Science

Adaptive learning is less developed for science than math—fewer platforms, less sophisticated personalization.

| Platform | Cost | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) | Free | Biology, chemistry, physics. Some adaptive practice. |
| [Generation Genius](https://www.generationgenius.com/) | ~$95/year | Video-based science, K-8. High quality, not truly adaptive. |
| [Mystery Science](https://mysteryscience.com/) | ~$99/year | Inquiry-based, K-5. Open-and-go, excellent but not adaptive. |
| [Labster](https://www.labster.com/) | Varies | Virtual science labs for older students. |

### History and Social Studies

The thinnest options. Most "adaptive" history platforms are really digital flashcards.

| Platform | Cost | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) | Free | World history, US history, civics. Limited adaptivity. |
| [iCivics](https://www.icivics.org/) | Free | Civics games and simulations. Engaging, not adaptive. |
| [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/) | Free (premium options) | Flashcards with AI features. Good for memorization. |

## AI as Curriculum Design Partner

There's another way to use AI that doesn't involve apps at all.

[Brettani Shannon](https://opened.co/blog/opened-day-in-the-life-brettani-shannons-slow-morning-ai-powered-unit-studies-curriculum), an Oregon homeschool mom featured in our Day in the Life series, uses [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/)—an AI research assistant—not to teach her daughter directly, but to design custom unit studies based on her interests.

Her 9-year-old, Snow, loves animals. Instead of buying a generic biology curriculum, Brettani asked Perplexity to create a four-day-a-week unit study focused on pet adoption, with book lists, movie suggestions, vocabulary words, and hands-on activities.

"This gave me a roadmap," she explains. "I liked most of what it produced—dog treat recipe, field trip idea to a shelter, movie suggestion—so I continued: 'Give me links to a specific dog treat recipe and 4th grade math lessons to incorporate.'"

The AI isn't teaching. It's brainstorming. Brettani still curates, edits, and decides what actually happens. But it dramatically cuts her planning time.

This approach works especially well for science and history—exactly where adaptive apps are weakest. Instead of hunting for the perfect curriculum, you build one around what your child already cares about.

## Where to Start

Overwhelmed by the options? Here's a simple path:

**For math (any age):** Start with [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/). It's free, comprehensive, and will show you how your child responds to adaptive learning. If they engage well, add [Khanmigo](https://www.khanmigo.ai/) for $4/month for conversational AI tutoring. If they need more challenge, look at [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/) or [Synthesis](https://www.synthesis.com/).

**For languages:** [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) is the obvious starting point—free, gamified, effective for building basic vocabulary and habits. For younger kids, [Studycat](https://studycat.com/) is worth the $8/month.

**For science and history:** Don't expect adaptive apps to carry these subjects. Use Khan Academy for content, but lean on unit studies, documentaries, field trips, and living books. Consider using AI tools like Perplexity to design custom units around your child's interests.

**For reluctant learners:** Game-based options like [Prodigy](https://www.prodigygame.com/) or [Spelling Safari](https://spellingsafari.com/) can build momentum, but watch for gaming. Once they're engaged, transition to more rigorous platforms.

## A Note on Cost

Skycak's point from the introduction is worth repeating: serious educational products often charge real money because they're built for serious learners. But serious doesn't have to mean expensive.

Khan Academy is free and genuinely good. Zearn offers a strong free tier. Duolingo's free version works for many families. The paid tiers add features—AI tutoring, ad-free experience, additional content—that may or may not matter for your situation.

For families enrolled with [OpenEd](https://opened.co/), many premium platforms are available through the reimbursement wallet—including Synthesis, tutoring services, and other subscriptions. You can test different options without bearing the full cost of trial and error. Mentor teachers can help evaluate what's actually working. They've seen hundreds of families navigate these choices.

## How to Use These Tools Well

A few principles from parents and educators who've figured this out:

**Start with one subject.** Math is usually easiest—pick one platform, use it consistently for 2-3 weeks before evaluating.

**Use AI for practice, not introduction.** Teach new concepts yourself (or through curriculum), then use adaptive platforms to reinforce and practice.

**Watch your kid use it.** Are they learning or gaming? Engaged or frustrated? Your observations matter more than the app's analytics.

**Mix and match.** The [OpenEd philosophy](https://opened.co/open-education/) is that you're the education designer. Use AI tutoring for math, [Charlotte Mason](https://opened.co/open-education/charlotte-mason) methods for literature, hands-on projects for science. No single tool does everything well.

**Be willing to switch.** What works for one sibling might frustrate another. Homeschooling's flexibility is your advantage—use it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What's the best AI tutor for kids?**
It depends on subject and child. For math, start with [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) (free) to see how your child responds. If they engage well, consider adding [Khanmigo](https://www.khanmigo.ai/), [Synthesis](https://www.synthesis.com/), or [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/) based on goals and budget.

**How do adaptive learning apps work?**
They continuously assess what a student knows and adjust accordingly. When a child struggles, the system identifies gaps and provides targeted practice. When they succeed, difficulty increases.

**Is AI tutoring better than human tutoring?**
AI excels at patient, consistent practice and instant feedback. Humans excel at motivation, relationship, and teaching reasoning. Best results combine both.

**What age is appropriate?**
Most platforms work from age 5-6 for basics. For younger children, hands-on learning matters more. By upper elementary, AI can handle more of the practice workload.

**Can AI tutors replace homeschool parents?**
No. They can't provide motivation, values, critical thinking instruction, or the human connection that makes education meaningful. They handle practice. You handle everything else.

AI tutors won't solve the 2 Sigma Problem on their own—Bloom's original research showed that human tutoring worked because of the relationship, not only the personalization. But used thoughtfully, these tools can handle the repetitive parts of learning, giving you more time for what matters: the conversations, the field trips, the messy projects, the moments when your kid finally gets it and you're there to see it.

The technology keeps improving. The question is whether you'll use it as a shortcut or as something that frees you to do more of what only you can do.
