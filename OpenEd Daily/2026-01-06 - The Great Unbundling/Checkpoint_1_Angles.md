## SEGMENT 1: THOUGHT - "THE COST OF GETTING BY"

**Source:** https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alternative-educational-models-neurodivergent-kids_n_69332ad5e4b06a47b6d3db7a

**Type:** Parable / Case Study (Best archetype per style guide)

### Angle Options

**A. The "getting by" trap**
Focus on the line: "On paper, she was 'getting by.' But the cost of getting by had become brutal." This frames the problem not as failure but as invisible suffering masked by adequate grades.

**B. The body keeps the score**
Lead with the physical symptoms: vomiting, daily nausea, crying every morning. The body rejected what the transcript accepted.

**C. The invisible diagnosis**
"The school system didn't identify any of this. Not one teacher flagged it." The system optimized for compliance, not wellbeing.

**D. The extraordinary change**
Focus on the transformation: stomach aches gone, morning tears gone. "The girl who couldn't get out of bed is now asking what's next."

### Recommended: **A - "The cost of getting by"**

Why: It's the most universal. Many readers have kids who are "getting by" but struggling. The line is memorable and quotable. Sets up the thesis without being preachy.

### Structure

**Hook:** "On paper, she was 'getting by.' But the cost of getting by had become brutal."

**Substance:** Lisa Jones's 14-year-old had dyslexia, dyscalculia, and ADHD. Still, she wasn't "failing." She was just vomiting from anxiety every morning, crying before school, running on adrenaline just to survive each day.

**Insight:** The school system didn't identify any of this. Not one teacher flagged it. The moment Jones decided to stop wasn't dramatic - she just looked at her daughter, pale and shaking on the bathroom floor, and thought: "We're done with this." The stomach aches are gone now. So are the morning tears.

**Key quotes to use:**
- "On paper, she was 'getting by.' But the cost of getting by had become brutal."
- "pale and shaking on the bathroom floor"
- "The school system didn't identify any of this. Not one teacher flagged it."
- "The stomach aches? Gone. The morning tears? Gone."

## SEGMENT 2: TREND - "THE NUMBERS ARE IN"

**Source:** https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2026/jan/01/private-school-enrollment-spikes-public-school-enrollment-tumbles-after-educational-freedom-account-program-becomes-available-to-all/

**Type:** Alarming Stat (Style guide: Data creates urgency)

### Angle Options

**A. The sharpest decline in a decade**
Lead with scale: "Arkansas' public school enrollment saw its sharpest decline in at least a decade this school year." Bigger than covid.

**B. The first universal year**
Focus on what changed: This was the first year Educational Freedom Accounts opened to every student. Cause and effect.

**C. Follow the money**
28,100 students got accounts for private school. 18,500 for homeschool/microschool. $326 million in total funding. When you give families resources, they move.

**D. The counter-narrative**
Teachers union says "plights of already underfunded public schools are only going to get more dire." School choice proponent says parents are "wanting to have a more direct influence on their kids."

### Recommended: **A + B combined - "The sharpest decline" + "The first universal year"**

Why: The stat is the hook (bigger than covid), and the policy change is the story. Cause and effect is clear.

### Structure

**Hook:** Arkansas' public schools just saw their sharpest enrollment decline in a decade - bigger than the first year of covid.

**Substance:** This was the first year Educational Freedom Accounts opened to every student. The numbers: 8,900 students left (1.9% drop). 28,100 got accounts for private school. 18,500 for homeschool or microschool. $326 million in total funding.

**Insight:** When you give families resources and say "go," they go. The question is no longer whether this will happen. It's how fast.

**Key data:**
- 8,900 students left public schools (1.9% drop)
- Sharpest decline in at least a decade
- Bigger than covid's first year (6,428 students)
- 28,100 private school accounts
- 18,500 homeschool/microschool accounts
- $326 million total funding

## SEGMENT 3: TOOL - "THE TEXAS EXPERIMENT"

**Source:** https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/texas-education-freedom-account-cato-institute-21235536.php

**Type:** How-To in Disguise (Style guide: Don't describe the tool - show how to use it)

### Angle Options

**A. The "a la carte" education**
Focus on flexibility: Families can mix private tuition, tutoring, therapies, and homeschool materials. Build your own education.

**B. The timeline**
Applications for families open February 4 through March 20. Decisions by May 1. Funds starting July 1. Time is running out.

**C. The homeschool carryover**
Homeschoolers get $2,000/year, but unused funds carry over. Save it for college credits or career certifications in high school.

**D. The rural opportunity**
"In rural Texas, where options have historically been limited, school choice can inspire entrepreneurs to create new alternatives."

### Recommended: **A - "The a la carte education"**

Why: Most actionable. Shows readers what's possible. Connects to the unbundling theme.

### Structure

**Substance:** Texas Education Freedom Accounts launch in 2026. Around $10,000 per student for private school, up to $2,000 for homeschoolers. The money can go toward tuition, tutoring, therapies, instructional materials. Unused funds carry over - so homeschool families can save for college credits or career certifications when kids hit high school.

**Insight:** Applications for families open February 4. If you're in Texas and want in, the clock is already running.

**Key details:**
- ~$10,000 per student (private school)
