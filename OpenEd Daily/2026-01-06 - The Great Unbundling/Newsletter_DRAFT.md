Greetings Eddies!

The morning Lisa Jones decided not to send her 14-year-old back to school, her daughter was vomiting from anxiety. Again.

It wasn't a dramatic moment. There was no big speech. She just looked at her daughter, pale and shaking on the bathroom floor, and thought: *We're done with this.*

What happened next is worth your attention. Not because it's unusual, but because it isn't. Thousands of families are making the same calculation right now.

Let's dive in.

## THE COST OF GETTING BY

Lisa Jones's daughter has dyslexia, dyscalculia, and ADHD. On paper, she wasn't failing. She was getting by. But the cost of getting by had become brutal: daily nausea, crying every morning, running on adrenaline just to survive each day, then collapsing at home where it felt safe to fall apart.

The school system didn't identify any of this. Not one teacher flagged it. Not one report card expressed concern. She had to follow her gut, chase diagnoses, and fight for answers while her daughter smiled and masked her way through every school day.

So Jones pulled her out. Built a [hybrid arrangement](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alternative-educational-models-neurodivergent-kids_n_69332ad5e4b06a47b6d3db7a): live virtual curriculum in the mornings, afternoons free for life skills and hobbies. Her daughter got a part-time job at a cafe, trained as a barista, earned a first aid certification.

The stomach aches? Gone. The morning tears? Gone. The girl who couldn't get out of bed is now asking what's next.

## THE NUMBERS ARE IN

Arkansas just saw its sharpest public school enrollment decline in a decade. Bigger than the first year of covid.

This was the first year [Educational Freedom Accounts](https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2026/jan/01/private-school-enrollment-spikes-public-school-enrollment-tumbles-after-educational-freedom-account-program-becomes-available-to-all/) opened to every student. The numbers: 8,900 students left public schools. 28,100 got accounts for private school. 18,500 chose homeschool or microschool options. $326 million in total funding.

The teachers union says underfunded schools will get more dire. School choice proponents say parents are "wanting to have a more direct influence on their kids."

Both things can be true. But the direction is clear. When you give families resources and say "go," they go. The question is no longer whether this will happen in other states. It's how fast.

## THE A LA CARTE EDUCATION

Texas families will soon be able to build education like a playlist, not a package.

[Texas Education Freedom Accounts](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/texas-education-freedom-account-cato-institute-21235536.php) launch in 2026. Around $10,000 per student for private school. Up to $2,000 for homeschoolers. The money can go toward tuition, tutoring, therapies, or instructional materials. Unused funds carry over, so homeschool families can save for college credits or career certifications when kids hit high school.

Applications for families open February 4 through March 20. Decisions by May 1. Funds starting July 1.

If you're in Texas and want in, the clock is already running.

That's all for today!
