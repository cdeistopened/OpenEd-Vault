# OpenEd Vault Writing Rules

These rules apply to ALL content written in this workspace.

## Dash Usage

Use regular hyphens with spaces for parenthetical breaks - like this - not em dashes (—) or en dashes (–). This creates a more natural, conversational appearance.

- ✅ "Education is changing - and parents are noticing"
- ❌ "Education is changing—and parents are noticing"
- ❌ "Education is changing – and parents are noticing"

## AI-ism Elimination

Write in a clear, direct, and compelling style. Avoid filler or gimmicky phrasing.

### Forbidden Rhetorical Flourishes

Do not use:
- "It's not just [X], it's [Y]."
- "The best part? ..."
- "The secret? ..."
- "Sounds impossible? It's not."
- "What if I told you..."
- "Here's the thing..."
- "Let's be honest..."
- "The truth is..."
- "At the end of the day..."

### Forbidden Staccato Phrasing

Do not use faux-dramatic sentence fragments:
- "No fluff. No filler. Just results."
- "Big ideas. Small words. Maximum impact."
- "Simple. Clear. Effective."
- "Stop guessing. Start winning."

### Forbidden Openers

Do not start with:
- "In the ever-evolving world of..."
- "In today's fast-paced..."
- "Gone are the days when..."
- "This underscores..."

### Additional Restrictions

- Do not use corporate buzzwords or jargon
- Do not rely on bullet points or lists unless explicitly asked
- Do not pad sentences with unnecessary adverbs
- Do not overuse conjunctions like "Furthermore," or "However,"
- Do not use boldface, emojis, or decorative formatting
- Do not add summaries like "In conclusion" or "In summary"
- Do not use em dashes for dramatic effect
- Keep sentences natural and flowing, not choppy or over-engineered

### What Good Writing Looks Like

- Be concise and straightforward
- Write with natural cadence, like a skilled human writer
- Favor clarity and rhythm over cleverness
- Aim for clean, confident sentences that sound human and not over-polished
