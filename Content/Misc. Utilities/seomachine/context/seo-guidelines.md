# OpenEd SEO Guidelines

This document outlines SEO best practices and the proprietary content framework that differentiates OpenEd content from generic AI-generated articles.

**Core Philosophy:** Generic SEO content is worthless. Our competitive advantage is proprietary insight from OpenEd podcasts, parent interviews, teacher expertise from Slack, and newsletter archives. Every article should contain quotes, stories, and perspectives that only OpenEd could surface - wrapped in an SEO structure that helps parents find it.

---

## The OpenEd Content Difference

### Why Proprietary Sources Matter

AI tools have made it trivially easy to generate "SEO content" on any topic. The result: identical articles regurgitating the same training data. Parents can smell this from a mile away.

**What makes OpenEd content different:**
1. **Real quotes from podcast guests** - Named experts with specific experiences
2. **Teacher insights from Slack** - Practical tips from our educator community
3. **Parent ambassador voices** - First-person accounts from actual families
4. **Newsletter archive material** - Repurposed insights from our existing content
5. **Mix-and-match philosophy** - Permission to blend approaches, not prescriptive

### Before Writing: Gather Proprietary Material

**REQUIRED before any article:**

#### 1. Podcast Archive Search
- Location: `/Content/Open Ed Podcasts/`
- Look for: Direct quotes, personal stories, expert perspectives, curriculum recommendations
- Attribution format: `[Quote] — [Name], [Role], on the [OpenEd Podcast](link)`

**Key Guests by Topic:**
- **Unschooling:** Kenneth Danford (North Star), Hannah Frankman (Rebel Educator), Peter Gray
- **Charlotte Mason:** Meg Thomas (coachmegthomas.com)
- **Microschooling:** Kristin & Ginger (SKOLA), Kerry McDonald
- **General Open Education:** Matt Bowman, Jon England

#### 2. Newsletter Archive Search
- Location: `/Content/OpenEd Daily/` and `/Content/Newsletter Archive/`
- Look for: Previous coverage, angles explored, statistics cited, stories used
- Use to: Expand newsletter segments, pull statistics with original sources, use stories as hooks

#### 3. Slack Teacher Expertise
- Look for: Curriculum recommendations, practical tips, common parent questions, what works vs. doesn't
- Attribution: "OpenEd teacher community" or specific teacher name with permission
- Use for: Practical "how to" sections, validating claims

#### 4. Parent Ambassador Interviews
- Look for: First-person usage stories, day-in-the-life context, honest assessments
- Attribution: `[Name], a homeschool mom of [number] in [State]`

### Minimum Proprietary Content Requirements

Every article MUST include:
- [ ] At least 2-3 proprietary quotes (podcast, Slack, ambassadors)
- [ ] At least 1 specific family story or example
- [ ] Named people throughout (not "experts say")
- [ ] OpenEd-specific perspective on the topic

---

## Content Length Requirements

### Target Word Counts
- **Pedagogical Deep Dives** (Charlotte Mason, Unschooling, etc.): 2,000-4,000 words
- **Curriculum Guides** (art curriculum, math options): 1,500-3,000 words
- **Grade-Level Guides** (1st grade homeschool, high school): 1,500-2,500 words
- **State Guides** (how to homeschool in Utah): 1,000-2,000 words
- **Standard Blog Posts**: 1,500-2,500 words

### Quality Over Quantity
- Don't add fluff to hit word counts
- Every section should provide genuine value
- Better to have 2,000 valuable words than 3,000 padded words
- Stay within maximum word counts - overly long articles hurt user experience

---

## Keyword Optimization

### Keyword Density Guidelines
- **Primary Keyword**: 1-2% density (20-40 uses in 2,000 words)
- **Secondary Keywords**: 0.5-1% density each
- **Natural integration is critical** - never force keywords

### Critical Keyword Placement
Primary keyword MUST appear in:
- [ ] H1 headline (preferably near the beginning)
- [ ] First 100 words of article
- [ ] At least 2-3 H2 subheadings
- [ ] Last paragraph / conclusion
- [ ] Meta title (within first 60 characters)
- [ ] Meta description
- [ ] URL slug

### Keyword Integration Best Practices
- **Natural language first**: Write for humans, optimize for search engines
- **Use variations**: Don't repeat exact phrase robotically
  - "homeschool art curriculum" → "art curriculum for homeschooling" → "teaching art at home"
- **Question formats**: Include conversational variations
- **Semantic keywords**: Use related terms

- 60 characters or less for SERP display
- Compelling and benefit-focused

#### H2 (Main Sections)
- 4-7 H2 sections for standard articles
- At least 2-3 should include keyword variations

  - "How to [topic] with OpenEd"

#### H3 (Subsections)
- Nested under H2s (never skip from H2 to H4)
- Break complex sections into digestible chunks

---

## Hooks That Work (and Don't)

### Good Hooks
- A podcast guest's specific experience
- A surprising statistic or data point
- A common misconception being challenged
- A moment that crystallizes the approach

**Example (Good):**
```
There's a quote that often circulates in special education settings: "Everyone is a genius, but if you judge a fish on its ability to climb a tree..."

As somebody diagnosed with ADHD late in life, I'm going to tell you something that might surprise you: I actually really hate this quote.
```

### Bad Hooks (Never Use)
- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- Dictionary definitions
- Generic statements about education
- "Many parents wonder..."
- "In the ever-evolving landscape of..."

---

## Meta Elements

### Meta Title
- **Length**: 50-60 characters (including "| OpenEd" if used)
- **Primary keyword**: Must be included
- **Compelling**: Should encourage clicks from SERP
- **Unique**: Different from all other OpenEd page titles

**Format Options:**
- `[Primary Keyword]: [Value Proposition]`
- `How to [Goal] | [Qualifier]`
- `[Topic] Guide for Homeschool Families | OpenEd`

### Meta Description
- **Length**: 150-160 characters
- **Primary keyword**: Include naturally
- **Value proposition**: Clear benefit to reader
- **Call-to-action**: Action phrase (Learn, Discover, Find out)

**Formula:**
```
[Problem/Question]? [Solution/Benefit]. [Unique angle]. [CTA].
```

### URL Slug
- Include primary keyword
- Lowercase, hyphens between words
- Short and descriptive (3-5 words)
- No stop words unless necessary

**Format**: `/blog/[primary-keyword-phrase]`

---

## Internal Linking Strategy

### Requirements
- **Minimum**: 3 internal links per article
- **Optimal**: 4-5 internal links
- **Maximum**: 7 internal links (unless 3,000+ word article)

### Link Types to Include
1. **Hub Pages** (1-2 links) - Method pages (Charlotte Mason, Montessori, etc.)
2. **Related Blog Posts** (2-3 links) - Articles on related subtopics
3. **Podcast Episodes** (0-1 link) - When guest is quoted
4. **Info Session CTA** (1 link) - Usually in conclusion

### Reference

---

## External Linking Strategy

### Requirements
- **Minimum**: 2 external links per article
- **Optimal**: 3-4 external authority links

### What to Link Externally
- **Statistics sources**: NHERI for homeschool statistics
- **Legal information**: HSLDA for state requirements
- **Influencer content**: Featured experts' own sites
- **Free resources**: When recommending specific tools

### Nearbound Playbook
Feature influencers prominently to tap into their audiences:
1. Quote with attribution (name, handle, site)
2. Link to their content
3. Feature in "People to Follow" section
4. Reach out post-publication

**By Topic Area:**
- Charlotte Mason: Leah Boden (@modernmissmason), Sonya Shafer (Simply Charlotte Mason)

- Classical: Susan Wise Bauer (Well-Trained Mind)
- Unschooling: Peter Gray (Free to Learn), Kenneth Danford (North Star)

---

## Voice and Style (Anti-AI Patterns)

### Forbidden Constructions
Never use:
- "X isn't just Y - it's Z" (the #1 AI tell)
- "The best part? ..."
- "The secret? ..."
- "In today's fast-paced..."
- "Let that sink in"
- "Here's the thing..."
- Staccato phrasing ("Simple. Clear. Effective.")
- Em dashes for drama (use hyphens with spaces - like this)

### Tone Anchors
- **Permission-giving, not prescriptive** - "You can..." not "You must..."
- **Specific over generic** - Named people, specific examples
- **Conversation, not lecture** - Write WITH parents, not AT them
- **Confident but not preachy** - State perspectives directly without hedging
- **Honest about limitations** - What won't work for some families

### OpenEd Philosophy to Embed
- **Mix and match** - Take what works from any approach
- **No "everybody needs to"** - Families design their own path
- **Philosophy over products** - Approaches matter more than packages
- **Parent as designer** - You know your child best

---

## Readability Optimization

### Target Reading Level
- **Goal**: 8th-10th grade reading level (Flesch-Kincaid)
- Makes content accessible to wider audience

### Sentence Structure
- **Average length**: 15-20 words per sentence
- **Maximum**: 25 words (break longer sentences)
- **Variety**: Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones
- **Active voice**: 80%+ active

### Paragraph Structure
- **Length**: 2-4 sentences per paragraph
- **One idea**: Focus each paragraph on single point
- **White space**: No walls of text

### Formatting for Scannability
- **Subheadings**: Every 300-400 words
- **Lists**: Use bullets/numbers for multiple items
- **Bold**: Emphasize key concepts
- **Short paragraphs**: Easier to digest

---

## Quote Integration Best Practices

### DO
- Attribute with name, role, and source
- Include context for the quote
- Let quotes carry emotional weight
- Use quotes to break up dense information
- Choose quotes with specific details

### DON'T
- Stack multiple quotes back-to-back
- Use quotes for generic statements
- Force quotes into sections where they don't fit
- Edit quotes to change meaning

### Format Examples

**Podcast quote:**
```
"[Quote here]"

— [Name], [role], on the [OpenEd Podcast](link)
```

**Teacher quote:**
```
As OpenEd teacher [Name] explains: "[Quote here]"
```

**Parent quote:**
```
[Name], a homeschool mom of [number] in [State], puts it simply: "[Quote here]"
```

---

## OpenEd Integration

Every article should clarify the OpenEd relationship:

### What OpenEd Can Support
- Secular curricula and materials
- Educational tools and supplies
- Tutoring and enrichment
- Field trips and experiences
- Membership fees for learning communities

### What OpenEd Cannot Support
- Religious curricula (note this where relevant)
- Items that don't qualify under ESA rules

### Standard CTA
End articles with:
```
*Interested in exploring [topic] or other open education approaches? [Join a free OpenEd info session](https://opened.co) to learn how we can support your family's learning journey.*
```

1. Search podcast transcripts for topic keywords
2. Check newsletter archive for previous coverage
3. Search Slack for teacher discussions
4. Check for relevant ambassador interviews

### Step 2: Extract Quotes
Create a quote bank for the article:
- 2-3 strong podcast quotes minimum
- Teacher insights where relevant
- Parent experience quotes if available

### Step 3: Gap Analysis
Identify what's missing:
- Statistics needing external sources
- Legal information needing verification
- Curriculum details needing research
- Influencer perspectives to include

### Step 4: External Research
Fill gaps with:
- NHERI for homeschool statistics
- HSLDA for legal information
- Influencer blogs/podcasts for additional perspectives
- Academic sources for claims needing backup

### Step 5: Write with Proprietary Material Integrated
Don't add quotes after writing - build article around them.

**Remember**: The goal is content that could only come from OpenEd. If an article could have been written by anyone with access to ChatGPT and Google, it's not good enough. Our proprietary sources - podcast guests, teacher community, parent ambassadors - are what make our content worth reading.
