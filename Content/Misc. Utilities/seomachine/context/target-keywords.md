# OpenEd Target Keywords & Topic Clusters

This document organizes OpenEd's target keywords by topic cluster for strategic content planning and SEO optimization. Focus is on search intent for answer engines and traditional SEO.

## Search Intent Strategy

OpenEd targets parents at three stages:
1. **Awareness**: "What is [method]?" / "How does [approach] work?"
2. **Consideration**: "Best [curriculum] for [need]" / "[Method] vs [Method]"
3. **Decision**: "Homeschool funding in [state]" / "How to get started homeschooling"

For answer engines (AI search, featured snippets), we optimize for:
- Clear, direct answers to specific questions
- Structured content with scannable headers
- Authoritative, cited information
- FAQ sections that match "People Also Ask" queries
