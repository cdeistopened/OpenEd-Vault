There's a quote that often circulates in special education settings:

"Everyone is a genius, but if you judge a fish on its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing it is stupid."

Most people share this with good intentions, praising the fish for being a great swimmer and respecting everyone's natural abilities.

As somebody diagnosed with ADHD late in life, I'm going to tell you something that might surprise you: I actually really hate this quote.

Here's why. There are valuable things at the top of that tree—things that come to people who pay their taxes on time and keep track of their driver's license, cell phone, and keys. I respect and celebrate the creativity and innovation that comes with ADHD—it's no accident that so many entrepreneurs have it. But I also want people with ADHD to reach the top of that tree. As a fish.

Sometimes that means somebody else who knows how to climb will need to grab a fishbowl, put the fish in it, and carry them to the top.

Let us be fish because that's where we thrive. But please don't tell us we don't have to reach the top of the tree. We do. Society demands it—and we want to get there too.

If that sounds overwhelming, I promise you: it doesn't have to be. Once you understand what's actually happening in your child's brain—and learn to work with it instead of against it—everything changes.

I was 36 years old, standing in the hallway of the school where I taught fifth grade, having a conversation with one of my eighth-grade students about fidget spinners. My mom, who taught at the same school, overheard us.

She pulled me aside later and said, "I think we missed something."

I went to my doctor and said, "I think I might have ADHD."

He looked at me and said, "Well, yeah."

Apparently, he had known all along. And he thought I knew it already too, and had just developed the skills and strategies to manage it.

That was a surprising time—to realize at 36 years old that the way my brain worked had a name, had been studied, and had strategies. Before that moment, I just thought I was... Andrea: a little scattered, incredibly passionate about certain things, but completely unable to focus on others.

Two years earlier, my oldest son Alex had been diagnosed with ADHD just before fourth grade. People often ask me, "When did you know Alex had ADHD?"

Alex was always exploring something, and I knew better than to try to guess what. I was constantly finding him somewhere unexpected. One of the most memorable was when he climbed out of his crib, up his dresser (wisely locked and fixed to the wall so he could handle exactly this sort of thing safely), and fell asleep in his top drawer.

So, I always knew Alex had ADHD. The only question was when it would start to negatively impact him.

More recently, teachers suggested my youngest son Dylan might also have ADHD. But this time, I was certain they were wrong. I thought I knew what ADHD looked like. Dylan wasn't like Alex or me.

It turns out, however, that Dylan does have ADHD—just a very different presentation. Understanding these different presentations—and the underlying neurology—completely changed how I approached parenting and teaching my sons.

Understanding the ADHD Brain
What ADHD Actually Is (And What It Isn't)
Let's start with the name itself: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Can we all agree that this is a terrible name?

People with ADHD actually do not have a deficit of attention. They have attention to spare. What they lack is control over what gets that attention. It's like having 50 channels on the television, and someone else controls the remote.

Here's how the brain works: The back of the brain stores information—everything you've learned and know. The front of the brain—the prefrontal cortex—controls how you use that information, and this is the part impacted by ADHD.

ADHD doesn't impact intelligence at all. As Dr. Russell Barkley, one of the leading ADHD experts, notes, you can get a 36 on the ACT and still do stupid things. If you have ADHD, that essentially becomes the story of your life.

The prefrontal cortex is responsible for executive function—your ability to self-monitor and self-adjust. People with ADHD love analogies, so I think of it like this: imagine a tiny child sitting in a big executive's desk, trying to run a company. That's what it feels like.

The 30% Rule
When Alex was first diagnosed, no one explained the developmental delay in executive function for people with ADHD—about 30 percent behind their peers (I round this up to one third because it's easier math).

That means if you have a 12-year-old with ADHD, their prefrontal cortex is only developed to about that of an 8-year-old. Would you have the same expectations for a sixth grader as a second grader? Would you expect a second grader to organize their own day or find papers they put somewhere last week?

This gap only gets bigger as they get older. By age 15, they've developed to about a 10-year-old's executive function. They're making progress, but are now five years behind their peers instead of four. By the time they're 18—maybe leaving home for college—they still have the executive function of someone starting middle school.

This is why scaffolding is essential and needs to be there longer than most people think.

Why "But This Is Important!" Doesn't Work
Neurotypical people have what's called an importance-based nervous system. ADHD people have an interest-based nervous system.

This means when you tell a neurotypical child, "This homework is important for your grade," their brain can engage with that. When you tell an ADHD child the same thing, their brain literally cannot access motivation through importance alone.

ADHD brains need one of four things to engage:

Interest (They find it genuinely fascinating)
Urgency (The deadline is NOW)
Novelty (It's new and different)
Challenge (It's difficult enough to be stimulating)
This is why your ADHD student can hyperfocus for six hours on building something in Minecraft but can't focus for six minutes on math homework.

When structuring learning at home, use this to your advantage. Can you make the math lesson about their interests? Add a time element? Try a new approach? Make it just challenging enough to be engaging?

A Homeschooling Framework for ADHD
The following strategies come from years of teaching students with ADHD, raising two sons with different presentations of ADHD, and managing my own ADHD as an adult—some learned from experts, some from trial and error.

Strategies for Parents
1. Build the Fishbowl

Let's go back to the fish and the tree… Your job isn't to teach the fish to climb. Your job is to build the fishbowl that gets them to the top.

That means you're going to be the external executive function while their internal one catches up. You're going to be the one who remembers the field trip permission slip, sets the timer, and breaks the project into steps.

Not forever. But for longer than you think.

2. Expect the Executive Function Age, Not the Chronological Age

Once I started thinking about Alex as having the executive function of someone five years younger, everything made more sense.

Would I expect an 8-year-old to wake up on time without help? No. Would I expect a 10-year-old to plan out their entire day? No. Would I expect a 12-year-old to navigate college applications independently? No.

So why was I expecting these things from my teenager with ADHD?

3. Understand the Wall of Awful

Every time your ADHD student tries to do something and fails, that failure gets added to an emotional wall they have to climb over before they can even start the task again.

Brendan Mahan of ADHD Essentials calls this "The Wall of Awful." For neurotypical people, starting an unpleasant task might feel like stepping over a small curb. For people with ADHD, it feels like scaling a 40-foot wall—a wall built from every past failure, criticism, and time they disappointed someone.

This is why your bright, capable kid can sit at the table for two hours without starting their work. They're not defiant. They're staring at a wall they don't know how to climb.

The solution isn't to lecture them about the importance of the task (that just makes the wall higher). The solution is to help them get over the wall:

Sit with them when they start (body doubling)
Break the task into the smallest possible first step
Remove distractions before they begin
Create novelty (new location, music, fidget toy)
Acknowledge the wall exists without judgment

4. Simplify Everything

One day, Dylan was working on a homework assignment using a visual graphic organizer. But this time, it wasn't working. Dylan could see all the steps at once—the whole project spread out in front of him. And instead of being helpful, it was overwhelming.

That's when I realized: the organizer itself had become the problem. So I grabbed some sticky notes and covered up everything except the one section he was working on.

Suddenly, he could focus.

That moment taught me something crucial: Don't give your kid with ADHD more to manage. Give them less.

5. Advocate for Accommodations

Accommodations aren't cheating. They're leveling the playing field.

If a kid can't see the board, we give them glasses. We don't say, "You need to learn to see better." We just give them glasses so they can learn the math.

ADHD accommodations work the same way.

How OpenEd Supports ADHD Students
This flexibility is exactly what OpenEd was designed to enable. As an OpenEd family, you have:

Complete curriculum freedom: You can switch math programs mid-year if needed.

Personalized pacing: Your ADHD student can spend extra time on topics that are hard and move quickly through topics that interest them.

Built-in support: Access to tutoring when they need extra help.

Real-world learning: Field trips, mentorships, project-based learning—all the hands-on, interest-based approaches that ADHD brains thrive on.

The Fish and the Tree, Revisited
I started by telling you I hate that quote about the fish and the tree. And I do.

But here's what I believe instead:

Don't judge the fish on its ability to climb. Build the fish a fishbowl, and carry that fish to the top of the tree yourself.

Because there are good things at the top of that tree. And your fish—your brilliant, creative, innovative fish—deserves to access them.

You can be that adult for your child. Stop fighting the fish. Build the fishbowl.

## Example 2: What is Open Education?

**URL**: https://opened.co/blog/what-is-open-education (or similar - this is likely the pillar page)
**Primary Keyword**: open education, what is open education
**Word Count**: ~3,000 words
**Author**: Charlie Deist

**What Makes It Great**:
- Uses extended metaphor (game show doors, operating system) to explain complex concept
- Historical context grounds the philosophy
- Real family examples make abstract ideas concrete
- Positions OpenEd without being salesy

Imagine you're on a game show. The host gestures to a stage, revealing three massive doors, and shouts, "It's time to choose your child's future!"

Behind Door #1 is your local school district. It's a known quantity—solid and dependable. You know what you're getting: a built-in community, a familiar structure, and no upfront cost.

Behind Door #2, you get a choice of several curated private school packages. There's the local Catholic school, the innovative tech-focused magnet school, or the quirky, nature-based forest school. Each offers a distinct philosophy and a strong community, but they come with a hefty price tag and their own set of non-negotiables.

Then there's Door #3. You push it open and find yourself standing at the entrance to a dizzying, endless hallway. A hundred smaller doors stretch out before you into the horizon, each labeled with a different curriculum, co-op, or educational philosophy. This is the homeschool option—the ultimate freedom, but also the ultimate burden of choice.

For generations, this has been the game. You pick a door, then maybe another door, and hope you've chosen wisely.

But education isn't actually a game show where you have to swear loyalty to what's behind a single door. Perhaps we need a better analogy.

Let's think of education as a kind of computer operating system.

An operating system (OS) is the foundational software that runs everything on a device. It dictates what programs you can use and how they work together. For the last 150 years, the vast majority of us have been using the same one.

The prize behind Door #1, the public school, is like a corporate PC from the 90s—it comes pre-loaded with approved software (Windows 95), it's hard to customize, and it's designed for institutional efficiency, not the individual user.

The options behind Door #2 are like niche computer brands that run a proprietary version of that same OS. And the endless hallway behind Door #3, homeschooling, has traditionally been like building your own computer from scratch—a powerful option, but only accessible to the most dedicated hobbyists.

The reason you can't easily take the math program from the tech magnet school, the nature walks from the forest school, and the literature list from a Classical curriculum is the same reason you can't run an iPhone app on a Windows PC. They were built to run on different, incompatible platforms.

The solution isn't another door. The solution is a better operating system.

This is open education. It's the modern, flexible education OS designed for the user, not the institution. It's the platform that finally allows you to download and run the best "apps" from every tradition—Montessori, Classical, virtual, project-based—and have them all work together seamlessly on a single platform.

The Story of Our Outdated eOS
The operating system we've all been running was designed in the 1840s. Its lead architect, Horace Mann, saw a nation grappling with the chaos of the Industrial Revolution and prescribed a powerful solution: the "common school."

It was a brilliant piece of social engineering for its time. It took a diverse, scattered, and largely uneducated populace and created a scalable system to produce literate citizens and competent factory workers. Its core features—age-based grades, a standardized curriculum, bell schedules, and batch processing of students—seemed revolutionary. It was, in effect, a human assembly line.

The rigidity of this system wasn't a bug; it was the central feature. Standardization was the goal.

As Matt Bowman and Isaac Morehouse put it in the Open Education book:

"The system sorted children by manufacture date (what we now call grade levels), processed them into batches, and tested their conformity at regular intervals. Those who didn't fit the mold were labeled as troublemakers or failures."

The problem is that while every other industry has undergone relentless reinvention, the basic architecture of school has remained frozen in time.

The Great Unbundling Begins
For decades, the system chugged along. But in the 21st century, the cracks began to show.

The internet was the first major shock to the system. Suddenly, world-class expertise was no longer confined to a single building. The "unbundling" began as families realized they could get a better math component from Khan Academy or a more engaging history class from an Outschool teacher.

Then came the pandemic, the single greatest stress test the system had ever faced. For millions of parents, it was the moment their old eOS finally crashed.

The numbers tell the story. Public school enrollment dropped by 1.2 million students across thirty-seven states. Homeschooling grew by about 1 million during that same period. Parents everywhere had the same realization: Wait, I can do this?

Kerry McDonald, a leading voice in alternative education and the author of Joyful Learning, explains: "Remote learning gave parents an up-close view of what was actually happening in their students' classrooms... A lot of the parents and founders that I've talked to said, 'Hey, I can do this. This isn't rocket science.'"

The New eOS—Open Education & the Platform for Everything
We are living through what could be called the "iOS moment" for education.

In the same way that the iPhone was not merely an upgraded iPod mp3 player, open education is not another competing program or philosophy. It is a new operating system. It is the clean, flexible, user-centric platform designed to finally run all the best programs together.

On this new platform, you can place the "Montessori app" for hands-on, self-directed learning in the early years right next to the "Classical literature app" for building a foundation in the great books. You can run a "Beast Academy app" for conceptual math while simultaneously accessing a "Forest School co-op app" for real-world science. They all work together because the underlying operating system is built for flexibility, not rigidity.

Real Examples of the New eOS in Action
The move to open education often begins with a simple realization: the traditional schedule isn't sacred.

Consider Breakout School in Utah, a program that spends 80-90% of its time outside and is specifically designed for students with autism and ADHD. Students who hated traditional school are now thriving. The founder, Dr. Dow Richardson, calls their challenges "their superpower."

Kerry McDonald notes: "Now we're able to tap into such extraordinary, in some cases, free or low-cost software, like Khan Academy... That just makes these unconventional spaces able to do what they're going to do."

Your Permission Slip to Design
You don't have to have it all figured out today. You just need to take the first step: opening your mind to the possibility that your child's education can be different.

Here's what we know from working with thousands of families: You are more qualified than anyone to make these decisions for your child. You know them better than any system ever could.

The era of being locked into a single, rigid system is over.

With a new operating system, you have permission to take what works, leave what doesn't, and build something better.

Let's be honest: homeschooling comes with significant costs. You pay once for educational materials, again through lost income while teaching, and yet again through property taxes that fund schools your children don't attend. For many families, these financial realities feel like insurmountable barriers to providing quality home education.

But here's what we discovered after reviewing learning plans from more than 100,000 families who have gone through the OpenEd program in the past decade: the most successful homeschoolers often spend almost nothing on curriculum. While public schools spend an average of roughly $16,000 per student annually, resourceful parents are building exceptional learning environments using free resources.

Once parents master the art of combining high-quality free resources, the correlation between educational spending and learning outcomes disappears. This guide will show you how to do exactly that.

The Evolution of Homeschool Resources
The landscape of educational resources has transformed dramatically over the past decade. Remember when finding curriculum meant thumbing through thick catalogs or traveling to crowded conventions? Pilgrimages that often ended with parents investing hundreds to thousands of dollars in an all-in-one boxed curricula, hoping they'd made the right choice.

Then came 2020. As millions of families got their first taste of learning at home, something unexpected happened: an explosion of educational innovation. Entrepreneurs, teachers, and parents started creating and sharing resources at an unprecedented scale.

Two powerful movements accelerated this transformation. First, the open source revolution brought us platforms like Khan Academy, making world-class instruction freely available. Now, we're seeing the next evolution—the broader Open Education movement, where parents are breaking down walls between traditional and alternative approaches to learning.

Finding What Works for Your Family
Here's what nobody tells you about curriculum: the best resources aren't necessarily the most expensive or the most polished. They're the ones that make your child's eyes light up with curiosity.

Most parents start their homeschool journey feeling like they need to replicate traditional school at home. Buy the textbooks, follow the scope and sequence, check all the boxes. But after working with thousands of families, we've seen that the most successful approaches are often more creative.

Take math, for instance. One family we work with combines Khan Academy's video lessons with hands-on projects from OpenStax. Their third grader learns fractions by cooking (free recipes online) and geometry by building (free project plans from maker sites). Total cost? Zero dollars. Results? A child who loves math.

Free Math Curricula
Khan Academy stands as the gold standard for online mathematics instruction, offering comprehensive coverage from early math through calculus. Their systematic approach and adaptive practice has served over 60 million students worldwide.

CK-12's interactive "FlexBooks" provide another robust option, combining digital textbooks with simulations and practice problems.

For elementary students, FreeMath Program offers a carefully structured curriculum that distills essential skills from top textbooks into clear, printable lessons.

Free Language Arts Curricula
Project Gutenberg opens the door to over 60,000 free eBooks, making it simple to build a literature-based curriculum.

K12 Reader provides an extensive collection of reading comprehension worksheets, grammar exercises, and writing prompts—all organized by grade level.

Starfall has revolutionized early reading instruction with their interactive phonics activities and simple stories.

Free Science Curricula
Discovery K12 provides a full science curriculum with daily lessons, videos, and assignments aligned with standard grade-level expectations.

The Smithsonian Learning Lab gives students access to millions of digital resources from across the institution's collections.

Free History & Social Studies Resources
The Big History Project, backed by leading historians, offers a unique approach that connects historical events to scientific developments.

PBS Learning Media provides thousands of free history documentaries, video clips, and lesson plans.

Free All-in-One Homeschool Platforms
Easy Peasy All-in-One Homeschool stands out by offering a complete, day-by-day curriculum for all grades and subjects.

Discovery K12 provides a comprehensive online curriculum covering all core subjects with built-in scheduling tools.

Freedom Homeschooling serves as a central directory for free curriculum options.

Building Your Complete Curriculum
The key to success with free resources isn't just finding them—it's knowing how to combine them effectively. Many of our most successful families follow a simple formula:

Choose one primary resource per subject
Add supplementary materials for extra practice or different learning styles
Incorporate hands-on projects and real-world applications
Use community resources to enrich learning

Take the Martinez family, who turned their dining room into a learning space. Each morning starts with Khan Academy math on a shared laptop. The children work in 30-minute rotations—while one child does math practice, another reads from library books, and a third works on science.

Education Savings Accounts (ESAs)
The landscape of educational funding has shifted dramatically in recent years. Education Savings Accounts are now available in numerous states. These programs typically provide families with several thousand dollars annually for educational expenses.

Common ESA-eligible expenses include:
- Basic educational supplies and materials
- Technology needs (computers, educational software)
- Enrichment activities and field trips
- Specialized curriculum or learning tools
- Educational services and tutoring

Take Arizona's ESA program, for example. Families receive about 90% of what the state would have spent on their child in public school. This means while you're using Khan Academy for math and Easy Peasy for language arts, you could allocate ESA funds toward hands-on learning materials or educational experiences.

Taking the First Step
The journey to quality home education doesn't begin with an expensive curriculum package—it starts with a curious mind and thoughtful planning. Our decade of research shows that successful homeschoolers aren't defined by their budget, but by how intentionally they combine resources to match their children's needs.

## Example 4: What the New York Times Got Wrong About Homeschooling

Emma Goldberg's recent piece in the New York Times on America's homeschooling movement gets a lot right. Her reporting from the Great Homeschool Convention in Texas is vivid and immersive, and she's 100% correct that something significant is happening.

The numbers don't lie: homeschooling has more than doubled since the pandemic.

But Goldberg's safari-style narrative—studying homeschoolers like exotic specimens at a water park resort—also conceals the real story about what's happening with education outside of traditional classrooms.

We found three main misunderstandings that are far from unique to this article.

First, it paints a diverse movement that spans the political and cultural spectrum as motivated by uniform concerns.

Second, it frames parental confidence as anti-expert sentiment.

Finally, it presents a forward-looking revolution as a backwards retreat, ignoring novel educational approaches that are preparing children for a rapidly changing world.

Correction #1: There Is No Single "Movement"
Readers of the article will come away with the impression that homeschoolers are mostly cut from the same cloth: social conservatives motivated by religious beliefs.

That label has some historical basis. In the late 1970s and early '80s, Dr. Raymond Moore and his wife Dorothy helped galvanize a Christian homeschooling movement. But at the same time, a different current of thought was taking shape through figures like John Holt, who envisioned homeschooling as a liberatory, child-led alternative to standardized schooling.

Today, homeschooling is neither uniform nor fringe. As Kerry McDonald, host of the LiberatED podcast and author of Joyful Learning, puts it:

"More families are attracted to homeschooling and related approaches because they offer the educational personalization and flexibility that are often missing in a conventional classroom."

Research from Angela Watson's Hopkins Homeschool Research Lab confirms this: 29% of homeschoolers identify as Democrats—far from the stereotype the Times reinforces.

Correction #2: Parents are Coordinators of Expertise, Not Know-It-Alls
The article's second blind spot treats parental confidence as anti-expert sentiment. It quotes TikTok homeschool influencer Jessica Ellis, a former public school teacher:

"I truly believe there is nobody—nobody in the world—that is more equipped to teach your child than you."

Goldberg frames this as hubris. But this misses Ellis's deeper point: parents don't claim superior subject knowledge—they correctly assert that they know and care about their children in ways no expert can.

Dr. Claire Honeycutt, a neuroscientist who left her tenured professorship to homeschool, embodies this distinction:

"You may not know everything some teacher knows, but you know your kid, and you'll fight to ensure they get everything they need."

Corey DeAngelis, author of The Parent Revolution, makes much the same point:

"You don't have to be a surgeon to choose your child's doctor, and you don't need a teaching degree to know what's best for your child's education."

Furthermore, the right comparison for most homeschoolers isn't parents versus world-class teachers. The question is whether parents offer something better than what their local boundary district school delivers. In many places, that bar is shockingly low.

"In Chicago," DeAngelis notes, "there are 30 to 40 schools with zero percent math proficiency rates—parents can do better than zero percent."

Correction #3: Parents are Preparing for Tomorrow, Not Yesterday
Perhaps the article's biggest misunderstanding is its backward-looking frame. When Goldberg quotes a conference speaker advising against college (except STEM), it's presented as regressive alarmism.

But this reflects an increasingly mainstream opinion, backed by ample data. A Gates Foundation survey found only 58% of current high schoolers believe "a good job requires a college degree." According to the Federal Reserve, nearly 40% of recent college grads are underemployed.

Families aren't retreating from reality—they're asking forward-thinking questions: How do we prepare children for nonexistent jobs? For careers prioritizing adaptability over credentials?

At OpenEd, we see families mixing project-based learning with rigorous academics, prioritizing communication and emotional intelligence alongside math and science. They're building portfolios and businesses, not just padding GPAs.

Where Goldberg sees a fracturing, we see a refactoring (programming lingo for restructuring the system to make it cleaner, more efficient, and adaptive).

Few parents reject the system entirely—most recognize its limitations. Some walk away completely; others take pieces and build something more responsive: Microschools. Online academies. Hybrid charters. Co-ops. Apprenticeships. Tutors. Forest schools.

Again, there's no single "home-school movement"—just millions of decisions by parents who've stopped outsourcing judgment. But whether parents identify as home-schoolers, homeschoolers, or something else entirely, the opening up of education is here to stay.

- **Empathy before solution**: Each article acknowledges reader pain points upfront before offering answers
- **Conversational but substantive**: Uses accessible language while delivering genuine insights
- **Confident without being preachy**: Takes clear positions but respects reader intelligence

### Structural Patterns
- **Problem-solution intros**: Openings establish the challenge before previewing the value
- **Memorable frameworks**: Creates sticky concepts (fishbowl metaphor, 30% rule, OS analogy)
- **Real examples**: Family stories and specific use cases make abstract ideas concrete
- **Expert quotes for credibility**: Kerry McDonald, Corey DeAngelis, Dr. Honeycutt
- **Natural product integration**: OpenEd appears as solution without hard sell

### Content Patterns
- **Specific numbers and data**: "100,000 families," "1.2 million students," "29% of homeschoolers"
- **Named resources and tools**: Khan Academy, Beast Academy, specific curriculum recommendations
- **Reframes common assumptions**: Fish/tree quote reframe, "preparation for tomorrow not yesterday"
- **Actionable takeaways**: Not just philosophy but practical strategies parents can implement

### SEO Patterns
- **Primary keyword in opening**: Target keyword appears naturally early
- **Question-based H2 headings**: "What ADHD Actually Is," "Why Ads Aren't the Best Choice"
- **Internal linking opportunities**: References to other OpenEd content, podcast, methods
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Long-form content (2,000-3,500 words) that fully addresses topic

## Usage Notes

When writing new content:
1. **Read these examples before starting** to internalize the OpenEd voice
2. **Reference during writing** when unsure about tone or structure
3. **Compare your draft** to these examples for consistency check
4. **Match the quality bar** these examples set

These aren't templates to copy—they're examples of voice, tone, and quality to emulate while creating original, valuable content for homeschool families.
