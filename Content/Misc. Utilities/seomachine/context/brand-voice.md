# OpenEd Brand Voice & Messaging

This document defines the OpenEd brand voice, tone, and messaging framework. Reference this when writing all content to ensure consistency.

## Brand Voice Pillars

### 1. Empowering, Not Preachy
- **What it means**: We position parents as capable decision-makers, not students who need instruction
- **How it sounds**: Confident, supportive, respecting their intelligence and autonomy
- **Example**: "You know your child better than any system ever could. We're here to support what you're already building."
- **Avoid**: Condescension, lecturing, talking down, positioning ourselves as the experts who will "save" them

### 2. Conversational & Direct
- **What it means**: Write like you're talking to a friend who's smart and busy
- **How it sounds**: Natural rhythm, plain language, no corporate jargon or edu-speak
- **Example**: "Most curriculum guides tell you what to buy. We're going to tell you what actually matters."
- **Avoid**: Academic language, buzzwords like "leverage," "optimize," "innovative pedagogical frameworks"

### 3. Honest About Challenges
- **What it means**: Acknowledge the real struggles of homeschooling without sugar-coating
- **How it sounds**: Empathetic, real, acknowledging the gap between Instagram homeschool and actual homeschool
- **Example**: "Some days fall apart by 10am. That doesn't mean you're doing it wrong - it means you're actually doing it."
- **Avoid**: Over-promising, toxic positivity, pretending homeschooling is always beautiful

### 4. Anti-Dogmatic
- **What it means**: No single approach is "the answer" - families mix and match what works
- **How it sounds**: Open-minded, flexible, celebrating experimentation
- **Example**: "Charlotte Mason for nature study, Singapore Math for arithmetic, and screen time for coding - if it works for your family, it works."
- **Avoid**: Declaring any method superior, creating guilt about not following one approach purely

### 5. Contrarian When Necessary
- **What it means**: Challenge conventional education assumptions without being preachy about it
- **How it sounds**: Confident, willing to name problems clearly, but focused on solutions
- **Example**: "The system was designed to process students efficiently. Your child isn't a product on an assembly line."
- **Avoid**: Being preachy or self-righteous, attacking individuals instead of systems, doom-and-gloom without hope

## Tone Guidelines

### General Tone
Imagine you're an experienced homeschool mom at a co-op, talking to a newer mom who's overwhelmed. You've been there, you know it's hard, you've figured some things out, and you want to help - not by telling her what to do, but by sharing what you've learned. You're warm but direct. You don't waste her time.

### Tone Variations by Content Type

**How-To Guides**: Practical, clear, encouraging
- "Start with 20 minutes. That's it."
- "If this feels overwhelming, skip to the 'minimum viable' section."
- "This isn't the only way - it's one way that works."

**Philosophy/Method Deep Dives**: Thoughtful, nuanced, exploratory
- "Charlotte Mason created a method, not a rulebook."
- "The tension between structure and freedom isn't a bug - it's the whole point."
- "Most families land somewhere in between."

**Newsletter/Daily Content**: Personal, punchy, conversational
- "Something interesting happened this week."
- "I've been thinking about this wrong."
- "Here's what actually changed my mind."

**Advocacy/Movement Content**: Confident, visionary, rallying
- "Education is being unbundled. Families are taking it back."
- "Your child's uniqueness isn't a problem. It's the point."
- "This isn't about rejecting school - it's about building something better."

## Messaging Framework

### Core Brand Messages

#### Message 1: Parents Are the Best Designers
- **Concept**: Parents know their children better than any system and are capable of designing their education
- **Key Points**:
  - You don't need teaching credentials to educate your child
  - Your observations about your child are more valuable than any standardized assessment
  - The abundance of resources means you can build exactly what your child needs
- **Usage**: When addressing parental self-doubt, imposter syndrome, or comparisons to "real" teachers

#### Message 2: Education Should Fit the Child
- **Concept**: The child shouldn't have to adapt to a one-size-fits-all system - education should adapt to them
- **Key Points**:
  - Every child learns differently and at their own pace
  - "Behind" and "ahead" are fictions created by arbitrary grade-level standards
  - Mastery matters more than moving on by calendar date
- **Usage**: When discussing learning differences, pacing, curriculum choices, or comparison anxiety

#### Message 3: Mix and Match What Works
- **Concept**: Open education means taking the best from any approach and leaving the rest
- **Key Points**:
  - You don't have to be "pure" Charlotte Mason or "pure" unschooling
  - Different approaches work for different subjects and different kids
  - Experimentation is part of the process
- **Usage**: When discussing curriculum choices, methods, or parental guilt about not following one approach

#### Message 4: Learning Is Natural
- **Concept**: Children are born curious - the system often breaks that, but it can be restored
- **Key Points**:
  - Curiosity doesn't need to be manufactured; it needs to be protected
  - Interest-led learning produces deeper understanding than forced instruction
  - The goal is kindling a fire, not filling a vessel
- **Usage**: When discussing unschooling, deschooling, motivation, or resistant learners

### Value Propositions

**For the Overwhelmed New Homeschooler**:
"We help you cut through the noise to find what actually works for your family - with funding, community, and expert support so you're not doing this alone."

**For the Experienced Homeschooler Seeking Community**:
"Connect with families who share your values and teachers who understand open education - plus funding for the resources you've been DIY-ing."

**For the Parent of a Child Who Doesn't Fit the Mold**:
"Your child's differences aren't a problem to fix - they're the starting point for designing an education that actually works for them."

**For the Parent Frustrated with Traditional School**:
"There's another way. And it doesn't require becoming a certified teacher or giving up your sanity."

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Sentence Structure
- **Vary length**: Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones
- **Active voice preferred**: "We fund your child's education" not "Your child's education is funded by us"
- **Average length**: 15-20 words per sentence
- **Clarity first**: If in doubt, make it shorter and simpler

### Paragraph Structure
- **Length**: 2-4 sentences typically
- **One idea per paragraph**: Don't cram multiple points together
- **Transitions**: Use natural bridges, not "Furthermore" or "Moreover"
- **White space**: Let the page breathe - dense blocks lose readers

### Word Choice
- **Conversational**: Write how you'd speak to a fellow homeschool parent
- **Specific**: "87% of grown unschoolers" not "many people"
- **Active verbs**: "Build," "Create," "Design," "Fund" - not "utilize," "facilitate," "implement"
- **Cut filler**: Remove "very," "really," "actually," "just" unless truly needed

### Terminology

**Say This** → **Not That**
- Open education → Alternative education (sounds marginal)
- Homeschool families → Homeschoolers (focuses on people, not practice)
- Learning differences → Learning disabilities (when context allows - emphasizes difference, not deficit)
- Educational freedom → School choice (broader, less political)
- Design your education → Customize your curriculum (active, not passive)
- Mix and match → Eclectic approach (more accessible)
- Interest-led → Child-centered (more concrete)

### Dash Usage
Use regular hyphens with spaces for parenthetical breaks - like this - not em dashes (—) or en dashes (–). This creates a more natural, conversational appearance.

## Content Formatting

### Headlines
- **Be specific**: "How to Start Homeschooling in Utah" not "Getting Started with Homeschooling"
- **Include benefit**: Tell reader what they'll gain or learn
- **Use numbers when helpful**: "7 Charlotte Mason Principles" or "Complete Guide to..."
- **Keep concise**: 60 characters or less for SEO

### Subheadings
- **Make them scannable**: Reader should understand article from headings alone
- **Use questions**: "What Is Unschooling?" works well for SEO and readability
- **Be specific**: "Nature Study" not "Another Approach"
- **Include keywords naturally**: Don't stuff, but be deliberate

### Lists
- **Use sparingly**: Don't rely on bullets as a crutch
- **Parallel structure**: Each item should be grammatically consistent
- **Introduce properly**: Don't drop into lists without context
- **Keep items similar length**: Long bullet + short bullet looks awkward

### Calls-to-Action
- **Be specific**: "Join a free info session" not "Learn more"
- **Focus on value**: What does the reader get?
- **One primary CTA**: Don't overwhelm with options
- **Natural placement**: CTAs should feel like helpful next steps, not sales pitches

## Voice Examples

### Excellent OpenEd Voice ✅

"When Dr. Phil devoted an episode to what he called 'the fastest growing trend in American education,' the comments section exploded. The segment featured a family on a farm where children learn by building fairy villages, managing fires, and caring for livestock. No curriculum. No grades. No classroom.

'Educational neglect!' some viewers cried. 'Save these children!'

But then the teachers started showing up.

'I'm a former public school teacher with a Master's Degree in Education,' wrote one. 'I left teaching in 2021... and I believe without a doubt that unschooling is the future of education.'"

**Why this works**:
- Opens with a specific, interesting hook
- Shows conflict without preaching
- Lets voices speak for themselves
- Builds intrigue through narrative
- No "In today's world..." or "Let that sink in"

### Not OpenEd Voice ❌

"In today's ever-changing educational landscape, many parents are beginning to explore alternative pedagogical approaches that prioritize individualized learning experiences. Homeschooling isn't just about teaching at home - it's about creating a transformative educational journey that empowers young learners to reach their full potential.

The best part? You don't need to be a certified teacher to facilitate meaningful learning experiences for your children."

**Why this fails**:
- Generic opener ("In today's ever-changing...")
- Jargon ("pedagogical approaches," "facilitate")
- Forbidden construction ("isn't just X - it's Y")
- Forbidden flourish ("The best part?")
- Vague ("transformative," "full potential")
- No specifics, no story, no humanity

## Audience Understanding

**Primary Audience**: Sarah - The Overwhelmed Homeschool Mom
- Mid-30s to mid-40s, suburban, 2-3 kids

- Leans conservative, possibly faith-based, some "crunchy" sensibilities
- Drowning in curriculum options but paralyzed by choice
