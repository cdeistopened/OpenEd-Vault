## Common Questions & Objections

### "Is OpenEd really free?"
**Answer**: Yes. OpenEd is funded through state Education Savings Account (ESA) programs. Families receive a reimbursement wallet to purchase approved educational resources at no out-of-pocket cost.

### "Do I need to be a certified teacher?"
**Answer**: No. You know your child better than anyone. Your job is to design and coordinate their education - we provide the teacher support, resources, and funding to make it happen.

### "What if a curriculum isn't working?"
**Answer**: Switch it. Complete curriculum freedom means you can try different approaches until you find what clicks. No bureaucracy, no judgment.

### "Will my child be socialized?"
**Answer**: OpenEd families have access to clubs, field trips, park days, virtual events, and community connections. Many families find their children are more socialized through homeschool than they were in traditional school.

### "How is this different from regular homeschooling?"
**Answer**: Regular homeschooling means doing everything yourself - finding curriculum, paying for it, figuring out requirements. OpenEd provides funding, a curated marketplace, teacher support, and community. You get the freedom of homeschool with the support of a program.

### "Is OpenEd available in my state?"
**Answer**: OpenEd currently operates in Utah, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, and Oregon. We're expanding as more states adopt ESA programs.

## Content Creation Guidelines

When writing about OpenEd features:

1. **Lead with parent empowerment**: Position parents as capable designers, not students who need instruction
2. **Emphasize funding + support**: The combination of free access AND professional help is our unique value
3. **Show flexibility**: Highlight ability to mix methods, switch curriculum, adapt to child
4. **Include real examples**: Sample schedules, family stories, specific resource combinations
5. **Address the overwhelm**: Acknowledge curriculum paralysis and position OpenEd as the solution
6. **Avoid education jargon**: "Design your child's education" not "implement pedagogical frameworks"
7. **Match audience to pain point**: New homeschoolers need reassurance; experienced ones need funding info
