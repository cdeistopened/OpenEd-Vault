**Text:** BLAME SCHOOL

**Guidelines:**

### YouTube Description

2. Full description (2-3 sentences)
3. Resources section (with clickable links)
4. Chapters section (formatted timestamps)

**Example:**

Parents worry about smartphones destroying their kids' mental health. But research shows something very different is actually causing anxiety and depression in teens.

In this episode, biopsychologist Dr. Peter Gray reveals what 83% of anxious teens actually cite as their primary source of stress—and it's not what you think. He breaks down decades of research, challenges the popular narrative about social media, and explains why we keep blaming new media instead of looking at the real problem.

---

### Cold Open Script

**Format:** Simple verbatim clips with speaker labels and timestamps

**Example:**

```
(00:00-00:05)
PETER: We have convinced children that how they're doing a school
is a measure of them. That they are constantly being judged.
They're constantly being assessed. They're being compared to others.

(00:05-00:13)
PETER: Every year, this has been true for a long time. Every year,
the rate of suicide and the rate of admission into mental hospitals,
emergency admissions for pediatric mental health emergencies plummets.
It goes way down. Every summer, school closes and the kids are doing
better. School opens up and it gets worse again.

(00:13-00:15)
PETER: School is a direct cause of anxiety and depression.

(00:15-00:28)
ELA: So when they asked teenagers what's stressing them out...

PETER: 83% Check school. Nothing else came close.
```

**Guidelines:**
- Total duration: 22-35 seconds
- All quotes must be verbatim (exactly as spoken)
- End with unresolved cliffhanger (listener wants to know more)
- Include speaker labels and approximate timestamps
- Arrange clips in narrative sequence (not chronological—for impact)

---

### Approved Social Clips

**Format:**
- Clip number & title
- Duration
- On-screen hook text (2-4 words for maximum impact)
- Full verbatim transcript
- Platform recommendations
- Best use case

**Example:**

### Clip 1: School as a Measuring Stick
**Duration:** 1:15 | **On-Screen Hook:** Summer = kids get better. School = kids get worse. Every year. Without exception.

```
PETER: We have convinced children that how they're doing a school is a measure of them.
That they are constantly being judged. They're constantly being assessed. They're being
compared to others. They're being made to feel like, if I am a failure at school, I'm a
failure as a human being.

And it's no surprise that every year, this has been true for a long time. Every year, the
rate of suicide and the rate of admission into mental hospitals, emergency admissions for
pediatric mental health emergencies plummets. It goes way down. Every summer, school
closes and the kids are doing better. School opens up and it gets worse again, it even
plummeted during the COVID lockdown, suicides, anxiety, depression, mental health,
admissions, all went down. They didn't go back up again. Even when schools opened online,
they didn't go back up again until school opened up in person.

School is a direct cause of anxiety and depression.
```

**Platform:** YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok
**Best for:** Parent guilt/validation

---

### Clip 2: Computer Games Are Real Play
**Duration:** 1:20 | **On-Screen Hook:** Your kid's gaming habit might be the healthiest thing they're doing.

```
PETER: Now kids had a new way they could do it on the computers, they could play
computer games. And computer games are real play people. Adults wanna demonize them. But
the truth of the matter is this is real play. And the kids enjoyed them. They're creative,
they're interactive. Once you had an internet connection and they were multiplayer games,
they were interactive.

And so I went back and reviewed the research from those times, and the research is
unequivocal those kids who were on computers and playing computer games, even if you
control for background factors like socioeconomic category and so on. We're doing better
psychologically than those who weren't on computer games. So, and this was, this is true
for every age group. It's true for young kids as well as for teenagers.

So the computer was kind of a saving grace.
```

**Platform:** YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels
**Best for:** Permission + research credibility

---

### Clip 3: Why We Blame the Wrong Thing
**Duration:** 1:10 | **On-Screen Hook:** We'd rather blame TikTok than admit the truth about school.

```
PETER: The story that a lot of people wanna believe, which I do not believe. Is that what
accounted for getting worse is social media. The iPhone became increasingly popular. Kids
were kids, had smartphones. They were on smartphones a lot. And it's very tempting for
adults to look at kids on smartphones and say, oh, they're addicted to it. Or, this is
why they're not getting together in person is because they're spending all their time on
smartphones.

This whole story that has been around for a while is not supported by science. Uh, the
scientific research does not support this story. There have been actually literally
hundreds of studies looking at correlation between smartphone use, social media use, and
mental, uh, health among young people, uh, which all in all show no, no meaningful
correlation.

So we, as a culture, we would far rather blame social media than blame school. School
has a halo around it.
```

**Platform:** YouTube, LinkedIn
**Best for:** Contrarian + shareable
