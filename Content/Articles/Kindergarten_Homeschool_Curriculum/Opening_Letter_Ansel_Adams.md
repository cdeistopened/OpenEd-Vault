## The Lesson of Ansel Adams

If you’re stressed about choosing a kindergarten curriculum, I want you to think about Ansel Adams.

Before he was the legendary photographer who defined the American landscape, he was a 12-year-old boy who was miserable in school. Hyperactive and unable to sit still, he described his classroom as a "dreadful" place where the sun and fog played outside while he was trapped inside.

His father did something radical for 1915: he pulled Ansel out.

He didn't buy a boxed curriculum. He gave Ansel a year's pass to the World's Fair and told him, "That will be your school." They traveled to Yosemite, where Ansel got his first camera. His father protected what he called Ansel's "internal spark"—that fragile curiosity that standardized schooling was threatening to extinguish.

Today, that spark is more important than ever. The World Economic Forum reports that we are preparing children for jobs that don't even exist yet. In that future, the ability to sit still and fill out a worksheet will be far less valuable than the ability to observe, adapt, and create.

This week on the blog, we are breaking down how to build a "Kindergarten Without Walls"—one that prioritizes freedom over busy work. We’ve curated the best resources from our team of teachers (real, specific picks like *Math with Confidence* and *Handwriting Without Tears*) to help you build a foundation that honors your child's development.
