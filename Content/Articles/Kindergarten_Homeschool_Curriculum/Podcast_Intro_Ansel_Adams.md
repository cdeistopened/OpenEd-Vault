# Podcast Intro: The Ansel Adams Method

**Host:** If you’re staring at a stack of kindergarten worksheets and feeling a knot in your stomach, I want you to think about a 12-year-old boy named Ansel.

Before he was the legendary photographer who defined the American West, Ansel Adams was... a problem student. He was hyperactive. He couldn't sit still. He described his classroom as a "dreadful" place where the sun was shining outside, but he was trapped in the dark.

So, in 1915, his father did something radical. He didn't buy a better curriculum. He didn't hire a tutor to force him to sit still.

He pulled him out.

He gave Ansel a year's pass to the World's Fair and said, "That will be your school." They went to Yosemite. He got his first camera. His father prioritized what he called Ansel's "internal spark" over his ability to conform.

Today, we're talking about how to do the same thing for your kindergartner. We call it "Kindergarten Without Walls."

We're going to look at why the $10 billion curriculum industry wants you to panic, and why the research says you should actually relax. Plus, we’ve got specific, teacher-approved resources—from "Math with Confidence" to "Handwriting Without Tears"—that honor that internal spark instead of extinguishing it.

Welcome to the show.
