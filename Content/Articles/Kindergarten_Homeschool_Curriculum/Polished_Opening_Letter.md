Greetings Eddies,

With Thanksgiving approaching, we’re shuffling the deck: **Deep Dive Wednesday is moving to Tuesday.** Tomorrow, we’ll share our latest podcast with Jean Lee, founder of the Academy of Chaos (get pumped).

Then on Thursday, we’re taking a break from Open Education to open... well, probably a second bottle of wine.

But before we sign off, a thought on **gratitude and freedom.**

If you’re stressed about choosing a kindergarten curriculum, think about Ansel Adams.

Before he was the photographer who defined the American landscape, he was a miserable 12-year-old. Hyperactive and unable to sit still, he described his classroom as a "dreadful" place where the sun played outside while he was trapped in the dark.

In 1915, his father did something radical: **he pulled him out.**

He didn't buy a boxed curriculum. He gave Ansel a year's pass to the World's Fair and said, *"That will be your school."* They traveled to Yosemite. He got his first camera. His father protected what he called Ansel's "internal spark"—that fragile curiosity standardized schooling threatened to extinguish.

Today, that spark is more important than ever. The World Economic Forum warns we are preparing children for jobs that don't exist yet. In that future, the ability to sit still and fill out a worksheet will be worthless compared to the ability to observe, adapt, and create.

This week on the blog, we’re breaking down how to build a **"Kindergarten Without Walls"**—one that prioritizes freedom over busy work. We’ve curated the best resources from our team of teachers (real picks like *Math with Confidence* and *Handwriting Without Tears*) to help you build a foundation that honors your child's development.

Enjoy the short week,

– Charlie (the OpenEd newsletter guy)
