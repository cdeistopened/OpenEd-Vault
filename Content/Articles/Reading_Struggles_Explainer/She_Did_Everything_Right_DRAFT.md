Janssen Bradshaw had every advantage a parent could want when it comes to raising readers.

She grew up in a home where her mom - an English major - read aloud every single day. Even in high school, they'd sit together with two copies of *Pride and Prejudice*, taking turns page by page. Janssen became an elementary school librarian. She started Everyday Reading, a blog and Instagram account dedicated to books. Her house has somewhere between 2,000 and 5,000 books in it.

When her first daughter tested at a 12th-grade reading level in kindergarten, Janssen figured this is just what happens when you surround kids with books from birth.

Then came her second daughter.

"I started working with her when she was like three - her letters, her sounds, all the same things I'd done with my oldest child," Janssen told me. "And it was just not clicking for her."

She kept at it. Same methods. Same environment. Same read-alouds and library trips and books everywhere. But by first grade, a teacher delivered the news at a parent-teacher conference: her daughter was barely at grade level - the very lowest they could call "at grade level" - and she was drifting lower with each assessment.

Same mom. Same books. Completely opposite outcomes.

"My second daughter is extremely bright," Janssen said. "It was not like she was not smart. But learning to read is just really hard for some kids. And for her, it was really difficult."

## Why Early Reading Struggles Matter So Much

If you're watching your child struggle with reading, you probably already sense that time matters. The research confirms it.

The shift happens around third grade. Before that, kids are "learning to read" - decoding words, building fluency, making the connection between sounds and symbols. After third grade, they're "reading to learn" - using reading as a tool to absorb everything else. History. Science. Math word problems. Instructions.

"If you get to third grade and you are not a competent reader, most kids never catch up after that," Janssen explained. "Because now you're not teaching reading, you're teaching everything else assuming you can read the assignments."

The [National Assessment of Educational Progress](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/) puts hard numbers on this: 66% of fourth graders read below proficiency level. And research consistently shows that roughly 70% of struggling readers who don't get effective intervention never catch up.

But here's what the statistics don't capture: the way reading struggles become identity struggles.

Janssen watched it happen with her daughter. "That was making her feel like she was dumb, which was not true. It made her feel like she didn't like school. She was starting to disengage with school because it was hard for her."

A kid who can't read doesn't just fall behind academically. They start to believe something is wrong with them.

## Signs Your Child May Need Help

So what should parents actually watch for? Not vague "they're struggling" - but specific, observable patterns.

**Decoding difficulties:** They struggle to break apart longer words. They don't recognize the same word when it appears again a few sentences later. They guess at word endings instead of sounding them out.

**Comprehension gaps:** They can't remember or retell what they just read, even if they technically got through all the words.

**Avoidance and resistance:** "I hate reading." Meltdowns when it's time to practice. Elaborate strategies to get out of anything involving books.

**The bright-but-struggling pattern:** This was Janssen's daughter exactly. Sharp in conversation. Quick to understand concepts when they're explained verbally. But something wasn't connecting on the page.

If you're seeing these patterns, the answer is rarely "try harder." Something else is going on - and with the right help, it can change.

## Why 60-Minute Tutoring Sessions Don't Work

When parents see their child struggling, the natural instinct is more help. More time. More practice. And often, that means traditional tutoring: hour-long sessions, once or twice a week.

Tony Mickelsen, CMO of Savvy Learning, puts it bluntly: "What child is going to have fun learning to read for 60 minutes? That's tough for me as an adult."

Most parents are putting in plenty of effort. They just need a different approach.

In 1984, educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom published research that became known as the "[Two Sigma Problem](https://opened.co/blog/einstein-had-a-tutor)." He found that students who received one-on-one tutoring performed two standard deviations better than students in conventional classrooms - meaning the average tutored student outperformed 98% of classroom-taught students.

We've known for 40 years that personalized instruction dramatically outperforms the standard model. Yet we've built most of our educational infrastructure around approaches that work for maybe half of kids.

There's another factor Janssen discovered firsthand: the parent problem.

Her daughter would resist and fight when mom or dad tried to practice reading with her. The emotional stakes were too high. She didn't want to disappoint them. She felt the pressure differently.

But when a college intern - not a parent, not a teacher with a classroom full of other kids - started working with her one-on-one at school, something shifted. Within weeks, Janssen was seeing major progress.

Then COVID hit and everything shut down.

## What 25-Minute Sessions Can Do

The school's reading tutor - actually just a college student doing an internship - reached out to Janssen. She wanted to finish her hours. Would Janssen's daughter be willing to continue working together online?

What happened next surprised Janssen.

"This was like a white screen with black words on it," she said. "'Let's just practice words.' That's it."

Nothing fancy. No gamification. No elaborate curriculum. Just consistent, focused, one-on-one practice.

And her daughter would get out of the pool - without complaint - to get on that Zoom call.

"I remember that summer we went down to visit my parents and she was swimming and I said, 'Come on in, it's time for you to do this.' And she just got out of the pool and got on with her and she just put up no resistance."

What made it work? A few things came together:

**Frequency over duration.** Short sessions - 20 to 25 minutes - multiple times per week. Think of it like exercise: four 30-minute gym sessions beat one two-hour marathon. Kids stay engaged instead of burning out. Progress compounds instead of resetting.

**Consistency builds momentum.** Harvard economist Roland Fryer's research on high-dosage tutoring found that it's not about total hours - it's about frequency and engagement. 130+ hours delivered in small, consistent doses outperforms sporadic longer sessions.

**The not-parent factor.** Someone outside the family dynamic. Lower emotional stakes. A relationship built purely around this one thing.

**Structured literacy approach.** Systematic, explicit phonics instruction - often called Orton-Gillingham based methods - that builds skills sequentially rather than expecting kids to just "pick it up."

Tony Mickelsen describes what happens at the end of a well-designed 25-minute session: "The kids are hyped. They want to come back."

That experience - Janssen watching her daughter transform through consistent, personalized, short-burst instruction - eventually became [Savvy Learning](https://savvylearning.com/), the company she co-founded with her husband and another couple. They launched in fall 2020, hoping for 10 sign-ups. They got over 100.

## From Barely at Grade Level to 11th Grade Reading

So what happened to Janssen's daughter?

She went from barely at grade level in first grade - drifting lower with each assessment - to testing at an 11th-grade reading level by fifth grade.

Years later, someone asked Janssen if her daughter was embarrassed that she talks publicly about those early struggles.

So Janssen asked her directly. Her daughter was eight or nine at the time.

"Why would I be embarrassed that something was hard for me?" she said. "And then I worked really hard and now I'm awesome at it."

Janssen's reflection: "It's one thing for your parent or your teacher to be like, 'You're smart, you can do hard things.' It is another thing for a child to know: this was really hard for me and I fully conquered it."

The struggle wasn't a setback. It became proof.

One more thing helped during those difficult years: audiobooks. Janssen's daughter still loved stories - she just couldn't decode them herself yet. Audiobooks kept her engaged with books, kept her vocabulary growing, kept her comprehension developing even while they worked on the mechanics.

"When she did start getting the reading help she needed, she could put those parts together pretty quickly," Janssen said. "Because she understood the fundamentals of how stories and words and vocabulary all work."

Don't underestimate the value of keeping a struggling reader connected to the joy of stories, even through a different medium.

## How to Help a Struggling Reader

If you're seeing the signs - the resistance, the frustration, the bright kid who just isn't clicking with reading - here's where to start:

**Get a baseline.** Know where your child actually stands. [Savvy Learning](https://savvylearning.com/) offers a free 15-minute reading assessment that shows exactly where kids are and what they need. It's a starting point, not a sales pitch - you'll get actionable information either way.

**Think frequency over duration.** If you're considering tutoring, look for programs that meet three to four times per week in focused, shorter sessions. The research is clear: this outperforms occasional longer sessions.

**Give yourself permission to get outside help.** Sometimes the best thing a parent can do is not be the teacher for this particular skill. That's not failure. That's strategy. Janssen had 5,000 books and a background as a school librarian - and her daughter still needed someone else.
