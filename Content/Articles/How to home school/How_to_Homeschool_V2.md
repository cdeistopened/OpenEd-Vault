# How to Homeschool: Prepping and Starting Homeschooling Your Children

You're more qualified than you think. That's the message Isaac Morehouse, CEO of OpenEd, wants every parent to hear. Whether you're already homeschooling, considering it, or just exploring open education, your kids will be okay. Relax.

Your role isn't to be a subject expert, but an architect. Curate experiences and foster an environment where learning flourishes. Trust your child's innate curiosity; countless resources exist to support their journey. Your job is to find the right ones and remove roadblocks.

## Is Homeschooling Right for You?

There are two ways to approach homeschooling. The homeschool CEO tries to manage every variable, optimize every moment, and control every outcome. The gardener does something different. They know you can't force a seed to grow. You cultivate the right conditions and trust the process. Fire the CEO. Become the gardener.

The foundation of a great education isn't a perfect schedule. It's a loving, engaged environment. Everything else is fine-tuning. Don't compare yourself to some other family you see on Instagram. Your garden will look different from everyone else's, and that's not a bug in the system—it's the entire point.

This principle matters most when starting with older children. As Janae Daniels, host of the School to Homeschool podcast, explains: "We cannot parent children whose heart we do not have. If you're starting to homeschool your teenagers, the very first thing that you have to focus on is the relationship. That has to come before everything else." The relationship is your soil. Without healthy soil, nothing else can take root.

Consider homeschooling if school is causing anxiety, bullying, or breaking your child. Seventy percent of teens at North Star, a learning center for homeschoolers, came directly from school—leaving because of anxiety, bullying, neurodiversity needs, or straight-A culture that was breaking them. The only barometer that matters is your child's health and curiosity.

You can trust what you see working with your actual child more than what any system says *should* work. Your child struggling with reading using one method? That's not failure of commitment. It's information. Add what works while keeping everything else you love. The goal was never ideological purity. The goal is raising humans who love learning, think clearly, and can build meaningful lives.

## What to Consider When Starting Homeschooling

Your child spends roughly 1,260 hours per year in school. That's 35% of their potential learning time. The other 2,390 hours—65%—happens under your supervision, whether you planned for it or not. Yet we act like that 35% defines everything. We agonize over which institution to choose, which box to check, as if that one decision determines the entire shape of their intellectual and emotional development.

What if instead of asking "Which institution should I choose?" you asked "What does my child need right now, and where can I find it?"

For 200 years, education was a binary choice: traditional school or homeschool. Public or private. All in or all out. But something shifted. Just as Netflix unbundled cable and let you choose what to watch when you wanted, and Spotify unbundled albums and let you create your own playlists, families are now unbundling education and rebuilding it around their children. This isn't about rejecting any approach; it's about permission to take what works. A student takes advanced math at the public school (excellent teacher, free access), learns Latin through an online academy, does science experiments at a maker space, plays volleyball on the school team, and studies literature at home. Is this public school? Homeschool? Classical education? Online learning? The answer: it's all of them. You are no longer a passive consumer forced to use the pre-installed software. You become the architect of your child's learning journey.

So what does an architect need to know when starting?

Structure should adapt to your child's age and needs. Think of structure like a trellis—it's there to support growth, not confine it. In the early years (0-10), you only need minimal structure, leaning into unschooling and play. In the middle years (10-14), add more parent-led structure to guide them through the pre-teen funk. Children change more between 10 to 14 than any other time in their lives except zero to three. In the teen years (14+), they build their own structure, driven by jobs, sports, or projects.

Of course, even this framework isn't rigid. Janae notes that her 9-year-old daughter with a sensory processing disorder thrives with more structure, while her other kids benefit from ample unstructured time to get bored. (As Janae discovered, "Boredom leads to brilliance. We've overbooked our kids so much that we've robbed them of the gift of boredom, because that's where genius happens.") Different plants need different amounts of support, and the same is true for kids.

Once you have a sense of structure, you need to know what your child actually wants to climb toward. Matt Bowman, founder of OpenEd, shared a simple tool: The Sticky Note Method. For one week, have your kids jot down answers to a few questions: What do you think about in your free time? What are you good at? What do you want to get better at? What do you dislike? This makes their inner world visible. Then, the magic happens when you connect their interest to a real-world need. A kid who loves baking can start a cookie business for neighbors. A kid fascinated by video games can learn coding to build a website for a local charity.

Your expertise isn't in Latin, calculus, and chemistry. Your expertise is in your child. You know what lights them up and what shuts them down. You see when they're thriving and when they're just going through the motions. You don't have to be a math expert, choose one curriculum forever, or re-learn calculus. You have to be an architect. Your job is to find resources that teach effectively. If even triplets—sharing identical genetics and environment—require different math approaches, what does that say about a standardized system? You can switch mid-year. Math is unusually modular. The curriculum is a tool. If your hammer doesn't work, you get a new hammer. You don't sit there hitting your thumb over and over thinking, "I must be bad at hammering." Video lessons exist. Answer keys exist. Phone support exists. AI tutors exist. When Laura Feller, an OpenEd mom in Utah, realized her son might reach calculus—a course she'd never taken—she found Math-U-See, a curriculum with video lessons and phone support. "My youngest son may get to calculus," she said, "and this curriculum will help him do that because I certainly won't be able to." Her son isn't limited by her math education. That's the power of being an architect instead of trying to be an expert in everything.

## Homeschooling Costs and Reimbursements

Homeschooling doesn't need to be expensive. Traditional private schools cost $12,000-30,000 per year. Customized learning can easily be achieved at home for $500-2,500 per year. Meanwhile, homeschooled students score 15-30 percentile points higher on standardized tests than their traditionally schooled peers. Better results. Lower costs. More flexibility.

With today's tools like Khan Academy, Zearn, CK-12 Foundation, Math is Fun, and countless YouTube channels, personalized education isn't more affordable—it's more effective. Free often means you do more curation work, but not worse—a different architectural challenge. Many families use Khan Academy plus Singapore workbooks, or Zearn plus supplemental problem-solving from other sources. Why do we think that learning must happen in expensive buildings, or that personalization is a luxury?

Brian Ray from the Homeschool Legal Defense Fund argues that to count as "homeschooling," education must be 1) parent-controlled, 2) home-based, and 3) privately funded. We take a more expansive view. Let parents decide what they call themselves—and give all parents as much control as they want over their child's education. What about 'roadschoolers' who learn from an RV? Or families who share studio space and employ a certified teacher two days a week? Or households using ESA dollars to cover a part-time microschool? The definition is expanding because the infrastructure is expanding.

Almost half of all U.S. states now offer funding for homeschool expenses. Twenty-five states have funding programs with average annual funding ranging from $2,000 to $9,000 per student. Funding covers 100% of educational expenses in most programs. There are three main types:

**Education Savings Accounts (ESAs)** provide funds families can use for curriculum, technology, tutoring, and educational materials. Some are universal programs available to all students. Others are needs-based for students with IEPs or income-qualified families.

**Independent Study Charter Schools** create public school partnerships that provide funding for educational materials, curriculum, and technology. In California, examples include iLEAD Exploration, Sky Mountain, and Visions In Education, with funding of $2,200-4,300 per year.

**OpenEd Programs** operate in 9 states with 100% reimbursement for curriculum, classes, tutors, materials, and programs. Customization used to feel expensive. This is why educational freedom has traditionally been a privilege of the wealthy. OpenEd provides funding for curriculum, classes, tutors, materials, and programs—making educational freedom accessible to families regardless of income.

State requirements vary significantly. Some states require notification or filing. Some require testing. Some require portfolios. Parents can issue diplomas in most states—there's no such thing as a "state-issued homeschool diploma" in most states. Instead, parents are empowered to issue diplomas. Keep records and transcripts. Even if your teen isn't going for a diploma now, these might come in handy later.

James Isabele Jr. worked in manufacturing for 15 years with certifications in everything required for a new job—until they asked for his "state-issued homeschool diploma." His mom had kept records and documented his entire high school program. After the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) sent a letter explaining that parents issue diplomas, he got the job. HSLDA provides legal support and state-specific information for homeschoolers nationwide.

## Homeschooling FAQs

**Do I need a teaching degree?** No. Your job isn't to be an expert in every subject. It's to curate experiences and create an environment where learning can flourish. You don't have to be a math expert, choose one curriculum forever, or re-learn calculus. You have to be an architect—someone who finds resources that teach effectively.

**Can homeschoolers go to college?** Absolutely. Pretty much every college has a homeschool pathway for applications. Colleges value self-directed learners over applicants who wait to be told what to do. A 2015 article in Business Insider calls homeschooling the "New Path to Harvard." Isaac Morehouse doesn't have a high school diploma, never took the ACT or SAT, yet has an associate's, bachelor's, and master's degree. He started at a community college in high school (they didn't care about diplomas) and transferred those credits to a four-year college.

**What about socialization?** An actual homeschooler shared the real gaps they experienced before attending an Ivy League school: collaboration skills on group projects, sitting through repetitive content, listening to presentations and giving feedback, meeting deadlines over pursuing perfection, and separating school from the rest of life to avoid burnout. Ask yourself: Are these the skills that make you a thriving, curious human being? Or are they the skills that make you good at filling out forms and sitting quietly through PowerPoint presentations? One gap you can fix in an afternoon at the DMV. The other kind is more stubborn. The skills that matter in an AI world are Curation, Curiosity, and Connectivity. Most schools teach what AI does best—standardized knowledge, recall, following instructions. These three skills, on the other hand, can't be standardized.

**How do I create a transcript?** Think like a translator, not a transcriber. Nature journaling + science reading + field studies becomes "Biology with Lab." Classic literature + writing + mythology studies becomes "English 10." Civil War reenactments + primary source reading becomes "U.S. History." For credit hours, look up Audible duration of assigned books, add up total hours, and include discussion and writing time. A transcript is a communication device—like a resume, it highlights real achievements in a standardized format that others can understand. Save the creative course names for your family records. Use conventional subject titles on official documents.

**Do homeschoolers get diplomas?** There's no such thing as a "state-issued homeschool diploma" in most states. Parents are empowered to issue diplomas. Keep records and transcripts. You can create DIY diplomas using Canva or Google Docs templates, or use professional services like HomeschoolDiploma.com. Most California homeschoolers use a Private School Affidavit (PSA)—you're legally a private school and can issue diplomas.

**What if I'm not good at a subject?** You don't need to be an expert. You need to be an architect. Video lessons exist. Answer keys exist. Phone support exists. AI tutors exist. Your job is to keep them moving and find resources when stuck. The curriculum is a tool. If your hammer doesn't work, you get a new hammer.

**How much does homeschooling cost?** Customized learning at home costs $500-2,500 per year, compared to $12,000-30,000 for private school. Free resources like Khan Academy, Zearn, CK-12, and YouTube channels make quality education accessible. Many states offer funding through ESAs or charter schools. OpenEd provides 100% reimbursement in partner states.

**Can I mix different educational approaches?** Yes. You have permission to take what works from anywhere. You have permission to change your approach when circumstances change. You have permission to combine the seemingly incompatible—enroll in the public school for band and athletics while homeschooling academics, or love Classical education while using adaptive math software. The goal was never ideological purity. The goal is raising humans who love learning, think clearly, and can build meaningful lives.

**Can I switch back to school?** Yes. Flexibility works both ways. Isaac's son needed near-complete freedom when young, more structure in middle school, and eventually chose public school at 14. It's about him. It's about each kid at each stage.
