# How to Homeschool: Prepping and Starting Homeschooling Your Children

You're more qualified than you think.

That's the message Isaac Morehouse, CEO of OpenEd, wants every parent to hear. "Your kids are going to be okay. You can relax a little bit."

Your job isn't to be an expert in every subject. It's to curate experiences and create an environment where learning can flourish. Humans are naturally curious. Your child doesn't need you to impart everything from your brain to theirs. They're learning because that's what humans do.

Resources are nearly endless—from online platforms to books to community-based learning. Your job is twofold: find the right resources for your child, and remove the roadblocks to their natural curiosity.

Relax, and trust in your child's innate desire to learn.

## Is Homeschooling Right for You?

Here's what matters: the foundation of a great education isn't a perfect schedule. It's a loving, engaged environment. Everything else is fine-tuning.

Don't compare yourself to some other family you see on Instagram. Your garden will look different from everyone else's. That's not a bug in the system—it's the entire point.

### The CEO vs. Gardener Mindset

There are two ways to approach homeschooling. The homeschool CEO tries to manage every variable. They optimize, dictate, and control. The gardener does something different. They know you can't force a seed to grow. You cultivate the right conditions and trust the process.

Fire the CEO. Become the gardener.

This principle matters most when starting with older children. As Janae Daniels, host of the School to Homeschool podcast, explains: "We cannot parent children whose heart we do not have. If you're starting to homeschool your teenagers, the very first thing that you have to focus on is the relationship. That has to come before everything else."

The relationship is your soil. Without healthy soil, nothing else can take root.

### When Homeschooling Makes Sense

Consider homeschooling if school is causing anxiety, bullying, or breaking your child. Seventy percent of teens at North Star, a learning center for homeschoolers, came directly from school—leaving because of anxiety, bullying, neurodiversity needs, or straight-A culture that was breaking them.

The only barometer that matters is your child's health and curiosity.

You can trust what you see working with your actual child more than what any system says *should* work. Your child struggling with reading using one method? That's not failure of commitment. It's information. Add what works while keeping everything else you love.

The goal was never ideological purity. The goal is raising humans who love learning, think clearly, and can build meaningful lives.

## What to Consider When Starting Homeschooling

Here's the math everyone ignores: Your child spends roughly 1,260 hours per year in school. That's 35% of their potential learning time.

The other 2,390 hours—65%—happens under your supervision, whether you planned for it or not.

Yet we act like that 35% defines everything. We agonize over which institution to choose, which box to check, as if that one decision determines the entire shape of their intellectual and emotional development.

But what if the question changed? What if instead of asking "Which institution should I choose?" you asked "What does my child need right now, and where can I find it?"

### The Un-Scheduling Arc

Structure should adapt to your child's age and needs. Think of structure like a trellis—it's there to support growth, not confine it. Different plants need different amounts of support, and the same is true for kids.

Isaac Morehouse laid out a simple roadmap based on his own experience:

**Early Years (0-10):** Minimal structure, leaning into unschooling and play.

**Middle Years (10-14):** A bit more parent-led structure to guide them through the pre-teen funk. Children change more between 10 to 14 than any other time in their lives except zero to three.

**Teen Years (14+):** They build their own structure, driven by jobs, sports, or projects.

Of course, even this framework isn't rigid. Janae notes that her 9-year-old daughter with a sensory processing disorder thrives with more structure, while her other kids benefit from ample unstructured time to get bored.

Even the appropriate level of structure resists one-size-fits-all structure.

### Start with Observation: The Sticky Note Method

Once the trellis is in place, you need to know what the kid actually wants to climb toward. Matt Bowman, founder of OpenEd, shared a simple tool: **The Sticky Note Method**.

For one week, have your kids jot down answers to a few questions:
- What do you think about in your free time?
- What are you good at?
- What do you want to get better at?
- What do you dislike?

This makes their inner world visible. Then, the magic happens when you connect their interest to a real-world need. For example, a kid who loves baking can start a cookie business for neighbors.

### You're an Architect, Not an Expert

You're no longer the overwhelmed teacher trying to master every subject. You're the architect of your child's learning.

Your expertise isn't in Latin, calculus, and chemistry. Your expertise is in your child.

You know what lights them up and what shuts them down. You see when they're thriving and when they're just going through the motions.

You don't have to be a math expert, choose one curriculum forever, or re-learn calculus. You have to be an architect. Your job is to find resources that teach effectively. Video lessons exist. Answer keys exist. Phone support exists. AI tutors exist.

If even triplets—sharing identical genetics and environment—require different math approaches, what does that say about a standardized system?

You can switch mid-year. Math is unusually modular. The curriculum is a tool. If your hammer doesn't work, you get a new hammer. You don't sit there hitting your thumb over and over thinking, "I must be bad at hammering."

## The Great Unbundling: A Better Operating System

For 200 years, education was a binary choice: traditional school or homeschool. Public or private. All in or all out.

But something shifted. Just as Netflix unbundled cable and let you choose what to watch when you wanted, and Spotify unbundled albums and let you create your own playlists, families are now unbundling education and rebuilding it around their children.

The question changed from "Which institution should I choose?" to "What does my child need right now, and where can I find it?"

This isn't about rejecting any approach. It's about permission to take what works.

A student takes advanced math at the public school (excellent teacher, free access), learns Latin through an online academy, does science experiments at a maker space, plays volleyball on the school team, and studies literature at home.

Is this public school? Homeschool? Classical education? Online learning?

The answer: it's all of them.

You are no longer a passive consumer forced to use the pre-installed software. You become the architect of your child's learning journey.

## Homeschooling Costs and Reimbursements

Homeschooling doesn't need to be expensive.

Here's the cost comparison: Traditional private schools cost $12,000-30,000 per year. Customized learning at home costs $500-2,500 per year.

Meanwhile, homeschooled students score 15-30 percentile points higher on standardized tests than their traditionally schooled peers. Better results. Lower costs. More flexibility.

### Free Resources Abound

With today's tools like Khan Academy, Zearn, CK-12 Foundation, Math is Fun, and countless YouTube channels, personalized education isn't more affordable—it's more effective.

Free often means you do more curation work. Not worse—different architectural challenge. Many families use Khan Academy plus Singapore workbooks, or Zearn plus supplemental problem-solving from other sources.

Why do we think that learning must happen in expensive buildings, or that personalization is a luxury?

### The Expanded Definition of Homeschooling

Researcher Brian Ray argues that to count as "homeschooling," education must be 1) parent-controlled, 2) home-based, and 3) privately funded.

We take a more expansive view. Let parents decide what they call themselves—and give all parents as much control as they want over their child's education.

What about 'roadschoolers' who learn from an RV? Or families who share studio space and employ a certified teacher two days a week? Or households using ESA dollars to cover a part-time microschool?

The definition is expanding because the infrastructure is expanding.

### State Funding Programs

Almost half of all U.S. states now offer funding for homeschool expenses. Twenty-five states have funding programs. Average annual funding ranges from $2,000 to $9,000 per student. Funding covers 100% of educational expenses in most programs.

There are three main types of funding:

**1. Education Savings Accounts (ESAs)** - Universal or needs-based programs that provide funds families can use for curriculum, technology, tutoring, and educational materials.

**2. Independent Study Charter Schools** - Public school partnerships that provide funding for educational materials, curriculum, and technology. In California, examples include iLEAD Exploration, Sky Mountain, and Visions In Education, with funding of $2,200-4,300 per year.

**3. OpenEd Programs** - Available in 9 states with 100% reimbursement for curriculum, technology, tutoring, and educational materials.

Customization used to feel expensive. This is why educational freedom has traditionally been a privilege of the wealthy. OpenEd provides funding for curriculum, classes, tutors, materials, and programs. This isn't a luxury service for the wealthy. We make educational freedom accessible to families regardless of income.

## How to Homeschool in Your State

State requirements vary significantly. Some states require notification or filing. Some require testing. Some require portfolios. Parents can issue diplomas in most states—there's no such thing as a "state-issued homeschool diploma" in most states. Instead, parents are empowered to issue diplomas.

Keep records and transcripts. Even if your teen isn't going for a diploma now, these might come in handy later. James Isabele Jr. worked in manufacturing for 15 years with certifications in everything required for a new job—until they asked for his "state-issued homeschool diploma." His mom had kept records and documented his entire high school program. After HSLDA sent a letter explaining that parents issue diplomas, he got the job.

The Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) provides legal support and state-specific information for homeschoolers.

If you're in one of OpenEd's partner states, we can help you navigate state requirements and provide funding for your educational choices.

## How to Homeschool FAQs

### Do I need a teaching degree?

No. Your job isn't to be an expert in every subject. It's to curate experiences and create an environment where learning can flourish. You're more qualified than you think.

You don't have to be a math expert, choose one curriculum forever, or re-learn calculus. You have to be an architect. Your job is to find resources that teach effectively.

### Can homeschoolers go to college?

Absolutely. Will they be limited in their future? Not at all.

Pretty much every college has a homeschool pathway for applications. Colleges value self-directed learners over applicants who wait to be told what to do. A 2015 article in Business Insider calls homeschooling the "New Path to Harvard."

Isaac Morehouse doesn't have a high school diploma. He never took the ACT or SAT. Yet he has an associate's, bachelor's, and master's degree. He started at a community college in high school (they didn't care about diplomas) and transferred those credits to a four-year college.

### What about socialization?

An actual homeschooler shared the real gaps they experienced before going on to attend an Ivy League school:

1. Collaboration skills and taking input from others on group projects
2. Sitting through repetitive content when you've already mastered the material
3. Listening to others' presentations and giving constructive feedback
4. Meeting deadlines over pursuing perfection
5. Separating school from the rest of life to avoid burnout

Ask yourself: Are these the skills that make you a thriving, curious human being? Or are they the skills that make you good at filling out forms and sitting quietly through PowerPoint presentations?

One gap you can fix in an afternoon at the DMV. The other kind is more stubborn.

The skills that matter in an AI world are Curation, Curiosity, and Connectivity. Most schools teach what AI does best—standardized knowledge, recall, following instructions. The 3 C's, on the other hand, can't be standardized.

### What about learning gaps?

See above. The gaps homeschoolers experience may not be the ones you fear. Traditional schools create gaps too—gaps in creativity, independent thinking, and real-world problem-solving.

### How do I create a transcript?

Think like a translator, not a transcriber.

Translation Method examples:
- Nature journaling + science reading + field studies → "Biology with Lab"
- Classic literature + writing + mythology studies → "English 10"
- Civil War reenactments + primary source reading → "U.S. History"

For credit hours: Look up Audible duration of assigned books, add up total hours, include discussion and writing time.

A transcript is a communication device. Like a resume, it's meant to highlight real achievements in a standardized format that others can understand. Save the creative course names for your family records. Use conventional subject titles on official documents.

### Do homeschoolers get diplomas?

There's no such thing as a "state-issued homeschool diploma" in most states. Instead, parents are empowered to issue diplomas.

Keep records and transcripts. You can create DIY diplomas (Canva, Google Docs templates) or use professional services (HomeschoolDiploma.com starts at $34.99).

Most California homeschoolers use a Private School Affidavit (PSA)—you're legally a private school and can issue diplomas.

### What if I'm not good at [subject]?

You don't need to be an expert. You need to be an architect.

Video lessons exist. Answer keys exist. Phone support exists. AI tutors exist. Your job: keep them moving, and find resources when stuck.

The curriculum is a tool. If your hammer doesn't work, you get a new hammer.

### How much does homeschooling cost?

Customized learning at home costs $500-2,500 per year, compared to $12,000-30,000 for private school.

Free resources are available: Khan Academy, Zearn, CK-12, YouTube channels. Many states offer funding through ESAs or charter schools. OpenEd provides 100% reimbursement in partner states.

### Can I mix different educational approaches?

Yes. You have permission to take what works from anywhere.

You have permission to change your approach when circumstances change. You have permission to combine the seemingly incompatible. You have permission to enroll in the public school for band and athletics while homeschooling academics. You have permission to love Classical education while using adaptive math software.

The goal was never ideological purity. The goal is raising humans who love learning, think clearly, and can build meaningful lives.

### Can I switch back to school?

Yes. Flexibility works both ways.

Isaac's son needed near-complete freedom when young, more structure in middle school, and eventually chose public school at 14. It's about him. It's about each kid at each stage.
