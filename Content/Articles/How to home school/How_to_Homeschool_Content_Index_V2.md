## Required Sections & Source Material

### 1. Is Homeschooling Right for You?

**Source Material:**

**From "Yes, you are qualified to teach your child":**
- "Your job isn't to be an expert in every subject. It's to curate experiences and create an environment where learning can flourish."
- "Humans are naturally curious. Your child doesn't need you to impart everything from your brain to theirs."
- "Resources are nearly endless – from online platforms to books to community-based learning."
- "Relax, and trust in your child's innate desire to learn."

**From "CEO vs. Gardener" & "What kind of homeschool parent are you":**
- "Your kids are going to be okay. You can relax a little bit." - Isaac Morehouse
- "The foundation of a great education isn't a perfect schedule; it's a loving, engaged environment."
- "Don't compare yourself to some other family you see on Instagram."
- "We cannot parent children whose heart we do not have. If you're starting to homeschool your teenagers, the very first thing that you have to focus on is the relationship. That has to come before everything else." - Janae Daniels
- "I learned that boredom leads to brilliance... We've overbooked our kids so much that we've robbed them of the gift of boredom, because that's where genius happens." - Janae Daniels
- The CEO vs. Gardener mindset: "The homeschool CEO tries to manage every variable. They optimize, dictate, and control. The gardener does something different. They know you can't force a seed to grow. You just cultivate the right conditions and trust the process."

**From "Have you considered not going to school":**
- "The only barometer that matters is your child's health and curiosity." - Ken Danford
- "70% of North Star's teens came directly from school—leaving because of anxiety, bullying, neurodiversity needs, or straight-A culture that was breaking them."

**From "The End of All or Nothing":**
- "You can trust what you see working with your actual child more than what any system says *should* work."
- "The goal was never ideological purity. The goal is raising humans who love learning, think clearly, and can build meaningful lives."
- "Your child struggling with reading using one method? That's not failure of commitment. It's information. Add what works while keeping everything else you love."

**Key Points to Include:**
- You don't need to be an expert in every subject - you're a curator/architect
- Focus on relationship first (especially with teens)
- Trust the process and your child's natural curiosity
- The foundation is a loving, engaged environment, not a perfect schedule
- Consider homeschooling if school is causing anxiety, bullying, or breaking your child
- "The only barometer that matters is your child's health and curiosity"
- Don't compare yourself to others - your garden will look different
- You can trust what you see working with your actual child

### 2. What to Consider When Starting Homeschooling

**Source Material:**

**From "CEO vs. Gardener - The Un-Scheduling Arc":**
- **Early Years (0-10):** Minimal structure, leaning into unschooling and play
- **Middle Years (10-14):** A bit more parent-led structure to guide them through the pre-teen funk
- **Teen Years (14+):** They build their own structure, driven by jobs, sports, or projects
- "Think of structure like a trellis – it's there to support growth, not confine it. Different plants need different amounts of support, and the same is true for kids."
- "Children change more between 10 to 14 than any other time in their lives except zero to three." - Matt Bowman

**From "The Sticky Note Method":**
- For one week, have your kids jot down answers to:
  - What do you think about in your free time?
  - What are you good at?
  - What do you want to get better at?
  - What do you dislike?
- "This makes their inner world visible. Then, the magic happens when you connect their interest to a real-world need."

**From "Best Homeschool Math Curriculum" (condensed):**
- "You don't have to be a math expert, choose one curriculum forever, or re-learn calculus. You just have to be an architect."
- "If even triplets—sharing identical genetics and environment—require different math approaches, what does that say about a standardized system?"
- "You can switch mid-year. Math is unusually modular."
- Key principle: You're an architect, not an expert. Your job is to find resources that teach effectively.

**From "The End of All or Nothing":**
- "You're no longer the overwhelmed teacher trying to master every subject. You're the architect of your child's learning."
- "Your expertise isn't in Latin, calculus, and chemistry. Your expertise is in your child."
- "You know what lights them up and what shuts them down. You see when they're thriving and when they're just going through the motions."
- The three barriers: Knowledge, Resources, Community

**From "What is Open Education":**
- The concept of being an "educational architect" rather than choosing a single institution
- "The question changed from 'Which institution should I choose?' to 'What does my child need right now, and where can I find it?'"
- "You are no longer a passive consumer forced to use the pre-installed software. You become the architect of your child's learning journey."

**Key Points to Include:**
- Structure should adapt to your child's age and needs (Un-Scheduling Arc)
- Start with observation (Sticky Note Method) to understand your child
- You don't need to be an expert - be an architect/curator
- Different kids need different approaches (even in the same family)
- Freedom to change curriculum is a superpower
- Your expertise is in your child, not in every subject
- Consider what your child needs right now, not a rigid long-term plan
- The question: "What does my child need right now, and where can I find it?"

**Note:** Make sure this section focuses on practical considerations and doesn't repeat Section 1's "is it right for you" content.

### 3. Homeschooling Costs and Reimbursements

**Source Material:**

**From "Create Before You Consume":**
- Brian Ray's definition: "To count as 'homeschooling,' education must be 1) parent-controlled, 2) home-based, and 3) privately funded."
- **BUT:** "We say: let parents decide what they call themselves—and give *all* parents as much control as they want over their child's education."
- Discussion of expanding definition to include public funding

**From "The ROI of Personalized Education":**
- **Cost Comparison:**
  - Traditional private schools: $12,000-30,000/year

- Homeschooled students score 15-30 percentile points higher on standardized tests
- "With today's tools like Khan Academy, Outschool, and Time4Learning (to name just a few), personalized education isn't just more affordable – it's more effective."
- "Why do we think that learning must happen in expensive buildings, or that personalization is a luxury?"

**From "Best Homeschool Math Curriculum":**
- Free resources: Khan Academy, Zearn, CK-12 Foundation, Math is Fun, YouTube channels
- "Free often means you do more curation work. Not worse—just different architectural challenge."

**From "The End of All or Nothing":**
- "Customization can feel expensive. This is precisely why educational freedom has traditionally been a privilege of the wealthy."
- "OpenEd provides funding for curriculum, classes, tutors, materials, and programs... This isn't a luxury service for the wealthy. We make educational freedom accessible to families regardless of income."

    3. Listening to others' presentations and giving constructive feedback
    4. Meeting deadlines over pursuing perfection
