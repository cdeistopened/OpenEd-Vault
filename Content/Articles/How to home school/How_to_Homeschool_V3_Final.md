# How to Homeschool: Prepping and Starting Homeschooling Your Children

There’s a reason homeschooling doubled in the last five years, and it’s not what most people think. In fact, when The New York Times recently published a piece on the "home-school" movement, it framed it as a "fracturing of American values," even sparking a "Great Hyphenation Debate" (who puts a hyphen in homeschool?!). But the truth is simpler and more powerful: learning doesn’t require a classroom, education doesn’t require a system, and you’re already more qualified than you realize.

Some estimates put the number of homeschool students in America at over 5 million. Newsweek reports this "Great Education Exodus" is driven by parents seeking safer environments, better educational experiences, and learning tailored to their child's needs. These families have discovered that education can adapt to children rather than forcing children to adapt to education. Your role as a parent isn’t to become a subject expert in every field—it’s to become an architect, designing learning around your actual child. You curate experiences, find resources, and create an environment where natural curiosity drives real learning.

## Is Homeschooling Right for Your Family?

The decision to homeschool often comes from recognizing that traditional school isn’t working for your specific child. Maybe they’re anxious or bullied. Maybe they’re gifted and bored, or labeled “behind” when they simply learn differently. Perhaps you’ve watched their natural love of learning slowly extinguished by worksheets and standardized tests.

Regardless of your motivations, let’s address the elephant in the room: you're probably terrified you'll mess this up.

Good news: It's nearly impossible to do worse than what's already happening. The national average for actual instruction time in public schools is 2.5 hours per day. The rest? Transitions, discipline, announcements, standardized test prep. Your child is spending 6-7 hours to get 2.5 hours of learning.

But homeschooling isn't about recreating school at your kitchen table. It's about designing education around your actual child, not some statistical average.

Consider homeschooling if:

*   Your child is anxious, bullied, or struggling in traditional school
*   They're gifted and bored (or labeled "behind" when they just learn differently)
*   You want education that adapts to your child, not the other way around
*   Your family values time together more than institutional schedules
*   You believe learning happens everywhere, not just in classrooms

70% of families who leave traditional school cite anxiety, bullying, or "poor fit" as primary reasons. The system isn't broken—it's working exactly as designed. It's just designed for efficiency, not for your specific child.

You know your child better than any institution ever could. You see when they're thriving and when they're drowning. That knowledge is your primary qualification.

Homeschooling today means you don't have to choose just one approach. Your third-grader might use Montessori math manipulatives in the morning, then explore nature in the afternoon, while your teenager needs online AP classes and classical literature discussions. Most families blend what works from various educational philosophies—taking the best of Charlotte Mason, classical education, Montessori, and unschooling to create something unique for their children.

The foundation of great education isn't a perfect curriculum or schedule—it's a loving, engaged environment where children feel safe to explore, question, and sometimes fail. If you can provide that, you're already more qualified than you think.

## What to Consider When Starting Homeschooling

Before you begin, it’s important to understand that homeschooling doesn’t mean replicating a seven-hour school day at home.

Elementary students typically need just 1-3 hours of focused academic work daily. Middle schoolers require 2-4 hours, and high schoolers might spend up to 5 hours a day studying if they are preparing for college or AP exams. The efficiency comes from eliminating time wasted on classroom management, transitions, and teaching to the middle while your child either waits or struggles to keep up.

Think about it like this: Your child currently spends approximately 1,260 hours annually in school, which accounts for about 35% of their potential learning time. The remaining 65% happens under your supervision anyway, whether or not you’re formally homeschooling. When you homeschool, you’re simply being more intentional about all of that time, not just the “school” hours.

The shift from institutional education to homeschooling requires rethinking your role entirely. Instead of asking “Which school should I choose?” you’ll ask “What combination of resources will best serve my child right now?” This might mean online math classes, literature-based history, hands-on science experiments, and afternoon apprenticeships. You become the architect of a customized education rather than a consumer of a pre-packaged one.

The appropriate level of structure will vary over time. Early years (from birth to age ten) often thrive with minimal formal structure, emphasizing play, exploration, and following natural interests.

The middle years from ten to fourteen often benefit from more parent-led guidance as children navigate pre-teen changes and need help maintaining focus.

By the teen years, many homeschoolers become largely self-directed, pursuing jobs, sports, internships, or passion projects that drive their learning.

Remember that you don’t need to be an expert in every subject. Video lessons, online tutors, answer keys, AI assistants, and homeschool co-ops all exist to support you. Your expertise lies in knowing your child—their interests, struggles, learning style, and what makes them come alive. That knowledge is more valuable than any teaching certification.

## Homeschooling Costs and Reimbursements

While traditional private schools cost between $12,000 and $30,000 annually, most homeschool families spend between $500 and $2,500 per child per year. This includes curriculum, supplies, activities, and enrichment classes. Even more surprising is that homeschooled students consistently score 15 to 30 percentile points higher on standardized tests than their traditionally schooled peers, proving that quality education doesn’t require enormous expense.

The landscape of homeschool funding has transformed dramatically in recent years. Almost half of U.S. states now offer some form of funding for homeschool expenses.

Around twenty-five states have Education Savings Account programs or similar initiatives, providing families with between $2,000 to $9,000 annually to cover curriculum, technology, tutoring, and educational materials. Some programs are universal, available to all families regardless of income, while others are needs-based or designed for specific populations like special needs students or military families.

Beyond ESAs, several states offer homeschooling through charter school partnerships. California’s independent study charter schools, for instance, provide $2,200 to $4,300 per year for educational materials and enrichment activities. These programs typically require more oversight and reporting than independent homeschooling but offer substantial financial support in return.

OpenEd operates in nine states, providing a unique model that combines the flexibility of homeschooling with the support and resources of public education. Families in OpenEd programs receive 100% reimbursement for secular curriculum, educational technology, tutoring, and enrichment classes. The program assigns each family a certified teacher for support while maintaining minimal reporting requirements—typically just a brief weekly learning log. This approach makes personalized education accessible regardless of family income, breaking down the historical barrier where educational customization was a privilege reserved for the wealthy.

Even without state funding, homeschooling can be remarkably affordable. Free resources like Khan Academy provide complete K-12 curriculum at no cost. Library systems have expanded their educational offerings, many now employing homeschool liaisons who can guide you to resources and programs. YouTube channels like Crash Course, SciShow, and TED-Ed deliver better content than many textbooks, entirely free. The key is knowing where to look and how to curate these resources into a coherent educational experience.

### How to Homeschool in Choosing Your Approach

Modern homeschooling isn’t about picking one educational philosophy like joining a religion. It’s about taking what works from anywhere and creating something unique for your child. You might use classical literature discussions, Montessori math materials, online science classes, and unschooled afternoons for pursuing passions.

Visit the Open Education Hub to explore different approaches in depth:

*   **Classical Education:** Trivium-based learning with Great Books and Latin
*   **Montessori:** Self-directed learning with specialized materials
*   **Charlotte Mason:** Literature-rich with nature study and short lessons
*   **Unschooling:** Child-led learning through life experiences
*   **Virtual/Online:** Digital platforms and adaptive technology
*   **Microschooling:** Small learning pods of 5-15 students
*   **Waldorf:** Imagination and arts-based developmental approach

Most families blend elements from multiple approaches. Your third-grader might thrive with Montessori math manipulatives while your teenager needs the structure of online AP classes. The beauty of homeschooling is the freedom to adapt as your children grow and change.

## Homeschooling FAQs

**Do I need a teaching degree?** No teaching degree is required in any state for parents to homeschool their own children. Your qualification comes from knowing your child better than anyone else. You understand their interests, their struggles, their learning style, and what makes them engaged or frustrated. You don’t need to be an expert in every subject—you need to be an expert in finding resources that teach effectively. Video lessons, online tutors, answer keys, AI assistants, and homeschool co-ops all exist to support you in areas where you need help.

**Can homeschoolers go to college?** Homeschoolers not only go to college—they often have advantages in the admissions process. Colleges actively recruit homeschoolers because they tend to be self-directed learners who know how to manage their time and pursue interests deeply. Every college in America has established procedures for homeschool applicants. Homeschoolers typically score higher on standardized tests (SAT/ACT) and have time to develop impressive extracurriculars and real-world experience that make their applications stand out. Many homeschoolers begin taking community college classes during high school, earning college credit before they even apply to four-year universities.

**What about socialization?** The socialization question assumes that sitting in a classroom with 25 children born in the same year is the only way to develop social skills. In reality, homeschoolers often have more diverse social experiences. They interact with people of all ages through co-ops, sports teams, theater groups, volunteer work, jobs, and community activities. They learn to communicate with adults professionally and can work with younger children patiently. Most communities have numerous homeschool groups organizing park days, field trips, science fairs, and social events. The question isn’t whether homeschoolers get enough socialization—it’s whether traditional school students get enough real-world social experience.

**How do I create transcripts and issue diplomas?** Parents are legally empowered to issue their children’s diplomas in most states. Creating a transcript involves documenting your child’s high school coursework, grades, and credits in a format colleges recognize. Think of it as translating your child’s learning into academic language. That year spent reading classic literature, writing essays, and discussing themes becomes “English 10.” Building and programming robots while studying physics concepts becomes “Applied Physics with Lab.” Many online services and templates can help you create professional-looking transcripts. Keep detailed records of curriculum used, books read, projects completed, and hours spent—these become your documentation.

**What if I’m not good at certain subjects?** You don’t have to personally teach every subject. Your role is to ensure your child has access to quality instruction, whether that comes from video lessons, online classes, tutors, co-op teachers, or community college professors. When your child reaches algebra and you’ve forgotten everything past basic arithmetic, you might use Khan Academy videos, hire a math tutor once a week, or join a co-op where another parent teaches math. The curriculum is a tool—if one doesn’t work, you find another. Your job is to facilitate learning, not to be omniscient.

**What if we need to return to school?** Homeschooling isn’t a permanent commitment. Families move fluidly between homeschooling and traditional schooling based on their children’s changing needs. Public schools are legally required to accept returning students from their attendance zones. Some families homeschool for just a year or two during a difficult period. Others homeschool through elementary school then transition to traditional middle school. Some do the opposite, pulling children out for middle school’s challenging years. The flexibility to respond to your child’s needs is one of homeschooling’s greatest advantages.

## Take the First Step (It’s Smaller Than You Think)

You don’t need to have everything figured out. You don’t need the perfect curriculum or schedule. You just need to start.

Here’s your homework (ironic, we know):

*   **Tonight:** Join your state’s homeschool Facebook group. Read for 30 minutes.
*   **This Week:** Have an honest conversation with your kids about school. Listen more than you talk.
*   **This Weekend:** Try one educational activity that’s NOT school—cook together, nature walk, museum visit, build something. Notice how much learning happens naturally.
*   **Next Step:** If you’re in an OpenEd state (AR, IN, IA, KS, MN, MT, NV, OR, UT), apply today. It’s free, takes 2 minutes, and could cover 100% of your costs.

Not in an OpenEd state? Explore your state’s Education Savings Account programs, tax credits, or charter school options. Visit the Open Education Hub to explore different educational approaches and find resources for your journey. And check out the OpenEd Academy – an accredited virtual private school that empowers families to build the ideal home-based curriculum for their child, while also getting school credit for extracurriculars.

Most of all, trust yourself. Trust your child. The goal was never to replicate school at home. The goal is to help your child fall in love with learning, develop real skills, and become who they’re meant to be. Everything else is just details.

### Alternate conclusion: The Permission You’re Looking For

Here it is: You have permission to try this.

Permission to pull your struggling child out mid-year. Permission to not know all the answers. Permission to change course when something isn’t working. Permission to count building forts as physics and baking as chemistry.

Most importantly, you have permission to trust yourself. You know your child better than any system ever could. You see when they’re thriving and when they’re drowning. That knowledge is your qualification.

3.7 million families have already discovered what happens when education adapts to children instead of the other way around. Their kids aren’t just surviving—they’re flourishing. They’re curious. They’re engaged. They’re learning how to learn, not just what to memorize.

Your child’s education doesn’t have to look like your education did. It can be better. It can be theirs.

Ready to design an education as unique as your child? You’re exactly the right person to do it.
