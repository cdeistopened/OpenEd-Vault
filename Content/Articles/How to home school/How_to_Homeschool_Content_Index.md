## Required Sections & Source Material

### 1. Is Homeschooling Right for You?

**Source Material:**

**From "Yes, you are qualified to teach your child":**
- "Your job isn't to be an expert in every subject. It's to curate experiences and create an environment where learning can flourish."
- "Humans are naturally curious. Your child doesn't need you to impart everything from your brain to theirs."
- "Resources are nearly endless – from online platforms to books to community-based learning."
- "Relax, and trust in your child's innate desire to learn."

**From "CEO vs. Gardener":**
- "Your kids are going to be okay. You can relax a little bit."
- "The foundation of a great education isn't a perfect schedule; it's a loving, engaged environment."
- "Don't compare yourself to some other family you see on Instagram."

**From "What kind of homeschool parent are you":**
- "We cannot parent children whose heart we do not have. If you're starting to homeschool your teenagers, the very first thing that you have to focus on is the relationship. That has to come before everything else."
- "I learned that boredom leads to brilliance... We've overbooked our kids so much that we've robbed them of the gift of boredom, because that's where genius happens."

**From "Have you considered not going to school":**
- Ken Danford's approach: "Have you considered not going to school?"
- "70% of North Star's teens came directly from school—leaving because of anxiety, bullying, neurodiversity needs, or straight-A culture that was breaking them."
- "The only barometer that matters is your child's health and curiosity."

**Key Points to Include:**
- You don't need to be an expert in every subject
- Focus on relationship first (especially with teens)
- Trust the process and your child's natural curiosity
- Consider homeschooling if school is causing anxiety, bullying, or breaking your child
- The foundation is a loving, engaged environment, not a perfect schedule

### 2. What to Consider When Starting Homeschooling

**Source Material:**

**From "CEO vs. Gardener - The Un-Scheduling Arc":**
- **Early Years (0-10):** Minimal structure, leaning into unschooling and play
- **Middle Years (10-14):** A bit more parent-led structure to guide them through the pre-teen funk
- **Teen Years (14+):** They build their own structure, driven by jobs, sports, or projects
- "Think of structure like a trellis – it's there to support growth, not confine it. Different plants need different amounts of support, and the same is true for kids."

**From "What kind of homeschool parent are you":**
- "Children change more between 10 to 14 than any other time in their lives except zero to three."
- "Each year I'm learning something new or what worked last year doesn't work this year."

**From "The Sticky Note Method":**
- For one week, have your kids jot down answers to:
  - What do you think about in your free time?
  - What are you good at?
  - What do you want to get better at?
  - What do you dislike?
- "This makes their inner world visible. Then, the magic happens when you connect their interest to a real-world need."

**From "Homeschooling a Child with ADHD":**
- "Expect the Executive Function Age, Not the Chronological Age"
- "Simplify Everything" - reduce choices, remove obstacles, make the path obvious
- "You Don't Need 'ADHD Curriculum'" - you need curriculum that's actually engaging
- Freedom to change curriculum if it's not working

**From "Best Homeschool Math Curriculum":**
- "You don't have to be a math expert, choose one curriculum forever, or re-learn calculus. You just have to be an architect."
- "If even triplets—sharing identical genetics and environment—require different math approaches, what does that say about a standardized system?"
- "You can switch mid-year. Math is unusually modular."

**From "Have you considered not going to school":**
- **Path 1:** Stay for the social piece, not the grades. Use school as a community center.
- **Path 2:** Build a patchwork week from after-school activities, jobs, online classes

**Key Points to Include:**
- Structure should adapt to your child's age and needs
- Start with observation (Sticky Note Method)
- You don't need to be an expert - be an architect/curator
- Different kids need different approaches (even in the same family)
- Freedom to change curriculum is a superpower
- Consider your child's learning style and interests
- Build relationships first, especially with teens
