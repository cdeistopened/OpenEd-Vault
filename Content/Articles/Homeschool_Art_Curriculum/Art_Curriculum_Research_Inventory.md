## NOTES

The current V3 draft has some good picks but:
1. Missing several highly-mentioned options (Artistic Pursuits barely mentioned, Creating a Masterpiece undersold)
2. The "toddler with glue stick" framing is wrong
3. Could use the decision framework approach
4. Subscription box category deserves its own callout
5. Free resources should be highlighted more prominently
