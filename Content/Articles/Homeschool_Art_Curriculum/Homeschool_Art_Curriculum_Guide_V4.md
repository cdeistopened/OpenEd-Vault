## The Subject Parents Fear Most

Art is the subject that makes confident homeschool parents suddenly feel like frauds.

You can muddle through math with a textbook. You can read history aloud. But teaching perspective drawing? Watercolor technique? That feels like a job for someone who actually knows what they're doing.

Here's the thing: you don't have to teach it yourself. You find the people who can.

That's the whole promise of open education. You're the curator, not the instructor. And for art, the "instructors" have never been more accessible—through online video courses, subscription boxes that show up at your door with everything you need, and communities where your kid can create alongside other kids.

Sir Ken Robinson warned us: "We don't grow *into* creativity, we grow *out* of it." Art gets cut first when the schedule tightens. Don't let it. The resources exist. You just need to know where to look.

## OpenEd Creative Studios

Before we dive into curricula, a word about community.

One of the hardest parts of homeschool art is the isolation. Your kid makes something, and their only audience is you. That's fine—but it's not the same as creating alongside peers who share their curiosity.

[OpenEd's Creative Studios](https://opened.co/community-and-clubs) connect students with hands-on creative projects led by real teachers. Past sessions have included:

- Snowy Owl Art
- Nature Sun Catchers
- Heart Cupcake Decorating
- Line Dancing

It's free for enrolled families. Your kid shows up on Zoom, follows along, and walks away with something they made—plus the experience of doing it together.

If community matters to you (and it should), start here.

## Kindergarten & Early Elementary (K-2)

**What's happening developmentally:** Kids this age are "symbolic" drawers. They draw what they *know* (a house is a square with a triangle roof), not what they *see*. The goal isn't realism—it's strengthening hand muscles, building positive associations with creativity, and letting them explore.

### Staff Pick: Homeschool Art Box

A monthly subscription that arrives with everything: a lesson about a historical artist, prints of their work, step-by-step instructions, and all the supplies. You open the box and go.

This year's artist lineup includes Michelangelo, Monet, Cezanne, Matisse, Chagall, and Georgia O'Keeffe. Your kindergartner gets exposed to real art history while making something with their hands.

**Best for:** Families who want zero prep and a built-in artist study.

### Other Popular Picks

**iCreate Art Box** — Recommended by OpenEd team member **Ashley Teerlink**. Another "open and go" subscription. Eliminates the midnight craft store runs for that *one* specific type of glue.

**My Zoo Box** — Combines zoology with hands-on crafts. Great for animal-obsessed kids who need a hook to get interested in art.

**Art for Kids Hub (YouTube)** — Free. Massive library of "how to draw" videos. Want to draw a specific Pokémon? They have it. Great for building confidence or filling a 20-minute gap.

**Parent tip:** Your job at this age is "Manager of the Mess." Provide good materials (real clay, quality crayons), then step back. Don't critique. Let them explore.

---

## Upper Elementary (3rd-5th Grade)

**What's happening developmentally:** Somewhere between ages 9-11, kids hit a "crisis of confidence." They want their drawing of a horse to actually look like a horse. If they can't achieve this, they decide they "have no talent" and quit.

This is the crucial window. The goal is bridging the gap between symbolic drawing and realistic rendering through specific technique instruction.

### Staff Pick: The Great Artist Program (K-6)

This one comes from our #team-curriculum channel, specifically endorsed by **Jen Johnson**.

The hook: it's designed for parents who are *not* artists. Short lessons (30-45 minutes) combine an artist biography with a hands-on project. Works beautifully for co-ops or multi-age families—you can teach a 1st grader and a 5th grader at the same time.

**Best for:** Families who want "real art" and history without it being dry.

### Other Popular Picks

**Artistic Pursuits** — The most recommended book-based curriculum across homeschool forums. Blends art history and appreciation with technique. Written directly to the student, so they can work independently. Different books for K-3, 4-6, 7-8, and 9-12.

**Deep Space Sparkle** — Originally designed for art teachers. Patty Palmer's site is a treasure trove of vibrant, successful projects sorted by grade level. If you want "Pinterest-worthy" results, this is it.

**Yellow Spot Sun** — Integrates seamlessly with classical history cycles (e.g., "Architects of the Ancient World"). If you're doing a classical rotation, this lets art reinforce your history.

**Creating a Masterpiece** — See Middle School section below, but note: their elementary levels are excellent too. DVD instruction means you're completely off the hook.

---

## Middle School (6th-8th Grade)

**What's happening developmentally:** Time to introduce professional-grade materials and rigorous technique. Middle schoolers are ready to be taken seriously as artists. Treat them like apprentices, not kids.

### Staff Pick: Creating a Masterpiece

This is the most-recommended video-based art curriculum across homeschool forums. Sharon Hofer teaches like a grandmother who happens to be a master artist—gentle but serious.

Materials include soft pastels, acrylics, and copper tooling. The results are often "mantle-worthy." Your middle schooler will produce work they're genuinely proud of.

**Best for:** Families who want someone else to teach technique at a high level.

### Other Popular Picks

**Atelier** — DVD-based, 6 lessons per module. Thorough instruction with art appreciation built in. The website is confusing, but the product is solid. Holds its value well if you resell.

**Masterpiece Society Studio** — Online membership with multiple course tracks: drawing, watercolor, acrylics, pastels, plus themed workshops. Instructor Alisha Gratehouse gets great reviews. Nice feature: supply lists are inside the portal, so you know what you need before you commit.

### The Anime Hook

Don't roll your eyes at your teen's obsession with anime. Leverage it.

**Anime Art Academy** — This isn't cartoons. It's rigorous figure drawing disguised as pop culture. Teaches anatomy, expression, and storytelling.

**Procreate + Outschool** — Introduction to digital art tools is a career skill now, not an optional extra. Outschool offers short courses to get them started on an iPad.

## High School (9th-12th Grade)

At this stage, the path splits. You're either checking a box for graduation or building a foundation for art school.

### Track 1: The Generalist (Fine Arts Credit)

Goal: Cultural literacy and fulfilling graduation requirements.

**You ARE An ARTiST (Chalk Pastel)** — Offers high school tracks that integrate with history and literature. Great for the "unit study" teen who wants to earn an art credit while studying the Renaissance.

**The Annotated Mona Lisa** — A fast-paced, visual tour of art history. Works well as a "spine" for a history-of-art credit.

**AP Art History** — For the academically ambitious. Providers like **UC Scout** or **One Schoolhouse** offer accredited courses that look good on a transcript.

### Track 2: The Specialist (Portfolio Prep)

Goal: Art school admission.

Admissions officers want to see *observational drawing*—drawing from life, not from photos. They want to see how the student translates 3D space to 2D paper.

**Ashcan Art / New York Art Studio** — Online intensive portfolio prep that mimics the rigor of art school.

**Outschool "Portfolio Review" classes** — Professionals critique student work. Essential feedback before submitting applications.

## Free & Budget Resources (All Ages)

Not everything costs money. Some of the best resources are free:

**Art for Kids Hub (YouTube)** — Massive library, free, great for confidence-building and filling gaps. Recommended by **Wendy Robison**.

**Under the Home** — Free K-5 online curriculum covering art history, music, and studio art.

**Oak National Academy** — High-quality, free video lessons for all ages. UK-based but universally applicable.

**Your local art museum** — Many offer free or low-cost homeschool programs. Check their education department.

## Logistics: Keeping the Sanity

You can't teach art if you're terrified of the mess. Here's how veteran homeschoolers manage it:

**The Art Cart** — Mobility is key. Keep everything on a rolling cart. Roll it to the table for "Art Time," roll it into a closet when done. If setup takes 20 minutes, you won't do it.

**The Digital Archive** — You don't need to keep every doodle. Photograph their work, upload it to a digital folder or frame, and recycle the physical copy. Keep only the absolute best in a single portfolio binder.

**Grading (High School)** — Grade on *objective* criteria, not "talent." Did they follow the instructions? Did they complete the assignment? Did they show effort and improvement?

---

## Why This Matters

It's easy to cut art when the schedule gets tight. It feels like the expendable subject.

But creativity is a muscle. If you don't exercise it, it atrophies. And in a world where AI can write essays and solve equations, the ability to create something from nothing—to see what isn't there yet—is one of the few skills that can't be automated.

So buy the messy clay. Let them draw the anime characters. Find the video instructor who will teach them while you handle the other kids.

You don't have to be an artist. You just have to make space for art.

## Start with Community

If you're enrolled with OpenEd, your family already has access to [Creative Studios](https://opened.co/community-and-clubs)—free virtual art sessions where kids create together.

It's the easiest first step. No curriculum to buy, no supplies to gather. Just show up.
