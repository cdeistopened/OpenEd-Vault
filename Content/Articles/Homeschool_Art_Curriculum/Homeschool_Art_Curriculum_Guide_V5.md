## OPENING LETTER (For Newsletter)

Greetings Eddies!

Sir Ken Robinson's TED talk on creativity has been watched over 75 million times. The line that hits hardest: "We don't grow *into* creativity, we grow *out* of it."

Schools, he argued, educate creativity out of children by prioritizing subjects that "matter" (math, reading) over ones that supposedly don't (art, music, dance). By the time kids reach adulthood, most have learned to suppress the creative impulse entirely.

This week's deep dive is our most comprehensive guide to homeschool art curriculum. Not because art is a nice-to-have, but because it's the subject most likely to get cut when the schedule tightens—and that's exactly why it matters.

Inside: the programs our teachers actually recommend (organized by age), a framework for choosing the right approach, and the developmental milestones that explain why your 10-year-old suddenly thinks they "can't draw."

Let's dive in.

# Homeschool Art Curriculum

Art is the subject most likely to get cut when the schedule tightens.

Math has a textbook. History has a narrative. But art? It feels optional—a rainy-day activity, a gap-filler between "real" subjects.

The problem: creativity is a muscle. Stop exercising it, and it atrophies. By the time most kids reach middle school, they've already decided whether they're "artistic" or not. That decision often sticks for life.

This guide gathers recommendations from OpenEd's teachers and veteran homeschool families—programs that have been tested at actual kitchen tables, organized by age and learning style.

## Types of Homeschool Art Curriculum

Art curriculum comes in more formats than most subjects. Before you commit to anything, it helps to know what's out there.

### By Format

**Subscription Boxes** — Everything arrives at your door: supplies, instructions, artist background. You open the box and go. Zero prep, zero craft store runs. (Examples: Homeschool Art Box, iCreate Art Box)

**Video-Based Instruction** — Someone else teaches while you handle the other kids. DVD or streaming, usually with a supply list you source yourself. (Examples: Creating a Masterpiece, Atelier, Masterpiece Society Studio)

**Book-Based Curriculum** — Traditional workbook or textbook approach. Often written directly to the student for independent work. (Example: Artistic Pursuits)

**In-Person Classes** — Local art studios, community centers, and museums often run homeschool-specific sessions during school hours. Google "[your city] homeschool art classes" to see what's available.

**Co-op Art** — Many homeschool co-ops include art as a group subject. A parent with some background (or just enthusiasm) teaches a rotating group of kids. The social element matters here as much as the instruction.

**Online Live Classes** — Real-time instruction with a teacher and other students. Outschool is the biggest marketplace, but individual artists run their own as well.

### By Philosophy

**Process vs. Product** — The great dichotomy of early art education. Process art values the journey (finger painting, clay squishing, no rules). Product art values the outcome (follow these steps to draw this bird). The best programs blend both.

**Picture Study (Charlotte Mason)** — Instead of drilling artist names and dates, you study one artist deeply. The child looks at a painting for several minutes, then describes it from memory. This trains observation skills that transfer to every other subject.

**Unit Studies** — Art as the visual language of whatever else you're studying. Learning about the Civil War? Draw 1860s architecture. Studying anatomy? Sketch skeletal structures. This lets art reinforce other subjects rather than competing with them.

## Kindergarten Homeschool Art Curriculum

At this age, kids are what educators call "symbolic" drawers. They draw what they *know*—a house is a square with a triangle roof—not what they actually see. And that's exactly right. The goal here isn't realism. It's building hand strength for writing, and forming a positive relationship with creativity before anyone tells them they're "not artistic."

Your job at this stage is mostly to provide good materials (real clay, decent crayons) and get out of the way.

### Staff Pick: Homeschool Art Box

A monthly subscription that arrives with everything you need: a lesson about a historical artist, prints of their work, step-by-step instructions, and all the supplies. You open the box and go.

This year's lineup includes Michelangelo, Monet, Cezanne, Matisse, Chagall, and Georgia O'Keeffe—so your kindergartner gets exposed to real art history while making something with their hands.

### Other Options

**iCreate Art Box** — Recommended by OpenEd's Ashley Teerlink. Another "open and go" subscription that eliminates the midnight craft store runs for that one specific type of glue.

**My Zoo Box** — Combines zoology with hands-on crafts. If your kid is animal-obsessed, this gives art a hook.

**Art for Kids Hub (YouTube)** — Free and massive. Want to draw a specific Pokémon? They have it. Great for filling a 20-minute gap.

## Elementary Homeschool Art Curriculum

Somewhere between ages 9-11, something shifts. Kids start wanting their drawing of a horse to actually look like a horse. When it doesn't, many decide they "have no talent" and quit entirely.

This is the crucial window—the moment to bridge symbolic drawing and realistic rendering through actual technique instruction. Get it right, and they keep creating. Miss it, and they may not pick up a pencil again for years.

### Staff Pick: The Great Artist Program (K-6)

Endorsed by OpenEd's Jen Johnson from our curriculum team. Short lessons (30-45 minutes) combine an artist biography with a hands-on project.

The design assumption is that you, the parent, are *not* an artist—which is freeing. It also works well for co-ops or multi-age families; you can teach a 1st grader and a 5th grader at the same time.

### Other Options

**Artistic Pursuits** — The most recommended book-based curriculum across homeschool forums. Blends art history with technique, and it's written directly to the student so they can work independently. Different books for K-3, 4-6, 7-8, and 9-12.

**Deep Space Sparkle** — Originally designed for art teachers. Patty Palmer's site is a treasure trove of vibrant projects sorted by grade level. If you want "Pinterest-worthy" results, this is it.

**Yellow Spot Sun** — Integrates with classical history cycles (e.g., "Architects of the Ancient World"). If you're doing a classical rotation, this lets art reinforce your history.

**Art for Kids Hub (YouTube)** — Recommended by OpenEd's Wendy Robison. Free, engaging, great for filling a 20-minute gap or building basic confidence.

## Middle School Homeschool Art Curriculum

Middle schoolers are ready to be taken seriously. This is the time to introduce professional-grade materials and rigorous technique—to treat them like apprentices rather than kids doing crafts.

### Staff Pick: Creating a Masterpiece

The most-recommended video-based art curriculum across homeschool forums. Sharon Hofer teaches like a grandmother who happens to be a master artist—gentle but serious.

Materials include soft pastels, acrylics, and copper tooling. The results are often "mantle-worthy"—the kind of thing you actually hang on a wall.

### Other Options

**Atelier** — DVD-based, 6 lessons per module. Thorough instruction with art appreciation built in. Holds its value well if you resell.

**Masterpiece Society Studio** — Online membership with multiple course tracks: drawing, watercolor, acrylics, pastels. Instructor Alisha Gratehouse gets great reviews.

If your middle schooler is obsessed with anime, don't roll your eyes—leverage it. **Anime Art Academy** is rigorous figure drawing disguised as pop culture. It teaches anatomy, expression, and storytelling. And learning **Procreate** on an iPad isn't just fun; digital art tools are a genuine career skill now.

## High School Homeschool Art and Art History Curriculum

At this stage, the path usually splits. Some students just need a fine arts credit for graduation. Others are building a portfolio for art school. The approach differs.

### For the Generalist

If the goal is cultural literacy and checking a graduation box, you have options that integrate art with other subjects:

**You ARE An ARTiST (Chalk Pastel)** offers high school tracks that pair with history and literature. If your teen is doing a Renaissance unit study anyway, they can earn an art credit at the same time.

**The Annotated Mona Lisa** is a fast-paced visual tour of art history—works well as a spine for a history-of-art credit.

**AP Art History** is there for the academically ambitious. UC Scout and One Schoolhouse both offer accredited courses that look good on a transcript.

### For the Aspiring Artist

If your student is serious about art school, admissions officers want to see one thing above all: *observational drawing*. Drawing from life, not from photos. They want to see how a student translates three-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional surface.

**Ashcan Art** and **New York Art Studio** offer online intensive portfolio prep that mimics the rigor of art school itself.

For feedback before submitting applications, look for "Portfolio Review" classes on Outschool—professionals who will critique student work honestly.

## Free & Budget Resources

**Art for Kids Hub (YouTube)** — Massive library, free, great for confidence-building.

**Under the Home** — Free K-5 online curriculum covering art history, music, and studio art.

**Oak National Academy** — High-quality free video lessons for all ages. UK-based but universally applicable.

**Your local art museum** — Many offer free or low-cost homeschool programs. Check their education department.

## Logistics: Keeping the Sanity

**The Art Cart** — Keep everything on a rolling cart. Roll it to the table for "Art Time," roll it into a closet when done. If setup takes 20 minutes, you won't do it.

**The Digital Archive** — You don't need to keep every doodle. Photograph their work, upload to a digital folder, recycle the physical copy. Keep only the absolute best in a portfolio binder.

**Grading (High School)** — Grade on *objective* criteria, not "talent." Did they follow instructions? Complete the assignment? Show effort and improvement?
