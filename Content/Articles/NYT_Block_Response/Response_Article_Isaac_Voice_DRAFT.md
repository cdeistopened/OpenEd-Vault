# What the New York Times Gets Wrong About Unschooling

*By Isaac Morehouse*

The New York Times published a guest essay this weekend calling for mandatory state oversight of homeschoolers. The author describes being "unschooled" by his mother in the 1990s - kept isolated at home while she processed her own grief, his hair bleached while she worked through trauma, exposed to online predators with no one noticing.

I take his experience seriously. And he makes some points worth considering - that isolation can be harmful, that some children fall through the cracks, that adults outside the home can sometimes see what parents miss.

But when he compares his experience to an imagined school system where mandated reporters catch every struggling child, where teachers notice every cry for help - he's committing what philosophers call the Nirvana Fallacy. He's comparing a real system to a fantasy.

I have my own story.

My mom wanted a highly structured, rigorous curriculum for us. She didn't manage it.

She tried - lord knows the number of books she purchased at curriculum fairs - but she was raising three stubborn kids while caring for a disabled husband. The result is that my siblings and I didn't do much consistent, structured learning. Today we might be called borderline "unschoolers," but at the time nobody had heard the word.

Between the ages of 4 and 13, roughly half of my time on any given day was spent playing with LEGO. My mom felt guilty about this. So did I. I was always worried that "real school kids" would be far ahead of me.

That day never came.

From the outside, my childhood might have looked like educational neglect. But what might have looked like neglect was the best thing that could have happened to me. Instead of being forced onto a conveyor belt, I was building spaceships and castles and whatever else I could imagine. The confidence I developed creating things. The spatial reasoning. The hours of focused attention on projects I cared about. These are skills that serve me now in a dynamic economy - as the head of an education company that helps thousands of families navigate this same journey.

My world was expanding. I had church, sports, jobs starting at age 10, community around me. I wasn't isolated. I was engaged with the real world in ways my schooled peers weren't.

If I could go back, the only change I'd make is doing even less "academic" stuff and even more of everything else.

## Compared to What?

When analyzing any system, the three most important words are: "Compared to what?"

The author wants mandatory registration, assessments, and check-ins for homeschoolers. He imagines a school system where someone from outside the home would have intervened to help him.

That school system doesn't exist.

Three weeks before this essay, the same New York Times published "America's Children Are Unwell. Are Schools Part of the Problem?" The data: 1 in 4 teenage boys now diagnosed with ADHD. Autism diagnoses rising from 1 in 2,500 to 1 in 31. Anxiety onset at age 6. Peter Gray, a research professor at Boston College, was quoted: "Instead of saying 'We need to fix the schools,' the message is 'We need to fix the kids.'"

Gray has tracked a pattern for years: every fall when school starts, teen mental health deteriorates. Emergency room visits for anxiety spike. Psychiatric hospitalizations rise. Then summer comes and it all improves. When researchers asked teenagers what stresses them out, 83% cited school. Nothing else came close.

In Chicago, there are 30 to 40 schools with zero percent math proficiency rates. Zero. Parents can do better than zero percent.

The actual school system is failing millions of kids. The track got narrower. More kids didn't fit. And we called it a disorder.

The author invokes John Holt, who coined "unschooling" in the 1970s. Holt's vision was about *expanding* a child's world - community, mentors, real-world engagement, following curiosity wherever it leads. He wrote: "Children learn from anything and everything they see. They learn wherever they are, not just in special learning places."

The author experienced his mother contracting his world. Isolation from peers. Emotional enmeshment. That's painful, and I believe him when he describes it.

But unschooling - as Holt envisioned it, as thousands of families practice it today - is about expansion, not contraction. Real unschooling looks like Ken Danford's North Star Teens in Massachusetts, where struggling teenagers find structure when they want it and freedom when they need it. It looks like families following their children's passions into deep learning. It looks like kids building confidence through real-world engagement.

Here's what worries me about essays like this one.

Parents already feel inadequate. They see their kids struggling in school - anxious, medicated, falling behind, hating learning - and they wonder if they could do better at home. But they're scared. What if I'm not qualified? What if I mess it up? What if someone calls me neglectful?

We don't need more parents afraid to pull their kids out of dysfunctional situations.

The resources available now didn't exist when I was growing up. There are curricula that don't require much teaching. Co-ops where kids go a few days a week. Online communities. Local groups. Hybrid programs like OpenEd that work with public schools to provide standards without standardization - so a parent who feels overwhelmed can get help where they need it.

There's never been a better time to give your child something different.

What we don't need is more scrutiny and crackdowns on parents who are trying to do better for their kids. Parents have the strongest interest in their children's wellbeing. They know their kids better than any bureaucrat checking boxes on a form.

Abuse happens in homeschool settings. It also happens in schools - and schools miss it constantly. Mandated reporters are overwhelmed. Teachers have 30 kids in a class. The system the author imagines, where trained professionals catch every struggling child, doesn't exist anywhere.

The debate about homeschool oversight is legitimate. I'm not dismissing it.

But it should be based on what homeschooling and unschooling actually look like when practiced well - not on one man's painful experience with a parent who happened to use the word "unschooling."

The author is now a published novelist writing for the New York Times. I won't claim to know what his childhood did or didn't give him. But I know what mine gave me - even in its imperfection - and I know what thousands of families are building right now for their kids.

We can hold space for his pain while defending the families doing this well.

The New York Times should know better than to conflate them.
