Hi Peter,

The NYT published a guest essay this weekend calling for mandatory homeschool oversight. The author invokes John Holt, but describes something that looks more like isolation by a struggling parent than actual unschooling.

Key paragraph:

> "Mom called what we did 'unschooling,' a concept championed by the home-schooling pioneer John Holt. She agreed with his assertion that 'schools are bad places for kids'... I mostly spent my days with her visiting shops, libraries and restaurants of our rapidly-growing suburb, or else having 'project time' — drawing superheroes, rereading my David Macaulay and Roald Dahl books, or writing short stories by the pool as Mom reapplied my hair bleach."

We're writing a response and would love a sentence or two from you distinguishing real unschooling (expanding a child's world) from what he describes (isolation/enmeshment).

Thanks,
Charlie
