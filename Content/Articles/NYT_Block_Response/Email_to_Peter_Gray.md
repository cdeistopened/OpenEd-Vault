**Subject:** Quick quote request - NYT homeschool op-ed response

---

Hi Peter,

The New York Times published another piece on homeschooling yesterday - this time a guest essay by novelist Stefan Merrill Block about his experience being "unschooled" in the 1990s.

The piece describes what sounds like genuine abuse and neglect - his mother kept him isolated, bleached his hair, had him crawl on the floor at age 12, and used him to fill an emotional void. He was exposed to an online predator and engaged in self-harm with no one noticing.

The problem: Block labels this "unschooling" and uses it to argue for mandatory registration, assessments, and state oversight of all homeschoolers. He cites you by name (from the earlier NYT piece on schools and mental health) and invokes John Holt as the origin of unschooling - but what he describes is the opposite of what Holt advocated.

We're writing a response and I'd love a short quote from you on one specific point:

**The ask:** Can you speak to the difference between unschooling (child-led learning that expands a child's world through real engagement with community, mentors, and interests) versus isolation and neglect (what Block actually experienced)?

Specifically: Block conflates "unschooling" with being kept home by a struggling parent who needed him for emotional support. That's not unschooling - that's a troubled parent using education as cover. Real unschooling, as Holt described it, is about expanding access to the world, not shrinking it.

A sentence or two would be perfect. Something like:

"What Block describes isn't unschooling - it's isolation. Unschooling is about [X]. What he experienced was [Y]."

Or if you have data on comparative abuse rates between homeschool and school populations, that would be gold.

Happy to jump on a quick call if easier. We're hoping to publish within the week while this is still in the news cycle.

Thanks Peter,
Charlie
