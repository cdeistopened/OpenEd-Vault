# You Can Do This (A Response to the NY Times Latest Piece on "Home-Schooling")

*By Isaac Morehouse*

The New York Times just published a new article on homeschooling, and it's not surprising they're paying attention. Homeschooling is the fastest-growing form of education in the United States, and shows no signs of slowing down.

We [previously responded](https://opened.co/blog/what-the-new-york-times-got-wrong-about-homeschooling) when the Times painted homeschoolers with a broad brush after attending the Great Homeschool Convention. Once again, the title of their latest piece makes a sweeping claim - "[The Home-schooled Kids Are Not Alright](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/opinion/home-school-isolation.html)" - based on one author's experience. (The author probably didn't even write that title.)

The essay describes a painful childhood. The author was kept isolated at home by a struggling mother with his emotional needs unmet. He calls for mandatory registration, assessments, and check-ins for all homeschoolers.

His pain is real. And he makes points worth considering: that isolation can harm children, that some kids fall through the cracks, and that adults outside the home can sometimes see what parents miss.

But his argument rests on a comparison - between his homeschool experience and a school system that would have caught his pain. Teachers who would have noticed. Mandated reporters who would have intervened. Counselors who would have helped.

That school system doesn't exist.

Philosophers call this the Nirvana Fallacy: comparing a real situation to an imagined ideal. The question we should always ask is: compared to what?

I was homeschooled in the 80s and 90s in Michigan, back when it still carried a strong stigma. My mom wanted a highly structured, rigorous curriculum for us. She didn't manage it. She tried - lord knows the number of books she purchased at curriculum fairs - but she was raising three stubborn kids while caring for a disabled husband. Between the ages of 4 and 13, roughly half of my time was spent playing with LEGO. My mom felt guilty about this. So did I.

But at the same time, my world was expanding. I had church, sports, jobs starting at age 10, community around me. I wasn't isolated. I was engaged with the real world in ways my schooled peers weren't. From the outside, it might have looked like educational neglect. It was the best thing that could have happened to me.

So: compared to what?

Three weeks before this essay, the same New York Times published "[America's Children Are Unwell. Are Schools Part of the Problem?](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/24/magazine/youth-mental-health-crisis-schools.html)" Their own data showed that 1 in 4 teenage boys are now diagnosed with ADHD, and anxiety is spiking as early as age 6.

Peter Gray, a research professor at Boston College, has tracked a pattern for years: every fall when school starts, teen mental health deteriorates. Emergency room visits for anxiety spike. Psychiatric hospitalizations rise. Then summer comes and it all improves. When researchers asked teenagers what stresses them out, 83% cited school. Nothing else came close.

My co-founder Matt Bowman watched his own daughter make this choice. During her junior year at a traditional high school, she pulled him and his wife aside.

"My friends are all on anxiety medication for tests," she told them. "The pressure is crazy. I'm forgetting stuff."

She enrolled in OpenEd's early college program, finished her associate degree, kept playing three sports with her friends, and thrived.

Corey DeAngelis, a school choice advocate, puts the bar in perspective: "Chicago has dozens of schools with zero percent math proficiency rates. You can do better than zero percent."

In other words, the actual school system is failing millions of kids. The author's concern about children falling through the cracks deserves a serious response. Abuse happens in homeschool settings. It also happens in schools - at significant rates.

[Brian Ray](https://nheri.org/about/), founder of the National Home Education Research Institute, has [reviewed every major study on this question](https://nheri.org/what-research-says-about-public-school-private-school-and-homeschool-child-abuse-neglect-and-fatalities/). His conclusion: "At this point, there is little evidence that public schooled or private schooled children are abused, neglected, or otherwise maltreated at any higher or lower rate than the homeschooled."

The research tells a more complex story than the Times headline suggests:

A [2022 study by Ray and Shakeel](https://nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/) using a nationally representative sample found that "demographics - not school type - explain differences in abuse and neglect." The maltreatment that did occur among homeschooled children happened outside the home, not by family members.

Another study found that "legally homeschooled students are 40% less likely to die by child abuse or neglect than the average student nationally." ([Williams 2017](https://nheri.org/what-research-says-about-public-school-private-school-and-homeschool-child-abuse-neglect-and-fatalities/))

Ray also found [no relationship](https://nheri.org/what-research-says-about-public-school-private-school-and-homeschool-child-abuse-neglect-and-fatalities/) between the degree of state regulation of homeschooling and the rate of abuse or neglect. (2018)

Meanwhile, education researcher Charol Shakeshaft estimates that 5.6 million public and private school students experience sexual misconduct by a school employee sometime between kindergarten and 12th grade. A study this year by Williams et al. noted: "Despite the fact that students in public schools are surrounded daily by mandatory reporters of suspected abuse and neglect, there appears to be no protective effect."

We're not weighing in on what homeschool requirements should be - that's up to every state, and some already have stricter requirements than others. But the data doesn't support the assumption that more oversight of homeschooling automatically means safer kids.

In fact, the fear of oversight can itself become a barrier to good parenting. Peter Gray, writing in his Substack [Play Makes Us Human](https://petergray.substack.com/p/parents-fear-of-cps-is-a-major-deterrent), has documented how fear of Child Protective Services deters parents from giving their children healthy independence:

"As a parent of young kids, it's very disheartening," one parent told him. "I'm more afraid of random neighbors calling CPS than I am of actual kidnappers or car crashes."

When the default assumption is distrust - when parents feel watched - something predictable happens. They stop letting their kids play outside. They stop taking educational risks. They recreate school at home: the same curriculum, the same schedule, the same pressure. And that can have its own damaging effects.

Parents are often in the best position to direct their children's education. We want to give families permission to think of education as a much more open process of discovery - regardless of how it is delivered, and by whom.

Ken Danford has been running [North Star Teens](https://northstarteens.org/) in Massachusetts for nearly 30 years. When a struggling teenager shows up, he says something that shocks them: "You don't like school? Don't go back. Don't ever go back in the building."

When people ask him whether kids are "ready" for that kind of autonomy, he flips the question around.

"You are born ready for that autonomy," Danford says. "What kind of question is that? You think kids couldn't possibly know what they want to do with themselves? Schooling is the abnormal thing. I'm just turning your question around 180 degrees. Why would you consider the kookiness of school to be normal and asking kids what they want to learn to be abnormal? That's insane."

Matt Beaudreau runs [Apogee](https://www.apogee-strong.com/), a microschool network serving families who might traditionally have been classified as homeschoolers. Students attend anywhere from one to five days a week, with the rest of their learning happening at home or in the community.

"What's more likely," Beaudreau asks, "a stranger choosing what's best for somebody, a government choosing what's best, or that person's parent?"

Parents are the most incentivized party to get this right. You know your child better than any bureaucrat checking boxes on a form.

As Corey DeAngelis puts it: "You don't need a teaching degree to know what's best for your child's education."

Cassie Shepherd writes at [Home-Centered Learning](https://www.homecenteredlearning.com/), a blog that has inspired countless parents to take the leap. Her story is one that plays out in millions of families across the country - a school that wasn't serving her children well, twins whose light was going out, and a family that didn't know alternatives existed.

"I was like, 'No way, that's not even what I'm considering'," Cassie recalls when a neighbor first mentioned homeschooling. But the neighbor walked her through the options, pulled curriculum off the shelves, showed her what was possible. "It was this immense relief of - I see something that is a different path that might work for us."

She pulled her twins out of first grade in November 2019 after meeting with the principal. "They are good people and they're working and doing hard things," she says, "but there's a lot of needs and your child is one of many."

The principal told her directly: "I can't change what you want. I wish I could."

"The second we brought them home, their lights went back on and they've thrived ever since."

## You're Not Alone

But giving yourself permission doesn't mean doing this alone.

Laura Feller, an OpenEd parent, remembers the early days: "In the beginning it was overwhelming and scary. Can I help him? Do I have the ability? Do I have the resources? Am I enough?"

Her answer: "Yes. Yes, I am enough to help him. My husband is enough. As a family, we are enough - because we don't have to do it on our own. We have a community. We have resources in the community that can help us manage and find the pathway that's best for him."

The infrastructure for homeschooling has never been stronger. There are curricula that don't require much teaching. Co-ops where kids go a few days a week. Hybrid programs like OpenEd that work with public schools to provide standards without standardization - so a parent who feels overwhelmed can get help where they need it.

Michael B. Horn, a leading voice on education innovation, describes what's happening across the country: "Parents increasingly are not putting up with one size fits all. They're making lots of different choices. Some are going to the microschool for everything. Some are saying, 'We'll take a little bit from here, go here for the sports, take this tutor' - cobbling it together."

Meanwhile, there are an increasing number of virtual programs that combine instruction with community - like [Recess](https://recess.gg/).

Ben Somers founded Recess after his own difficult experience in traditional school. At age 11, he was put on 70 milligrams of stimulants because he was a "foot tapper and wiggler." Now he's building community infrastructure so homeschool families never have to feel isolated.

"I can imagine a version that's much better," he says.

So can we.

Not every parent will pull their kids out of school completely. But many are discovering they have more options than they realized.

Darryl Stinson, a transformation speaker whose [TED Talk](https://youtu.be/8yBfAeadqjI) has over 2 million views, shared his first reaction when Matt Bowman suggested he could pull his kids out of school for educational travel.

"Is that even allowed?"

He couldn't wrap his mind around it. But he couldn't unhear it either.

"What if there was a different way?" he started asking. "What if it wasn't career suicide or sabotage? What if it was actually one of the most powerful, empowering things we could do?"

His kids missed over a hundred days of school that year. They still had good grades. They were still student council leaders. They traveled, listened to sales calls in the car, started thinking like entrepreneurs.

"Now my daughter starts a new business every 90 days," Darryl says. "They're expressed, they're learning, and they see that they have a say in their future."

The author of the Times essay is now a published novelist. I won't claim to know what his childhood did or didn't give him.

But I know what mine gave me.

If I could go back, the only change I'd make is doing even less "academic" stuff and even more of everything else - working, sports, building things. Those years of playing LEGO and freedom that looked like neglect gave me skills that now help me run an education company serving thousands of families navigating this same journey.

His story matters. So do the stories of parents who are building something better.

To the millions of parents considering a more open approach to education: You are enough. The resources exist. The community exists. And as long as you keep showing up for your kids, they will be more than alright.

Don't let fear stop you from giving your child something different.
