# You Can Do This

A piece in the New York Times this weekend might make you question whether homeschooling is right for your family.

The author describes a painful childhood - kept isolated at home by a struggling mother, exposed to online predators, his emotional needs unmet. He calls for mandatory registration, assessments, and check-ins for all homeschoolers. The title the Times chose: "The Home-schooled Kids Are Not Alright."

His pain is real. And he makes points worth considering - that isolation can harm children, that some kids fall through the cracks, that adults outside the home can sometimes see what parents miss.

But when he compares his experience to an imagined school system where mandated reporters catch every struggling child, where teachers notice every cry for help - he's committing what philosophers call the Nirvana Fallacy. He's comparing a real situation to a fantasy.

I want to offer a different perspective. Not a rebuttal - a conversation. Because if you're a parent wondering whether you're capable of educating your child, I don't want this essay to be the thing that stops you.

## I Have My Own Story

My mom wanted a highly structured, rigorous curriculum for us. She didn't manage it.

She tried - lord knows the number of books she purchased at curriculum fairs - but she was raising three stubborn kids while caring for a disabled husband. The result is that my siblings and I didn't do much consistent, structured learning. Today we might be called borderline "unschoolers," but at the time nobody had heard the word.

Between the ages of 4 and 13, roughly half of my time on any given day was spent playing with LEGO. My mom felt guilty about this. So did I. I was always worried that "real school kids" would be far ahead of me.

That day never came.

From the outside, my childhood might have looked like educational neglect. But what might have looked like neglect was the best thing that could have happened to me. Instead of being forced onto a conveyor belt, I was building spaceships and castles and whatever else I could imagine. The confidence I developed creating things. The spatial reasoning. The hours of focused attention on projects I cared about.

My world was expanding. I had church, sports, jobs starting at age 10, community around me. I wasn't isolated. I was engaged with the real world in ways my schooled peers weren't.

If I could go back, the only change I'd make is doing even less "academic" stuff and even more of everything else.

## Compared to What?

When analyzing any system, the most important question is: compared to what?

The author imagines a school system where someone from outside the home would have intervened to help him. That school system doesn't exist.

Three weeks before his essay, the same New York Times published "America's Children Are Unwell. Are Schools Part of the Problem?" The data: 1 in 4 teenage boys now diagnosed with ADHD. Autism diagnoses rising from 1 in 2,500 to 1 in 31. Anxiety onset at age 6.

Peter Gray, a research professor at Boston College, has tracked a pattern for years: every fall when school starts, teen mental health deteriorates. Emergency room visits for anxiety spike. Psychiatric hospitalizations rise. Then summer comes and it all improves. When researchers asked teenagers what stresses them out, 83% cited school. Nothing else came close.

"My friends are all on anxiety medication for tests," my co-founder Matt Bowman's daughter told him when she decided to leave her traditional high school during her junior year. "The pressure is crazy. I'm forgetting stuff." She enrolled in our early college program, finished her associate degree, kept playing three sports with her friends, and thrived.

Corey DeAngelis, a school choice advocate, puts it bluntly: "Chicago has dozens of schools with zero percent math proficiency rates. Come on, you can do better than zero percent."

The actual school system is failing millions of kids. The track got narrower. More kids didn't fit. And we called it a disorder.

## You Don't Need Permission

"How do you know the government is choosing what's best for each child?" asks Matt Beaudreau, founder of Apogee, a microschool network. "How do you know that this stranger over here is choosing what's best? What's more likely - a stranger choosing what's best for somebody, a government choosing what's best, or that person's parent?"

Parents are the most incentivized party to get this right. You know your child better than any bureaucrat checking boxes on a form.

Darryl Stinson, a transformation speaker whose TED Talk has over 2 million views, told me about his first reaction when I suggested he could pull his kids out of school for educational travel: "Is that even allowed?"

He couldn't wrap his mind around it. But he couldn't unhear it either.

"What if there was a different way?" he started asking. "What if it wasn't career suicide or sabotage? What if it was actually one of the most powerful, empowering things we could do?"

His kids missed over a hundred days of school that year. They still had good grades. They were still student council leaders. They traveled, listened to sales calls in the car, started thinking like entrepreneurs. "Now my daughter starts a new business every 90 days," Darryl says. "They're expressed, they're learning, and they see that they have a say in their future."

## You're Not Alone

Here's what worries me about essays like the one in the Times.

Parents already feel inadequate. They see their kids struggling - anxious, medicated, falling behind, hating learning - and they wonder if they could do better at home. But they're scared. What if I'm not qualified? What if I mess it up? What if someone calls me neglectful?

Laura Feller, an OpenEd parent, remembers that fear: "In the beginning it was overwhelming and scary. Can I help him? Do I have the ability? Do I have the resources? Am I enough?"

Her answer: "Yes. Yes, I am enough to help him. My husband is enough. As a family, we are enough - because we don't have to do it on our own. We have a community. We have resources."

The infrastructure for homeschooling has never been stronger. There are curricula that don't require much teaching. Co-ops where kids go a few days a week. Platforms like Recess.gg where homeschoolers make friends worldwide. Hybrid programs like OpenEd that work with public schools to provide standards without standardization.

Michael Horn, a leading voice on education innovation, describes what's happening: "Parents increasingly are not putting up with one size fits all. They're making lots of different choices. Some are going to the microschool for everything. Some are saying, 'We'll take a little bit from here, go here for the sports, take this tutor' - cobbling it together."

Ben Somers founded Recess after his own difficult experience in traditional school - including being put on 70 milligrams of stimulants at age 11 because he was a "foot tapper and wiggler." Now he's building the community infrastructure so homeschool families never have to feel isolated.

"I can imagine a version that's much better," he says.

So can we.

## The Real Message

The author of the Times essay is now a published novelist. I won't claim to know what his childhood did or didn't give him.

But I know what mine gave me - even in its imperfection. And I know what thousands of families are building right now for their kids.

We can hold space for his pain while encouraging the parents who are trying to do better for their children.

Don't let fear stop you from giving your child something different. You don't need a teaching degree to know what's best for your child's education. You don't need permission from the New York Times.

The resources exist. The community exists. And you are enough.
