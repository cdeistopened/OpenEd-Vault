# Checkpoint 2: Cold Opens & Clips - Dalena Wallace (REVISED)

**Selected Big Idea**: "I'm Not Gifted at Teaching" - The Permission to Outsource
**Episode Frame**: A 13-year homeschool mom admits she's not good at teaching - and explains why that made her kids' education better.

---

## COLD OPEN SCRIPT (SYNTHESIZED)

**Duration**: ~45 seconds (err on longer side - trim in Descript)
**Narrative arc**: Shocking stat → Personal confession → Struggle is real → Curiosity gap

```
DALENA: I've even talked to therapists who have said, number one clients
are homeschooling moms.

<Swoosh cut>

DALENA: I tell people I'm not gifted at teaching.
Like I just don't feel like it's something that I do really well.

DALENA: After 13 years of homeschooling, I definitely, even before 13
years, I mean, five, six years into it, I was experiencing some burnout.

DALENA: I know that I do Monday's well and I do Friday's well. So I can
start something strong and I can end it strong, but that in the week,
my goodness, that's like really hard sometimes.

DALENA: I almost gave up on homeschooling. I thought, I don't think
I can do this.

## APPROVED SOCIAL CLIPS (SYNTHESIZED FOR NARRATIVE ARC)

### Clip 1: "I'm Not Gifted at Teaching" (SYNTHESIZED)

**Duration**: ~1:15 | **Platform**: YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok

**On-Screen Hook**: "She homeschools 6 kids. She's bad at teaching."

**Narrative Arc**: Confession → Why it happened → The unexpected solution

**Synthesized Verbatim Transcript**:

```
DALENA: I tell people I really, unfortunately I'm not gifted at teaching.
Like I just don't feel like it's something that I do really well.

DALENA: With having six kids, every kid is different. You know, what I
thought was working really well for my older two, turns out like my
third and fourth came along and it was just not working at all for them.

DALENA: But that's really what's driven me to seek help and to seek
support and to reach out to others and find those tutors and start
co-op classes so that other families can learn alongside my family
and my kids.

DALENA: My top suggestions would be people. Find the people around you
who can teach your kids something. Don't think it has to be a certified
teacher because there are people, members in the community who want to
teach a skill.

DALENA: Letting go of that expectation that I as the homeschool mom
have to be doing everything myself.
```

### Clip 2: "Weepy Wednesday" (SYNTHESIZED)

**Duration**: ~1:10 | **Platform**: YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok

**On-Screen Hook**: "By Wednesday, I was done."

**Narrative Arc**: The breaking point → The weight she carried → The simple solution

**Synthesized Verbatim Transcript**:

```
DALENA: I called it my Weepy Wednesdays. I could start the week strong,
you know, and Monday is great. Tuesday's okay. But by the time Wednesday
hit, it was just like, this is so hard. And I still have two more days
of the week that I have to go.

DALENA: That idea of being the super mom who has to not only feed and
clothe and bathe their kids and put them to bed and keep them all on
track and get them to where they need to be. But then to also do the
academics during the mornings was like, my goodness, this is exhausting.

DALENA: So I just really started small by inviting a friend to come and
we would take turns teaching different subjects. One of us would be with
the younger kids while the other one was teaching the older kids their
geography lesson in the room next door.

DALENA: It doesn't have to be on you. You can let go of an academic
subject and find someone who's really skilled in that and give yourself
a little break there.
```

**Source timestamps synthesized from**:

- 53:36 (Weepy Wednesday naming)
- 51:28 (super mom weight)
- 54:00 (inviting friend, trading subjects)
- 49:10 (doesn't have to be on you)

**Best for**: Relatability + actionable solution - starts with memorable hook, ends with permission

### Clip 3: "Pulled Her Out After 6 Weeks" (SYNTHESIZED)

**Duration**: ~1:05 | **Platform**: YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, LinkedIn

**On-Screen Hook**: "We pulled her out after 6 weeks."

**Narrative Arc**: The experiment → Why it failed → The lesson

**Synthesized Verbatim Transcript**:

```
DALENA: We actually sent our third daughter to a private school at the
beginning of this school year. But it was just a quarter, so it was
like six weeks into it, and I just knew that was not working.

DALENA: She really hated the long days every day, five days a week. It
was so exhausting for her to wake up at 6.30 to leave by like 7.15 and
then she'd go to school until 3.30. Then she'd stay for basketball or
volleyball practice. She wasn't getting home until 6.30 and it was just
too much.

DALENA: And so we recognized that right away and we were not afraid to
pull her out when we realized this was not a good fit for her.

DALENA: It really has been trial and error. Just listening to our kids
and picking up on are they thriving? Is this working well for them or
would a different situation be what they need?

DALENA: Things can shift and look different year after year, and
sometimes even within the same school year.
```

**Source timestamps synthesized from**:

- 24:38 (sent third daughter)
- 25:23 (long days, exhausted)

**Narrative Arc**: Shocking stat → Why it's true → What we need to do

**Synthesized Verbatim Transcript**:

```
DALENA: I've even talked to therapists who have said, number one clients
are homeschooling moms.

DALENA: It's very, very common for us to feel a lot of pressure and to
feel a lot of responsibility and the weight of all of it being on our
shoulders.

DALENA: After 13 years of homeschooling, I definitely, even before 13
years, I mean, five, six years into it, I was experiencing some burnout.
I almost gave up on homeschooling. I thought, I don't think I can do this.

DALENA: We need to offer grace, we need to offer space, tools and
resources that are gonna I really, unfortunately come alongside them and support them in this
work and let them know that they're not alone. They don't have to do
it alone.
```

- 06:15 + 13:04 (burnout, almost gave up)

**Narrative Arc**: Contrarian advice → Why curriculum failed her → The real answer

**Synthesized Verbatim Transcript**:

```
DALENA: My top suggestions would be people. Find the people around you
who can teach your kids something and who have some space in the day.

DALENA: I have used really good curriculum, but honestly, as I'm talking
about it, it's like, we don't use that anymore. And it's because it was
just maybe a little bit too labor intensive on me.

DALENA: Don't think it has to be a certified teacher because there are
people, members in the community who want to teach a skill.

DALENA: We have hired homeschool graduates who understand what the
homeschool day looks like and who are interested in teaching some day.
We're giving them this experience.

DALENA: Find the people who can teach the classes and help me by grading
them and assigning them, raising the bar, challenging my kids.
```

- 47:39 (top suggestion is people)

| 3. Pulled Out After 6 Weeks                                                                 | "We pulled her out after 6 weeks."               | ~1:05    | Experiment → Lesson         |

## QUALITY GATES PASSED

✅ Cold open synthesizes both versions (therapist stat + confession)
✅ Cold open is ~45 seconds (longer for Descript trimming)
✅ All clips use verbatim quotes only (synthesized from multiple timestamps)
✅ Cold open ends with unresolved tension ("I almost gave up")
✅ 5 clips with distinct angles and complete narrative arcs
✅ On-screen hooks are scroll-stopping statements
✅ Each clip has clear beginning, middle, end

---

## CHECKPOINT 2 DECISION POINT

**Review the synthesized versions:**

1. **Cold Open**: Now combines therapist stat opener with confession arc - does this flow work?
2. **Clip Hooks**: Each clip now has a specific on-screen hook. Any adjustments?

   - "She homeschools 6 kids. She's bad at teaching."
   - "By Wednesday, I was done."
   - "We pulled her out after 6 weeks."
   - "Therapists' #1 clients? Homeschool moms."
   - "Stop looking for the perfect curriculum."
3. **Narrative Arcs**: Each clip now synthesizes quotes from multiple sections to create complete stories. Do they feel coherent?
4. **Any sections to add/swap?** I can pull from other parts of the transcript.

Once approved, I'll move to Checkpoint 3 (YouTube Strategy: title, thumbnail, description, chapters).
