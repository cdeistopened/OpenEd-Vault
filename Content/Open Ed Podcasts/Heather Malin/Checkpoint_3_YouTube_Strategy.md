## YouTube Description
**Hook**: We think we're helping kids by asking "what is your purpose?", but research shows we're actually shutting them down.

**Full Description**:
Heather Malin, former director of research at Stanford's Center on Adolescence, reveals why the pressure to "find a purpose" is backfiring on teens. Instead of big, existential questions, she argues for a "Start Young, Start Small" approach—using art, open-ended questions, and even boredom to help kids discover who they are.

In this episode, she breaks down the science of motivation, why "beyond-the-self" goals improve grades, and how to foster a purpose mindset without the pressure.

## Cold Open Script (Final)
**(31:09-31:25)**
**HEATHER**: ~~I have a teenager and she's more receptive now... but through her early teen years and 12,~~ I could not say the word purpose around her. She got so tired of hearing it and she didn't want to think about that.

**(31:25-31:35)**
**HEATHER**: ~~And so if that is why~~ I think it's really important to not go in to this process saying, well, you need to identify your purpose.

**(11:35-11:42)**
**HEATHER**: I just want to make sure it's clear that we're not starting with asking you know eight-year-olds like what is your purpose in life?

**(11:42-11:46)**
**HEATHER**: It's more like...

## Social Clips (Final)

### Clip 1: The "What Matters" Question
**Duration**: 1:11
**On-Screen Hook**: Don't ask "What's your purpose?"

**(11:35-11:46)**
**HEATHER**: I just want to make sure it's clear that we're not starting with asking you know eight-year-olds like what is your purpose in life?

**(11:46-12:03)**
**HEATHER**: It's more like what matters to you? Who are the people you care about? What have been experiences in your life that you found really important and why? What do you take away from those experiences? Yeah, so I definitely am on board with I totally agree with starting young and scaffolding it upwards.

**(12:03-12:15)**
**ELA**: That's quite interesting. You mentioned a couple of questions. What are some other good questions to ask?

**(12:15-12:46)**
**HEATHER**: So, the questions you can ask are those, you you can start with values. I think some people don't like the word values, but it's, that's kind of asking about like, you know, what kind of person do you want to be? Who, maybe who are people that you admire and why? A lot of the purpose questioning is why. So what matters to you...
