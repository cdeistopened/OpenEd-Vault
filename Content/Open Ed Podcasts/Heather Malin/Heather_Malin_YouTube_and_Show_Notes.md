**YouTube Description**:
We think we're helping kids by asking "what is your purpose?", but research shows we're actually shutting them down.

Heather Malin, former director of research at Stanford's Center on Adolescence, reveals why the pressure to "find a purpose" is backfiring on teens. Instead of big, existential questions, she argues for a "Start Young, Start Small" approach—using art, open-ended questions, and even boredom to help kids discover who they are.

In this episode, she breaks down the science of motivation, why "beyond-the-self" goals improve grades, and how to foster a purpose mindset without the pressure.
