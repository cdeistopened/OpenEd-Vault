# 3 Ways to Foster Purpose in Your Teen (Without Nagging)

If you have a teenager, you know the drill. You ask about their future, and they shut down. You ask what they care about, and they shrug.

According to Heather Malin, former director of research at Stanford's Center on Adolescence, this isn't defiance. It's exhaustion.

"I could not say the word purpose around my teenager," Malin says. "She got so tired of hearing it."

We often treat purpose like a destination—a single "thing" our kids need to find to be successful. But research shows that pressure actually backfires. Here are three research-backed ways to foster purpose without the power struggle.

### 1. Stop Asking "What Is Your Purpose?"

It’s the worst question you can ask. It feels heavy, permanent, and performative.

**Try this instead:** Start small. Malin suggests asking, "What matters to you right now?" or "Who do you admire?"

Purpose isn't a lightning bolt; it's a habit of noticing what you care about. By lowering the stakes, you make it safe for them to explore.

### 2. Dig for the "Why" (Even When It's Shallow)

If your kid says, "I want to be rich," don't roll your eyes. Dig deeper.

"Underneath that desire to be wealthy is often a way they want to connect with the world," Malin explains. Maybe they want to take care of you. Maybe they want freedom.

When you ask "why" (with genuine curiosity, not judgment), you often find a "beyond-the-self" motivation hiding inside a selfish-sounding goal. That hidden motivation is the seed of purpose.

### 3. Let Them Be Bored

We often equate purpose with passion and excitement. But Malin argues that true purpose requires the cognitive maturity to push through boredom.

"Purpose can be boring," she says. "You have to get through the parts that support whatever it is you want to do."

If we constantly entertain our kids, we rob them of the chance to develop this resilience. Let them be bored. It’s good for their prefrontal cortex.

## [SUGGESTED CUTS FOR PACING]

*User Note: You mentioned the episode felt "fluffy." Here are suggested cuts to tighten the audio:*

1.  **The "Art" Section (07:25 - 09:09)**: While interesting, this section about kindergarten art is less relevant to the core "teen purpose" topic. **Recommendation: CUT** to focus on the middle school/teen years.
2.  **The "Twitter Girl" Story (28:00 - 30:00)**: (If present in full audio) This story is long and specific. If the episode drags, this is a prime candidate for removal to keep the pacing up.
3.  **Repetitive "Process" Explanations**: Heather defines purpose as a "process" multiple times (01:55, 31:25, 41:00). **Recommendation**: Keep the first definition at 01:55 and the practical application at 31:25. Cut the middle instances.
4.  **Ela's "Inner Self" Monologue (05:54)**: Ela's reflection on "who am I not" is valid but slows the interview down. **Recommendation**: Trim this to get straight to the next question.

# 5 Questions with Heather Malin

**You say we think about purpose all wrong. How so?**

We treat it like a treasure hunt—something you either find or you don't. But purpose isn't a destination. It’s a developmental process. It’s the daily practice of exploring who you are and who you want to be in the world.

**So how do we start that process with a child?**

Start with art. Long before kids have the words to articulate "this is who I am," they can draw it. Art is simply the act of sharing your inner world with the outer world. It’s the first language of purpose.

**What is the one question parents should stop asking?**

Stop asking "What is your purpose?" It’s too big. It shuts them down. Instead, ask small questions: "What matters to you right now? Who do you admire? Why?" Start young, start small, and let the answers evolve.

**You’ve found a surprising link between motivation and "beyond-the-self" goals. What is it?**

We found that when students connect their learning to something bigger than themselves—even just "I want to do well to support my family"—their grades actually improve. Self-interest has limits. Contribution is fuel.

**You argue that boredom is essential for purpose. That sounds counterintuitive.**

We confuse purpose with constant excitement. But meaningful work involves drudgery. You have to develop the cognitive maturity to stick with the boring parts to achieve the goal. If we constantly entertain our kids, we rob them of the resilience they need to sustain purpose.
