## Selected Direction: Option 2 (Focus on System/Success)
How to Homeschool Year-Round (Without Burnout)
## YouTube Description
**Hook sentence:** You don’t need a bell schedule to keep your kids on track—you need Jean Lee’s “plan everything, pause for magic” rhythm.

**Full Description:**
Neuroscientist and Academy of Chaos founder Jean Lee never planned to homeschool—now she’s the mentor every family corners at soccer practice. In this conversation with Ela Richmond, Jean shares how she maps an entire year in Homeschool Planet in one weekend, keeps even her four-year-old accountable, and still slams the brakes to chase June berries or inspect insects. 

If you’re a working parent, raising twice-exceptional kids, or just trying to stop the daily workbook wars, this episode is your blueprint for flexible structure.

## Cold Open (Final)
- **Concept:** “Plan, Then Slam the Brakes”
- **Duration:** ~00:32 (00:40:28 – 00:18:06 rearranged)
- **On-Screen Text Hook:** PLAN + PAUSE
- **Clip Order (verbatim):**
  1. **00:40:28 – Jean (7s):** “We were going somewhere last week and we were on a timeline, but my middle daughter saw an insect... She said, I need to know what is this insect?”
  2. **00:40:41 – Jean (5s):** “I paused and I said, this is not a life or death situation. If we are five or 10 minutes late, there are no consequences...”
  3. **00:17:03 – Jean (6s):** “I love using an online scheduling tool to lay out our lessons for the entire year.”
  4. **00:17:10 – Jean (6s):** “I can see our math curriculum. If we do one lesson every weekday... we're still gonna get done at the beginning of April.”
  5. **00:18:06 – Jean (8s):** “And we actually go year round... it's snowed in Indiana this week. So we had a great snow day and I said, we're not doing school today. We're all going outside all day.” *(Cut here for cliffhanger.)*
- **Cliffhanger Type:** Unfinished implication—listeners stay to learn how she keeps progress after spontaneity.

## Long-Form Clip Pulls (YouTube Chapters / Secondary Uploads)

### Clip A – “How I Plan 12 Months of Homeschool in 1 Weekend”
- **Suggested Title:** “How I Plan 12 Months of Homeschool in 1 Weekend”
- **Runtime Target:** ~3:30 (00:16:40 – 00:20:10)
- **Edit Instructions:** 
  - Roll in 1-second pre-roll of Ela’s question (“How you schedule things…”) to provide context, then cut straight to Jean at 00:16:43 (“I do a lot of parent mentoring…”).
  - Keep through her description of mapping math lessons, realizing April completion, year-round approach, snow day anecdote, and using travel time for lessons.
  - Fade out right before Ela asks the deschooling follow-up at 00:20:10 to keep focus on the weekend-planning workflow.

### Clip B – “This Is Why ‘Deschooling’ Backfires”
- **Suggested Title:** “This Is Why ‘Deschooling’ Backfires”
- **Runtime Target:** ~3:15 (00:19:41 – 00:22:55)
- **Edit Instructions:**
  - Hard open on Jean’s line “I love this topic because deschooling is spoken about a fair amount…” (00:19:41) for immediate hook; no need to include Ela’s lead-in.
  - Keep the full explanation on why long breaks become “no schooling,” the behavioral battles, and her gentle-rhythm alternative (holiday light loads, kids waking at nine, karate evenings).
  - End after Jean says “the day is very fluid and flexible from that perspective, but I don’t typically stop” (00:22:55). Cut before Ela’s next question to maintain a clean conclusion.
