# Jean Lee Cold Open Workshop

## Scene Elements Library
- **Scene A – Instant Homeschool Friend (00:00:32 – 00:02:25):** Jean confesses she once thought homeschooling was “weird,” then suddenly becomes the person every parent corners at soccer practice. Stakes: lonely transition vs. being everyone’s lifeline.
- **Scene B – Planned Flexibility (00:17:00 – 00:21:10 & 00:40:28):** She maps the year in Homeschool Planet yet pauses a car ride to identify an insect. Stakes: can you keep rigor without killing wonder?
- **Scene C – Dopamine Guardrails (00:42:20 – 00:44:10):** Jean dismantles the daily-screen-time reward system for ADHD kids and swaps it with surprise, communal gaming. Stakes: protecting brains vs. melting down your day.
- **Scene D – Curriculum Intervention (00:52:32 – 00:54:40):** Parents bring her stacks of workbooks, and she shows them they’ve been assigning practice with zero instruction. Stakes: chaos at the table unless you know the difference.

Mix-and-match idea: start with a vivid slice (Scene B insect), jump to the system behind it (Scene B planner), flash forward to a caution (Scene C dopamine), then cliffhang on Scene D (“Now let’s talk about your child’s learning style…”).

## Concept 1 – "Everyone Finds Jean"

### The Scene
Drop us into the moment Jean realizes strangers keep handing her their parenting crises because she became “the first homeschool friend” overnight.

### Clips (In Order)
**Clip 1** | **Jean** | 00:01:38 | ~6s  
"It was literally schools closed and we all came home. So it was immediate for us."

**Clip 2** | **Jean** | 00:01:52 | ~7s  
"It doesn't matter if we're at soccer, if we are at ballet, if we are sitting on a park bench... I talk to hundreds and hundreds of families every week and conversations are always similar."

**Clip 3** | **Jean** | 00:02:08 | ~5s  
"Hey, is that your kid over there? Yeah, that's mine. She's seven and we're homeschool family. Do you homeschool?"

**Clip 4** | **Jean** | 00:02:15 | ~6s  
"One of the coolest things about being in that space is I love being family's first homeschool friend."

**Clip 5** | **Jean** | 00:02:18 | ~6s  
"I didn't have that friend, and I sure wish I had because my transition was hundreds of hours of research..."

### Structure
- **Arc:** Shock (schools close) → Swarm of parents → Character (“first homeschool friend”) → Stakes (she had no guide) → Tease (how does she shorten the path?)
- **Spine:** Who helps the helpers? Jean’s origin story hints at her method but withholds it.
- **Total Length:** ~30s

### The Cliffhanger
- **Type:** Promise of revelation  
- **Line:** "I didn't have that friend, and I sure wish I had because my transition was hundreds of hours of research..."

### Why This Works
Starts with COVID chaos everyone remembers, then flips the script: the reluctant homeschooler became the hotline. We never hear how she makes the transition easier now—listeners stick around to find out.

### Testing Results
- Stranger: ✅  
- Itch: ✅ (How does she help the next family?)  
- Stakes: ✅ (Hundreds of hours of research at risk)  
- Tease: ✅  
- Emotion: ✅ (lonely → empowered)  
**Score:** 5/5

## Concept 2 – "Plan, Then Slam the Brakes"

### The Scene
Contrasts Jean’s obsessive year-long planning with her willingness to stop the day over an insect sighting.

### Clips (In Order)
**Clip 1** | **Jean** | 00:40:28 | ~7s  
"We were going somewhere last week and we were on a timeline, but my middle daughter saw an insect... She said, I need to know what is this insect?"

**Clip 2** | **Jean** | 00:40:41 | ~5s  
"I paused and I said, this is not a life or death situation. If we are five or 10 minutes late, there are no consequences..."

**Clip 3** | **Jean** | 00:17:03 | ~6s  
"I love using an online scheduling tool to lay out our lessons for the entire year."

**Clip 4** | **Jean** | 00:17:10 | ~6s  
"I can see our math curriculum. If we do one lesson every weekday... we're still gonna get done at the beginning of April."

**Clip 5** | **Jean** | 00:18:06 | ~8s  
"And we actually go year round... it's snowed in Indiana this week. So we had a great snow day and I said, we're not doing school today. We're all going outside all day."

### Structure
- **Arc:** Curiosity interruption → Permission to pause → Reveal master planner → Evidence of flexibility → Tease (year-round rhythm still gets done)
- **Spine:** Can meticulous planning coexist with spontaneous learning?
- **Total Length:** ~32s

### The Cliffhanger
- **Type:** Unfinished implication  
- **Line:** "We're all going outside all day." *(Listeners want the system that lets her do that without falling behind.)*

### Why This Works
We open mid-chaos with an insect rescue, then smash cut to spreadsheets and year-round pacing. Ending on the snow day leaves the question: how does she keep progress without the bell schedule?

### Testing Results
- Stranger: ✅  
- Itch: ✅ (How does she plan *and* pause?)  
- Stakes: ✅ (Fall behind vs. seize magic moments)  
- Tease: ✅  
- Emotion: ✅ (Wonder + relief)  
**Score:** 5/5

## Concept 3 – "Dopamine-Proof Parenting"

### The Scene
Drop into Jean’s neuroscience brain right as she dismantles the classic “earn an hour of screens” system.

### Clips (In Order)
**Clip 1** | **Jean** | 00:42:20 | ~7s  
"That is a dangerous situation with kids who have a DHD because it quickly becomes a dopamine seeking behavior."

**Clip 2** | **Jean** | 00:42:32 | ~5s  
"If you are using that as a reward, it is probably the absolute worst reward."

**Clip 3** | **Jean** | 00:42:46 | ~8s  
"You're asking them to do the absolute worst job in the shortest amount of time to get the reward that is going to give them the dopamine release that they want."

**Clip 4** | **Jean** | 00:43:10 | ~6s  
"So I don't like to work within those constructs. I like it to be a popup surprise: today, guess what? We don't have anything planned this afternoon..."

**Clip 5** | **Jean** | 00:43:24 | ~6s  
"Why don't we sit down as a family and let's play family Feud, or let's play we sports soccer, or let's do the skiing game..." *(Cut before she explains why it works.)*

### Structure
- **Arc:** Warning → Contrarian claim → Neuroscience explanation → Alternative strategy → Tease (does it actually work?)
- **Spine:** Screens aren’t evil; predictable dopamine is. Jean’s solution begs follow-up.
- **Total Length:** ~32s

### The Cliffhanger
- **Type:** Unfinished statement  
- **Line:** "Why don't we sit down as a family and let's play family Feud..." *(Listeners lean in to hear the payoff.)*

### Why This Works
Parents instantly recognize the tension: chore charts vs. meltdowns. Jean stops mid-plan, making audiences wait to hear whether surprise gaming actually keeps kids regulated.

### Testing Results
- Stranger: ✅  
- Itch: ✅ (Should I cancel chore charts?)  
- Stakes: ✅ (ADHD dopamine spirals)  
- Tease: ✅  
- Emotion: ✅ (Urgency + relief)  
**Score:** 5/5

## Concept 4 – "Curriculum Is Not a Workbook"

### The Scene
Jean sits with burnt-out parents, flips through their stacks, and reveals they’ve been assigning practice with zero teaching.

### Clips (In Order)
**Clip 1** | **Jean** | 00:52:32 | ~6s  
"The important thing to know about curriculum is how to recognize what is curriculum and what is practice..."

**Clip 2** | **Jean** | 00:53:05 | ~6s  
"They think any type of learning material is curricula, when in reality curricula will include guidance in a clear lesson of how to whatever it might be."

**Clip 3** | **Jean** | 00:53:30 | ~5s  
"What they will bring almost exclusively is workbooks. And those workbooks do not have lessons."

**Clip 4** | **Jean** | 00:53:45 | ~7s  
"So it goes back to the idea of expectation with your child. Can you expect your child to complete algebra if you have not taught them how to solve the problems?"

**Clip 5** | **Jean** | 00:54:32 | ~7s  
"When you're looking for something to educate your child, look for this. Now let's talk about your child's learning style..." *(cut before she explains the audit)*

### Structure
- **Arc:** Definition → Myth → Reveal → Stakes → Tease (learning-style audit)
- **Spine:** You’re fighting your kid because you’re giving worksheets, not instruction.
- **Total Length:** ~31s

### The Cliffhanger
- **Type:** Unfinished statement  
- **Line:** "Now let's talk about your child's learning style..."

### Why This Works
Every overwhelmed parent recognizes the nightly workbook war. Jean exposes the root cause, then stops right as she’s about to teach the fix.

### Testing Results
- Stranger: ✅  
- Itch: ✅ (How do I audit my materials?)  
- Stakes: ✅ (Tears over algebra)  
- Tease: ✅  
- Emotion: ✅ (Relief + urgency)  
**Score:** 5/5
