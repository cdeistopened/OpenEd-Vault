Every summer, something remarkable happens.

[Teen mental health improves](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10969660/). Emergency room visits for anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and intentional self-harm [drop dramatically](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK552668/) from May through July. Psychiatric hospitalizations decline. Kids breathe easier.

Then August hits. School starts. And it all comes roaring back.

This isn't a one-year anomaly. It's a pattern that repeats annually—so consistent that researchers in Canada tracked over 20,000 children and documented the same phenomenon year after year. Mental health admissions plummet when school ends. They spike when it resumes.

During COVID lockdowns, the pattern held. When schools closed in March 2020, mental health improved across the board. It didn't rebound when schools moved online. It only got worse again when kids returned to in-person classrooms.

When you ask teenagers what's stressing them out, 83% cite one thing: school.

Not TikTok. Not Instagram. School.

We've been pointing our worry at screens while ignoring what the data keeps screaming at us.

## Why School Has a Halo

Dr. Peter Gray has been watching this unfold for decades. He's a biopsychologist and the author of *Free to Learn*, published in 2013—a book that became foundational for parents questioning how we educate children. He's spent his career researching how children naturally learn through play, why freedom makes them happier, and what happens when we systematically take that freedom away.

What he's discovered contradicts the story we've been telling ourselves.

"So we, as a culture, would far rather blame social media than blame school," Peter told me during our podcast conversation. "School has a halo around it."

That halo blinds us. We see our kids glued to phones and assume that's the problem. We don't see what happens when school closes for the summer and they suddenly seem lighter. We don't connect the dots.

But the dots are there. And they've been forming a pattern for 70 years.

## The Timeline Nobody Talks About

The rise in anxiety and depression among young people didn't start in 2010. It didn't start with smartphones or social media.

It's been happening [since the 1950s](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2888013/).

By 1990, rates of anxiety and depression among young people were 5 to 8 times higher than they were in 1950. That's 40 years of gradual, continuous decline in youth mental health—decades before Instagram existed.

But here's the part that breaks the social media narrative: between 1990 and 2000, those rates actually *got better*. Kids' mental health improved significantly. Then it leveled off from 2000 to 2010, only to spike again after 2010.

If social media caused the crisis, why did mental health improve during the decade when the internet arrived? And why did things get worse starting in 2010—not because of new technology, but because of what was happening in schools?

## What Changed in 1950

Between 1950 and 1990, childhood transformed. School expanded dramatically—the school year increased by five weeks. Homework became standard. (It barely existed in the 1950s.) Organized sports replaced free play. Television brought kids indoors. Families got smaller. Houses got bigger, so children had no need to leave them.

Every single change eliminated children's freedom. They had no space to play, explore, fail, or figure things out on their own. And mental health declined in lockstep.

Then computers arrived.

By the early 1990s, most teenagers had access to computers. By the mid-1990s, they had internet connections. Suddenly, kids had a new way to escape adult control. They could play games, explore, interact with peers without constant supervision.

"Computer games are real play, people," Peter said, directly challenging the panic many parents feel about screen time. "Adults want to demonize them, but that's not the science."

The research is clear: kids who played computer games in the 1990s were doing better psychologically than kids who didn't. This wasn't addiction or avoidance. It was liberation.

For a decade, kids had breathing room again. And mental health improved.

## Why We Blame Phones Instead

Fast forward to 2010. Mental health starts declining again. Smartphones become ubiquitous. Social media explodes.

And suddenly, we have our villain.

Except [the data doesn't support it](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7012622/).

Hundreds of studies have examined the correlation between social media, smartphone use, and mental health decline among young people. Meta-analyses show [small to moderate correlations at best](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032720323727)—some show slight positive effects, some show slight negative effects. Overall, they largely cancel out.

But here's what breaks the narrative completely: the United States and the UK are the only two developed countries that experienced this recent mental health spike.

Europe adopted smartphones and social media just as quickly. Kids in France, Germany, Spain—they're on TikTok and Instagram just as much as American kids.

Yet mental health in the European Union actually *improved* during the same period when it worsened in the US.

Same phones. Same apps. Different educational systems.

The variable wasn't technology. It was what was happening in schools.

## What School Does to Kids

This isn't about bad teachers or mean administrators. It's structural.

We've convinced children that how they perform in school is a measure of their worth. They're constantly being judged, assessed, compared. They internalize a brutal equation: if I fail at school, I fail as a human being.

"We have convinced children that how they're doing in school is a measure of them," Peter explained. "That they are constantly being judged. They're constantly being assessed. They're being compared to others. They're being made to feel like, if I am a failure at school, I'm a failure as a human being."

That constant assessment creates a baseline of anxiety that never fully lifts. Until summer. When it does.

The pattern is too consistent to ignore. The data is too clear. School isn't just correlated with anxiety—it's causing it.

## What Childhood Is Actually For

The purpose of childhood, according to Peter's research in evolutionary biology, is straightforward: becoming increasingly independent.

Children are born totally dependent. The extended childhood period exists for them to gradually develop the capacity to take care of themselves. They need time to do things alone. They need to interact with other children away from adults, learning to get along with peers without supervision. They need to solve their own problems and live with the consequences.

Since the 1950s, we've been systematically eliminating those opportunities. Children are monitored and directed by adults constantly. We've scheduled every hour, optimized every activity, turned childhood into a resume-building exercise instead of a crucible for developing capability.

School accelerated this. More hours. More homework. More assessment. Less freedom.

And we wonder why kids are anxious.

## The Alternative That Works

Here's the hopeful part: kids in self-directed education environments—where they follow their own interests and solve their own problems—show better outcomes than kids in traditional school. They're happier, more capable, more resilient.

"If instead of dropping out of school, students transition to self-directed education—where they follow their own interests with support—they do far better," Peter said. "I've documented this in my research."

College professors teach as if you forgot everything you learned in high school anyway. The real skill isn't memorizing curriculum. It's developing independence and self-reliance. Self-directed education builds exactly that.

## What You Can Actually Do

The solution isn't restricting technology. It's giving kids back the freedom we took away.

Peter offered concrete starting points:

Make children responsible for remembering their own activities. If you have to remind them, they're probably not genuinely interested. "Tell your child: 'I'm not your calendar keeper. That's your job. If you need a ride and can't get there yourself, I'll provide it—but you have to remind me,'" he said.

Encourage independent mobility. Children should walk or bike places when possible, or take public transportation. Even kindergarteners used to walk to school. This builds independence and physical health. Now teenagers don't walk anywhere.

Give children back unstructured time. They need it more than they need another activity.

The pattern is undeniable. Mental health improves when school is out. It declines when school is in. Social media use stays constant. School is the variable.

We've been looking in the wrong direction. The answer isn't taking away phones. It's giving back freedom—the very thing childhood is supposed to provide.
