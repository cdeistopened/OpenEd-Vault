### **Clip Sequence**

**[OPEN - Set up the stakes]**

```
PETER: We have convinced children that how they're doing a school is a measure of them.
That they are constantly being judged. They're constantly being assessed. They're being
compared to others. They're being made to feel like, if I am a failure at school, I'm a
failure as a human being.
```

**[BUILD - Provide the evidence]**

```
PETER: Every year, this has been true for a long time. Every year, the rate of suicide
and the rate of admission into mental hospitals, emergency admissions for pediatric mental
health emergencies plummets. It goes way down. Every summer, school closes and the kids
are doing better. School opens up and it gets worse again.
```
