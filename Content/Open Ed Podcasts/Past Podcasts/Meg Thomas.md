Because whatever story you tell yourself, your brain releases chemicals and creates a physical sensation in your body. So the story you tell yourself creates how you feel.

So I come on these calls and I'm excited and I wanna help everybody. And so when I'm talking about these things, you can see like I'm higher energy and it's super fun and it's exciting, but if I was like feeling dread about being here, my body language would be slumped. Like, I don't know. Who cares, right? Like you just can't fake those feelings that drive your actions."

### **CLIP #1 (00:01:50–00:02:40)**

> "So if a lot of us want to feel confident, why does it feel so hard to feel confident? So one of the rea—like a couple of the reasons with confidence is anxieties and fears are blocking us from feeling confident. And so I wanna talk about these and then talk about how we can get past those to actually step into feeling confident. So anxiety is a really interesting emotion because if you look at it, anxiety is just a generalized fear. So many things could go wrong. I don't know what I'm doing. And—and you can't even pinpoint it."

### **CLIP #2 (00:05:20–00:06:15)**

Um, I love when little kids go to do something because they're just like—we all expect them to be bad at something and we find it adorable and it's like, it's okay because you're gonna get good at something. But as an adult we're like, oh no, we should be good immediately. Um, and so it's just—it's interesting. Like I plan on being bad at it. If you go back to my old podcast, they're real bad. If you go back to my really old Instagram posts, they're real bad. If you go back to my homeschool 18 years ago, it was a hot mess, right?"

### **CLIP #3 (00:09:00–00:10:00)**

> "We have the internet, we have smart phones, and we have Alexas and Google Homes and all the other things. Uh, and now with Chat GPT, with one of my big kids with math, uh, if we're doing a math lesson and he'll be like, 'But why? But why is this?' You can grab your phone and take a picture of it into AI and say, 'Explain this answer to me like I'm stupid,' or 'like you would to a third grader,' or whatever that is. And like, I can just—when I do school with my big kids, I just have my phone there so I can look stuff up right then and there and I can learn with them."

---

### **CLIP #4 (00:12:55–00:14:00)**

> "So let's break it down then. How do I feel confident? So we know some of the things in the way are fear, anxieties, but how do we actually feel the feeling of confidence? It's as simple as the story you tell yourself. So if you are telling yourself that you're inadequate, you'll never be smart about this, like you can never figure it out, you're not going to feel very good. Because whatever story you tell yourself, your brain releases chemicals and creates a physical sensation in your body. So the story you tell yourself creates how you feel."

### **CLIP #5 (00:18:00–00:19:15)**

> "So, just a fun little thing to help you. So as you're working on feeling whatever you wanna feel—if it's confident, patient, excited, joy, um, whatever, love—all those fun things, I want to give you one simple thing to help your homeschool with whatever, um, style of education you want to give your kids. And it's to find what you value. So this may be you're like, what does this have to do with homeschool? Everything. Because if you value—myself, I value adventure.

# Meg Thomas

[00:00:00] Perfect. Hello. Welcome. Thank you for spending your Thursday night with me. Um, this is exciting. I'm gonna go ahead and share my screen and.

We go, all right, we're gonna start your school year with confidence. What an amazing topic. So this is my family. This picture's a little outdated 'cause I haven't had enough kids living at home. Um, to take a new one. Uh, we have a new daughter-in-law in this picture. So I have seven kids and now we're entering into our 18th year of homeschooling.

Right? So it's been super fun. We started when my oldest was in first grade and just have. We've gone the whole way through. Uh, we have five homeschool graduates now, and I still have two little ones at home. Um, and I am a homeschool and parenting coach, so it is my absolute joy and pleasure to talk all things homeschooling.

Anybody I meet at a park that just looks like a really nice, fun mom. I'm like, do you homeschool? And they're like, yeah, if they do great, and if they don't, I'm like, [00:01:00] oh, you should. I just, I love homeschooling and I love talking about it. So, um, it is one of my favorite things to do. So let's talk about confident, right?

Like, we wanna feel confident in our homeschool. And why? Because feeling confident is amazing, right? Like, uh, your, your, your posture's even better, right? Your shoulders are back. Like, I know what I'm doing. I, I just, I, I'm in my zone. Confidence is an amazing feeling. You feel alive, you feel intelligent. You just, it feels good.

So if a lot of us want to feel confident. Why does it feel so hard to feel confident? So one of the rea, like a couple of the reasons with confidence is anxieties and fears are blocking us from feeling confident. And so I wanna talk about these and then talk about how we can get past those to actually step into feeling confident.

So anxiety is a really interesting emotion because if you look [00:02:00] at it, anxiety is just a generalized fear. So many things could go wrong. I don't know what I'm doing. And, and you can't even pinpoint it. So it's even funny. I would notice this week my husband and I are celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and we're going out of town, uh, this weekend.

And my brain is just like, I have so many things to do, and it was so big and so ambiguous that like, I'd wake up all nervous and my heart would be going fast, and like, I've got so much to do. But when we can start writing down what those fears are or the things that we are telling ourself that we need to do, we can actually take ourself out of anxiety and start attacking those fears one-on-one.

So. When you actually can start naming the fears, this is some of the things I'm afraid of. These are the things I'm worried about. These are the things that are concerning me. They are just dragons on your pathway to create the most amazing homeschool ever. Right? And we want to [00:03:00] take them off one by one, just like you would a to-do list of getting past these fears.

So once you can actually name it. Then you can make a plan. But when we stay in anxiety, we don't make a plan. We often stay stuck because it just feels like too much and it feels overwhelming. And like, what in the world do I do with this? So we want to actually then may move to the next step of just naming the fears.

So for me, like I said, going away this weekend, um, I just made a list and it was so funny because it was silly things like, um. Wash my hair was on my list, but it takes so long to dry that. I was like, oh, I gotta make sure I do that. And as soon as I sat on my list, I was like, oh, I can wash my hair. That's not a big deal.

Great. And then all of a sudden it was done. Uh, I like to write a to-do list for my kids who are staying home. Like, this is the plan every day of what you guys need to be doing. Uh, please feed the dog, please feed the chickens. Those types of things. And I made the list, put it on the. Um, went it over with my kids.

Great. Checked it off, and now all [00:04:00] of a sudden these fears and anxieties can settle down because I'm facing them. I'm, I'm ticking them off one by one. So I wanted to go over what some fears are and at the end of this, we'll actually have, um, Kendall's gonna put up a, uh, popup. What's what, um, poll. A poll where you'll actually go in and we can kind of talk about your specific fears.

To help you make a plan. And we'll actually do that in just a little bit. But some of the ones I hear, uh, what if I'm not good at it? So some of you, this could be your first time homeschooling, or it was a hot mess the last year, or it's been a hot mess for the last three years or however long you've been homeschooling, right?

That you're like, Meg, I actually have proof I'm not very good at it. Right. Um, or I'm really afraid because I'm kind of a snippy mom, or I get really frustrated with my kids easily. Right. I don't know that I'm gonna be very good at it, and I love remembering Brene Brown and I'm gonna edit it and calls it your freaking first time.

Like plan on being bad at [00:05:00] something. Um, I love when little kids go to do something because they're just like, we all accept, expect them to be bad at something and we find it adorable and it's like, it's okay because you're gonna get good at something. But as an adult we're like, oh no, we should be good immediately.

Um. And so it's just, it's interesting, like I plan on being bad at it. If you go back to my old podcast, they're real bad. If you go back to my really old Instagram posts, they're real bad. If you go back to my homeschool 18 years ago, it was a hot mess, right? And so like being okay that like I don't have to be good at it yet, 18 years in, that's how somebody gets good is through practice and through repetition, right?

So that can be one of the fears that you might be feeling. Another big fear I hear, what if I fail my kids? Anybody else ever feel that way? Right? Like I am TA taking on this mantle of being in charge of my children's education. And what I see is when you enroll your kids into a [00:06:00] public school, a lot of times you're like, well, if a teacher fails them, then like, that's not on me and I can wash my hands on it, but now I'm taking on this responsibility.

And what if I fail my kids? And so if you were addressing that, that's really great to think of that in a way of like, what does failing your kids look like? Like can you actually describe what does that mean? Um, maybe if you're locking them up in a basement and beating them. Yeah. Probably not the highlight of parenting.

Right. Um, but failing is probably for me, like not trying because I'm gonna have lesson plans that go bad. Um, one of my favorite lesson plans I did that, it was so funny 'cause my kids don't even remember it. That, um. I thought it would be so fun. We built a tower, uh, not a tower, a city of London and I, we built this whole city and we spent all morning building it, and then I lit it on fire to show 'em the London fires and how close the houses were.

So the whole place started burning and I was like, isn't this a great demonstration of showing you how, like, what happened to [00:07:00] London? And they're bawling. Like, why would you do this? Like, this is terrible. We worked so hard on this. Like I totally failed that day or that activity that I had planned. And I thought, okay, never burden your kids' stuff again.

Even if it was supposed to be a fun lesson to like teach them something. Right? So like I don't only fail my kids if I give up, if I, I don't keep trying because there have been lots of lesson plans that have, that have flopped. There have been lots of times that I have homeschooled for my bed. Like, I'm so tired, just come on in and read to mommy, or, or whatever it looks like, right?

But I keep trying, and I, I, not every day is a really bad day, right? But like, keep going and you can't tell your kids if you keep trying. Another fear is like your kids are fighting all the time and you don't know what to do. That is my expertise, my friends. Um, I love helping in those areas. And so if you were like, I don't know what to do, then it's, it's getting help from an [00:08:00] outside source, right?

So like that's one of the things I love to coach about is that actual family dynamic. Um, but reading parenting books and studying different things of like, okay, I can figure this out. I, they just don't have these skills yet. And just think about that, like when a little kid is learning to walk and we're, we're cheering 'em on even when they fall.

And so if your kids are fighting a lot together, it's like they, they just don't know those skills yet. So I'm not failing because they're fighting like I, I'm, but I'm gonna keep figuring this out so that we can be a harmonious home. We can have peace in our home. Um, and we're not gonna be perfect because we're not trying to make little soldiers, right.

Sometimes I'm even saying things like, choose peace. Like is this choice contentious or like not? Right? And, and just like helping always to help them learn these skills. Um, and I was, I'll tell you too, I can see questions coming up in the chat and I'm gonna answer all of those, um, at the end so I won't take the full 30 minutes so that I can answer all those.

So continue to put those in. Um, another one is, I don't [00:09:00] think I'm smart enough. Uh, we have so much technology now that you don't have to be. I had a neighbor who wants to homeschool and she came over to my house a couple days ago and her son will be ninth grade, and so she was like, we're like into big grades now.

This isn't cutesy stuff that I can do. And I go, friend, you can learn it right then and there with them. A lot of the times when I was teaching my kids, I was learning it for my very first time. I never learned how to diagram sentences. I couldn't have told you what an adverb was. I didn't even like give thongs.

I didn't know what that was. And somebody told me they had to Google that the other day too, and I was like, great, we have the internet, we have smart phones, and we have Alexas and Google Homes and all the other things. Uh, and now with chat, GTP with one of my big kids with math, uh, if we're, we're doing a math lesson and he'll be like, but why?

But why is this? You can grab your phone and take a picture of it into AI and say, explain this answer to me like I'm stupid, [00:10:00] or like you would to a third grader, or whatever that is. And like, I can just, when we, when I do school with my big kids, I just have my phone there so I can look stuff up right then and there and I can learn with them.

I don't have some big fancy degree. I got married young and started having babies quick, and so I just got to learn right there with them. And there was actually a fun beauty about that because like it was my first time learning these things too. So that was really fun. So, um, these are just some of the fears.

So anybody else who's feeling anxious, think about all the things that you could possibly be anxious about and start naming those fears so you can start making a plan. To start conquering those fears and start facing those fears. So let's break it down then. How do I feel confident? So we know some of the things in the way are fear anxieties, but how do we actually feel the feeling of confidence?

It's as simple as the story [00:11:00] you tell yourself. So if you are telling yourself that you're an inadequate, um, you'll never be smart about this. Like you can never figure it out. You're not going to feel very good because whatever story you tell yourself, your brain releases chemicals and creates a physical sensation in your body.

So the story you tell yourself creates how you feel. So one of the signs I have hung up in my office, and I even have it in a shirt that just says, I am. I'm like, oh, I what I'm doing anywhere of my life. Right. That I just be like, I know this is crazy, and I.

I'm smart, I'm capable, right of like that. I have awesome feeling, totally releases those feel good feelings for me and those chemicals that will create that feeling. So the reason we want to know that is so if we wanna create that confidence with the story we tell ourself because how we feel drives our actions.

And [00:12:00] so it's even interesting. If you've ever had a conversation with your kids or your spouse or somebody close to that, you're like, they didn't know how frustrated I was, and I just think, oh, wow. Are you a wizard? Like everybody can tell when you're really angry or frustrated. Like if I came on this call and I was like, Ugh, I hate talking about homeschooling.

Like I cannot fake it. So I come on these calls and I'm excited and I wanna help everybody. And so when I'm talking about these things, you can see like I'm higher energy and it's super fun and it's exciting, but if I was like feeling dread about being here, my body language would be slumped. Like, I don't know.

Who cares, right? Like you just can't fake those feelings that drive your actions. So that's why we wanna know the story we tell ourselves, create tell. We feel that drives our actions. And those actions are what give us results. And I wanna show you some examples of how this actually works. So we're actually gonna talk about being afraid first.

So if you have a story of, I don't know what [00:13:00] I'm doing. You're probably gonna feel afraid or some other emotion like that. And when you are afraid, a lot of times people avoid. So they check out, and that could be on their phone, it could be sleeping, it could be doing, um, anybody else get really, like if you need to be doing something else, and so you're like, oh, I better start this home project.

I better organize this closet, right? Like, you are doing everything to avoid it, to check out and avoid researching, avoiding all of these things because you're so afraid that you don't know what you're doing. And when you avoid doing those types of things, guess what? You don't figure anything out because you didn't put in the time and effort to do it.

But on the flip side, right, we wanna feel confident. It can be something like, I know I can do this, and you can actually even take some of these stories like, I don't know what I'm doing yet. And even that little word yet can add like, and that's okay. Um, they just kind of give you some grace of like, but I can figure it out.

I'm a very capable person. And you can even think about other things that you figured out in your [00:14:00] life that you didn't think you could figure out before, right? So I know I can do this. Feeling confident. And when you're feeling confident, maybe you're gonna research lots of stuff. You're on this call, so like, that's already awesome.

You're already trying different things. Um. Reading open ed books, getting on their calls, right? Like just, maybe you're like, I don't even know how to operate open ed. Like, but I'm gonna try things and they're great. To message you back really quick because I had lots of questions even on registry, my kids for this fall, right?

And they were really quick. And so be willing to make mistakes, be willing to, um, try new things, whatever that looks like, because you'll do those things from confidence and then you confidently homeschool. Another one. Maybe you're like, I don't wanna feel confident, I wanna feel patient with my kids because like I am really short-tempered with them.

Okay, what do we, like, what's the story you wanna tell yourself? Everything's gonna work out. Um, something that helps me. When my kids were toddlers, it was like, this is typical toddler behavior, right? When they'd have a meltdown in Costco and I'd just be like, [00:15:00] yep. Sometimes two. It doesn't make me a bad mom, it doesn't make my kid a monster, right?

But it helped me to be really patient. So everything is gonna work out. And just when you're in that patient space, you can maybe just be relaxed and you can go at your child's pace, go at your pace. You can come from this point of understanding, right? And that could even be like they, a kid's like, this is stupid and I don't understand math, and why are you making me do this?

Right? And you're like. This isn't a problem. It's a great thought to help with patients. This actually is not a big problem. Right. And so if it's not a problem, it's like, Hey friend, no big deal. Let's just play some games today. And I, that was my favorite trick to do with kids is play games. Uh, but they were always math games and reading games and all of these things, and all of a sudden they're like, oh, math is actually kind of fun.

Oh.

Like being able to go at their pace.

And last one is [00:16:00] my favorite emotion. Excited. That is hands down, my favorite emotion. Um, so something like this is going to be fun. This is going to be amazing. Uh, I can't wait to see what I'm gonna create anything that's gonna create that excitement. So, uh, if, if you like that, not everybody I know is as high energy as I am, so maybe you're like, Meg, I'm good with like calm or something else like that.

Great. Do what works best for you. Um, but what I'm excited, I plan really fun things. We laugh a lot. We do a lot of silly stuff in our homeschool and I love it. Um, we play a lot of games and homeschool them is really fun. So as you are, just even noticing, because you already have stories on repeat, right?

Of like, are there stories that are not serving me? Are there stories that are serving me? And if I confident I. Thinking thoughts and telling stories to help me to create the feeling of confidence to actually practice it and like ways to even cheat it with [00:17:00] confidence is, um, if you'll notice your body language with you're not feeling confident is really like that.

Hunched over that down and even just rolling your shoulders back. All the way back and opening up your chest. And there's really neat, um, stories in, in, uh, I wanna say Jordan Peterson's book 12 Rules for Life, where he talks about that of just we're the only animals that expose our organs, right? Every other animal protects their organs, but when we have that confidence and it releases that dopamine.

Uh, when we, when we straighten up and we stand up tall and we put our shoulders back, it is a little quick hack to feeling confident to then help your body, like, that's right. This is the feeling I want to feel. So, just a fun little thing to help you. So as you're working on feeling whatever you wanna feel, if it's confident, patient excited, joy, um, whatever, love all those fun things, I want to give you a one simple thing.

To help your homeschool with whatever, um, style of education you want to give your kids, [00:18:00] and it's to find what you value. So this may be you're like, what does this have to do with homeschool everything? Because if you value myself, I value adventure. And if there is not an adventure in the horizon, if there's not something fun in our homeschool, then homeschool to me feels off.

It's not very fun anymore, and I'm just going through the motion, like ground hugg day. Like yeah, I show up and I do school every day with my kids, but it's kind of like, oh, I just don't love it. So when you start finding what your val, what you value, you start to feel in line with, like homeschool is going amazing.

Like, I don't know what's different, but it's usually because of what you value is being implemented into your homeschool. So. It guides your decisions about curriculum, activities and schedules. So some people really value family time, so they're like, we don't do a lot of extracurricular activities because we want as much family time as possible.

Somebody else maybe says we value experiences, so we wanna be in all the [00:19:00] extracurricular activities. Um, maybe a family values travel. So they're like, we're gonna figure out how to world school and make this really work. When you know what you value, it helps you prioritize. Prioritize what truly matters over what's just expected, right?

Well, like Susie down the street does this, so I guess I should do that. Um, I've totally fallen into that trap. Somebody I really like Charlotte Mason philosophy, I. Years ago I went to a Charlotte Mason class and, and, uh, this mom was like, everybody needs to read PLU tar. Like, you have to read PLU tar. And I was like, okay.

Kids, like, let's read PLU Tar. I hated it. They hated it. And like they don't even remember it. I don't remember any of the teachings from it because I didn't really value those things. Um, I've even noticed if it's something my husband really values, my husband has his undergrad in linguistics and he speaks a lot of languages.

And so he is like, you should teach the kids all these languages. So I was like, okay. So I tried to teach my kids Greek and we remember some of the words and, and, uh, we know the alphabet still, [00:20:00] but because it wasn't something that I valued. It was really hard for me to keep it going. And it's something that I was able to turn over to him that I said, if you would like to teach the kids a language, you can do it.

And it's been fun because that's been something that like, he actually speaks the languages versus my poor, broken, whatever language I'm trying to do. Um, and he, he's a, like, loves to dive into the grammar and he's so much more fun. And so it's like I gave that subject to dad and he just does it whenever it fits his schedule.

Um, so when you know what, your value reduces overwhelmed in comparison. Because you can see like people doing something that you're like, oh, that looks like really a really fun idea. Maybe I should do that. But if you don't value those things. Then like you can just be like, oh, that's great that Susie's doing those things.

I don't need to 'cause it's not for me. I'm creating a family culture that reflects what's most important to you. So just some things of why knowing what you value is so important and it brings that alignment because you could feel more peaceful because it fits your vision. Again, [00:21:00] not with somebody else's, but it also helps your kids growing up, knowing what your family stands for.

Learning becomes more meaningful and connected to life. And then I love this less guilt over what you are not doing and more joy in what you are doing. Because there are so many options, right? Like every year, even in my own homeschool, I just think there's so many fun things we could study about. So many fun, amazing things that we could learn about.

So when I pick things that align with what I value, then I could find joy in those. Instead of looking at somebody else or thinking, well, maybe I should have done this because I know what I valued. So there are lots of great things to do, um, to find what you value. And I have something like in my 30 days to even into homeschooling, I have like of how to find your values.

I'm sure you could find free ones online as well. But I wanted to give you some ideas that you guys could take away tonight of, to get into what you value. So asking [00:22:00] yourself, and this, you could even re uh, pull this in for every school year of what do you want your kids to remember most about their childhood?

Or you could even do, what do I want 'em to remember about this school year? And so even as I'm working with, I have my 14-year-old and my 8-year-old that will still be homeschooling. And with the 14-year-old, it's like, what do you wanna create? What do you want to do? What do you want to, um, what's important to you?

And, and here's what I would like to do and, and where do we, um, bridge that together so that we could be working this together? And, um, coming up with that. Um, what skills or character traits matter more to you than grades? I'm a huge fan of habits. I like to have my kids' master skills in finances, emotions, mental, physical, social, and spiritual, um, habits.

And so we really focus on those things. And part of the mental is our schooling and our education, right? But I want them to be well-rounded individuals. And so that is something very important to my husband and myself. What brings your family the most joy together? It can be so simple, right? Going [00:23:00] on a walk or breeding together.

Just something that brings joy to your family. And when do you feel most peaceful and connected in your homeschool? And if you're brand new, then thinking about just your home. So like we feel really peaceful. Um, a client today told me around food like that is something that brings our family a lot of joy, is to connect around food.

Um, so anything like that. Okay, so I'm gonna stop sharing and. Let's look through some of your questions. Okay. I'm just kind of going through them. So Brianna says, I love the idea of playing lots of games during homeschool. My kids would love that. Do you just make up or do suggestions on where we find good educational?

Such a great question. Um, Amazon is a really easy one to find games. Um, I have created some of my own, but a lot of ones are just like, uh, like Math Bingo from Amazon. There's one that is, I can see it over there, but I can't see what the name of it is, but it's math tiles and you play it [00:24:00] almost like Bananagrams, but with math.

Um, but sometimes even just Googling. Learning games, you can find some fun ones like that. So, um, you use your open funds for those and they're really awesome. Um, let's see. I.

Okay, so new ones that Kendall answered, I'll probably just skip those ones. What if your kids value different things than you do? This is such a good question. So this is where you kind of wanna bridge the gap. So when they're younger, a lot of times they'll just kind of go with the flow with what you wanna do.

And as they enter in the teen years, that's where you start giving 'em a little bit more of a leeway with their education because they're gonna start knowing what they value and what's important to them. Now your family culture can be, um, like this is what the Thomas family is about and this is what the Thomas family does.

But maybe, um, like I value like that we don't watch certain movies, so I protected those types of movies in my home, but my children could make the choice to watch that a movie I disagree with outside of the home, right? [00:25:00] So like, I'm still gonna protect the home and the family culture. Um, but like for my.

My daughter, who is 17, decided to, that she was just gonna graduate because she really wanted to go to an in-person university because that's what she really valued was something like that. And even though I wanted to keep her home with me another year, she, she like allowing her to make those choices.

So when they're younger, a lot of times you can, they'll just kind of go with you. And it's the teenager years when we work with them that we don't get the, the fighting with them because we are allowing them to kind of figure out what they like, what they enjoy, and what is important to them. Um, I remember I like to have my kids read biographies.

I'm inspiring people and, um, one of my sons said like, can I do sport? He rows like, I love sports and I wanna read a book about Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant and people that were like, just were amazing in sports. And so because he valued, um, athletics so much, like I just found a way that I could find a good book about people who were inspiring that didn't always need to be like a Christian [00:26:00] based book and it didn't need to be a historical book.

Right. Of like, so, so always just finding how we could bridge the.

Let's see. Do you have any tips for homeschooling? An only child? Yes. So that, this is so new to me. So my 8-year-old a lot of times is getting homeschooled. Like an only child. When I started I had five little kids and I was like, wow, I can do group stuff and uh, now I'm doing one. So with one, it really is again, like working on those habits and those flows of like, and then finding out, um.

What do you want it to look like? What do you want the end of this year? What do you wanna create with this? Right? And so, um, do you want to have more connections with other groups? So does that mean that you're gonna get into some co-ops or find some other things that are, um. That you wanna connect with other people?

Um, my little 8-year-old, because he is not truly an only child, I asked him like, what does he want to do? And he was like, I'm good because he has like a, a gym class he [00:27:00] goes to a couple times a week and we have neighborhood kids. And so he was like, I'm good. And then if we could go to the zoo once a week or we could go to the aquarium and do some things like that and goes Totally.

So, um, you just get to like really handpick your kids' education and it. Um, it's like, I don't know. I don't wanna say easy 'cause I know it's maybe your first time, right? But I'm like, for me, I'm like, it's only one kid. You can do what you want and like, spend as much time as you want on any subject because it's not in a rush.

So you go a really, um, let's see. Um, let's see. I did not do a copy of the presentation slides. Um, but I think I could do that. I could give maybe a copy of some of those. Um, let's see. And I can, I totally forgot to have you put the poll in. Um, yeah, maybe we can do that next time. Uh, let's see. Julie said last year was a hot mess with my eighth [00:28:00] grader, and now I'm trying with my third grader.

I'm hoping this will go better. Any tips to limit the burnout of kiddo and the parent child fight of what to do for homework? Okay, so this is a really great question because a lot of people, um. Want to know this. So we really want to create a rhythm and a flow with our home. And part of that is that family culture of like, this is what the Thomas family does.

So in, um, I'll give it to Kendall too, of, I do happy habits of like teaching your kids that we, we do the work, we get paid, we don't do the work, we don't get paid, right? So it's basically like you go have a job, you go to work, you get paid, you don't go to your job, you don't get paid. So it's the same idea with your kid, because I always tell my kids I'm not willing to fight with them.

I'm not going to. So it's like if you have screen time in your house, it's like, okay, you can have screen time when school is done. And I'm not gonna fight with you and like I'm actually gonna practice. Like if you get really grumpy or whatever, I'm just gonna put headphones in and after a couple days they see that you're serious about that, they're gonna start doing that.

So even for my [00:29:00] kids, it's, they have to get up and they have to. Um, so for my 14-year-old, he has to get up and do his chores by a certain time and get all of his school done and then he could get his cell phone. Um, and it's funny, it's just like an old Nokia phone, so it's not even a fancy one, but like, just something like that, that he knows I have to do this in order to get this.

When my kids were even younger, it was like, clean your room and then. Um, little things like this. I know somebody, a friend of mine does like you eat your fruits and veggies during the day. You get a treat at night. So it's just as simple as this. And because we're all motivated by positive and negative consequences, right?

And so if there is no consequence to their choice because you're not gonna fail them and homeschool right? Then what's the point? So, um, you are always working on connection first, right? And really working with your kid. But if they are like a. Not getting their stuff done, then it's like, then you can't go to the neighbor's house, right?

And so putting it in a way where it's like, it's actually a sign. It's up there and it said like, get schoolwork done by a certain time and you can play with the [00:30:00] neighbor kids. You don't get schoolwork done at a certain time. You can't play with the neighbor kids, as simple as that. No fight, no nothing because they know it's expected of them.

Um, at the very beginning, you might have a little bit of fight as your kids learn like, okay, mom actually means what she says. Uh, but eventually they just start learning like, this is how things are. I'll do one more question and we're out of time. I just wanna honor all of your time. Um, let's see. Okay, so last question.

Kami says, any suggestions for homeschooling with small children at home or making lessons applicable to children of different ages? I have a five, three and a 1-year-old, so. My own opinion is I wouldn't be doing a lot of school with kids that young, like life is school. So playing with a lot of puzzles, playing a lot of games, including them, um, singing songs, having fun, counting steps when you go down something.

Doing a lot of read alouds. Um, a 3-year-old and a one-year-old don't really need to sit for a lesson or anything. So if you wanna do [00:31:00] something with your five-year-old or you're practicing writing letters, and if your, uh, three Yearold wants to, I would let 'em participate. But if they don't want to, I don't.

Um, I'm a really big fan of. Like those zero to seven of really working on habits and that connection piece and exposing 'em to a lot of educational things. Right? So a ton of read alouds, a ton of learning games. And then as they get ready, they'll start asking you like, I want more. And then when they hit eight to 11, eight to 12, it's uh, Thomas Jefferson calls it the.

The love of learning phase where they're like, I wanna know more. Please tell me more. Like, I've gotta know about this. And so when you are really just like, kindling, this, those younger ages of learning is fun. Reading all the picture books going on, nature walks, maybe then looking up the, um, insect that you saw, taking pictures of it, utilizing museums, and just really playing and letting them be with you.

With you, cleaning with you is as annoying as that can feel [00:32:00] sometimes. They're going to learn so much. By just being with you, that then there we will be ready to naturally want to learn. Um, like I said, I'm not willing to fight my kids and so, uh, like I just, I've done it seven times and it works for me and it works for all my clients.

I've really just easing into it. And I, I just saw a post today about Finland that they actually wait till about seven to eight years old to even really start structured education. And underneath that. Getting outside, it's playing a lot of games, it's connecting with nature, it's learning good habits, right?

And so doing some of those things. So at that young of age, I would just play. Okay, thank you. I, I wanna wrap up so that, um, I'll just turn it back over to Kendall. So I will, would she emails out. I will let you guys know. Do you have any more questions? Um, how to get ahold of me? I was gonna, I'll give you the free download link for Happy Habits, and then I'll also create something for the slideshow notes.

Thank you all for being here. Awesome. Thank you so much, [00:33:00] Meg, for this session. We love having you and are so grateful for you to, to come and speak to us. So thank you so much. Thank you everybody for joining. Um, if you have any questions, I will send out the recording as Meg said, and a couple resources. So thank you so much.

Bye y'all. Thank you.

> "How do I feel confident? It's as simple as the story you tell yourself. So if you are telling yourself that you're inadequate, you'll never be smart about this, like you can never figure it out, you're not going to feel very good. Because whatever story you tell yourself, your brain releases chemicals and creates a physical sensation in your body. So the story you tell yourself creates how you feel. And so it's even interesting. If you've ever had a conversation with your kids or your spouse or somebody close to that, you're like, they didn't know how frustrated I was, and I just think, oh, wow. Are you a wizard? Like everybody can tell when you're really angry or frustrated. Like if I came on this call and I was like, Ugh, I hate talking about homeschooling. Like I cannot fake it. So I come on these calls and I'm excited and I wanna help everybody. And so when I'm talking about these things, you can see like I'm higher energy and it's super fun and it's exciting, but if I was like feeling dread about being here, my body language would be slumped. Like, I don't know. Who cares, right? Like you just can't fake those feelings that drive your actions."

We have the internet, we have smart phones, and we have Alexas and Google Homes and all the other things. And now with Chat GPT, with one of my big kids with math, if we're doing a math lesson and he'll be like, 'But why? But why is this?'
