    Hi there. Hi. How's it going?  
      
      
      
    Good.  
      
      
      
    How are you?  
      
      
      
    I'm doing great. It's great to finally meet you.  
    Thanks. Yeah.  
      
      
      
    I feel like I kind of know you because of the video  
    and then also just your presence on the event and  
    stuff. And also, you're kind of everywhere, which is  
    awesome.  
      
      
      
    Well, I don't know about that kind of on Instagram,  
    but I appreciate it.  
      
      
      
    So a little context. I know that we kind of shared a  
    little bit, but me and Charlie, I know that you know  
    Charlie a little bit. I don't know if you've ever met  
    him over a meeting, though. Have you or not?  
      
      
      
    We met, like, right before the Zoom call that we did  
    with empowered parents. We were chatting for just a  
    few minutes before we got on air. So I don't know.  
    Were you. You were on that call. Did I talk to you  
    beforehand or just. Were you observing? Okay.  
      
      
      
    Yeah, I was observing. So we're basically picking up  
    my tech high from the marketing side of things, and  
    we're. I mean, the business has incredibly been all  
    word of mouth for so long that now we're coming into  
    it and saying, okay, how can we make this bigger? How  
    can we help other parents? So, like, people that do  
    and do not know about my tech high to understand the  
    ideas behind an open, personalized education for  
    children, and then how can we best serve parents? So  
    there's a lot of room where I think the existing  
    company has done a really good job, but there's also  
    a lot of room where the company definitely needs some  
    help in, for example, supporting parents. Helping  
    parents to understand exactly how to do things. It's  
    been extremely apparent to me coming into this that a  
    lot of parents help each other, which is so, so, so  
    great. But, like, that's where I kind of want to come  
    in and see, like, where's the opportunity for us to  
    help both parents connect with other parents? And  
    then also, where is the opportunity for us to help  
    parents to deliver the education that they want for  
    their children? So that's a little bit of context on  
    perfect.  
      
      
      
    Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, I would say. You're  
    exactly right. We all mentor each other in the  
    program.  
      
      
      
    So how long can you. So how long exactly have you  
    been a parent of my tech high? And I know your story  
    a little bit, but, like, just to kind of go backwards  
    a little bit, because I love, like, context on that  
    transition.  
      
      
      
    Yep, absolutely. So we were in public school in fall  
    of 2019 with my first graders, and we pulled them out  
    in November. So that. So I was able to, like, somehow  
    get in that mid year enrollment for January. I hadn't  
    even planned on it exactly, but then I had. My friend  
    was like, Oh, yeah. You should look into this. And I  
    bet you could get it in right now. And so I, like,  
    applied, and since she had already done it, I was  
    very like, it was just my next door neighbor. And I  
    think I had said that on the call. So to be honest, I  
    would have been really, I don't think I would have  
    done it if I hadn't known she had already gone  
    through it. Right.  
      
      
      
    Because program itself, or like personalized  
    education, like taking that on program itself.  
      
      
      
    So we were already going to homeschool, and then my  
    tech high was the benefit.  
      
      
      
    Nice.  
      
      
      
    But I would say that knowing now this is an older  
    platform, I don't know if you knew this, but I mean,  
    they just redid it all last year. Right. So it's  
    really difficult to wrap your head around. And for a  
    couple reasons. One is, I would say most people are  
    just so used to, I mean, if you're transitioning from  
    public education, that's just kind of how your  
    mindset is. Like, this is the way that it's done, and  
    so there's a learning curve when you're doing  
    something new. And so coming into my tech high, my  
    first thought is, and the issue that I've seen even  
    continued through this last year and the program of  
    the, you know, with the reformatting of the website  
    and stuff is people don't quite know what to expect.  
    And that's really important. And so what we just do  
    is it's kind of like, well, she did it and she's done  
    okay. And this is kind of the main points. And then,  
    okay, I trust you, and then I'll get in and learn  
    about it. But like, for example, in fact, I just had  
    a friend this week who has been homeschooling for  
    five years. She's used tech trap. She's used harmony  
    because she's moved in different states. She's come  
    back to Utah. So she's coming back to my tech high.  
    And she was just like, I've had my head in so many  
    programs, I needed a refresher on budget, what they  
    require for submissions. And none of that, you can't  
    see any of that until you're, like, in the parent  
    link. And I think that that's where I see the biggest  
    issue is there's a lot of really good information in  
    that parent link, but we need to move some of that  
    out front. I just, real quick, before I jumped on the  
    call, I went on the website and I would say my  
    feedback is, let me see if I can pull it back up. The  
    very first, you know, place if you were to say, like,  
    how it works, because I'm like, oh, I'm trying to  
    learn this program. How's it works? And the first  
    thing that pops up is the schedule builder. Right?  
    And there's a couple things I'll say about that. One  
    is it's intimidating for new parents, especially if  
    they're just starting homeschool. They're like, wait,  
    I have to have a schedule to homeschool, right? I can  
    see why the schedule builder's there, but I don't  
    know if that really needs to be the first thing that  
    they seed. They want to know, like, well, what is  
    this program? What required of me is the parenthood.  
    What, you know, what are the benefits for me for  
    coming into this? I mean, everybody knows the  
    benefits is the finances, and that's it. I'm like,  
    you don't even really see that. And I don't know if  
    that's done purposely because you guys can't  
    advertise that or something. I'm like, we don't see  
    it. So, yeah, that's kind of my first. Kind of my  
    first initial thoughts with some of that, you know,  
    the experience coming into it. So my experience,  
    yeah, kind of going back to the question was just, my  
    friend helped walk me through it, and so I was able  
    to trust her. And then once I got in there, it took a  
    minute to wrap my head around it, but I'm very detail  
    oriented and can piece it together, so that's  
    awesome.  
      
      
      
    Yeah, a lot of changes are coming very soon, so you  
    can bet on that. And I agree. So my background is in  
    marketing and technology, so software, all of that  
    stuff. And there's a heavy emphasis on value upfront.  
    Like, what is the value upfront? And can somebody  
    understand your value proposition by landing on the  
    website?  
      
      
      
    And just like, so you probably see that you don't  
    need me to tell you. I would just say that's always  
    the first issue. When people come to me, they're  
    like, I don't get what this is, but I know you say I  
    can get money out of it, so how do I do it?  
      
      
      
    Yeah, exactly. That's something that we're fixing.  
    What was going through your head as a new homeschool  
    parent? Kind of like, what was your mindset? You  
    know, what were your questions? What were you trying  
    to, you know, figure out? And, like, what were the  
    things that were bothering you as a new homeschool  
    parent?  
      
      
      
    Yeah, I would say the number one thing, and I would  
    bet most people, from what I've talked about, is  
    overwhelm. Right. So if there's a way that you can  
    kind of help people feel reassured, that's. That's  
    the biggest thing, is, hey, we're going to take care  
    of you and kind of take some of that overwhelm. Um,  
    you know, some guidance. Uh, I would say there's.  
    There's a huge fear of failure. Right. Like, not  
    entirely sure if this is really going to work out.  
    Um, a heavy responsibility, which is probably part  
    of, um, the overwhelm. Um, there's also excitement,  
    though. I would. I love the idea. I mean, what I was  
    really drawn to is the freedom. Right. So when we  
    talk about, let's see, what was the. I wrote it down  
    so I wouldn't forget. What was that wording that you  
    used? Your kind of open, personalized education? That  
    seems like kind of. I think Charlie used that word,  
    too, somewhere, is, you know, there's all these  
    possibilities. You know, they're endless in an  
    infinity almost amount. So, yeah, I mean, there's a  
    huge appeal to that. But of course, with that comes  
    overwhelmed. There's kind of a healthy balance  
    between the two.  
      
      
      
    Yeah. What kinds of things were overwhelming?  
    Because, like, I've heard from parents that, like you  
    mentioned the fear, right? The fear that you're going  
    to either do it wrong. Or, like, it wasn't a good  
    idea to start with. And there is a pretty large  
    homeschool community, especially in Utah, a pretty  
    large, like, self directed learning community. But  
    it's still something that's not the most popular  
    option. It's still a little bit new, a little bit,  
    you know, I don't want to say fringe, but, like, it's  
    still something that people are, you know, trying to  
    figure out if it's legit. There's tons, tons of,  
    like, old school ideas about what homeschooling is.  
    Absolutely. That's not what it is. You know, that's  
    not how it is anymore. Primarily because of the  
    Internet, primarily because we're more connected than  
    ever before. Primarily because what these parents and  
    what you as a parent were looking for was the  
    flexibility, the personalization. Like, you're  
    looking for all of these things and you want to make  
    sure that you actually get them. So was that like,  
    the biggest part of the overwhelm, or was it, was it  
    everything put together? It was like the making sure  
    that, you know, this was actually a good idea, the  
    trying to figure out how to navigate the program,  
    trying to figure out, like, it was it all of it kind  
    of put together.  
      
      
      
    As a parent, I would say my tech high itself, I mean,  
    is a piece of many pieces. Trying to figure out  
    curriculum, trying to figure out where your kids are  
    at and how you're going to help them progress. Right.  
    Especially just balancing all of life as a mother,  
    you know, if the mother or the father, whoever is  
    going to be, it's that balance of you're already have  
    a lot on your plate and you also, maybe you have, I  
    mean, especially as I've grown on Instagram and kind  
    of had that kind of side gig, it's like, I'm also  
    working now. So there's a balance of working and  
    making sure that the kids, oh, you know, probably  
    with the overwhelm, is that kind of that idea of,  
    like, falling behind. Right. You know, like that's a  
    common phrase. And it's hard because a lot of people  
    will say, well, they're the home school community  
    will kind of say, like, there's no such thing as  
    behind. But I mean, at the end of the day, there  
    still is because we live in a community that is the  
    wording that's established. You know, if you go to  
    the gas station, somebody says, oh, what grade are  
    you in? We still live in that culture. So there's  
    certainly that kind of pressure that comes with  
    overwhelming to make sure kids are on grade level or  
    progressing, balancing work, life home  
    responsibilities. So. Yeah.  
      
      
      
    What's that like as a mother? Trying to figure out  
    the balance portion of it all?  
      
      
      
    Oh, that's a good question. You know, it's just kind  
    of like anything else. Do you have kids?  
      
      
      
    I do not know.  
      
      
      
    Well, when you have kids, you just. You just have to  
    get in there and try. Things out, right? Like, figure  
    out what works, what doesn't work. And about the time  
    you. This is what I always say. I say this all the  
    time on Instagram, about the time you get it all  
    figured out and you try new schedules, new routines,  
    new curriculums, or mess things, you know, turn  
    things around. Your kids are changing and adapting  
    and growing, and so everything, you kind of have to  
    change with that. So. So you have to be really  
    flexible in your kids and kind of seeing where  
    they're at and helping them just enough to help them  
    continue to progress.  
      
      
      
    Yeah. What kinds of things keep you up at night?  
    Like, right now, what are the things that are kind  
    of, like, on your mind most?  
      
      
      
    Well, this part with homeschooling, I feel very  
    comfortable. I don't. I mean, at this stage, I feel  
    very good about where we're at. I'm very confident.  
    That's probably why I share a lot about it. I'm very  
    passionate about it. I already have a background in  
    education, and it's already kind of been my life's  
    path to go this direction, I would say. So what keeps  
    me up at night is, like, more like work and Instagram  
    and that kind of stress. My other things, taking care  
    of my house and balancing all of that. Homeschool is  
    a very happy place for me, and so it's not something  
    that I worry about. Do you want me to try to answer  
    that question more as a new homeschool mom?  
      
      
      
    You can. I mean, like, I bet also, there. There are  
    different types of homeschool parents, so, like, it's  
    not gonna be a one size fits all situation anyways.  
    But, like, as somebody who has such a good grasp on  
    the homeschool community and who, you know, is  
    talking to parents consistently, um, what are things  
    that you're finding that they are struggling with  
    and. Or that they are trying to understand more?  
    Because, um, like, I want to start connecting  
    information to people. So it's like, I don't know if  
    you know, Sandy Grant, but she has a lot of, like,  
    resources, and I was asking her about those  
    resources.  
      
      
      
    Who's she with? Is she with, um, homeschool hub?  
      
      
      
    Cindy.  
      
      
      
    Did you say Cindy? Sandy. Oh, Sandy. Okay. No, I  
    think.  
      
      
      
    I think she's a part of a couple of Facebook groups,  
    and she manages them, but she's also just a  
    homeschool parent that helps other homeschool  
    parents. And, like, yeah, there are so many  
    homeschool parents that are just so willing to share  
    what they've learned with other parents that it's,  
    like. It's actually incredible to me getting into  
    this community and starting to see that. But, like,  
    what are the things that you're noticing on the  
    ground level right now that are, like, these are  
    like, the fundamental things, but then also maybe  
    even more trend related to, like, maybe AI related or  
    like, are there things that, that parents are making  
    known to you as concerns? I.  
      
      
      
    Concerns probably same things that we kind of talked  
    about as far as, I mean, people's main concerns is  
    what will other people think of us still? Is that  
    that insecurity, walking into something new and they  
    either grow out of that or continue to have that  
    insecurity, probably. I mean, I think if else, for  
    me, when we talk about socialization, that's always  
    something that's going to come up. I feel like I've  
    seen that even change in the last couple of years.  
    Once you're in the community, you don't worry about  
    it as much. But coming that transition from one way  
    of thinking to another, like sometimes I almost, and  
    maybe it's just because I'm so much in this  
    community, but like, sometimes if somebody outside of  
    my normal family and friends, somebody I don't know,  
    says something about social, is socializing my kids  
    or something, I'm just like, oh, I forgot. People  
    still think this way because it's so far removed at  
    this point. But I know that's still a really big  
    issue for people coming in is making sure that their  
    kids have social skills and what that looks like and  
    how, for me, how that it basically can just look  
    different than what we've previously known, right? We  
    have really evolved. Our social skills are so much  
    more technology based. I mean, we see huge with  
    social media and so obviously with our kids, we're  
    not encouraging that at a young age or anything, but  
    doing our best to still give our kids, you know, I  
    think it's really, really important to have social  
    skills. So we want to make that a priority still, you  
    know.  
      
      
      
    Did you and your children ever utilize the clubs or  
    events or, like, community things that my tech I had,  
    we did not.  
      
      
      
    I would say I don't know anybody that ever has  
    because everybody probably in my scope of influence,  
    we all are friends. And so we're using, again, it's  
    kind of that word of mouth where I have seen it and  
    also just kind of observing a little bit of people  
    who have used tech trep, which I know you guys, it's  
    now transitioned and it's separate, but a similar  
    program in other states is, I see more rural people  
    using that. Right. Like, if you're not out and have  
    the opportunity to meet a lot of people, Utah, again,  
    is also very different since we have the religious  
    culture, it's just so easy for us to connect and we  
    already kind of feel safe, whereas outside of that,  
    where you're kind of deciding whether or not it's  
    almost kind of like shopping for friends. Right. And  
    so. So I can see where those can be really  
    beneficial, probably more in rural areas. I don't  
    know even what the attendance is like here in Utah,  
    but it hasn't been to me.  
      
      
      
    That's an interesting topic to me specifically,  
    because, like, I know that we don't want to be a  
    school, right? Like, we don't want to pretend to be a  
    school. We're not a school. Parents want to do their  
    own thing, and that's why they are sending them to my  
    tech high. But also, there is an aspect of school  
    that's fun, which is the social component and, like,  
    the club's component, and the learning with other  
    people. And I wonder if there's a better way for us  
    to do clubs and events that get people excited,  
    because I think we're barely tapping into the  
    potential inside of that. I don't know if it's, like,  
    more in person components. So it's not just, you  
    know, a. An online kind of a thing. But  
    hypothetically, what would have gotten you interested  
    in clubs, you know, events, anything external or,  
    like, community?  
      
      
      
    Something interest based that my kids. I have a son  
    who's really into stem. We're getting him a 3d  
    printer this year with our funds. We're super excited  
    about that. But I have had a hard time finding  
    somebody that's close. I mean, we're Mapleton, so  
    it's something that's interest based and close.  
    Right. And I would love communities and close and  
    being involved in things like that, but for us, it's  
    like, I feel like there's also. There's a lot more  
    things in, like, I don't know where you're at in Salt  
    Lake or Utah county, but northern Utah county is  
    pretty good. And Salt Lake, I feel like it has more  
    opportunities, but once you kind of pass american  
    fork, it just kind of dwindles, so. Because there's  
    just not as much down here, which is why we're here,  
    but so, yeah, convenience location. We are not  
    everybody's different, but I just feel like kids,  
    especially elementary kids, they don't want to be  
    sitting at a computer, right. So we want to get them  
    out and moving. Maybe it can be beneficial if, you  
    know, but to connect with kids, it's like. Well, what  
    I found, as far as one thing that's very helpful, and  
    this is kind of a twofold, is especially kind of  
    having my own homeschool groups and stuff, is if you  
    can have the parents know each other and the  
    relationship is there with the parents, then the kids  
    are going to have a relationship. Right. But if my  
    kid is talking with some person on Zoom that I don't  
    really know the likelihood of me ever communicating  
    with them outside of that and building a  
    relationship, which is what I want for my socialize.  
    For my kid to be socialized, it needs to be somebody  
    I know and trust and say, hey, let's get together.  
    I'm friends with you. Let's meet up, and we can go to  
    this club or this event together.  
      
      
      
    Yeah. Have you found the program to be easy to  
    navigate? I know that we do learning logs. I know  
    that we have teachers and kind of like, leads. Have  
    you enjoyed those aspects of the program? Or, like,  
    what aspects of the program do you enjoy most? And do  
    you not enjoy most?  
      
      
      
    Oh, yeah. I mean, I think it's all. It's fine, right.  
    Like, I mean, there isn't anything that, like, I  
    think once you learn it, it was a learning curve to  
    change, obviously, from last year, a few hiccups and  
    stuff along the way, but it's been fine. It's not  
    anything that I'm, like, would do differently or. I  
    felt good about it. Yeah.  
      
      
      
    And do you feel like, um, we do a good job of  
    balancing the involved and not involved? Because I  
    feel like that's a tough thing.  
      
      
      
    Yeah, that is a tough thing. That's why I would say,  
    like, parents really need to be reassured right up  
    front with the program that this isn't a government  
    overreach. Right. There's, there's just. It's. And  
    it's interesting. I didn't feel like that until I got  
    into the homeschool community.  
      
      
      
    Interesting.  
      
      
      
    What do you mean? Which was kind of an interesting  
    thing because for me, and maybe it's because I have  
    an education background, I understood state  
    standards. I didn't mind them. I thought it's good  
    for our kids to have. Have an idea of where they  
    should be at. I enjoy in the homeschool community  
    that there's not a pressure to keep them at a certain  
    level. But I want my kids to learn and grow, and I'm  
    really big in development milestones and, and seeing  
    that progression. And at around, you know, five, six,  
    they can start to read, not ten or eleven. Right.  
    Like, I kind of like, you know, things like that  
    where. And so I don't. I don't know if that's just  
    because that I can't. I was too. Had too much of an  
    educational background. But it wasn't until I got in  
    here and I could kind of see kind of that struggle of  
    people wanting more and more freedom that I realized  
    that this was such a big deal for people. And then  
    also kind of breaking away from that mindset that,  
    oh, it didn't have to be by fourth grade, we're doing  
    this. But it's, you know, I still want my kids to do.  
    And for me personally, I still. I think I mentioned  
    this, like, it's important to me because I don't want  
    my kids all at a church event or outside of the  
    homeschool community and be the only ones that can't  
    do something, you know, or feel like, because to me,  
    that just hurts their confidence. So I'm like, I want  
    to kind of keep up with the social standard in that  
    aspect, but there's. Yeah, there's kind of a balance  
    between the two worlds and, you know, making it work.  
      
      
      
    Yeah, 100%. As both an educator and a parent. What is  
    that balance, though? Because, like, we want to be  
    active on social media, and we want to help parents  
    to help their kids, and we want to educate parents,  
    but, um, we don't want to seem like, you know, we're  
    telling parents what to do or that there's only one  
    way to do things, because there's not, but. But like  
    you said, it's kind of nice to see the developmental  
    milestones. It's kind of nice to see your kid  
    progressing. It's kind of like an indicator of  
    success. At what point should you make sure that your  
    kid can do XYZ? Or how can we support you in these  
    things without even explicitly saying that?  
      
      
      
    I love a really good, I mean, let's turn this to  
    state testing, right? People either love it or hate  
    it, so. But it's optional, right? Provide the  
    information to support. Use words like encourage and  
    optional versus force or make sure you have to, or  
    all kids at this level, you know, things like that.  
    Sometimes it's just in the wording of, here's general  
    guidelines to help support you as the parent.  
    Optional. Right.  
      
      
      
    But still, I love that. Yeah. I literally love that  
    so much. I think, I think that's accurate. And then  
    so along the same lines of community, it seems as  
    though this is something we've noticed. It seems as  
    though in some communities, my tech high communities,  
    there are a lot of people complaining about things  
    and, or, like, the, the prevailing tone is not  
    positive and optimistic, and I think that that needs  
    to change over time. How do you, as a parent, you  
    know, who is on the ground, who's talking to other  
    parents, how do you see that being something that we  
    can take more control of? And, or, like, what would  
    you recommend to us as opposed to, you know, like, I  
    don't want to, like, again, we're not some  
    bureaucracy. Like, we're not trying to go in there  
    and be all crazy. But also we would love to change  
    the sentiment to being more positive, to be more  
    uplifting, to being more exciting.  
      
      
      
    That's such a good question. My personal opinion is  
    our people are just really entitled in general.  
    Right. I've especially seen that with the Utah fits  
    all scholarship come out. It's really sad to me that  
    we see when funds and money, it seems maybe the  
    connection is with money, you know? So since my tech  
    high is giving me this money, then I deserve this.  
    And I'm like, that's not how it works. Right. They're  
    here to support us. And I'm so grateful for that.  
    Right? Like, I'm so grateful. There's a lot of  
    states, and maybe I see this more in my perspective  
    on it. There's a lot of states that don't do this,  
    and it's, it's really regulated. And so I feel  
    really, really grateful to live in Utah. So that's a  
    hard question, is how to address. Maybe the  
    entitlement is that maybe the word that you might use  
    to describe the negativity that you guys have seen?  
      
      
      
    Honestly, I think that's a really. Good word. Um, I  
    don't, I think, yeah, I think that, like, I can't  
    speak for anybody's reasons. I don't know why certain  
    parents are more critical, but I think the problem  
    is, is when critical parents hurt the experience of  
    new parents. And that's something that we really  
    don't want to see anymore of if we can help it, just  
    because, you know, like you said, these parents who  
    are coming in new are already questioning a lot of  
    things. They're already confused, they're already  
    overwhelmed.  
      
      
      
    And, like, yeah, probably another word that's coming  
    to my mind is a lack of trust. So what can you guys  
    do to build trust for the parents? Right. We're  
    seeing this a lot coming off of 2020 just in general  
    with our society. Right. We just don't trust anybody.  
    I don't trust the news. I'm very careful about where  
    I go, the government leaders coming in, and I feel  
    like we're probably seeing, and we'll continue to  
    see, and it'll probably just get heated. Continue to  
    be heated. So what, you know, that's probably the  
    biggest question is, you know, what, what can we do  
    to trust people? My, my opinion, one thing with my  
    tech high is a spokesman. Right. There's, my tech  
    high is all web based. There's no personal  
    connection. I can't call somebody and talk to them on  
    the phone. I do know that it was very reassuring for  
    me to get on the parent webinar, and that is  
    something that I've encouraged people. And once I  
    could get in there and ask my questions, that was  
    very, very helpful. But moving that up to, so if  
    you're going to continue to use that webinar and that  
    platform, let's get it. So that's the first people  
    see, like, hey, here's the faqs, or here's what our  
    program is. Here's faqs. Then get on this webinar.  
      
      
      
    Mm hmm. I love the way you think about this. One of  
    the things that we do want to, want to bring in is  
    more active individuals across every single platform.  
    So people get to know the people that are running  
    things behind the scenes just because tech high for a  
    long time has been a logo. And that's it. And if  
    people can get to know people, it's a lot harder to  
    treat other people poorly. And then also when people  
    have questions, you go to certain people, people are  
    building people. You go to community events or park  
    days, and you're seeing these people, and it's just  
    like it has a compounding effect as opposed to just a  
    logo, for example.  
      
      
      
    That's where your trust right now, my tech ties trust  
    is between the parents. So when you have a positive  
    parent, it's great. When you have a negative  
    parenthood, it goes the other direction.  
      
      
      
    What does that. So what would that look like as a  
    parent? I would love your opinion on this. What would  
    that look like as a parent? Involved in communities  
    and involved in groups, building trust with somebody  
    who works. For the company, like, do you just provide  
    value? Are you consistently active? I mean, I know  
    that this is all language that you understand well  
    just because you run your instagram, but, like, are  
    you just consistently active, you know, commenting,  
    consistently, supporting questions like, what is the  
    best way to build trust as a part of my tech high,  
    but also as a part of these groups, because as an  
    outsider coming in who's not a parenthood, like,  
    that's already kind of something that people aren't.  
    Like people want to learn from, people who have been  
    to the places that they're trying to go, you know,  
    not people who have never been there before.  
      
      
      
    Yep. Yeah. I think an open door with lots of  
    questions and being very quick to respond to those  
    questions. Right. We're very much into a society  
    where people want answers. Now, for example, after  
    our Zoom call a few weeks ago, I did have a question  
    come in. She said, I watched the webinar and she had  
    all these other questions. Unfortunately, I missed  
    it. And I only just saw it yesterday, actually. But I  
    noticed it was sent two or three weeks ago. So that  
    was that first, like, hey, I watched this and now I  
    have more questions. Can you help me again? It's  
    interesting. They didn't go to you guys. Why did they  
    come to me? Right. And I don't know if it was because  
    she went through my feed to you guys, but it's kind  
    of that parent. So it's being able to respond to  
    those questions. There's probably a sense of trust  
    just, again, because it's a person that they're  
    seeing all the time and actively involved in that in  
    the social world. Right.  
      
      
      
    So, yeah, I think that's so true. Last question that  
    I have for you. What information do you want to see  
    us providing to parents? We're going to be starting a  
    newsletter. We're going to be starting content. We're  
    kind of through the lens of open education. So we  
    want this to be for my tech high parents, for people  
    that are much, much broader than my tech high parents  
    as well. So just evangelizing the category and  
    saying, hey, there's a new way to do things. And it's  
    personalized education because every child is unique.  
    They're not standard, and there are opportunities,  
    but most people don't know about them.  
      
      
      
    Yeah, absolutely. The biggest thing for me, I think I  
    said this on the call, was just seeing a different  
    way. So helping people dream probably, right. Kind of  
    this idea of like, hey, there's, you know, what do  
    you, what do we say? Creating a vision for people.  
    Help them create it. Internally so that they can say,  
    hey, when I sat down with my neighbor, I could see  
    what she had done. And I'm like, oh, and this is  
    exactly what I said on the call. There's another way  
    to do this because it's like a blind tunnel. And so  
    if you can kind of borrow other people's lights and  
    help them, give them some vision. So, I don't know,  
    highlighting maybe kids and. Their experiences, the  
    parents and the, and their experiences so that people  
    can kind of get like real, you know, real stories  
    coming out of it. So I love that.  
      
      
      
    Thank you so much for your time. And also, it's so  
    cool to meet like, good parents who are just crushing  
    it with their kids education. So thank you for, you  
    know, just be happy to help.  
      
      
      
    We really have been blessed with my tech guy. So I  
    hope I, I hope more, more people. One last thought I  
    had for you was there's also kind of a big disconnect  
    I've seen with Utah fits all in my tech high. This  
    fear of my tech high going away is definitely there  
    for those who may not want to use Utah fits all. But  
    you guys are also vendors and you have your, my tech  
    high direct classes. So again, maybe more education  
    on that is helping, helping more kids or more parents  
    kind of see what the difference is, what unique  
    things you can offer through both different avenues.  
    Right?  
      
      
      
    I love that. Thank you again.  
      
      
      
    Great to chat with you. Yeah, you bet.  
      
      
      
    And I think Charlie wanted to eventually have you on  
    the podcast just because you are incredible and have  
    a lot of insight. So we'll be getting in touch with  
    you about that if you're interested.  
      
      
      
    Great. Tell me more about the podcast. Is it just, is  
    it going to be my tech high podcast, like, to support  
    parents kind of ideas to with home education or what  
    is it specified on tech stuff or what is it about?  
      
      
      
    So basically, as we are kind of evolving in a lot of  
    directions, the podcast is going to be very similar  
    to what I was saying before, where we want to educate  
    parents on a lot of. A lot of things. So number one,  
    that there are more opportunities, that there are  
    more things and possibilities out, you know, in the  
    world, what we do specifically. And then also we want  
    to highlight people that are already succeeding. So  
    it's going to be a mix of highlighting people that  
    are succeeding, showcasing stories, giving people  
    tactics like how do you succeed? And then also more  
    on a philosophical level, like, why is this so  
    important that, you know, we move the world toward a  
    more kind of like open education kind of a world  
    rethinkers. Exactly. Exactly. So it's going to be,  
    it's going to be both high level and hopefully on the  
    ground as well. So perfect.  
      
      
      
    Yeah, I love that. I think that'll be a great way to  
    continue to build trust. So. Yeah.  
      
      
      
    Yeah, I love it. And then we'll also have people that  
    people can point to.  
      
      
      
    Yes, absolutely. Yep. Great. Well, thank you. Thanks  
    for your time. And I'm excited to see how things  
    unfold yeah, you as well.  
      
      
      
    Thank you so much.  
      
      
      
    Bye.  
      
      
      
    We'll see you later.
