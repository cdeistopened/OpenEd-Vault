# Podcast Planning Notes: SNHU and My Tech High Partnership

- Brian Boss (AVP of Community Partners) will likely be the SNHU representative
- The podcast should aim to be informative and engaging even for those not considering enrollment
- SNHU has physical campuses but also offers online programs

## Key Talking Points/Keywords

- Competency-Based Education (CBE)
- SNHU (Southern New Hampshire University) - pronounced "Snoo"
- My Tech High partnership (5-6 years old)
- Community partners model
- Early college experience
- Self-paced learning
- Asynchronous education
- Affordability
- Flexibility in education
- Success rates in CBE
- Demographics served (87% black or brown learners)
- Subscription-based model
- Unlimited course progression (compared to time-bound programs)

## Guardrails

- Be careful with out-of-date data
- Avoid misrepresenting what's possible (e.g., don't imply all students will finish degrees extremely quickly)
- Focus on the academic experience of CBE rather than specific outcomes
- Avoid disparaging other educational institutions or models

## Ideas

- Include student stories to provide real-life examples - talk with Emmeline about some success stories of a student who went through the program.
- Discuss the characteristics of successful CBE students:
    - Intrinsic motivation
    - Time management skills
    - Excitement about the learning environment
- Compare CBE to traditional education models without being negative
- Explore the concept of learner empowerment in CBE
- Discuss how CBE prepares students for the real world (marketable skills)
- Mention the potential for high school students to earn college credits or degrees
- Talk about the support systems in place for CBE students
