The word classical has a lot of different meanings.

Classical music.

Classical architecture.

Classical literature.

Classical education emphasizes the trivium: grammar, logic, and rhetoric.

But where did this concept actually come from?

The roots of classical education can be traced back to ancient Greece and Rome, where these disciplines were considered essential for cultivating a well-rounded and informed citizenry. Over time, this educational framework was adopted and adapted by medieval scholars and has continued to influence educational practices to this day.

But who were the actual figures in modern times associated with revival of the classical education?

One notable figure is Dorothy Sayers, who in her essay "The Lost Tools of Learning" advocated for a return to the classical model. Another influential figure is Mortimer J. Adler, who promoted the Great Books program and emphasized the importance of reading classical texts.

Parents might wonder how classical education prepares children for the future. It’s less practical than a coding bootcamp.

However, classical education aims to develop critical thinking, effective communication, and a deep understanding of human nature and the world—skills that are valuable in any field. By engaging with timeless works and ideas, students learn to analyze complex issues and articulate their thoughts clearly.

If You his 3rd grade teacher took him from watching cartoons every afternoon to his bedroom with a book.  
And I There's nothing more beautiful than that.  
And this this kiddo, I just really fell in love with him, and his little perseverant heart.  
And just the way he fell in love with the plastics was fantastic, and we did that in the online setting.  
So Yes.  
They're a little quiet, so I was trying to figure out what was going on here.  
Tess, That's alright.  
I, I'm just noticing it's It's little different than what it used to.  
So I'm moving cameras and figuring things out so it looks better.  
I think I'm good now.  
Hello.  
Love it.  
I think that's wonderful.  
I I let me I think I said this 4 of them Really great 4 Hello?  
Tithe tai helping us This office So helping us put the I love it.  
Are you sure these ones probably Sydney, Strange that.  
Is that better?  
K.  
I have a microphone, I mean, directly in front of me here.  
Hope Hopefully, it picks it up well.  
Yeah.  
Herveis?  
Yeah.  
Go in 5 4, 3, I'm here in Utah with where most of our my tech high students are at.  
Oh, Just for Yeah.  
Absolutely.  
So, textbook 3 hearts, new faculty orientation answer of that.  
Is, a classical liberal arts steep our students in What is most about western civilization Right.  
We expose them to all of the better Good.  
True, and beautiful.  
Each content area is Equally as an as the next Art is every bit as important As ELA, as math, as science, History and it's built on the Trivium Right.  
And a lot of our students, a lot of our scholars are in that grammar phase, that early elementary phase.  
Where we Just steep them in and we teach them words Right?  
It's all about words.  
So by the time they get to that next Parts of the trivia by the time they get to Yeah.  
The logic can start using all of those base words to start creating and argument.  
They They take what they know and they start to learn how to use it really well.  
Got the grammar.  
So the grammar phase, I believe, is a 2 and then the the logic phase starts around I I take that back.  
K 3.  
And then around 4th or 5th grade is when they start to enter the logic phase.  
And then in secondary school, is where, they enter the rhetoric.  
Was it something that you Great question, Charlie.  
I So I started working I spent most of my career working in higher education.  
And mostly traditional higher education, but focused on trying to innovative and move into online components or move into, curriculum that is competency based and trying to figure out the best way to develop a human being and to becoming the the greatest human being we can we can help them become.  
And about 2, 3 years ago, I really started to to learn more about Great Hearts and what the work that they were doing.  
And I was blown away by their outcomes.  
Oh, 1 of the one of the stats I love to share is that our average high school student gives a 26 on their ACT.  
Our average student does.  
That means that these students are not just Going to high school, but they are really developing and learning and growing.  
And when they go out into the world, we hear back from these students we hear things from them like, oh, college was so much so much easier than what I was doing in high school because my high school was so in-depth.  
And I learned Latin and I learned Greek and I read all of these great books.  
And I was so engaged in these conversations and these humane letter discussions and the Socratic method of learning.  
That when I went to college, it it was a really easy and fun experience versus a a really challenging and hard experience.  
And and as I started talking to the students, as I start meeting the teachers, as I started learning more about what classical education is, I found that it just resonated really well with who I was as a human being.  
And knowing that we want to teach truth, beauty, and goodness, we want to develop scholars.  
We 1, people to grow and and be Come very best that they can be And our curriculum and our teachers and our whole philosophy behind this is To not just memorize a fact and regurgitate it on a test.  
But to actually learn and grow and develop.  
And that's what that's what classical education and great hearts at its core is is designed to do is is develop these scholars to become Wonderful people.  
Yeah.  
I I I do.  
So I started teaching at a brick and mortar school.  
I've been to a couple of them.  
I then excuse me.  
I also have the opportunity to teach for Great Hearts online And I I have faith that we could do it.  
I had faith that we could bring this class of model to the online space.  
But it took one of my my students to really make that sparkle for me, really make that true for me, had a student who in the 4th grade, he had, transferred into Greathearts online in 3rd grade.  
K through 2 he went to a district school and his parents told me he was White.  
Disheartened with the learning He didn't really cared for him, and he wasn't excited about learning.  
But our 3rd grade teacher at Great Hearts online did such a beautiful job and this this student came in with such a beautiful, perseverant heart to begin with.  
But his parents said that within the 1st 2 months with great hearts, he went from watching cartoons every afternoon to television off Reading a book in a in a beautiful book too, not just any book.  
It was one of our great books.  
It was one of our classics, that did have, Models of virtuous behavior and just really rich content to to dive into.  
So it it's happening.  
It's happening in the online space as well as in our brick and mortar schools.  
Me add a little bit to that.  
One of the things that our curriculum is designed to do is is not just have Students that in front of a computer for 8 hours a day.  
But, actually, to open up a physical book make notes in it, read, turn those notes in, and show what they what they're learning.  
In our science classes, we ask students to go on nature walks.  
We ask we asked them to to go outside and describe what they're seeing We asked them to build weathervanes and grow mushrooms and build volcano kits, and it's it's a lot more than I'm sitting in front of a computer and a teacher is trying to tell me what to do.  
It's it's curriculum designed to have them go and learn and develop One of my most favorite pictures that I've ever seen, Is 1 of Heidi, who is our executive director at at Great Hearts Online, Her daughter graduated.  
When she graduated, she took a picture of her with her, with her chin on all of the books that she had read, and it was just I don't even know how many books.  
Like, 50 to a100 Just big thick like, classic books.  
And she was so proud of not just the fact that she read all of these books, but how it shaped her and how she learned and how she grew.  
Charlotte, I love how you're talking about how our teachers love our students because that is just at its core who we are.  
If you don't know Great Oaks very well, there's we have 40 campuses most of them in Arizona, Texas, but we also have Louisiana, and we're We're continuing to expand.  
Have 27,000 students who attend Great Heart's campuses.  
In most again, mostly Arizona and Texas, but we continue to expand.  
Online program has over 1500 students who participate in in that program.  
And our our teachers, every single one of them, is exactly what Charlotte is saying.  
They are highly qualified individuals who truly care about the scholars, and are just doing everything they can to help them develop not just memorize facts, not just turn in assignments, but just grow as people and and become Wonderful people.  
I'll I'll ask Charlotte in a minute to share more because she was a teacher and and she knows the classrooms really, really well.  
But the from a high level standpoint, our curriculum matches what we do on our brick and mortars.  
It's it's the same curriculum, same reading, same activities, same materials.  
However, We've we've taken what we do in our camp in our brick and mortar campuses.  
We've moved it to online, and then we've built it for online.  
Meaning that when a student logs in, it gives them on How to build a mushroom kit, how to learn this activity, how to get outside, how to make the how to make notes in a book in the correct way, how to handwriting and reading, all of these things are are done Yeah.  
With really clear instructions, really clear outlines of how to do it.  
And then in addition to so an online student who would be participating in this program through the My Tech High program, they would choose our classes, We would give them access to those classes in Canvas.  
They would have the instructions and the the information that they need in order to complete those assignments and activities, turn things in.  
But then they will get feedback From As needed is the answer.  
Our our teachers are available.  
They answer questions.  
They talk to students.  
They guide them on what to do next.  
And they'll have plenty of support, plenty of guidance, plenty of people they can reach to and talk to.  
If there's any questions or concerns to help them, through this process.  
Charlotte, is there anything wanna add to that about a day in the life of a of a scholar.  
Scholar.  
Yeah.  
So when I taught live, we would teach live in the morning, and then they would have some asynchronous activities, and it did Very the the, the 7 hour tip of school day, However, we we're doing exactly what we're doing in our live model in our asynchronous model But that that has the unique opportunity of teaching to the heart of and at the pace of every individual scholar.  
So if you have a scholar that learns, absorbs information just a little bit more quickly.  
They can get through that at their own pace.  
And then get to the hands on portion of it or I'm thinking back to my 2nd grade self who was afraid to ask for clarification slow the rest of the class down.  
That kiddo can replay the video if they need to.  
You know, they have that opportunity to learn at their own pace.  
And as Roger said, we also have those office hours so they Got that.  
Human connection when they do need to to touch base with someone.  
That's that's one of those things that I hope every online family knows and understands.  
I I have a son who was really struggling to to keep up with reading.  
And he's in he'll be going into 7th grade this upcoming year, he still struggles with reading.  
And part of the reason that he struggles is because the class is moving faster, than he is.  
He's in a regular you know, traditional school.  
And the class is moving faster than what he was capable of.  
He got a little bit behind The maybe the 1st day and then more behind the 2nd day and more behind the the 1st week and more behind after 3 weeks.  
And then suddenly he was just so far behind everybody else that it that he just couldn't couldn't keep up.  
And one of the things I love about online is that if a student misses it, you Have time You can go back.  
You can continue to work.  
You can continue to grow.  
Nobody's gonna force you to have to have You know, next week's assignments in.  
You can spend more time and spend more effort.  
Now I wanna say that We hold our students to our scholars to a very high standard We want them to grow.  
We want them to succeed.  
We ask a lot of them And so a student gets behind, We can spend a lot of time and help them get caught up but there is that need to spend that time.  
They're not gonna learn if they're not in class.  
They're not gonna learn if they're not doing the assignments and the activities.  
But they're spending the time and learning, they will grow, they will develop, And you'll be amazed at the end of the year how what what they become and how they start to express themselves and how they start to talk about what they've what they're learning and what they're doing and how they see the world It's just amazing to me how these scholars develop.  
Charlie, you wanna jump in on that, or go for it?  
I I see you saying that you want to, so I was gonna let you go first.  
This is something I feel particularly passionate about, I a product of Last blood it was not available in looks when I was growing up, so we had to go to parochial schools.  
My parents very lovingly call it our $1,000,000 education.  
Right.  
And I feel so strongly about the fact that we can offer this at great hearts.  
At Great Heart, so we do avoid Things are pop culture in our classrooms, and that absolutely extends into our online model.  
And that's not to say that pop culture is bad.  
That's just to say it's It's pop culture.  
Let's take a few hours out of the day and really focus our minds and Alright.  
On what has stood the test of time to be true and Good and beautiful.  
Right history, proves that it is.  
So we in our literature, we have all of these examples of What For 2 And in our great hearts model, we have the 9 core virtues and we talk about those in the classroom.  
We talk about modeling them.  
We encourage students to notice displays of humility in their They're their peers.  
That's a constant question that we bring up.  
And in brick and mortar and even online, when we have to have a an a 1 on 1 classroom management type situation.  
Like, alright, Gail.  
Let's talk about our behavior.  
Those discussions of virtue come up and it's not it's not didactic.  
It's not heavy handed.  
It's very Socratic You ask these students questions about their behavior, you ask them questions about virtue, and you just draw that natural beauty and natural goodness in them, out of them.  
Meanwhile, you're always providing that model of what excellent and virtuous behavior is.  
One of the things that surprised me I learned it, is that a very high percentage, and I I I shouldn't give you a number because I can't remember exactly what it was, but it was much higher than I expected.  
Of our graduates end up in science, technology, engineering, and medical fields.  
In stem based programs.  
And I I thought that's really interesting.  
We're classically based liberal arts education.  
Why are they all headed into STEM?  
And They are.  
It's and it's because we teach them things like logic and rhetoric and reading and grammar.  
And our students excel when they start to we teach them Latin and Greek.  
And when they go to Take biology and and medical classes or or Science based, work They understand the in it.  
They understand the foundations.  
They understand the logic and the rhetoric behind it, and they actually do really, really well.  
I've met so many of our graduates over the last 2 years And I'm blown away with the careers that they've gone into, with the education that they're doing.  
I just talked to one just 2 days ago, and she's applying to medical schools all throughout the country.  
And she was talking about her experience, and and she was writing her application to these medical schools.  
And in it, she's writing about her great heart's experience and how it taught her logic and rhetoric and and the ability to and that has helped her as she's moving into the medical our students Well, Excel ends in these areas without us having to teach it to them directly and that's what amazes me is they they understand the foundations and the basis behind it then when they take those classes, it just comes together and makes a really makes it really simple Charlotte, do anything you'd add to that?  
Just about in the and yet, great hearts graduates are impressive When one of them comes home to us to teach I just get a thrill and without fail, I am in love with working with our our great hearts graduates as well as our our other teachers.  
But in the vein of We are creating We are creating the next generation of leaders and That that is, that is true work That That, it's not just that we're teaching them how to do math and how to read.  
We we are helping to form the whole person.  
And we need a generation of liberal artists.  
There's nothing wrong with specializing.  
That is good and noble work, and eventually, they will specialize at some point in their adulthood.  
But those leaders right?  
If think about what a really good leader has, they have a fairly wide birth, a wide understanding, a a wide Back for their fellow man.  
And whatever Yeah.  
It's It's not it's not exactly the same, but I often tell people that I didn't I didn't become a really strong reader and a really strong until I learned Portuguese.  
I I learned Portuguese when I was 19, and And that just changed the way I thought about how I talk to people.  
How I communicated, how I when I read things, how it made sense.  
And And unless you learn another language, it's hard to you just communicate.  
You just do what you've always done.  
But when you start to learn another language, you to think about how do I say what I want to say?  
What is the right words in in this situation?  
How do I phrase it in the most eloquent and beautiful way that I can?  
So learning a language helps you do that.  
It helped me do that anyway.  
And spending 4 years well, our our stew our scholars start learning Latin Is it 6th grade, Charlotte?  
They start learning Latin?  
Some campuses earlier Yeah.  
All campuses have a foreign language and some have started just teaching Latin From the very Getting Yeah.  
And so the these these students have this this opportunity to start learning those roots and learning the The the foundations of what they're doing and start to think about how do I say what I want to say?  
How do I communicate what I'm trying to communicate?  
And it just just changes the way that our minds work and the way that we, develop, and it's it's wonderful.  
It's amazing Again, I I've said this, I think, 5 times, but it's amazing to see how our scholars grow and develop.  
And it's just these practices that we've put into place that, help them do that.  
Yeah.  
So let me Let me say that first and foremost, We've We hope you choose us.  
We want you to choose us.
