## Dyslexia Resources

- OpenEd’s policies and resources:
    
    # **1.5 Special Education Services (Utah 25-26)**
    
    Updated over 2 weeks ago
    
    OpenEd supports all learners, including those with special needs.
    
    All students can access free tutoring, either one-on-one or in small groups, to get the guidance that they need. Eligible students can also receive support from our Special Education team.
    
    ## **How It Works**
    
    Once enrolled, your student is considered a full-time public school student at one of our partner schools. Each of these schools has a Special Education team that services IEPs and Section 504 Plans.
    
    All SPED services are delivered online.
    
    ## **Special Education Pre-Referral Process**
    
    In accordance with federal and state law, if a student demonstrates signs of a learning disability or condition—such as speech difficulties—that may impact their ability to perform at grade level, a pre-referral process should be initiated by the parent or teacher. This process typically spans 4–6 weeks and includes documented interventions, observations, evaluations, and consistent monitoring of the student’s progress.
    
    This pre-referral phase is part of determining whether a student may be eligible for IEP or 504 services. During this time, formal interventions, testing, and data tracking help identify whether a learning disability is present or if other factors—such as the student's curriculum—may be contributing to the challenges.
    
    ## _**Before proceeding, please note:**_
    
    1. **Curriculum Review:**
    
    If the evaluation team determines that a student’s current curriculum is contributing to their difficulty progressing, they may be required to switch to a different provider for core subjects (e.g. BYU Independent Study, Edgenuity, etc.).
    
    2. **Purposes of Accommodations:**
    
    IEP/504 services provide additional tools and strategies to support student success within the general education curriculum—they do not replace the curriculum or modify state graduation requirements.
    
    3. **Long-Term Goal:**
    
    The ultimate aim of Special Education services is to help students learn how to manage their disability effectively so that, ideally within three years, they can access and succeed in the general education setting with greater independence.
    
    ## **Next Steps: Getting Started With The Pre-Referral Process**
    
    If you’re ready to move forward, please follow these steps to begin gathering the necessary documentation.
    
    1. **Collect Student Work Samples:**
    
    Begin collecting student work samples over 2 weeks that _clearly_ indicates the student’s challenges with grade-level progress_. S_ave all samples digitally as PDF or PNG files in a sharable folder (such as Google Drive or Dropbox).
    
    2. **Begin a Monitoring Journal:**
    
    Start a digital journal (document) where you record observations of the student during academic study times over a two week period. Please include 5-7 specific instances where the student demonstrated difficulty with grade level content. Indicate the date and time of each observation. Once complete, add the journal of your observations to the same shared folder.
    
    3. **Share the Folder:**
    
    After collecting work samples and documenting your observations in a Monitoring Journal, email **sped@opened.co** with a link to the shared folder for review.
    
    4. **Start Exact Path Interventions:**
    
    Our team will provide access to **Exact Path**, our digital learning and assessment tool. This is a free resource available in your library. The student will need to complete at least **4 weeks** of targeted interventions in **Math and Language Arts** to provide OpenEd with additional information to support the need for services.
    
    5**. Add Additional Documentation:**
    
    Please upload any additional assessments, notes, or relevant observations to the shared folder. This helps the Special Education team form a complete picture of your student’s needs.
    
    6. **Referral Submitted:**
    
    Once all documents are submitted, OpenEd will share them with the Special Education team of your student’s school of enrollment for review. They will coordinate any additional evaluations as needed.
    
    7. **Eligibility Review Meeting:**
    
    When appropriate, the school’s Special Education team will convene an IEP or 504 Plan eligibility review meeting. Parents will be invited to participate in this important step.
    
    ## **Resources For Students With Dyslexia**
    
    OpenEd’s personalized education focus, which allows students to work at their own pace and pay special attention to specific subjects, is especially beneficial for students with learning differences like dyslexia.
    
    Our partner schools do not conduct testing for dyslexia, as this type of neurological testing is done through a medical doctor. **[Dyslexia Center of Utah](https://dyslexiacenterofutah.org/)** offers screening testing and has recommendations for some great resources.
    
    Many parents ask for suggestions on the best curriculum or learning resources to help a child struggling with dyslexia. Over the past few years, parents have shared various recommendations, which you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PtQ7V2hGnVb07rWu9jxEfhd77m-j0I4zvKGux5SR7yw/edit).
    

The Dyslexia Center of Utah is fantastic.  [https://www.dyslexiacenterofutah.org/](https://www.dyslexiacenterofutah.org/)

If they want outside help I highly suggest [Savvy Learning](https://savvylearning.com/). They do individual or small group learning instruction using the Orton-Gillingham Approach, often used to help students with dyslexia.

I have a couple. 🙂

- Use a dyslexia-friendly font (uses thicker lines in parts of letters)
- Take breaks
- Use multisensory instruction
- Read along with audio books
- Take turns reading
- Have a conversation before, during and after reading
- Break down sentences, words, and syllables into manageable pieces like sounds and syllables
- Practice self-advocacy
- Match words with pictures
- Use systematic phonics instruction
- Utilize graphic novels
- Break directions into parts
- Use visuals to support oral directions
- Add a movement or kinesthetic example in directions
- Use student-centered instruction
- Help the student find his/her strengths

Orton-Gillingham is really one of the best approaches for dyslexic learners, if they are looking for a curriculum.

## Transcript

# Kris, Jaime, Andrea

Kris Vassel: [00:00:00] There are still a lot of myths floating around. when it comes to dyslexia. Some of the top myths that I hear over and over again are things like:

Children are seeing letters being reversed.

They have vision issues. We're being told that my child needs colored overlays or they need vision therapy.

And I'm not dismissing the fact that there are true, vision issues and those things do exist. But that is not the right intervention for dyslexia, because dyslexia is not vision based.

  

Andrea Fife: Well, welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm your sometimes host Andrea Fife. We've got something a little different planned for this episode, and I have to say I'm really excited. Uh, today's episode is for anyone teaching reading, especially those implementing intervention strategies for students with specific learning disabilities such as dyslexia.

Now we're going to use the word teachers a lot today [00:01:00] because we're going to dive deep into pedagogy. But parents, that doesn't mean that this episode isn't for you, whether you are personally teaching reading in your home, or whether you're partnering with external support. We know that in involved parents.

Are reading teachers. So as we get into it today, consider yourself at the center of this conversation. Every time we say teachers, we do mean you. So I'd like to introduce you to our two expert guests today, uh, because they are going to do most of the topic talking on this topic. So first meet. Jamie

Kris Vassel: Lesko our own Associate Director of Student Success here at Open Ed. Jamie leads our tutoring services to support students in reaching their academic goals through targeted data informed instruction. Before stepping into this role, Jamie was a special education teacher at a small charter school in Salt Lake City. Working closely with students who had moderate to to severe disabilities.

She is trained in the Wilson Reading System, which follows the Orton-Gillingham approach and played a key role in its [00:02:00] implementation school-wide to better support the growing population of struggling readers. Jamie is passionate about making sure every student gets the support they need to thrive, especially when it comes to reading and foundational skills.

Jaime Lesko: Thank you. Yes. Thank you so much for that introduction. That's lovely. I am excited to also be joined by Chris Vasal, who is an. Expert reading interventionist who has dedicated her professional life to helping struggling readers develop the skills and motivation necessary to become successful readers. Um, Chris began her educational career 23 years ago as a special education teacher for the um, Alpine School District in Utah. Uh, during that time she trained both general and special educators in the district on assessments and interventions for struggling readers. Um, she became a Wilson Reading System, level two certified Wilson Dyslexia therapist, as well as one of the first Wilson credentialed trainers in the state of Utah. 2006, she began working for the University of Utah Reading Clinic as a severe [00:03:00] reading difficulties coordinator, research associate and field site support staff. She trained special educators on effective reading assessments and interventions for struggling readers. Received certification in additional intervention models, became a letters regional trainer and presented to this Utah State Office of Education on effective rating interventions for at-risk readers. left the UURC and used what she learned to open her own private reading business in Missouri. And today she's here to share her expertise with all of us and with all of you.

Kris Vassel: Thank you so much, Jamie. It's glad. I'm so happy to be here.

Andrea Fife: And I'm so glad that you both accepted my invitation to be on the podcast today. I am so excited to listen to the two of you, swap stories, share your expertise. and I think that we'll all come away today having had a great conversation. So. Let's get started today with a general conversation about dyslexia.

Chris, as we were preparing for this episode, you mentioned to me a concern [00:04:00] about the dyslexia myths that still exist and how that leads to ineffective approaches for struggling Raiders. Tell us more about what you're seeing.

Kris Vassel: Sure. So, it's, Sad that unfortunately today there are still a lot of myths floating around. when it comes to dyslexia, what it is, what it looks like, how it affects children. I'm seeing it both with parents, with educators, with administrators. some of the top myths that I hear over and over again are things like, um, children are seeing, um, letters, being reversed.

They have vision issues. Um, and when you, believe in those types of myth, it's gonna take you down a different path. And, um, for example, um. Right now in my particular area, a lot of educators and parents are coming to me saying that, you know, we're being told that my child needs, colored overlays or they need vision therapy.

and I'm not, um, dismissing the fact that. There are [00:05:00] true, uh, vision issues and, um, those things do exist. but that is not the right intervention for dyslexia because dyslexia is, not vision based. There's a lot of research that backs that up. in fact, it is neuro biological and origin, so it is a language based disability.

So it's, um, in the brain, not the vision.

Andrea Fife: That's, that's incredible. I feel like we could do a whole podcast episode just, just on that, you know? Exactly. What, what is dyslexia, Jamie in, in your experiences with, Intervention strategies and things like that, have you come across, uh, similar myths that have made it difficult for a student to access the appropriate type of support for them?

Jaime Lesko: I think one of the biggest myths is that students with dyslexia can't learn to read. I think that's probably one of the biggest myths that I've ever heard. know, parents are like. This is just too big of a struggle. It is too big for me to deal with. even teachers, I've heard, teachers are like, it's just something they have to just deal [00:06:00] with. that's probably a myth that for myself, it just stabs me in the heart because I'm like, It is possible. you just need the right tools, the right resources. it takes a lot of patience. It takes a lot of hard work. It's not gonna come overnight. And so, um, when I think of myths that is the biggest one that I consider is just that it's just not possible.

And the fact of the matter is, is it truly is possible.

Andrea Fife: That's, that's great. I love that, that positive perspective and it, and it truly is possible. I know that something that you're both passionate about is research backed or research based. Data backed approaches to intervention. the, a really packed sentence. Like, that's, that's a lot of you almost, I, I'll be honest, I almost stopped listening, because I, I'm like, oh, this, this sounds like there's gonna be a lot of facts and figures, a lot of, you know, am I gonna, am I gonna stay engaged in here?

So talk to me about, you know, for a person who's coming from the outside of that. reading instructor world, what does it mean [00:07:00] to be using research based or data backed strategies?

Kris Vassel: Do well. reading is very complex and teaching reading really is rocket science. It's not something that, that you can just do naturally. It is something that, um, you have to be trained on how to do. So research based. Basically means it's backed by science, backed by research. So there's a term that has been floating around recently, the Science of Reading, and a lot of people are hearing that term, the science of reading.

And um, there's a lot of misconceptions around that term. A lot of people think that it means a specific phonics program. and so. In order to understand research based, we first need to kind of address that term. And it's really simple. The science of reading is basically a body of research that has been done over five decades.

that answers the question, how does the human brain learn to [00:08:00] read? And it's not backed just by education, it's backed by psychologies. By neurology b Linguistics. So it's all of those areas coming together, and it's five decades of research to answer that question. How, you know, how do children learn to read?

Um, what does that look like? And so in order to help children who have a language-based disability like dyslexia, it's important to have. and use interventions that are backed by science because then you know that it's gonna be effective and, um, it's gonna help them.

Jaime Lesko: I'll add to that, that it, it is really interesting to me how, um, when you talk about research based. approaches, programs, whatever it may be. this just what Chris said about the science of reading, it really boils down to you have to figure out which method works best for your kid. and it brings in all of the approaches of it can be done visually, can it be done, then kinesthetically, can it be done auditorily? so [00:09:00] there's, it really does bring in. All the five senses, which yes, teaching reading is complex and it is rocket science, but when you really break it down to, you just need to figure out which ways your student learns. That really, truly is not rocket science. It may take a while to get there, but just like Chris said, it's one of those things that, Yeah, it's really complicated to figure out how your brain works. but once you figure out or utilize a system that integrates a lot of different modalities, you'll find the one that connects the most with your kiddo. And that is the art of not only teaching reading, but just teaching in general.

Andrea Fife: So you, you both talked about, um, you know, systems and there they're kind of being, guess I'll say almost like a, like a script to follow, doing, follow, following, some certain methodologies. And I think that that's what leads then to the second part of the, of the data. So when we talk about [00:10:00] intervention, strateg strategies, relying on data, what does that, what does that mean?

Kris Vassel: Well, I, I have to jump back a little bit to answer that question. So in addition to the science of reading, structured literacy. Is a term that's been around since, I don't know, 2014. And it, it's a method of teaching reading that aligned with those findings of the science of reading. And so structured literacy encompasses a broad range of literacy skills that you want your struggling reader to know.

It focuses on both foundational and higher level reading and writing skills. So we're talking things like phonological awareness fluency. Reading comprehension, written expression, vocabulary, morphology, um, language structure, and integrating all of that with oral language development. So those are the things, a lot of, it's not just phonics, it's not just fluency, it's not just vocab.

It's all of it. And so that's the first piece is, um, whatever your, [00:11:00] um, you want it to be a structured literacy approach and it encompasses all of those. Uh, skilled and then it's delivered in a way that Jamie stated earlier. Tho those different modalities, the multi-sensory, so you know, a child is seeing the word, they're saying the word, they're writing the word.

Um, you want it to be direct and explicit and systematic. You want it to be, cumulative. So you start with one skill and you add to it, and you go back and review all of these things. Are very, important when you're working with struggling readers. So now to go back to that question about data driven, part of that is, when you're working with these children, it needs to be, constantly assess.

You need to constantly assess. Your struggling readers or any child that you're working with, it doesn't have to be just a struggling reader. Any reader needs to be constantly assessed, and then you are gonna adjust your intervention or your instruction based on [00:12:00] the individual student needs.

Andrea Fife: That's so great. I wanna, I wanna dive a bit more into some of the vocabulary that, that you're using for people who, live, like I said, live in this world of reading intervention. Um, I think that there's some vocabulary that comes as almost second nature, but that as families are learning how to do this in their own home or they're learning how to research. options might, might work for them? There's a few concepts you talked about that there that I wanna really dive into. I mean, one honestly is even just the word intervention in, in the first place. I use that in my introduction, but it may be a word that people, it might benefit from hearing defined.

And then the other is assessment. And I'm calling that out because in the open education world, uh, for many people who are choosing to school at home. the word assessment can feel like a scary term. It can feel like it's aligned to that word of, you know, state assessments or standardized assessments.

And, and I know that to a certain degree, you know, when you're wanting to get great [00:13:00] and reliable data, there is an element to the assessment that is standard. But I would not say that an intervention assessment is. Standardized in the same way that you might think of standardized assessment. So there's a lot to unpack there. what do the words intervention and the words assessment mean when you're talking about, uh, structured literacy strategies?

Kris Vassel: So, intervention is literally that intervening. So, to unpack that a little bit more, um, you. I have to bring up response to intervention. I don't know if you guys have heard that term out there. Response to intervention. It's been around for quite a while actually. It started when I first started teaching in the early two thousands, but basically back in the day when a child was trying to be, I.

put in special education, they would use the, the discrepancy model, which basically means that, you know, they get an IQ test done, an achievement test, and if the gap is big enough, then they qualify and they get put in special ed. and it wasn't very effective. So [00:14:00] response to intervention. RTI. came about in 2004 to kind of dismiss the discrepancy model, and basically it's a tiered model.

It's a framework, so tier one would be regular classroom instruction done with a regular teacher. If you're an at-home educator, that would be your core reading program that you do with your children at home. Okay. Tier two is where, let's say you've been doing tier one intervention, whatever. Instruction or reading program you're using.

let's say that you find that your child is still struggling and they're not quite picking up on the concept, then you would move to what's called tier two. That's gonna be more small group. it might be that you do more of tier one type curriculum or a different type of curriculum in tier two, but it's done in small groups.

Okay. Tier three is typically with somebody like myself, the special educator, um, a reading [00:15:00] interventionist, somebody who, um, has more training in working with. Children with language-based disabilities, and this is an additive tier. It doesn't mean that if you are an at-home educator and you are doing your regular.

Curriculum tier one, and you find that your child is still struggling, that you quit doing that and you just bring in a specialist or a tutor, or you do it yourself. It's in addition to, so you are gonna do tier one, you're gonna still do your core program, core curriculum, and then in addition to that, it's either tier two or tier three.

So that is what I mean by intervention is if the tier one is not working. And that's where the assessment comes in. How do you know if it's working? If you're not collecting any data, right? That's when you intervene and you provide a different type of curriculum, strategy, methodology to help meet that student's needs at that time.

Andrea Fife: That was such an incredible [00:16:00] description, Chris, for those who are watching this with, with the video, they'll see Jamie and I just grinning, grinning as you explained, how important it is not to assume that these interventions happen in place. Of, the core instruction and how important it is that this is a more holistic approach.

You don't just say, oh, it isn't working. I'm just gonna abandon it entirely. It's, this isn't quite working. What can be layered on or what can be adjusted? Um, and that's, that's what I really love about, you know, digging in and talking about it being, being data driven. Um, because then you're really looking at, you're taking a very scientific approach.

It's like the scientific method that. You know that you study and, and you learn about changing one variable because if you change everything all at the same time, it's difficult to really know what, what has an impact. So, that was such an excellent, excellent description. Anything you wanna add there, Jamie?

Jaime Lesko: just wanted to add that. Yeah, while the word assessment can sound really scary, um, and intimidating, [00:17:00] um, without those benchmark touch points, just to see where your kiddo is at, it is really difficult to identify those struggling areas, which is when intervention takes place. So you do need to have that regular data, those regular data touch, uh, touch points. in order to identify those areas that your student is struggling in, so that you can bring in a different strategy. Okay. We need to approach this in a different angle. We need to introduce a different modality or a different, Strategy for, for learning that concept. Um, until my student has grasped it and I do.

Yeah, I agree. the fact that you made sure to emphasize that it is in addition to the curriculum that you're utilizing, bring in something new that maybe, attacks it from a different angle, that's when your students are gonna find those. Those areas that they're just like, okay, now that makes sense.

It didn't make sense when you said it this way, but now it makes sense presented to me in this fashion. And that's what interventions are all about, and it's really, [00:18:00] really, really important to utilize those benchmarks, that progress monitoring, whatever that looks like. I know these are all terms that maybe parents don't know, but it's just those check-ins, right?

It's just a check-in to go. Did you understand this concept? Yes or no? Okay. If you did, great, we can scaffold and move on and build on that concept, but if you don't build on, or if you, if they didn't understand that concept, it's extremely difficult to scaffold and build onto it when there's that gap.

It's like trying to climb a ladder and you're missing several rums. It's not easy to do. You've gotta, gotta make space for those runs and make sure that those are intact in order to continue to build up.

Andrea Fife: That's great. okay, so we've talked about a lot of concepts. Definitely a lot of things that are kind of coming back to the importance of structure. Um, the importance of structure when it comes to. Reading instruction. a word that I think parents might come across as they're learning more about these topics, uh, would [00:19:00] be the word fidelity.

So you've got, you know, you've, you've made your decision about the reading methodologies that you want to use. What, what does it mean to implement that curriculum with fidelity?

Kris Vassel: Great question.

a curriculum is designed a specific way, and so if you not, if it's, um, backed by science and it's proven to work the way that it's designed, if you don't deliver it the way it's designed, then um, progress may be slow or non-existent. So, I'll give you an example. Um, back when I was traveling and being in and out of all these different schools in Utah, I came across the classroom where these educators were really struggling to, um, get some help for their struggling readers.

And so they heard about the Wilson program, they got excited about it, and they decided to just buy the material and, um, not get any training or certification or anything. So, um, they just opened it up and started using it. And when I [00:20:00] showed up that day, they were very honest with me and saying that this is what they did and that they were struggling to understand how to do it, even with a manual right in front of them.

Um, there's certain ways of how to deliver it and that can only be taught through, um, training. And so, uh, they were telling me how their students were not making the progress. That they thought that they would make. And so they were about to like throw this in the trash and say that this was not an effective curriculum.

So, um, that's just one example.

Jaime Lesko: Yeah.

Andrea Fife: you're nodding like you've got some stories to add here.

Jaime Lesko: oh, man, you know, I, I, you probably visited my school, Chris, I feel like I was thrown that curriculum and they were just, were like, we're gonna teach, you know, we need you to teach this. And I am that type of teacher that's like, well, I'll figure this out. But then I quickly discovered, I. I need, I needed training. There needed to be some support in place, and so I definitely had to go to our, director there and was just [00:21:00] like, this curriculum is a little bit confusing. It's pretty complex. There's a lot to it, and I need some modeling here. Um, in order for, in order to, I think really fully encompass what is. The purpose, what is going to be the intent? What is the design of this program? To meet the desired needs? The desired results of our students? And so, yeah, they got us a mentor in there. They brought us in, a fellow who taught us the curriculum and how to utilize it. And once we were able to see that modeled. It became effective. the effectiveness of us as teachers, um, without that modeling definitely, um, inhibited the ability for that, that program to be as successful. That approach to be, uh, what we, what we wanted it to be. we could see the results, um, improve drastically in our students the moment we all finally implemented the correct. Instructional strategies, for its implementation. it was [00:22:00] amazing once we adhered to the content, um, we followed the sequences, we did the patterns that it wanted us to do. having that structure, made it even easier for us as teachers to do it. Um, and the students understood what the next step was and they became more effective, more efficient in their reading progress.

So it was pretty amazing.

Andrea Fife: So I'm listening to you both talk and I'm thinking about a variety of curriculum options I've used across. subjects, not just reading. And I'm really thinking about that word curriculum and what it means and how you implement it. And, and I'm feeling like in any case, in any curriculum, what you're saying is, is probably true. That if you've picked an approach and you've picked it for a reason, that that approach is going to be most effective. If you as the teacher make certain that you're doing more than just. Open the materials and kind of figuring it out, but that whatever you've chosen, whether it's for reading anything, if, if you've selected a methodology for a reason, it probably makes sense to also pursue whatever training is [00:23:00] available, whatever materials are there to support the teacher on, on the teacher end of that.

But I do wanna learn a little bit more 'cause I. I get the sense, and my sense may be wrong, but I get the sense that you're both talking about some specific curriculum. is there a particular curriculum or are there many curriculum options that are based in this same science backed, you know, for someone who is. Again, out outside this world. tell, tell us specifically, is there one curriculum? Are there many curriculum options? Is it more about a philosophy? What should a parent be looking for? If they're looking for, strategies that are aligned with, with the science of reading and structured literacy?

Kris Vassel: Great question. So I can't speak for tier one because my area of expertise is tier two and tier three. I. Uh, so you will, you probably heard the term Orton-Gillingham at the beginning of all this when, uh, introductions were made. Um, a lot of people hear that, but don't know what that means. But basically, Samuel Orton, he was a [00:24:00] neuropsychiatrist back in the day who actually studied adult patients who had brain injury.

And he was also also a pathologist and he paired with a lady named Anna Gillingham, who was, um, a psychologist and an educator. And together, um, they created the Orton Gillingham approach and there's lots of derivatives. Um, a lot of people were trained under them and then branched off and kind of created their own interventions based on the same, You know, scratch that methods. Yeah. So, um, so all of 'em are direct and explicit. All of 'em are multi-sensory, so there's a lot of commonalities between all of them. But, um, Wilson, I. Reading system is the one that I was trained in. That's their flagship program. They have other interventions that are tier ones and tier twos, so their tier one and tier two intervention is Fundations.

And that I have seen a lot of, um, at home educators use that, [00:25:00] not just in the public schools. Um, they have just words. There is Linda Mood, be Slingerland Barton. Those are just some of the names, of Orton-Gillingham type, programs out there.

Andrea Fife: Great.

Jaime Lesko: similar. Similarly, I was also trained in the Wilson Reading Program, uh, which does utilize the Orrin Gillingham approach. and yeah, you just utilize it as a tier two intervention. We just tied it in with our tier one curriculums as much as possible, so we utilize the same benchmarks as the rest of the school. Um, but we utilize the Wilton Wilson Reading System in order to encourage students to progress a little bit faster in their, you know, and, and overcome the obstacles that they were meeting, the barriers that they were meeting, um, in their reading. And their reading strategies.

Andrea Fife: So I wanna be totally honest with you both. This sounds incredible. It also sounds. Really rigorous for the teacher. you know, it feels, it sounds like the implementation you need to be prepared to [00:26:00] invest some time. You need to be prepared to learn new things. If this is the system that looks like it's gonna be the right approach for, for, for that learner, what, what advice do you have?

For the, for the teacher, whether that is a classroom teacher, whether that is a parent implementing, uh, reading education in their own home. If what they're hearing is making them feel like, you know, that's gonna be the right approach. How do you keep the, the rigor there? How, how, how does a teacher go about preparing to deliver this type of instruction?

Kris Vassel: Well, maybe my story will, um, motivate some people who are kind of maybe on the fence. Um, when I began teaching, uh, my very first year of teaching, I used what I was taught in my undergrad program and I quickly realized that I didn't have what it took to help these struggling readers. Why? Because they weren't making progress.

So, my first year of teaching, I was just [00:27:00] overwhelmed and, uh, I started grasping at anything I could. So I went back and started taking master level classes. Still didn't help me help these children. So then I got certified in a program called Reading, reading Recovery, which is kind of like a tier two, and it helped some of my students, but ultimately after a year or two, they ended up in special education.

And I thought, I wanna help these kids, you know, what is it gonna take? And we actually had a parent come. Threatened to sue our school district because she felt like we did not have what it took to help children with dyslexia. And she was right. And so that was when, the special ed director of the district approached me and said, Chris, are you willing to go get special training so that we can avoid this lawsuit?

And I said yes, because I saw it. My students were not making progress and I wanted to help these kids so bad. And sitting across from a parent at an IEP year after year and saying, look, [00:28:00] I mean the numbers don't lie. They're not, you know, they look at this and go, my student's not making progress. What do you have to say about that?

Right. It makes you feel horrible. And so I, the first day I sat in that Wilson workshop, it was like, this is the key I. I put it into practice, right? And I had a very supportive administrator who allowed me to run my classroom how I wanted to. I was very blessed that way, and it was very eye-opening to see.

All of a sudden I am applying, a different type of teaching and my students are making progress. It was incredible to see, and that motivated me to continue down that path. Yes, it's rigorous. Yes, it's lengthy and it's long, but these kids need the best. Right. They need us. And it's not just one person.

It takes all of us together, a team to help this child. And I think all of us are on the same page, the educator, the [00:29:00] parent, anyone. They want what's best for that child. And that is for them to become a confident, proficient reader because as they get older, they lose their self-esteem. They start getting anxiety.

They come home crying and in tears, and it is heartbreaking to see them that way. They know, even in preschool, they know they're not like their peer. They know they're behind. And so the longer you delay, I. the harder it gets for them and that changes the entire family dynamic. It hurts the parent, it hurts the siblings, it hurts the child.

No matter what educational setting you're in, whether it's home, public, charter, private, it's all the same. And so that is motivation, right there is they do need it and, they deserve the best.

Andrea Fife: Wow. That's an incredible, an incredible story. thank you for sharing that with, with us.

so for. For a parent that that is simply not gonna be in the cards, [00:30:00] to say, you know what? I see that this is what my, my student needs for someone choosing to educate at home. And they say, I see that this is what my student needs, but it is just not realistic for me to go get personally trained in the, in, in this reading system. Um, Jamie. In the experiences that that you've had working with families who are pursuing open education options, what have you seen be successful? Um, for families who want the freedom and flexibility to choose their own tier one curriculum, but know that they're needing a bit more support.

Jaime Lesko: Yeah, I feel like I had a. Relatively similar experience to Chris when I was starting in, when I was in the classroom too. We just didn't, you know, we were given a curriculum and this is what you're supposed to teach and hopefully your kids make progress on it. Um, and when I would have parents that were just like, you know, kids are just not making progress, what can we do?

I feel like I was grasping at straws. Pulling in whatever I had access to. I had access to Bob books, I had access to, um, [00:31:00] these c and say technology, you know, I had all these different things. you know, I would grab Play-Doh and I'd be like, okay, we're gonna make these letters. We're gonna spill out these words here.

Here's a box of sand. Let's write the word here. Because I feel like as a parent and as a teacher, you're going to grasp at whatever you have access to in order to help your students be successful. And so, you know, similar, similarly, we, we didn't jump straight to a big program like the Wilson Reading Program.

We had to put in little Steps. We tried the Haggerty Phonemic Awareness program. We tried Lexia, we tried Read 180. We had multiple, these little mini programs that I wouldn't say were necessarily tier two interventions, but I. just different curriculums that maybe we're going to touch what the student needed at a different angle. so, answer to your question, Andrea, when I run into parents who are just are like, I just don't know what to do. It's all, a lot of it is just, it's just, it's just explore exploratory [00:32:00] learning, utilizing all five senses as much as possible and seeing what clicks. Um, it's that, breaking down that barrier of like. I'm struggling as a homeschool parent. I'm struggling as the educator, the prime educator in my student's life, to know how to meet the student's needs. Being able to vocalize that, you're going to finally break down those barriers and open up that conversation to. Other, I mean, there's always a teacher in earshot.

Do you ever like go to the grocery store and you're like hearing a student or hearing a parent talk about, talk to another parent about how Johnny's struggling in school. There's always a teacher in earshot and they're like, you should try this. Try this method. This is a good one. Um, I know that always happens to me.

And so I feel like when parents become vulnerable and they break down that barrier and they say, this is the struggle, they're going to open up that communication for so many people to say, Ooh, have you tried this? Have you explored that? Here's a method that worked for my kid. And those are all amazing opportunities [00:33:00] for. Um, parents to really open their eyes, open their minds to what possibilities are available, um, that might help their kiddo meet their needs, meet their goals. So that's what I have

Andrea Fife: I,

Jaime Lesko: at least I.

Andrea Fife: I love that. I know that both of you have a lot of experience, um, in the, in the world of tutoring. When would you recommend to a parent that they explore the option of, you know, going beyond just a general curriculum option beyond just the. instruction that they're receiving in their primary educational environment, whatever that may be.

Um, and explore some really specific and intentional tutoring strategies. So.

Kris Vassel: I think, um, early intervention's the key, so. Not waiting until they're, you know, much older, but, you know, early intervention is, more effective. It's, faster, it's cheaper, um, than remediation correct. [00:34:00] So what I would say to that parent is, you know, educate yourself on reading disabilities. There's a lot of, great books out there.

knowledge is power. If you know, you know what to look for and the signs as early as preschool and they start to see these things, then you can intervene early as a parent, whether that be you go and get your own training yourself. Um, or you seek somebody outside, like a tutor or some kind of learning center that specializes in working with children with dyslexia.

Jaime Lesko: And I would just add that as a, it's really easy for us as parents to be like, I'm gonna educate my kid and I know all the answers. And I just have experienced so many times. There are moments in my education opportunities for my kids when I've had to swallow my pride and recognize that there might be a different person that needs to be that second person in their life who's going to literally say the same things that I've said to them for the past year at school. But having a second [00:35:00] person come in and say, here, do this, do that. It all of a sudden rings. True in their ears. I call the second person theory. It happens all the time in my world. I feel like sometimes just as a parent when you just are like, I'm just gonna swallow my pride and see if there's somebody else who can meet my kid those needs right now, and then utilize a tutor to do that.

They're literally telling, telling your kid the same thing that you've been teaching them for the last school year. But, you know,

Kris Vassel: Yeah.

Jaime Lesko: if it makes, if it makes sense all of a sudden, that's fine. You know it's true. You all know the second person theory has happened in your lives.

Andrea Fife: Uh, yep. I, I've worked with Jamie for a long time and I love that that shorthand terminology that I can just send her a message and I'll be like, Hey, I just need second person. Here's what I need the student to hear. I just need you to say it. It's, it's time for a second, second person to come in. I, it's true in parenting as well.

Kris Vassel: I'd like to add something to that. So, um, one thing I constantly share with parents is you can't leave reading to the tutor. So if they [00:36:00] do decide to use an outside source, struggling readers are in a race against time, and I know you hear it all the time as a parent, but I can't stress this enough.

Reading daily at home. At least 20 minutes is crucial for poor readers. Okay. Especially when they're older, because the difficulty in text is huge compared to kindergarten, first grade. And if you look at good readers, they consume millions of words per year in text versus poor readers. Right? And reading is a life skill, and it's like any other skill.

Uh, limited practice is gonna lead to limited improvement. Correct. And so there are certain tips that I use with parent when it comes to reading at home. I don't know if you want me to share those today, but I'll make 'em brief and quick. First is having your child read aloud. Um, that sounds weird, right?

But especially those younger readers in kindergarten [00:37:00] and first grade. Um, it is crucial that they're reading aloud to a skilled reader or a parent so that they can offer support as they're reading aloud. Once they move to like a mid to and first grade reading level, they can start to incorporate some silent reading, but then it's important as a parent to give some kind of guided question, that you're gonna ask them about that portion that they read, and then as they, as they get older, you can increase that.

That length of silent reading. The second tip is making sure that when your child is reading at home, the topic is interesting to that child and it's on their independent. Or instructional reading level. The biggest problem I see with parents is that their children are reading books that are way too hard.

They're on a frustration level, and that leads to frustration. So a good rule of thumb that I share with parents is if your child is reading that book with at least 90% accuracy [00:38:00] and a pretty solid rate of speed, then that's good. In other words, if, if they're making more than one to two mistakes out of every 10 words, that book is probably too hard.

And for both of your sakes, you wanna go to an easier book. Um, there are great resources out there to help parents know. What level, uh, books are on ar book [find.com](http://find.com/) is a, a resource I share with a lot of parents. It'll go in there. You can type in a book. It'll tell you the exact level it is, so you know, oh, you know, this is an end first, or this is a beginning third, so you're, you know, that it's a book that's on their reading level.

Um. You can't rely on libraries, you can't rely on the things that are on the books. They're not always reliable. if they're looking for, uh, websites to go to, to print off poetry, nonfiction, fiction that are free, read [works.org](http://works.org/) is a great one. And common lit. Love those. You can go on there, print off text and your children can read.

Third is [00:39:00] modeling. Reading, doing what's called echo reading. So it's you reading a section and then they're copying you. You are modeling what good reading sound like. That's what good reader, poor readers need to hear. And then fourth is how to handle those errors. There's certain things that I teach, uh, parents about, you know, when your child is reading out loud and they make an error, it's hard to know what to do in that moment as a parent.

Um, one thing is encourage them to self-correct. When a kid makes an error, we wanna jump in right away. Right? Well then that makes it so you take away their ability to self-correct. When in reality if that child finished the sentence and then goes back and fixes it, all you need to do is great job, good job.

You did an awesome job, self-correcting. So you almost have to train yourself to sit on your hand. Right? Because as teachers and parents, when they start self-correct, you know, when they start making an error, we wanna jump in right away and you don't want that good readers self-correct. Depending on their age and reading ability, you're, you [00:40:00] gotta look at the type of error they made and determine, you know, what should I help them do?

Should they sound out the word chunk out the word, um, but you do not wanna turn it into a phonics lesson because you're gonna break fluency and the goal is to read and repetition is huge. A lot of kids and parents sit there and go, wait, we just worked on the word, the, on that page before, and we're on this next page, and they're, they're struggling with it again.

Um, it's important to understand for parents and educators, anyone that struggling readers sometimes need up to a thousand exposures to get a word in memory. So that means if they struggle with the word the, even if you worked on it, the page before, just keep repeating it. Uh, don't get upset with them. and ultimately it's what you said earlier, parents, um, are laying the way for their children.

What, what's the environment like in your home? Are you modeling, reading? Do you have books in your home? Are you prioritizing reading as a family? as you said, Jamie, children learn more from our [00:41:00] example right. Than what we say. They never listen to us. Right. And so, sadly, right. But they do watch us.

And so is mom and dad reading? Is brother and sister reading? Are we going to the library? Do we have books in our home? parents are huge. You are the child's first teacher. so those are just some things that parents can implement to really, really help with progress. I reading daily is just huge.

Andrea Fife: Thank you. Those are such actionable, actionable strategies. I'm excited to, to share, share those tips with parents, um, and with our, with our teachers. I think that's, that's so great. I knew this was going to happen. I knew that this was going to be such an engaging conversation. And that one episode was not going to be enough.

So I hope that you'll both consider joining me again on a future episode so that we can continue, talking about this, this topic. But, for my last question for today, I'm just gonna ask if, if parents, Listen to this and feel like, Hey, [00:42:00] I really want to go learn more. I wanna pursue some additional training, um, and be able to implement some really effective research backed strategies in my home. what is, if they have time to do just one thing, what is, what is the first, you know, training or book or strategy that you would say, if you have time to do one thing, start here.

Jaime Lesko: That's a hard, that's a hard ask.

Kris Vassel: there's a lot of books out there that I would encourage them to read. There's one, um, by Louisa Moats that's Overcoming Dyslexia. I believe that's the title. another one is What to Do About Dyslexia. Those are great books that they can get on Amazon and just. Start reading it because it's gonna lay out things for parents as far as what to watch, you know, and look for in their struggling reader what the next steps to take.

So it's really this, this outline, this guide that's all there. especially the one that, what to do about dyslexia. It's, that one is [00:43:00] a really good one. because it's written specifically for parents and it lays out everything for them, the types of assessments to look for and, and so forth. And I, I would say that's a good starting point, that I would recommend to parents.

Andrea Fife: Great. did you narrow it down to one?

Jaime Lesko: No, I think I, I truly would just go back to just, just those basics of. Consistency and trying to identify where those areas of struggle are and try to introduce reading in just lots of different, different ways. There's just so many facets of reading. Um, you know, have them reading in the supermarket.

Have them read, you know, the ingredients on a recipe book. Have them, you know, really just bring reading as. not so much a chore, but that it's a life skill. This is something that you need to implement in your life every day. Um, it's going to be utilized daily. How can we, how can you bring that into your home?

How can you bring that visual auditorily, [00:44:00] kinesthetically? How can you bring that into your child's life, um, in all the different facets? Um, and you'll see them grow. It takes

Andrea Fife: That's.

Jaime Lesko: I wish parents just know that it takes time. But like Chris said, time is of the essence in some cases, and so the earlier you can find those needs identify them and intervene in them, the better off your student will be.

Kris Vassel: I would add be patient with yourself. Be patient with your child. It's the first for some, the first time they're going through this. and celebrate the baby steps, right? very little progress. You celebrate those moments. They need that celebration and they need that positive reinforcement, um, and praise.

Jaime Lesko: Oh yeah, you gotta make it fun. You gotta make reading fun. Kids won't do.

Andrea Fife: Absolutely. Well, Chris, I know that you have, a long wait list to be able to get, get in to be able to use you directly as a private tutor, but if people do want to learn more about you and your business, where can they find you?

Kris Vassel: Uh, I have a [00:45:00] website, vassal light [tutoring.com](http://tutoring.com/). They can certainly go there. There's information on how to contact me more about my background. There's also some resources they can find on there as well. I.

Andrea Fife: Amazing. And Jamie, if we have any current open ed families listening, um, where can they go to get additional support? through, through the support available to our active students.

Jaime Lesko: You can for sure reach out to. Student success@opened.co and we'll connect you with a member of our team. We'll talk about your students' needs, and we'd love to connect you with a tutor.

Andrea Fife: Amazing. Thank you so much. I am in awe of the work that you both do to personalize education for students. Uh, like I said, I hope that you'll accept my invitation for a follow up episode. I think we'll get some really specific questions from some readers and they'll probably be begging me. Hey, can we get Chris and Jamie on again someday? but thank you so much for joining me today on the Open Ed podcast.

Kris Vassel: Thank you for having me. Appreciate it.

Jaime Lesko: Thank

[00:46:00]
