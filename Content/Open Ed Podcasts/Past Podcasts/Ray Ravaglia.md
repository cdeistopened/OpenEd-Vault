## Transcript

Ela Richmond (00:00.864)  
Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I have on today, Rayva Ravaglia and Matt Bowman, who are two incredible thought leaders and educators in this open education space. So today we're going to hear all about Ray's background, all of the things that he has done, amazing things in education. And to kick it off, Ray, can you give us a little bit of insight into like how you even got started in education to begin with?

Matt Bowman (00:05.235)  
you

Ray Ravaglia (00:25.221)  
Yeah, absolutely. So I went to Stanford University as an undergraduate. And as I was entering my final year, I trying to figure out what to do next. I thought I would spend a year goofing off before going to graduate school in philosophy. Found an opportunity to help work on a first year course to be taught computer based on calculus, a grant from the National Science Foundation. So this is back in

1987 and wound up over that next year and a half developing a complete first year AP calculus course that was delivered by computer. Now this was pure text and graphics and some automated mathematical processing so we could actually have students enter equations and evaluate those. We can have them justify some of logical reasoning and

verify that as well, but this was before the advent of easy multimedia technology. So when built that out, had some great success with it with students in the 1991 academic year, wound up pivoting to work with gifted middle school and early high school students. So that year we had one seventh grader, five eighth graders, four ninth graders, and three 10th graders take the AP exam, six five, six fours, and a three.

And in particular now was the the seventh grader and for the five eighth graders that scored five. So these younger kids really did quite well. Went to the National Science Foundation and said, hey, look, this seems to really work. Why don't we scale up? And they were no, thank you. This was proof of concept. We're not interested. So at that point we did this strange thing in a university context, which was to reinvent ourselves as a business inside the university.

with the idea that the intended beneficiaries of this research, i.e. the students, could, we'd go direct to them on a tuition-based model. And so we created a thing called Education Program for Gifted Youth, quickly built out courses in mathematics from algebra up through the calculus so that we could go out and build our own supply line of students needing calculus, and then ultimately wound up.

Ray Ravaglia (02:48.179)  
pushing that down to kindergarten level mathematics and building it up through the undergraduate degree. So by 95 or so, we were offering a full mathematics curriculum really all the way from kindergarten through what you would need for an undergraduate degree. And then sort of rolled out from there into other subjects.

Ela Richmond (03:10.22)  
Wow, that's crazy. just a follow up question. So what was your goal? So you said you reinvented this and you built up this business.

Ray Ravaglia (03:19.699)  
Yeah, and initially the goal was, so the National Science Foundation's goal was something like only 20 % or so of the high schools in the country at that time were offering calculus. Calculus was a real filter in terms of who could ultimately go on to more advanced courses in mathematics, the sciences, engineering, et cetera. And the question was, how do we get more students successfully through this stuff?

Our thought was that a computer-based course would be an easy way to get it out to the students who needed it. But when we looked at the high schools that were convenient drive from Stanford, even though 80 % of the high schools in the country didn't have calculus, most of those near us did. And that's what led us to pivot to gifted middle school students, because there isn't any middle schools out there that are offering calculus on a routine basis. So at that point, our goal really shifted to

how do we meet students where they are in terms of what they need to learn and then make it possible for them to learn it no matter where they are and to move through the material as quickly as their natural ability would let them so that, you know, in some sense, get rid of the age restriction on when you can take a course, get rid of the place restriction on who can have access to it and really just make it work. And at that point, the question was,

how can we do this effectively? So I think we probably had the first online advanced placement course that anybody was offering, because that was the 89 academic year that we first started doing this. As we got going, technology kept pushing ahead, and so CD-ROMs became available, and people will find this amusing. When we first got our hands on something that would let us cut our own CDs,

It was $4,000 for the hardware. It was $3,000 for the software license that would let us write to the CD-ROMs, and the blanks were $45 each. But we did that and started doing multimedia. And we started doing lectures that would involve digitizing handwriting and capturing the audio, something that when Khan Academy came around three or four years later,

Ray Ravaglia (05:45.393)  
We had been doing this for a long while. Now, the other thing that we were doing, we realized that the time it takes to actually record stuff and produce it and push it out there, that's expensive, it's time intensive. So we started looking at, could we do this in real time? Could we do something with shared whiteboards and...

video conferencing but without video because nobody had video at that point. And so we wound up with a system whereby students would make two connections to us. One would be they would dial in on a modem to a system we had that would let eight people connect concurrently and share a screen. And then they would dial in a voice call into a PBX phone conference bridge so we could do the audio conferencing part. So we could do AV.

And this was back in 92, 93 that we were doing this and that was quite effective. And so we've just been itching from that point forward through how do we stay using the technology to make possible the kind of education that people want so that again, when you need something, you can get it and you don't have to worry about how old your kid is or where you're living that this just available. And so that was the problem we were trying to solve at that

Matt Bowman (07:08.955)  
Hey, let me chime in there raise super cool story. love that. Interestingly enough in 94, I started teaching middle school and so I totally understand what you're talking about and and then in 96, I got a grant to bring the internet into my classroom. I was teaching up in Washington state. You know, I'm sure it was probably Microsoft backed brand or something, but.

Ray Ravaglia (07:10.992)  
Absolutely.

Ray Ravaglia (07:19.76)  
okay.

Matt Bowman (07:36.292)  
super interesting to hear kind of your legacy story around you know late eighties early nineties and then i came right after that and so anyway kudos for being a pioneer in that space as wake will.

Ray Ravaglia (07:48.336)  
Thank you.

Ela Richmond (07:50.05)  
That's so fascinating. So Ray, back to this whole like, this is the 90s, right? Was this like a wild thing where people like looking at you and saying, what are you doing? This is weird.

Ray Ravaglia (08:00.499)  
Absolutely. mean, my joke was that at that point, it would take about five minutes to explain what it was we were doing. If somebody says, Ray, what are you doing now? You're graduated from Stanford, you're in grad school, you're working on this project. What is it? And then you'd sort of have to set the stage and really explain it. I mean, these days you'd say something like online learning and they'd get it. So it's been really fun to see something that was so on the fringe.

Ela Richmond (08:23.566)  
Mm-hmm.

Ray Ravaglia (08:29.543)  
becomes so mainstream that it's hard for people to imagine it being any other way.

Ela Richmond (08:36.684)  
Yeah, I'm curious, Matt, did you experience the same thing? So like you got a grant for this, right? To bring online into the classroom. Did you also experience parents pushing back?

Matt Bowman (08:46.895)  
not so much parents, just other teachers. It was super interesting that when they announced it, teachers were complaining that that grant was even available and, you know, saying we shouldn't do that. We shouldn't bring, you know, this weird thing online into the classroom. And I jumped at the chance and I just loved it. And so, yeah, there's always skeptics, but I think parents loved it because we started seeing the student engagement kind of go off the charts.

Cause you know, when they would do a project before they would, you know, their friend would see it, their mom would see it and I would see it. And so they kind of said, Oh, good. It's good enough for who it's for. Right. Whereas if we had a sister school in Germany and it was like swap your projects, they would spend hours on it, getting it better and right. Because someone up, someone out there would see it instead of just their mom and teacher. So I just loved having that ability to see the engagement that.

Another audience added to that mix created so yeah the the general sense was you know let's keep technology out of the classroom and still there's some you know some threads there. I remember to the sea you know CDs we were given all the CDs on sim city and sim roller coaster and all the sim tower.

You know, and kids just loved it. And I loved it. It was the most engagement on economics. And I was teaching social studies and language arts. These kids were just absolutely engaged in, you know, Sim City trying to create a city that's effective and, you know, works well for everybody. Like it was really fun.

Ray Ravaglia (10:31.891)  
And what I love about that too is just the moment that, know, anything that pulls them in so that it captures, you know, the mind share so that they're thinking about it. And it doesn't really matter so much what it is because ultimately it's the productive time thinking that is going to lead to get them better at thinking and is going to produce the skill acquisition, you know, even if they're not learning any new facts about anything.

You're gonna get better.

Matt Bowman (11:01.651)  
Yeah, I agree 100%. And you know, I joke the memories I have of teaching sixth grade, the parents would say this 11 and 12 year old kid, I have no idea what's going on in their mind or body. It's twitching, it's moving, it's, you know, they're awkward. And they're like, if you can get anything in that head, like good luck to you, right? And I fell in love with that 10 to 14 year old age group.

Uh, and really did a lot of research around that. My master's degree was focused on that forgotten child that we sometimes they're too old for elementary, but they're really too young for a seven period day, a thousand kids switch every 40 minutes. And so really this idea of that, that sixth grade is like the epitome of just help them enjoy learning stuff. Don't worry about the facts and the figures and the whatever. It's just like.

Let them experience the joy of discovery, of aha moments, of, and then they'll want to share it. And it's so fun to see that age group. So I just fell in love with teaching that age group. And it's cool that you started servicing that group,

Ray Ravaglia (12:14.547)  
Absolutely. I mean, what I find so interesting in listening to your story is, and this is what I found, because we made this move in the, you know, as the 90s rolled on into the 2000s, where we realized that when we started, everything was about individualized self-paced, anytime, anywhere. And the thought was, you know, just set people down and go through the material. They're going to learn the stuff. And what we found is that, yeah, they could accelerate for a while, but then they would lose interest and drift away.

Ela Richmond (12:44.171)  
Interesting.

Ray Ravaglia (12:44.317)  
but that if we could connect them with other students, that's what would keep them engaged for years. And you want to be able to say, dude, check this out. I mean, when you've learned something new, when you find something cool, if you create something you wanna show off, you need to have that interaction. And if it's missing, it's just, you know, it's ultimately not gonna be compelling.

Ela Richmond (13:08.526)  
Mmm.

Matt Bowman (13:08.933)  
I'll just insert there too, know, into the early 2000s, the big complaint about online education was that students aren't finishing, right? There was always, they had this big start ramp and to your point, they engage and then they just stop. And I didn't view that as a failure of the function. I viewed it as the learner got what they wanted, right? And stopped. And so it's not like,

Our whole goal is always to finish and get a credit or the finish and get the checkmark or certificate of the class. It's like, go as far as your brain is interested in learning that and move on when you're done.

Ray Ravaglia (13:53.939)  
Well, I mean, it's funny because if you were saying the same thing about, mean, know, kids go to the library and they pick these books up and they read a few pages and then they put them back on the shelves. Why would we have, I mean, you know, again, it's just the expectation of how a thing is being used is really going to set up the test for whether or not it's successful in its use. I mean, one of the things that I found, and sort of this is slightly tangent, but looking at satisfaction.

Matt Bowman (14:05.746)  
Right.

Ray Ravaglia (14:23.139)  
And it wasn't just the student satisfaction, it was the instructor satisfaction. We found that when we were doing things that were purely sort of individualized self-paced, where there was a big defined curriculum that students were working through asynchronously, we found our instructors would do everything they could to optimize and make it efficient and they'd build up stacks of answers to common questions.

Matt Bowman (14:47.987)  
Good

Ray Ravaglia (14:48.529)  
And they could whittle their job down to something that could be done in three hours a day. And then they would quit. Because at the end of the day, when you're just a tool of the machine, it's not enjoyable. You don't go into teaching to do that. When we went to synchronous classes where the instructors actually had to teach and they had to meet with the students live in video.

Matt Bowman (15:03.507)  
Right.

Ray Ravaglia (15:11.879)  
They'd complain about how much work it was. They'd talk about how inconvenient it could be to have to do this stuff at a set time every day. They'd never quit. They would be there year in and year out, and they really enjoyed it. They'd make these great relationships with their students. And the same way the students, the attrition rates for an individualized self-paced course, even kids who are gifted and really good at it, the attrition rate could run north of 30%. And once you got to the synchronous environment,

attrition was down around two to three percent because again, the relationships they would build and if somebody stops coming to class, their friends would hunt them down and ask what's up. If it's an asynchronous class and you stop engaging, people often don't notice until the end of term. And so this was just, and I think that's the thing that people forget when they're looking at education technology is at the end of the day, education is about the relationships with each other, with your professor.

And if you're not forming those, it's not going to be enjoyable. And the technology has to enable, can't interfere.

Ela Richmond (16:18.102)  
Interesting. Can you speak to that from a level of, okay, you've done online education, you were a big proponent of technology, and now you've realized that technology has a purpose. You are still a big proponent of technology, but now you've realized that relationships are core. Like, what is the role of each and how does that interplay?

Ray Ravaglia (16:37.137)  
Yeah, absolutely. know, 2005 is when I created the Stanford Online High School. And one of the things that we did at that moment was decide we were going to conduct this with synchronous classes. The kids were going to have to come together in real time to meet. And because we had kids, you know, theoretically around the world, it could be really inconvenient for some. But we knew that the payoff would be there because

they needed to see that there were other students, they needed to feel that they were part of a community. And what we found was that the technology was all about enabling rather than replacing. And I would say to the parents, look, if we had the technology to beam kids in, if we had Star Trek quality transporters, we could beam them into a seminar room and conduct it in person and then beam them home afterwards, we would do that. We don't, but what we have is the video conferencing that can approximate.

The other thing that we would find with the technology is, you know, it was easy to think, you know, when you're thinking of a school, it's easy to imagine someone saying, this school is great, the other kids are so interesting, the teachers are so engaging, the technology, you know, it crashes every once in a while, but I love this place. You can't imagine the other way. We're like, yeah, the other kids sort of boring, the teachers, I don't know, I've seen better.

But the immersive video conferencing technology is so compelling. I just want to be in the school. mean, it is the human factor is going to dominate.

Matt Bowman (18:05.907)  
you

Ela Richmond (18:10.936)  
That's interesting. So tech, in your opinion, makes things accessible. So back whenever you were talking about Stanford, it was this recognition that these kids could not access the calculus class, right? And that is the value that you were giving them. You were allowing them to recognize the things that they could possibly do and say, here, here are all these tools in your tool belt to go do what you could possibly do.

Ray Ravaglia (18:36.275)  
Yeah, exactly. First problem you solve is access. And then once things are accessible, what you need to do is ensure that the relationships are there because access without the relationships is going to unravel. the relationships are what are going to preserve and sustain and keep things moving forward.

Ela Richmond (18:56.504)  
I love that. How would you recommend a parent think about this? So you've talked about this a lot from the level of like an administrator, but like, how would you talk to a parent about thinking about their kid's education?

Matt Bowman (18:56.787)  
Thank

Ray Ravaglia (19:10.035)  
So, the first question is, what's the goal? And I would always tell parents, look.

Matt Bowman (19:11.379)  
Thank

Ray Ravaglia (19:19.923)  
If your goal is get them into an Ivy plus institution, just remember that getting in isn't what's gonna matter at the end of the day. They at least have to be prepared to be successful when they get there. And whatever they learn there has to prepare them to be successful in life. And that's where you're gonna start measuring whether the whole path was successful. What I would say to the parents is figure out

what problem you're solving and why you're bringing technology in to address it. And if you have a school, this is when I was doing online schools, I would always say, look, if you have a school nearby that you love, enjoy it, be happy. Most people don't. I mean, you're someplace where a school is meeting half of your need, talk to them about, my kid wants to come half time. And the stuff that isn't meeting your need, like say your kid's bath science off the charts,

we'll let them go to school and do the English and Humanities stuff, and then they go online and do the math and science three years ahead. Or the flip side, if they are sort of Dwight Global Online School, which is the second online school that I've created, which is modeled on a standard prep school experience, they have a lot of students who are very talented artists, athletes, dancers, what have you. They have serious.

Matt Bowman (20:42.899)  
you

Ray Ravaglia (20:45.511)  
know, substantive outside activities that they're pursuing, but they don't want to do it at the cost of a high quality education. So for those students, it's easy because the problem they're solving is how do I get something just as good as the prep school that I would have gone to, but that doesn't nail me to the desk so that I can go out and, you know, be on Broadway or I can go travel with my team when we play internationally, but still get the education.

So again, to the parent, it's always figuring out what's the problem you're trying to solve and how is technology actually solving it. Don't just embrace the technology because it's technology and you think it's cool.

Matt Bowman (21:26.791)  
Well, I just need to chime in. Ray, you just summarized the open education book. We've mailed you a copy. I hope you get a chance to read it. And when you do, you're going to see that what you just said is what open education is. And, and just for the audience, that's how we connected that. wrote a great article around intentional education and the rise of that and the need for parents to ask those questions of what is it?

What's the role that I'm hiring my schools to do for me and my children? And are they happy or not? Like those are some of the foundational questions. If yes, thumbs up, keep doing. If not, tap into what else might be available and mix and match the resources you have available in your community. And you did a great job of summarizing that Ray, so thank you.

Ray Ravaglia (22:17.971)  
Thank you. It's funny, I wrote an op-ed a number of years back called Fire Your School, which would just run through these questions. don't view them as somebody you owe something to. You're fundamentally their employer. If you're not happy, go in and make demands. And if you don't see the changes you want, go somewhere else. if people demand options and alternatives, they will look

those options and alternatives will appear. I mean, if the market need is there, the market will create the alternatives. And, you I find that, you when you talk about education, there's always this sort of like, is it, you know, a for-profit company? Is it a not-for-profit? What's going on? And, you know, what I find is that, okay, for-profit companies inherently have to operate to maximize shareholder value. I mean, that's what for-profit...

Ray Ravaglia (23:20.453)  
not-for-profits so often seem to want to maximize the political clout of their boards. I mean, they're not fundamentally worrying about the students. Unless there's something that is much more cooperative or if it's a family-run enterprise where some family has their personal reputation on the line, that's where you have some real responsiveness to individual consumer demand. But in education, so often,

the predatory for-profits and the sort of oblivious not-for-profits are really interchangeable when it comes to their ineffectiveness and their sort of unwillingness to respond to individual need.

Matt Bowman (24:04.755)  
just add to that that when we started open ed, my wife and I did in 2009. So right on the heels again of your 2005 launch and we saw we had five kids and they all needed something different and we thought other families felt the same. So we started open ed and it was interesting. I had gone to the Stanford executive business management program when I had worked in the tech industry and one of their principles was

lasting innovation, I'll never forget this lasting innovation, and this is from the center for social change from Stanford. Lasting change only occurs when there's a public private partnership. Because the public kind of has the stability and some resources and funding and the private can act and think quickly and differently. And the combination of those two is what makes lasting innovation. And that was the thesis of OpenEd.

So we contracted with school districts to run online learning for them because they didn't know how to do that. that partnership, that public private partnership, and I always say tax status doesn't matter. Like judge quality on quality, but don't judge it on tax status. That's the most ridiculous judgment of how to judge quality. So totally aligned there, Ray, that you can see good and bad on both sides equally.

Ray Ravaglia (25:18.023)  
Yeah.

Ray Ravaglia (25:22.931)  
Absolutely.

Ray Ravaglia (25:32.103)  
Yeah, no, I love your story. mean, having five kids that really and where they all need something different that nothing's going to cause sort of more awareness and sort of responsiveness than having that. when you look, is it available? It's almost never going to be available when it's five different things. And so, you know, creating it yourself and rolling it together the way you did, think commendable. Well done.

Matt Bowman (26:00.221)  
Well, and again, my wife and I thought all the kids were going to be the same because our house was the same. The rules were the same. The expectations were the same. We posted every Saturday, the job chart. It was the same. And our cadence and culture was very similar, but every child needed something different. And we didn't realize that. And, know, as they started getting older and they started needing something different, we ended up at one point had.

four different schools that the five kids were going through. And so we agreed that it was inconvenient for the parent to coordinate that, but our children were worth it. And so let's do what benefits them instead of what benefits us. And so that's a really, you know, it's a messy way to try to figure it out. And we say that over and over again in the book that there's no simple, easy roadmap. You just have to be intentional.

and think about it in a way that you embrace every child's unique and their education might need to be too.

Ray Ravaglia (27:04.401)  
Yeah, yeah, and that's very well said. And I think, that's what I found when doing that piece on intentional education, though, you know, had I seen your book ahead of time, and we may have had to call it open education. I may take you up on that. But what I found that was interesting there is sort of the recognition that, you know, the learning needs can be very individual, but they need to have interaction with each other.

Matt Bowman (27:17.363)  
Nice. You're free to use the term open education.

Ray Ravaglia (27:34.233)  
and that when you have kids together, figure out what the right way of doing things with them together is. And that's probably not all sitting at a desk listening to someone talk. I mean, that's just not the best use of having people in the same space.

Ela Richmond (27:42.606)  
Hmm.

Ela Richmond (27:52.59)  
That's fascinating. Can you elaborate on that so that I understand you correctly? You said there are going to be apparent differences between kids. You're going to do different things with them, but for the things that you do together, make sure they're the right things.

Ray Ravaglia (28:06.451)  
Yeah, I so it's, I'm looking at, you know, so say I am working with students in middle school age, late elementary school age, even high school, and I've decided, okay, we're gonna, you know, we're gonna break up and we're gonna be, you know, we're doing literature, we're gonna read novels, we're gonna talk about them. You know, rather than sort of pulling together everybody who is 14 and making them read the same novel, I mean, let us look at

sort of current levels of fluency and ability and, you know, sort of if you're the fifth child in a family of five, you probably have a pretty different sense of the world than if you're the first child in a family of three, say. You know, so assemble groups that make sense for the novel you're reading and do that. know, everybody could read their own novel individually, but part of the joy and part of the value of that sort of activity is discussing it with each other.

So you don't wanna do that as a separate activity. When you're doing something like, so say you're doing a theatrical production or you're doing some other sort of thing that involves natural group activity, well then it's probably a similar to kids who have musical talent and have them do something. If you're trying to get everybody to sort of realize their own level of ability, then again.

ability grouping makes sense and activities, you know, as I like to say, you can play team sports with the team. It's hard to play them individually. When you look at why group projects fail, so you often talk to kids about how much they hate group projects because they wind up doing all the work and the other kids are just sort of dragging along. Well, I mean, that's a design flaw for what the project was.

because it should be, know, good group projects should be like playing a symphony or it be like playing soccer where if you don't have the players on the field, if you don't have the instruments all engaged, you cannot play the piece, you cannot play the game. know, if doing something that is capable of having one person do all the work is just bad design. And I think that that's something that people are reluctant to really think through for whatever reason.

Matt Bowman (30:25.341)  
Yeah, let me add to that Ray one of the threads of themes in the book and in my life philosophically is that entrepreneurship is one of those things that creates a group setting that is naturally everyone needs to contribute in their own talent. you know, it's so fun to see kids organize groups. Now all of a sudden the one who reads and writes all the time.

is extremely valuable for your website. The one who codes all the time builds the website. The one who is always drawing and designing all of sudden has a place on the team. And you have this interdisciplinary group in an entrepreneurship setting that I have found is unlike any other group cohort you can find. When they're motivated to go build something that solves the problem.

Hopefully there's a dollar on the line that they can get. So you need the outspoken salesperson to, you know, and so you kind of get the, love entrepreneurship is one of the ultimate interdisciplinary team projects you can ever find.

Ray Ravaglia (31:31.987)  
I think that's really well said. it's also the only activities that really build empathy are things like that where you're trying to meet a need. So you actually have to figure out what the need is, as opposed to prescribing what it should be. If I give you a product and tell you to out and sell it, then you're going to make me think I need it. If I'm saying, here's some resources, I want you to figure out what the market wants. Go interview people, find out what they need, and then

Matt Bowman (31:49.575)  
Love that.

Ray Ravaglia (32:01.747)  
you know, build the company that creates it. I mean, that's really the thing that's going to build AMP.

Matt Bowman (32:07.411)  
Absolutely, I love bringing in the empathy part of entrepreneurship. Well said.

Ela Richmond (32:12.45)  
How did you figure all of this out, Ray? Was it just like watching people and like realizing over time?

Ray Ravaglia (32:19.635)  
Yeah, definitely a lot of hard earned experience, a lot of mistakes. I mean, the best way to learn things is to do it wrong and realize you've done it wrong. So collect the data, look at the data as it rolls in. Some of it too was as we were successful. So when we built the, when I built my first online high school, the thought was we want to be the best high school in the world, not

If you say we want to the best online school, you're going to make easy decisions that you'll come to regret later. But if you decide we want to be the best high school, then you need to figure out, OK, what problems are you solving and how are you going to get there? And then you look at who are your students. And initially, we were getting people who had really no alternative. they would get what Clayton Christensen would call the non-consumers, the people who they're desperate.

And so maybe they live in the middle of nowhere, they don't want to ship their kid off to boarding school, so they think an online high school, we're to give it a try. Over time, as you have success, you begin to seem like a real option for people who do have alternatives. And so you need to stay ahead of what are they expecting. So when you start getting people who could have gone to any number of good boarding schools, but have chosen to keep their kid home and put them in an online school.

You think of what are the things that they would have found at the boarding school that they would be missing if, now that they've gone on your thing, that the earlier students weren't looking for. And that's what leads you to do things like having a director of student life or something that you might not have had when you first stand up at school, but as you become more mature, you realize people are gonna be looking for that. Or initially, counseling support might just be...

one person who helps you do everything, over time you need to start specializing in the college admissions, strategizing counselors and academic planning things and so on and so forth. So a lot of it is just trial and error making mistakes. A lot of it is listening to people and anticipating what the customer needs are and racing ahead to make sure that you're meeting them before they're asking you why they're not.

Ela Richmond (34:44.28)  
That's fascinating. how would you categorize those non-consumers back in the 90s? They were the people that couldn't find anything?

Ray Ravaglia (34:51.077)  
I'll give you some very, the very first kid I admitted to the Stanford Online High School was, you know, he was a 12 year old, 13 year old young, but you know, the parents were desperate. They were running a successful medical practice in Arizona, but they were in a shut up shop and moved to Washington State to put him in the Robinson School at the University of Washington.

And then they found this and thought, this could be the solution. This could let us stay where we are in our lives and not have to disrupt the other children to meet our son's need. And they did and it worked. So that was one. Earlier had a student whose mother was running a medical practice, sort of this is in West, far West part of Idaho.

running a medical practice out of the home, and dad was a blacksmith. And the son was off the charts gifted in mathematics. I think he went on to Harvard. But for high school, he loved all of the freedom that living out in sort of the frontier gave him. But the parents felt they were really shortchanging him because they could not meet his educational needs with the options that were available. And again, we were the solution that let that happen.

Ela Richmond (35:56.91)  
Yeah.

Ray Ravaglia (36:16.947)  
And so those are the people who start off as the non-consumers, where it's just, it's an existential problem that they're solving.

Ela Richmond (36:26.36)  
That's fascinating. Something that we have seen with OpenEd, so Matt, you can speak to this too, has been that, so we have served a ton of homeschoolers, but especially after COVID, this subset of homeschool families that were non-consumers, so like they had issues in their public and private schools, they didn't do anything, and then COVID was like a breaking point for a lot of them. And it was like, okay, we need another option, we are going to pull them out.

Matt Bowman (36:33.351)  
it.

Ela Richmond (36:54.07)  
of what is not working and we don't know what the other solution is going to be because we don't have one yet, but we are going to try and create it. so like, I wonder, was that similar for you too? Did you see this like breaking point moment of like, we don't have a solution, but we're just going to, I don't know, figure it out.

Ray Ravaglia (37:11.911)  
Yeah, I think that they throw themselves to you out of desperation, hoping you can catch them because they know if they stay where they are, they're going to fall. And, you know, or it's like you pulling them out of the river. mean, I've had a parent once talked about this is like standing on the shore and you're pulling someone out of the river. What you need to figure out is how do you catch them before they fall into the river? And

Matt Bowman (37:12.445)  
Thank

Ray Ravaglia (37:42.428)  
So it's that kind of thing. definitely, I think it's also that.

When you talk to families that have homeschooled, mean, those are always my favorite families to work with because they have long ago given up on the idea that someone's going to solve their problems. They want to be an active participant in finding a solution. They will grudgingly give their child over to you once they have faith that you're going to do at least as good a job. know, and oftentimes you see that once the students start needing more advanced mathematics or something beyond the scope where the parent feels comfortable to teach.

But they've sort of made the realization that you cannot just stay with the status quo. The hardest thing are the people who, we had a student who, she was going to a very good school in the general Silicon Valley area, doing quite well in it. And she desperately wanted to come join an online school because as she explained to her parents, she was spending more than an hour a day getting dressed. And she just didn't want to have to do that anymore.

the social climate at her school was really debilitating. And that's not something the parents would necessarily have noticed. They were busy people. But she had eventually realized this was a problem. They realized this was a problem and so they saw, okay, this is gonna be a solution. And it's always that. And there's so much delight when you can help people solve these problems that just clearly make their lives better.

Matt Bowman (38:51.795)  
Thank

Ray Ravaglia (39:22.915)  
I that's what I've always said to parents too with educations. There are enough people giving children bad education experiences. We want to make sure that we're giving them good education experiences. If it's not working, tell us. And in general, I always tell anybody who's working for me as a teacher that the kids are infinitely capable. If they are successful, that's what we expect. In some sense, credit the parents, credit the something.

really own the failures, because that's the thing that you have the most control over, is intervene and make sure that they're not failing. You know, don't just say...

Matt Bowman (40:01.555)  
That's cool. go back to the girl example you shared. One of the chapters in our book is give the child a voice in their education decisions. And it seems sometimes that's a hurdle for some parents that they feel. And again, we're not saying just let, you know, a five year old do whatever they want. Like we have our, our open ed logo is an O, but it's brackets instead of the closed O.

Cause it's like, there's some framework there. Adults, you know, have a role, but give your child the voice, listen to them, see what they're saying about their education journey. And then another chapter that I think you'll like is, put your children ahead of your reputation parents. That's another stumbling block is that the parents want to be able to, just talk about their reputation instead of listening to their child's needs.

Ray Ravaglia (40:58.157)  
Absolutely. I mean, especially when you look at people who are forcing their kids to apply to and strive for Ivy plus institutions when the kids oftentimes don't want to be there. They want to actually, you know, especially if they know what they're interested in or if there's someone who wants to go someplace smaller and more intimate where the faculty are there to help develop their abilities rather than to do their own research and look at them as.

rushing taxes on their time. It's, you know, the parents need to like, calm down. And especially to there's a sense of failure, like if your child has been producing phenomenally high SAT scores, and then they decide not to go to someplace that demands phenomenally high SAT scores, you feel what you you've set yourself up. So now that you're now you act disappointed. And again, best fit.

people look for the best fit.

Matt Bowman (41:57.949)  
love that. Well said, Ray. Yeah, that voice needs to be amplified. Ella, that's a great, that's exactly what we believe.

Ela Richmond (42:06.72)  
No, I agree. Ray, I'm curious of your take and especially Matt's take. So Matt has this concept called an education designer, right? And he believes that parents are education designers. Like you get to design the education of your child. You were talking about how parents have responsibility and especially homeschool parents see their responsibility on this like really large scale. They have taken ownership of this title. I'm an education designer. I'm going to...

make sure that whatever it is that I put in front of my kid, it is the best thing possible. I'm paying attention to this. How do you help other parents become that? Because I would say that that is one of the harder things. Like when I just have conversations about education in the world, most people outsource their education, their kids' education entirely.

Ray Ravaglia (42:55.345)  
Yeah, I mean, so I sort of come at it backwards. What I would say to people is, look, when you have legal problems, you talk to a lawyer, you have medical problems, you see a doctor. For your education portfolio, your children's education choices, either really go out and find somebody who is a professional at that level of doctor and lawyer and not someone who works for your school because your school is managing a portfolio of which your child is just one piece.

And if everybody else gets into Harvard and your child fails, they'll be happy. So you have, what you're interested in is different than what your school is interested in. Understand that. So either you need to educate yourself in how to manage your own education portfolio and there are resources out there to help you do it. Or you need to find someone who is your private educational expert who you can turn to and who can work with you to manage the portfolio. But if you just sit there and passively

let your child go through the school system, there is no reason to think that they're gonna try to maximize his or her success.

Matt Bowman (44:03.133)  
That's powerful, Ray. And I think that's where you cited some of that in your intentional education article, which is, and I was going to add to Ella's comment on education designer, the role of parents, like it or not, right? Like it or not, you need to think about what's your education design strategy. Again, your point, Ray, if you want to do yourself, great. If you want to find help, great. But even since COVID and now, you know,

I want to spend just a minute on this, get your take on AI. AI is our next big driver of people coming to our program. And the reason is it's unsettling to see what the future looks like in a standardized road roadmap of schooling. It's leading to something that can be very easily replaced. So now parents are saying, whether I like it or not,

I've got to become an education designer or figure out how to do that because the traditional path I can't default to anymore. What's your take on the insecurity that AI is creating for parents looking in the future?

Ray Ravaglia (45:16.125)  
So, I mean, the point that I always make to people about AI is, I mean, AI is a tool.

So if you're someone who actually has something you're trying to do, and then you can look at it, you can be happy, it's a tool in your arsenal, it's something else you can deploy. If you're someone else's tool, I mean, if your existence is purely subordinated to helping someone else accomplish what they want to accomplish, then you should worry because unless you are markedly better than the AI alternative, at some point, you're going to be replaced.

You know, that's why as much as possible, get your own thing going, get out in front and have some ownership of what you're doing. You know, I would say too, is a, you know, any situation that lets a child just, you these days, if you give somebody an essay prompt and you just take an essay and you mark it up, that's just, you know, that's malpractice, frankly.

Matt Bowman (46:22.013)  
Yeah.

Ray Ravaglia (46:23.387)  
You know, so you either need to view it as a process. So I need to see all of your intermediate steps. And if you're using AI, include that stuff too. Show me your prompts, show me what you did to prime it. Tell me what you took from that and how you integrated it, et cetera. Let me see the intermediate stages, you know, or do the sort of thing that I think we'll see increasingly common is you'll see universities administering sort of blue book exams.

and make people write stuff out freehand. so make sure your child is comfortable writing with a pen or pencil for an hour or two and producing something coherent that someone can read because it may come down to that. So, and again, it's the what is going to be asked of somebody when they are producing that thing that will be assessed and then what is the learning process you're going through in order to develop the skills and knowledge, et cetera.

that ultimately is going to be fed into the thing doing the assessing. And I think that, again, unless districts and schools have clear policies and a clear plan on how this stuff is being incorporated, whether as a tool to be used or as a thing to be cautioned against and not to be used, it's the intentionality. Is there a plan? Do they have something that they are clearly communicating?

And then to the parents, are you happy and satisfied with what they are saying? And if not, look for something else. I mean, and that's why I think what you're doing, anything that brings people in with an eye towards them having some real say in what's happening with their child is going to be much better than just passively sitting there.

Matt Bowman (48:16.403)  
That's, we, we said a quote in our book that says, you know, at middle school or told her teacher, if you ask me something that AI can do, you shouldn't have asked it. I thought that was just, that was so clever of that middle school, student.

Ray Ravaglia (48:26.835)  
BFUFUFUFUF

Ray Ravaglia (48:32.239)  
Yeah, that's really fun.

Ela Richmond (48:37.442)  
Okay, so we're going to take a little bit of a twist in the conversation. We're going to follow the line of technology, which has been the theme of this conversation. Where do you think we are going in education? If you were to plot out like say in the next five or 10 years, do you have a vision in your mind of where education is going?

Ray Ravaglia (48:57.587)  
Where is education going? So, I mean, this is always the challenge of, you know, what are we educating people towards doing? I think that one of the things that will happen with the rise of AI is going to be a return to the value of non-digital skills. I think there'll be more appreciate, things like woodshop, I can imagine.

there being more appreciation for actually teaching people how to do stuff. I would imagine too that there will be, you know, it's going to be more attention to the process rather than the product. And this is where I think that, you know, AI and in particular sort of machine intelligence and observation has the real potential to have an impact.

If you think about sort of ideal education is always going to be one-on-one tutoring. And if I'm tutoring you to do something, I don't need to make you take a test at the end of it. I know if you know how to do it, you know, I can just watch you. And the problem is once I get a classroom full of people, there's no way I can watch everybody learning. And so at that point, I have to shift from paying attention to the process to sort of assessing the.

product using statistical sampling, is essentially what the examinations are. If we can get to a point where the cameras can reliably watch people in the learning process, we will have so much more information about what's going on and we can intervene at that optimal moment where you need to let people make mistakes, but you don't want them to make too many mistakes. So that is reinforcing the confusion. You want to

sort of give them the opportunity to catch it themselves and correct it. And then at some point, if they have it, you want to intervene. And then sort of what do they do next? Well, depending on the type of mistake it was, either take them back to some more constituent activity that they can go through to build up whatever thing fell apart. Or maybe it's sort of a shift. You know, if somebody has thrown 90 pitches and now they're missing the strike zone.

Ray Ravaglia (51:20.061)  
probably don't give them a different strike zone, maybe do something other than throw the baseball. So just contact shift, do other things so that you're productive in their use of time. I think too what we'll see with education is if we get more efficient in keeping people close to the zone of proximal development when they're working, so they're at that sweet spot. It's not that we're get six hours of sustained sweet spot concentration.

people aren't capable of that. I think we'll get more efficient in, if I can get you in the zone for one or two hours a day, I can let you do a bunch of other stuff as opposed to like this sort of fractional attention that I get from somebody in a traditional classroom. So I might have you chained to your desk for six, seven hours a day. But if much of the time you're just listening to me talk and not thinking about anything or thinking about something completely different.

That is not really high value activity.

Ela Richmond (52:20.366)  
How long do you think it'll take for schools to implement something like that? Because they are set up very, very differently than that.

Matt Bowman (52:22.768)  
Thank

Matt Bowman (52:27.364)  
Yeah.

Ray Ravaglia (52:30.311)  
Yeah, I think that that's probably 10 years out. think that it's, you know, someone will need to have easily deployable versions of the technology or a sort of killer app that everybody who sees it wants it and they start using it and that it has positive impact. know, one of the things that I was, the things I've been waiting for forever with

Matt Bowman (52:30.888)  
fun.

Ray Ravaglia (53:01.017)  
online learning is sort of if you look at emotional detection from like micro facial micro expressions. So this pretty well established body of science around that and being able to have someone, you know, an environment where every student is is on camera during the class and the machine is paying attention to what's going on and then feeding back to the professor.

you how much confusion is being expressed subtly, how much, you know, whatever other emotions you want to be tracking, you know, that is going to give you some insight into what's going on because, you know, if you're in a situation where you're talking to the class, unless you're paying attention to whether or not they're hearing what you are saying and hearing it in the way you are intending, you're not going to have the impact that you're hoping. And so,

All of that, that's sort of like, how do you get continual feedback so that you can optimize the use of time, which is always going to be the thing that we have in the shortest supply, and make sure that, you know, you want to make sure that the students are getting what they need when they need it. So 10 years and we need some killer apps.

Ela Richmond (54:23.118)  
That's cool. Do you find the last killer app that kind of like moved everything in was Khan Academy?

Matt Bowman (54:24.326)  
Thank

Ray Ravaglia (54:30.045)  
So, mean, Khan Academy is, there's much that is wonderful about Khan Academy. What I find more interesting than just the sort of straight up Khan Academy is their schoolhouse.world project, where you can get students to essentially run tutorial sessions for other students. And, you so here's the thing, Khan Academy, if you think about time people spend with working in the general Khan Academy,

Ela Richmond (54:42.157)  
in free

Ray Ravaglia (54:56.987)  
you develop a lot of information about that student's capabilities. And so the ones who are doing really well, why not invite them to then work with other students? And now you pay attention to what's happening there. And if they're doing a good job with that, well, that's a very strong signal for their capability. Because not only do they know the stuff, but they are good at engendering that knowledge in someone else. And at that point, why ever make that person take an SAT?

or any sort of standardized test because you have more data already from Khan Academy environment. And that's what I really, know, sort of like the killer app for Khan Academy is if they get to the point where they really let the students reveal as much about themselves as the machine has learned. And this is the other thing too. I can pay someone to go sit and SAT for me. That's just like buying four hours of someone's time. I'm not advocating that people do this, but

Ela Richmond (55:30.584)  
Interesting.

Ray Ravaglia (55:55.333)  
it's frauds that don't take a lot of time are pretty easy to perpetrate. If I have to produce 40 or 50 hours of sustained work in an environment, that's a lot harder to fraudulently deliver, you know, and almost impossible if you have sort of good technology. And so I think that at some point we will move away from things like standardized examinations just because there's so much

Matt Bowman (56:10.834)  
Yeah.

Ray Ravaglia (56:24.303)  
inherent problem with whether or not they're accurate samples and really reflect student knowledge to more sort of pervasive sustained measures. You know, it's like somebody who has white coat hypertension. So they go to the doctor's office and their blood pressure's off the charts. But if you put a continual blood pressure monitor on them, they're totally fine. You know, what is it that you want? You want to make them sit the SAT or do you want the continual monitor? I mean, for the sort of knowledge of students.

Matt Bowman (56:46.021)  
Ha ha.

Matt Bowman (56:54.803)  
No, that's great rain as we wrap up here, you know, want to do a plug for con Conmigo that Saul created on the AI side, describe some of what you were saying around knowing where to where to intervene, where to not. I think he's doing a great job on that because of so much data that he has to draw from. So.

Ray Ravaglia (57:13.843)  
Yeah, absolutely. And I think that as that starts getting deployed more aggressively into schools, there's a lot of potential there. The real question is going to be, how do you do it in a way that bolsters the relationships with students and teachers and that doesn't subvert them?

Ela Richmond (57:33.76)  
This has been an incredible episode. Thank you so much, Ray, for coming on the podcast. Thank you so much, Matt, for being a co-host and also a collaborator on this episode. This, I hope, is not the first and only time that you will see Ray. Hopefully we can do a couple more things with him. But thank you so much for coming on the episode today.

Ray Ravaglia (57:54.973)  
Matt and Ella, absolutely my pleasure. Thank you for having me anytime. Happy to come back.

Matt Bowman (58:00.947)  
Thanks, Ray.

Ray Ravaglia (58:02.119)  
Okay.
