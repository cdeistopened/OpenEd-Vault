## Final Cold Open: "The Medication System" (Hybrid Cut)

**Timestamp Segments:** [00:01-03:34] + [19:52-20:50] (Montage Style)

**Total Length:** ~45 seconds (edited)

**Structure:** Opens with shocking medication story, cuts to transformation insight, ends on cliffhanger about what's actually possible

### Edited Cold Open Transcript:

**Ela Richmond:** What got you interested in education to begin with?

**Ben Somers:** When I was 11, I had this teacher who was really frustrated that I was kind of like a foot tapper and wiggler. We had to go see a psychiatrist and I went on 70 milligrams of Concerta when I weighed like a hundred pounds. That's a really large dose of methamphetamines.

Now as an adult looking back, to fit into this model of how you're supposed to learn, you're supposed to just load up a hundred pound, 11 year olds with tons of drugs. I'm like, that seems really crazy.

**Ela Richmond:** Did you in the moment know that it was wrong?

**Ben Somers:** For sure. When I was 11, I was aware that when I took this pill in the morning, my day looked way different.

**Ela Richmond:** The purpose of the pill was just to keep you paying attention?

**Ben Somers:** It was really about the other kids. It wasn't about me. I was disruptive and probably talked a lot and was running around all the time. So it was to make it easier for the teacher to deal with the classroom. In my town that year, almost a quarter of all the boys in the school were on stimulants.

**(Swoosh Effect / Cut)**

**Ben Somers:** I've been surprised at how often kids you would label as unmotivated totally morph into absolutely those things in the right circumstance. You ask some kid who can't memorize state capitals and they can list all 372 Pokemon and which ones were a part of the different leagues and memorize them perfectly and all their moves. This doesn't make sense...

## YouTube Description

**Hook:**  
In 2025, we're still medicating boys at alarming rates just to make them fit a learning model designed for compliance, not curiosity. Ben Somers was put on 70mg of Concerta at age 11—not because he needed it, but because the system did. Now he's building the alternative.

**What's Inside:**

- Why a quarter of boys in Ben's school were medicated to comply
- The shocking business insight: what actually makes kids want to learn (it's not curriculum)
- How kids labeled "unmotivated" transform instantly in the right environment
- The Montessori principle applied to digital spaces and modern homeschooling
- Why parents should think of themselves as education designers, not teachers

**About Ben Somers:**  
Ben dropped out of high school and later worked at Synthesis School (the SpaceX school) before founding Recess, a platform where kids choose their own classes and make friends who share their interests. He's now building tools to turn screens from "bad" to "great" for families.

## Rough Transcript

Ela Richmond (00:01.116)  
Ben, welcome to the podcast. I wanted to kick this off with a question that I've been wondering ever since you and I started talking backstage. What got you interested in education to begin with?

Ben Somers (00:15.742)  
I was truant from grade six to grade nine and dropped out of high school. And I think that probably some, really didn't like school as a kid, but I spent a lot of time doing school and like worked pretty hard in it. And yeah, actually the other thing is that when I was 11, I had this teacher who was really frustrated that I was kind of like a foot tapper and wiggler.

and I'd move around a lot. And so kind of, we had to go see a psychiatrist and I went on 70 milligrams of Concerta, which is one of the drugs you can take at 11 when I weighed like a hundred pounds. And that's a really large dose of methamphetamines. And I think it developed some...

I was already like a little rebellious as a kid and felt rebellious in school. And then now as an adult looking back, I think this idea that to fit into this model of how you're supposed to learn, you're supposed to just load up like a hundred pound, 11 year olds with tons of drugs. And I'm like, that seems really crazy. And there has to be a better way than that. So I guess something about, I felt wronged during my school process, but I liked learning and liked a bunch of my teachers. And so I can imagine a version that's much better.

Ela Richmond (01:33.562)  
Yeah, that's crazy. Did you in the moment know that it was wrong or like know that you didn't enjoy it?

Ben Somers (01:38.36)  
for sure. Do you know how much 70 milligrams of methamphetamines are? If you're 100 pounds and you take that, you're you're really going and like you have anger issues, you have all these things, you're like crazy constipated. Like there's like a ton of...

Ela Richmond (01:44.217)  
No.

Ela Richmond (01:52.134)  
Wow.

Ben Somers (02:04.75)  
There's a ton of side effects. Yeah, and it actually like, we went to an endocrinologist years later, whatever, and it had some effects on like my puberty and things like that, but they think, they don't really know. The causes there are questionable. But for sure, when I was 11, I was aware that when I took this pill in the morning, my day looked way different.

Ela Richmond (02:22.488)  
Wow. And like the purpose of the pill was just to keep you like paying attention and what you needed to be in school or like?

Ben Somers (02:31.31)  
I think that was not, I mean, had tons of great teachers. My fifth grade teacher was not good. I think there, it was really about the other kids. It wasn't about me, which I like understand. You know, I think I was like disruptive and probably talked a lot and was running around all the time. And so it was like to make it easier for the teacher to deal with the classroom and make it a better experience for their kids. What's funny is in my town that year, I think like almost a quarter of all the boys in the school run.

Stimulants. Yeah.

Ela Richmond (03:01.852)  
Wow. Wow, that is not good. And then as you got older, right, like you started looking back on your journey, you started kind of understanding, this was my experience especially, which I wonder if you can relate to. I started looking back on my journey and being like, wow, I definitely could have done that differently or there could have been improvement points. like, I wonder what I would have become now even. Like I'm entirely happy with who I am, but like.

But like, wonder who I would have been if my education looked a little bit different or like if I was approached a little bit differently, like the classic, I always struggled with the classic. I think I'm bad at math, right? But like, what if you're not and things like that.

Ben Somers (03:45.24)  
Really? Yeah, I think there's only two reasons you work in education, maybe three or like you were unchanging education. Right. If you're specifically working on building something that changes the system, either you had a bad experience and you can imagine a version of yourself that's better than you are now. And you want to build the education that would have produced that version of yourself. And maybe the second is.

that you felt you had a particularly good schooling experience and you want to bring that to more people. But if you're working on net new things, I think it means you can imagine a version of yourself that's better than you are now. And that definitely is true for me.

Ela Richmond (04:27.59)  
That's interesting. So let's talk about that as we explore your journey. So did you do any education things before recess or was recess like your first foray into education?

Ben Somers (04:39.214)  
I did small stuff, think, growing up here and there. I take a really broad view of the word education, like what it means, but you know, I think like coaching sports is related. I'm doing, you know, tons of different things. Playing games with your friends can be related, but traditional education, I did some tutoring in high school and college and some debate coaching, but then three, four years ago, I went to work at a company called Synthesis School.

which makes these team simulation games for kids and like a kind of an AI math tutor, really a digital math tutor, not really an AI math tutor, but a digital math tutor. And yeah, I decided to work in education after building a company with my brother and wanted something I could work on for like 40 years. And so I picked education as a problem and then went to go work for the smartest people I could find. And I thought Josh Don and Crispin were both really good options. Josh had...

built this school at SpaceX and done this really cool work. Chrisman had collaborated and made these great stories called the conundrums and built tutoring companies in the past. And I was just a really smart guy. And so I went to go work there and learn from them and hang out with them and follow Josh around and annoy him at times. yeah.

Ela Richmond (05:56.816)  
What would you say that you learned from them there?

Ben Somers (06:01.934)  
It's really good. I wrote a bullet point, like a 30 bullet point or 40 bullet point doc or something of just like, are all the things I learned from there and sent it to Crispin afterwards.

I learned a lot of things about company building.

They're really interesting seeks the company grew really quick. went from, you know, like zero to 20 million in two years, and then all the way back down to 3 million after a crazy product pivot, and then interest its way back up to 10 million ARR. And it's been like a, it was a cool, um, Christian in particular is, is really comfortable with his back against the wall. And he, uh, is like just very fearless and like endlessly optimistic and.

I saw kind of the power of that and like how many problems come up, even if your company is interesting and cool and good and you've got great investors and great backstories, just how hard... So I learned something about that, just like the need for total perseverance that I think was crazy valuable. I learned a lot about education from, I mean, it was a cool place because I think it was like the Mecca for two years of people who, was like right as COVID hit,

this great company launches that's got this cool backstory with SpaceX and it's this new way of teaching kids things and like teachers could work with it. And so, and everyone's looking for part-time income as these teachers. And so I think it was like the Mecca for all of these great forward thinking teachers. And so I learned a ton from them, just details about how to make a kid feel seen and like how to use the after class time to pull them aside and get them to do things and how to, how to.

Ben Somers (07:44.148)  
motivate a room of people and tell a story that gets everyone excited and all these things. And Josh was particularly good at making kids feel like whatever they were doing was really important. He was really good at like whatever we were doing as a group, this is, this matters. And he would really get everyone to buy in. And so there's a whole lot of that stuff that I think I picked up that was really valuable. That I say is like a thousand tiny skills.

I'd go on this for a while. I learned a lot of stuff since this was a really good experience.

Ela Richmond (08:15.42)  
How did it evolve your understanding of education? So you work for this top education company, right? And obviously it influences what you're going to do next, right? Which is recess.

Ben Somers (08:28.3)  
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, what were the insights that led to what I'm working on now?

Ela Richmond (08:34.417)  
Mm-hmm.

Ben Somers (08:37.454)  
There were two core insights that were very specific, I'd say, and then other ones that like like I walked away from saying, I'm going to start a company around these ideas and this thing I learned. And then now I look back and it's like, oh, there's other stuff that philosophically made its way in. But the first was that the number one predictor of retention. And this is a business metric, but also a learning metric.

was if the kid had a friend in their class. So it wasn't who the teacher was, whether they were Illinois teacher of the year, or they were one of the Josh Mo's who didn't was not, didn't, didn't work out great at synthesis. That didn't affect retention that much. if you want a ton of games or lost a ton of games, didn't affect retention that much. There were all these things that you'd expect, which game you were playing, you know,

If you're playing a fun game or a bad game, because the games are different, some of them are really great, some of are bad. That didn't make that big of a difference. And like, those are crazy. I would have put all of this first, but it really, if you had a friend in your class, if you were in your class, you stuck around forever. If you didn't, you turned in three to six months. And that struck me as being a big deal because you got to make your business work if you're in education and you got to figure out how to do that. so, and then my anecdotal experience was that

Ela Richmond (09:48.121)  
Wow.

Ben Somers (10:01.614)  
The kids performed way better when they had a friend in the class. They could take criticism from the teacher or from their peers way better when they had a friend in the class. They would talk about it sometimes when they weren't in the class. So they actually were progressing because they were thinking about it in their free time or talking about it in their free time. They're like all these things or making maps in their free time because they would make it and send it to their friend. And there were like all these things that were, I was kind of shocked by how much a good social experience led to a better learning experience.

and a better business model. And I was like, that's really interesting.

We spent, at one point, like, I wanna say $10 million a year on games. It's probably $10 million a year on engineering as a whole, so maybe like $7 million on games and like that. And.

the games had less of an impact on retention than Friend in a Class, which is close to free.

So from a business perspective, I was like, that's really, we really gotta laser in on this and make this experience really good. And then the learning one was true too. So that was the first part. Everyone was sleeping on friends, like a lot, both to make their products sticky and fun and good and to make the learning experience better. The second was the kids had a man disorder recession once a week.

Ben Somers (11:27.791)  
And then they had, they could choose from a list of events for the rest of week.

and the feeling in the mandatory class and the chosen class I taught both was really different.

And the chosen class just felt like electric. Like every kid wanted to be there. Every kid wanted to be there. They didn't have to go there. The parents weren't paying for that session. They chose to be there. And their level of commitment, their level of drive, their like skill in the game, what you could do in a session was so different that I then had this second thought of, kid buy-in matters a lot more than we.

treat it than we like to think about it. And there's, don't know, other than homeschooling, I don't really know of any good model that works in kid choice as a very serious part of their curriculum design, pedagogical design, you know, at best they like pay lip service to it and let them pick a project they work on for 30 minutes a day for a month or something. So anyways, the two core insights that led to Recess were, which you'll catch the name, you hang out with your friends a lot at Recess and you get to choose what you do.

and so that's what led to recess is a place where you could choose what you do and you'd meet lots of cool people and you could hang out with them whenever you want. And so if you were a kid in Idaho, who was really into building circuits and crazy Minecraft contraptions and cool products, you could find other homeschoolers from around the country who did that kind of stuff. Or if you're someone who loved publishing books, you could make other friends who like doing that and making art and you could, one of you could do cover art and the other one could write it and then one could

Ben Somers (13:13.144)  
copy, it, and then you could publish it on Amazon or whatever. kids are that kind of stuff on recess all the time. And, that's what, yeah, those are the two core insights that led to the product that we've made this far.

Ela Richmond (13:25.446)  
That's really fascinating, especially because like, I mean, what is the topic that I hear kids bring up like all the time today? It's Roblox. And why is it Roblox? It's because they're playing with their friends most of the time, or like they're meeting people.

Ben Somers (13:33.826)  
Yeah. Yeah.

And, and it's a, it's one of the only game platforms. on iOS, they can't download apps that a lot of kids can't download apps they don't without their parents. So you either have to get approval to pay for the app or you can just to download it. Roblox is actually just a giant app marketplace. It's hidden as if it's a game. ever, we all think it's like a game. If you open it up, it's 10,000 games and the kids get to pick which ones they want.

Ela Richmond (14:04.208)  
That's really fascinating.

Ben Somers (14:06.062)  
So both a place where you hang out with your friends and a place where you get to choose what you do with total freedom.

Ela Richmond (14:12.518)  
That's really fascinating. I hadn't thought of that before. So how have you taken all of these insights and put them into recess? have there been any things that surprised you as you've built out recess? is it like, yeah, I'm curious to hear what that looked like, what's really working, and questions that are stumping you right now.

Ben Somers (14:40.482)  
Yes, really good questions.

Ben Somers (14:48.43)  
So what it like at recess now is they, recess started as basically once a day, as close to the word recess as we could get, once a day at the same time every day, a whole bunch of kids would log on and we would use something like Gather Town and they could run around and talk to each other and hang out and meet each other. And I would like place games down and they could convene around the games they wanted to play. And that was how it started. So it was like,

just a place to go spend time and have there be a bunch of other kids. Now the way the friend thing and the choice thing, they work really in hand in hand. And there's a big marketplace of classes and the classes are run by YouTubers and they're run by like people who are professionals in their field. they, the interesting thing about recess is your parents can't sign you up for any classes.

the kids pick the classes. But there's a second trigger. So the kids look through this marketplace and so all the thumbnails are really exciting to them. how to, it's not, know, learn circuit design and learn the basics of circuit design. It's how to build a trap door in Minecraft. It's, you know, how to become a favorite TV. How to write a show for your favorite TV show, how to do this thing, right? And so they're

presented in a way that kids are very excited about them. Because the only way you sell the class is if the kid wants to click on it. And then the second part is the kid requests it from their parent and then their parent can approve or deny the request. And so there's no such thing as a kid being in a class they don't want to be in that doesn't exist on the platform. And so every room you go into, everyone wants to be there. And there's no such thing as a parent paying for a class they don't value.

Ela Richmond (16:20.006)  
Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (16:42.598)  
cool.

Ben Somers (16:42.998)  
And so there's this, there's this nice double trigger where, so that I think it's put the, and it puts the kid in charge of a lot of trust from the parent. The second part about the friends is when you join a class, you're going to meet one, everyone wants to be there and they all like the same stuff as you. Right. So you already are going to share, have a lot in common with them. And after the class is over, we basically like, you get suggested friends of all the kids you just met and you can like add them as a friend. And then we get you like a discord style chat.

where you can chat with them and call them and hang out with them and play games with them. And then you can see what classes your friends are in. So you can organize and easily schedule joining up with them. so there's another cool, so those are the two main parts of like, does this manifest kids pick the classes and parents prove them. And then we use the classes to help the kids make friends who like the same stuff as them, and then give them great, great tools to keep going. And then what's cool is things kind of like will trend.

Ela Richmond (17:35.751)  
That's cool.

Ben Somers (17:42.688)  
on recess, so like one kid will get really into this engineering thing or making these kinds of videos, those papers engineering thing, and one of their friends will see and they'll join that class, and then one of their friends will see and they'll join that class, and now you've seen three people just join that class this week and it kind of like becomes popular, and so you, it's cool, I think there's some waves of motivation that come over, and I think it helps because it helps make.

topics that might not normally be picked up by kids like become more popular.

Ela Richmond (18:17.788)  
That's really, really fascinating. So what have you been surprised by on this journey? So obviously you started very differently than where you're at now, but like, have there been any things that have surprised you about either the way that kids use the platform or like how people want to learn?

Ben Somers (18:23.502)  
Thanks.

Ben Somers (18:38.19)  
think on that front, not so...

much. mean, think there's kids use the platform. We launched this jobs feature and kids were going to hire. We were like trying to make a mini economy. So you like hire each other and pay each other and get someone to make your book cover and stuff. And I was surprised at how much kids like to fire each other. I didn't see that coming. So we had to take that feature away. It's a small number of kids like to fire people, but the same people who wanted to post jobs were the kids who wanted to fire people.

I there's a way to make that work. don't know what it is, but...

Ela Richmond (19:15.004)  
That is so

Ben Somers (19:27.0)  
I think I'm continuously surprised by...

Ben Somers (19:38.584)  
how like a lot of people would try to label kids as being like motivated or diligent or ambitious or whatever or curious.

Ben Somers (19:52.994)  
And I've been surprised at how often kids you would label as none of those things totally morph into absolutely those things in the right circumstance. Like when you get them going about their thing, and like we all know this intuitively, like you ask some kid about who like can't memorize state capitals and then you ask them and can list Rattleoff.

all 372 Pokemon and which ones were a part of the different leagues and like memorize them perfectly and like all their moves and it's like this doesn't make sense like you can't remember 50 things that are pretty easy but

Every time you like either help it happen or see it and can do something with it, think it's it's it's just always surprising. And sometimes you can like. So something about that feels slept up.

Ela Richmond (20:44.892)  
That's interesting. What do you think that means? So like, there's a lot of criticism around homeschool approaches, more unschool approaches, right? Like, let your kid do a lot of what they like. And this probably depends on the kid and their personal interests, their self-directedness. It probably depends on the kid.

Ben Somers (21:00.824)  
Yeah.

Ben Somers (21:05.41)  
Yeah.

Ela Richmond (21:11.91)  
But there's a lot of criticism around an unschooling approach, because it's like, OK, but in life, there are things that you have to do, right? And like, for example, you might not want to memorize the 50 states, but at some point, yeah, or taxes, yeah, exactly. There are some things that you have to do. And I've heard the criticism quite often that, like, are you preparing kids for a world where they don't feel like they have to do the things that they have to do? I'm curious to hear your take on the balance between

having them figure out what they're interested in and fostering that and really, really promoting that as a thing that is valuable. Yes, you're interested in Pokemon and that's the coolest thing ever, but then also, okay, well, math, right? How do we make that really, really interesting? Or maybe it's history. Yeah, I'm curious to hear your take on that.

Ben Somers (22:07.286)  
I have a few thoughts. The first is.

Ben Somers (22:20.206)  
Ben Somers (22:24.088)  
things have a reason. And I, I think it's useful if you can attempt to figure out what the reason that you do things are. Like I'm particularly bad at doing things I don't want to do or that I don't think matter or things that I have to do. And I like, I don't entirely reject the premise. I do think there are things you have to do, but I'm way more willing to pay.

my taxes when I think about the purpose of taxes and the purpose of a country and what it means to be a citizen and all these things. And like, when I start to think about them, even though I don't like doing the paperwork and these things, but at the same time, I think like, this is where good entrepreneurs come from. You're doing your taxes and you're like, this is a total nonsense. Like, why do I have to do it this way? And someone is like, well, maybe you don't have to, maybe we could make something that would make it simpler to do this.

And maybe we make something to make it even simpler to do it. And I can imagine TurboTax getting to the point where, you know, I think they actually lobby to keep it complicated. um, so I don't know. I've, I've mixed opinions about it. I do think a small amount of discipline. I think like discipline training is a useful thing to learn. And I think you can train discipline in a bunch of different areas and you can train discipline.

And sometimes I think you, there's something to learn about when you can rely on an expert authority and when you can't rely on an expert authority and when you can rely on an expert authority, you don't always have to ask why if you really trust them. So I don't know, like it was a very long answer, but I, I certainly, we do a bunch of full school for kids or have a handful of kids that basically is just like a full school. And for sure they're doing

rigorous math practice every day, even if they don't want to. And they're occasionally doing reading comprehension tests to see if that's going well, even if they don't want to. So as radical as I am, I still think there's room for that stuff. Then my second answer, I know I'm rambling a couple of times on these questions. You ask good questions. So I'm like, have a lot of thoughts. The second part is kind of the Montessori idea, which is like, I actually don't.

Ela Richmond (24:37.968)  
No, this is great. This is great.

Ben Somers (24:49.836)  
really think kids should play Pokemon. I think it's like a pretty bad game from a learner design standpoint. And there are other games that are similarly fun and exciting for a kid that have a lot more, have you do a lot more problem solving and logic problems or other types of problems in them and have more transferable skills. And I think this is where Montessori was really smart. She really wanted to give the kid a lot of freedom and have the kid learn independence and learn

self-motivation and how to focus themselves and all those kinds of things. And so she would let the kids choose whatever they wanted within a curated environment. So you couldn't bring your toys from home in. But anything she had in her space, you you could take out and play with. There were these materials that she had custom designed that would like help scaffold the kids' knowledge.

and build upon each other. when they came up, you know, when they moved to the next one, there was kind of new things for them to learn. when given that curated environment, the kid earns a lot more freedom. And I think this is similar to like, if you grew up in a, in a nice town that's super safe, where your parents are, spend a lot of time, they don't have to really well educated, but they spend a lot of time learning, working, doing interesting things. They have good value systems. the kid can have a ton of freedom from the time they're eight years old. They can walk.

Ela Richmond (26:15.602)  
Mm.

Ben Somers (26:16.91)  
four blocks to their friend's house, they can use their time in interesting ways. I think if you grew up in other environments where there are like tons of bad influences around and lots of negativity and potentially even violence, don't get a lot of, you shouldn't get a lot of freedom as a kid. And so the better you can make the environments, and this is where I get super obsessed is the digital environment. think there's like this idea that screens are bad.

Ela Richmond (26:36.038)  
Yeah, I actually love this.

Ben Somers (26:47.01)  
Like almost every parent I know with a kid under 10 is like terrified of screens. Has like a lot of anxiety about them, frustrations about them, doesn't want their kid on them, worrying about how much time to spend on them. And I think there's like totally, I think it makes sense and it's really sad.

Ela Richmond (27:08.444)  
So speak to that a little bit, because that was one of my questions as you were talking. I love this idea of curating the environment and then having kids earn a higher level of freedom as they get to it. But how do you determine when is the right point to expose them to things that are highly addictive? Because that's the issue with technology. It's not that technology is bad. It's a tool, right? But then if you give your kid access to a tool that has a lot of potential,

They could use YouTube for tutorials. They could also use YouTube for a host of other things that you don't want them doing. And so from your perspective, where does technology fit in? And do you see that in light of how you were thinking about Montessori, or has it kind of evolved from there?

Ben Somers (27:44.078)  
Totally.

Ben Somers (28:00.384)  
If you are a crazy involved parent who spends a lot of time with your kid and is nearby them with the screens all the time, and you use your screens in a really great way so you don't model behavior of watching TikTok on the couch for 45 minutes, but you do model pulling them over and showing them how to build something in CAD or that you wrote a short story or that you did these things. And you're going to like talk to them about the pitfalls of where tech can get dangerous.

I think you can give them like a ton of freedom really young, really, really young. If you are the 99.8 % of parents who have a lot of other stuff going on and you are not going to dedicate probably what is a full-time job to curating their screen time, then I agree with them that I don't really know when like,

Three doesn't seem like a good time. Seven doesn't seem like a good time.

12 doesn't seem like a great time. 15 doesn't seem like a great time. And then 18, you gotta stop doing stuff for them anymore, so I guess they can do whatever they want. So I don't know, that, yeah, if you're not gonna be, so yeah, you can't rely on the tech to.

raise your kids correctly or to teach the kids how to use them safely. They will not do that. That really has to be you. Or you work on the thing I'm working on, which I hope will have this effect. Like for the YouTube example that you're giving, there's a segue into this thing I'm building now. The super long story short is you download an app on your iPad and it turns your iPad from bad to great. It goes from like,

Ben Somers (29:58.658)  
something you really are nervous about giving your kid to something you are absolutely hyped to give your kid. And they're coming to you at the end of the day and teaching you all these things they learned and you're excited about it and it's a very different way of kids interacting with screens. And we do that by relying a lot on AI for sure. using one of the things that AI is really good at is kind of mimicking.

text, like parroting something or translating it. Like if you want to like translate a document, it's really good at that. If you want to say, so, or for example, for us, if we can get a, if we can get a good description of a parent's values, their value system, whether that be that they're really into faith and they want faith to be a big part of their kid's life, or they really want their kid to develop strong technical skills, or they want them to have a strong moral backbone in this area or whatever, you know, they can, they can kind of just, if we can get a good picture of what their value system is.

I actually think we can have, and we're doing this now, AI is kind of like help the kid discover the internet within the confines of their parents' And so same as if I was looking up tons of cool sites and sending them to you as a parent, and you'd be like, I don't like this. I like this. I don't like this.

Ela Richmond (31:10.332)  
That's interesting.

Ben Somers (31:25.864)  
we're gonna basically try and like automate that and then give you as a parent samples and experiences that make you feel connected to your kid's screen time so you understand what they're doing on it so it's not a mystery to you. And then you can just tell if this thing is working and you trust it to do what you're, know, help you parent your kid. It's kind of like a digital companion for you on the iPad that makes the iPad good.

Ela Richmond (31:49.51)  
That's really fascinating. Yeah, that's really fascinating and it aligns with. So we recently compiled all of the ideas that Matt Bowman, who's the founder of OpenEd, had kind of put together through years of building OpenEd and then also being a, he was a teacher for a long time. He was a homeschool dad for a while. And so he and Isaac put together this like this vision of what education can be. And it's basically like,

Education should be mix and match. Like mix and match aligned with your values and your priorities as a family and a child's individual personality, their interests, their strengths and weaknesses. And like, if for you as a parent, like this is what always scared me. So personally, I never thought I'd be a good homeschool mom. Cause I always thought homeschooling was I'm gonna sit in front of, you know, a whiteboard and I'm going to personally be the one to teach you every single subject forever.

Ben Somers (32:22.956)  
Yeah. Totally.

Ben Somers (32:45.772)  
Yeah, totally.

Ela Richmond (32:48.922)  
And that never excited me. Like I'm not a teacher. I don't think I could explain it well. I think I'd get frustrated. like, and really expanding my idea to, okay, I'm not necessarily having to open myself up to being the teacher and everything. Rather, I'm becoming like an education designer. It's like, what could my child's education become? And I'm designing the education that like, aligns with our values, that aligns with them.

Ben Somers (33:09.165)  
Yes.

Yes.

Ela Richmond (33:18.226)  
and that becomes something that can help them to become who they could possibly be, kind of back to what you and I were talking about. You get into education thinking, oh, if I had these different experiences, who could I possibly be? And as a parent, you now get to look down at your kid and you're like, okay, who could you possibly be? Let's figure it out. And that is infinitely more exciting to me than the alternative of this either or. I'm gonna pick.

this path and it's going to be like, this is it. And I think examples like what you were talking about where these things get to be aids to you, right? Like you get to ask questions and figure it out and like, you're not alone on this process. It's not like, okay, find one curriculum and let that be it. like, you know, read this book and then you'll be an expert. It's like, okay, I'm gonna pick the very best thing for math for this week. And then maybe next week it'll change and maybe, you know, and it's like, it is this much more dynamic.

process, which is kind of scary for a lot of people, but it's to me a lot more exciting.

Ben Somers (34:23.468)  
I think you're gonna remove the fear too.

I think the removing the fear, I think is, is there's a, there's a product that's missing that would remove the fear, which is a more like they're in school. They have these things called learning management systems and they're for, they're really built for the administrator, not for the kid.

Ela Richmond (34:27.77)  
Wait, it's

Ela Richmond (34:41.969)  
Yes.

Ben Somers (34:51.222)  
And so they're built to like keep track of a whole class or a whole grade, like a whole grade year and to notice trends in the grade year. And then they, there's a little bit there to kind of like make sure the kid didn't miss assignments or track attendance or do, you know, maybe like notice that they've fallen behind in something.

Ela Richmond (34:59.472)  
Mm-hmm.

Ben Somers (35:17.07)  
I think you can, there are examples in a handful of tech tools now that are really good. Like there's this one called Math Academy. I don't know if you guys have that in your marketplace, but you definitely should. And I'll connect you to the guy who runs that. He's super cool and smart and he was a teacher. But.

that have

Like school treats all knowledge like it goes in a line. And so it's really scary as a homeschool parent because if you don't want to go in that line, then you are no longer on the same track as school and you can't compare yourself to the school benchmarks anymore.

Ela Richmond (35:47.622)  
Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (35:58.162)  
Mm-hmm.

Ben Somers (35:59.532)  
And so that's really scary because it's like, if we deviate from this line, we're kind of flying blind.

And I think in reality, knowledge is not.

ordered in a straight line. It's ordered in a big complex graph of ideas that are connected to each other in different ways. there are prerequisites and post-requisites, but it's much messier. And there's like many different ways to get to the same idea. And some ideas rely on a bunch of ideas, others you can skip right over. what I think is missing is

a really good tool that kind of maps the kid knowledge in a more open-ended and less linear way and is backed and connected to standardized test scores, which I think a lot of parents and homeschoolers don't like. But I think you can actually build a system that allows for rabbit holes and offshoots and tangents and a totally different way of going about it and still have it feel really clear about, you know.

Ela Richmond (36:56.408)  
Interesting.

Ben Somers (37:13.856)  
All the knowledge that you that that you're supposed to acquire in school and what your kid has acquired thus far and what they're not going to acquire and what they will if you get on this path. And if you're missing this knowledge, here's a really clear and easy way to go get it. If you do want to kind of go back into the physical school or to the traditional school. So I think this product is broadly missing. And if, and we're, know, this is part of the thing that we're making for the browser is like part of what we think is making the right environment.

for the kid to exist on the screen is for it to, to have a good experience with their computer with this tool is like, to have it build a lot of confidence and make it really clear for the parent about how they're using their computer, how it's affecting their learning and where they can go. I think the computers are uniquely good at kind of measuring and mapping this kind of stuff compared to even if you had a human sitting next to the kid 24 seven, it would, the human wouldn't do as well as a computer would do.

Ela Richmond (38:06.204)  
Yeah.

Ela Richmond (38:11.782)  
Yeah, this is interesting because this was the very first thing that was like, think everybody that saw that first Khan Academy video of Sal Khan sitting with, I think it was his son, right? On the iPad. That was the very first aha moment that everybody had of like, wow, what could possibly be the future of education? And I think that there's something so important there because there is this shift happening where like,

Ben Somers (38:21.676)  
Yeah. Yeah.

Ben Somers (38:34.019)  
Yeah.

Ela Richmond (38:39.812)  
in the past education was this thing that you entirely outsourced, right? was maybe not in the way past, but like in...

Ben Somers (38:47.118)  
Yeah, way past there was something you didn't did all yourself and then you outsourced it all.

Ela Richmond (38:51.268)  
Yeah, yeah, exactly. And so like, we've been in this kind of movement of, outsourcing education is the way to go. But like, it's not working for a lot of families. And a lot of families are not aligning with, you know, the curriculums that they're choosing or more like in your case, some families are seeing their children being mistreated by the system. It's not set up to treat their kid properly. And so like, they're creating this new

Ben Somers (38:59.363)  
Yeah.

Ela Richmond (39:20.466)  
paradigm where I think parents are becoming education designers. And I think my hope at least is that like this opens up a new conversation about kind of what you were saying where where parents need different information if they're education designers, right? They need information about like, what do my kids want? What do my kids like? Where are my kids struggling? Like they need different kinds of information to fill those gaps. And like

And they also need to be connected with the solutions to those things. So if they are this in between, this person that is like diagnosing and also trying to fix, something that I love to bring back is this phrase I heard from, think, actually I forget who it was. were like, the person most invested in making your child successful is the parent, period.

because they're the one that has to live with them, they're the one that has to experience them all day long, they're the ones that later in life, know, whenever they are successful, get to look back and be like, all right, we're good, right? Like they're the closest to wanting this kid to succeed. And so like empowering them to be able to make these decisions is really, really fascinating.

Ben Somers (40:31.47)  
Yeah.

Ben Somers (40:38.52)  
Yeah. I, while you were talking, I was thinking of some analogies or metaphors of

Yeah, the idea that you design your kids education, not necessarily that you facilitate every part of it. It feels like a big...

a big shift and it's like even if you go there's a you know you're on a spectrum from

I dig all my soil and mix it with the cows that I have on my site and make my own manure and find all the seeds from things that are near me and plant them all and I don't buy anything from anybody and then I get the food and then I make there's this video where one guy has tries to make a chicken sandwich from scratch but like truly from scratch and it takes him like six months and it's a terrible sandwich and he was like really bummed that wasn't a good sandwich and video it's pretty entertaining.

and on the other end of the spectrum is not door dash. It's someone chooses every single meal for you and sends it to you and you have no choice in the matter about even what meal you have. And it's like, most people actually want to like, definitely pick their meals and like sometimes cook and do some other things with them. But if they had to do all that stuff on their own, they'd be like, please just someone feed me.

Ela Richmond (41:48.388)  
Interesting.

Ben Somers (42:03.982)  
But when you can make it really easy, they actually want to be involved and they want to do this stuff. And so I think there's like something similar and it's still, I don't know, maybe not the perfect metaphor, but it,

The fact that it's way easier to homeschool now and there are lots of good software materials and good online classes and tutors available, I think are a huge contributor to why homeschooling is getting way more popular.

Ben Somers (42:32.974)  
I think you're right about that.

Ela Richmond (42:33.488)  
Yeah, I would agree. I would definitely agree. I think it's easier to homeschool now than ever. A lot of the stigma is falling away as to what a homeschooler is, even within the homeschool community. And I know that some people are very particular, like, this is homeschooling, this is not. But I think there's this like,

Ben Somers (42:47.331)  
Yeah.

Ben Somers (42:55.702)  
where I am now in Sarat- in Sarat-

It's now, it's high status to homeschool. Like it is the opposite. If you hear their homeschooler from somewhere else, I don't know if it engenders the same thing, but if you hear, if someone in San Francisco hears another person in San Francisco is homeschooling, they assume that means like, those parents are like really smart. They're doing something really good.

Ela Richmond (43:04.569)  
Interesting.

Ela Richmond (43:21.244)  
That's awesome.

Ben Somers (43:25.858)  
different. The stigma is for sure falling away.

Ela Richmond (43:26.322)  
That is awesome.

Ela Richmond (43:32.325)  
interesting.

Interesting. Isn't that fascinating that like the privileged thing to do now is to be able to teach your own kids and take them out and choose how they learn and imbue your culture?

Ben Somers (43:51.374)  
I think makes sense. means, cause it makes a lot of sense. Cause it means two things. means one, you're dissatisfied with the quality of the education. Like here, it means that you're dissatisfied with the quality of education, which means you've got high standards. And two, it means you've organized your life in such a way that you can solve childcare and, good instruction, which I think a lot of people just assume they're going to spend a lot of time on it, that you have like,

figure out how to carve out enough time to be able to do a good job with that and be able to figure out childcare in an expensive city. And so it's almost like, it's a, yeah, it means that you've got really high standards and you have a lot of control over what your lifestyle looks like.

Ela Richmond (44:37.946)  
Interesting. That leads me to my final rapid fire questions. My first question for you is, what do you see like ideal world, the future of education looking like?

Ben Somers (44:52.718)  
Flexible campuses with lots of great resources and amenities. So pottery workshops and basketball courts and sports fields and all that kind of stuff. And they're flexible in that you can go at different times. You can come late, you can leave early. Your family can go on vacation for a week when you want to go on vacation. Your parent can come.

hang out with you for an hour in the middle of the day and get lunch with you if they've got the hour free. You know, and in nice places where the kids can have lots of physical freedom and they get to know the same people from the time they're five to 18. So they can have like long standing relationships. Plus, an extremely rigorous interactive dynamic.

learning experience. I'm really into this guy named Seymour Papert who has this concept of micro worlds, which is like how kids should learn things and they get, they are immersed in a micro world. So he talks about like language learning and how much better language learning is when you're immersed in it. And he's like, I can imagine this for things that aren't just learning foreign languages. can imagine versions of it that are good for math versions of it that are, know, Ms. Frizzle's magic school bus. If you ever watched that as a kid.

Ela Richmond (46:01.057)  
Interesting.

Ben Somers (46:16.716)  
You know, get transported into like the inside of a vein. That's how you start learning biology. Cause you're like trying to get out and you got all these problems that you encounter. so the white blood cells come to attack you. And that's how you learn about the immune system and this kind of stuff. And I think like that is an, is like the right model. I think that's the right model. And so one half is this wonderful physical place with great culture, great resources, tons of cool people, flexibility for the family and for the kid. And combined with,

Ela Richmond (46:28.902)  
That is awesome.

Ben Somers (46:48.182)  
spectacular interactive dynamic experiences that make that that help that respond to the individual kid and make their learning experience really good and fun and interesting and visceral. And so yeah, what it looks like is that campus plus a few hours a day working really hard on a screen.

Ela Richmond (47:08.774)  
Very cool. Second question, what are some of the best, me the top two education books that you'd recommend everybody read?

Ben Somers (47:20.797)  
Oh, recommend everybody to read. They have to like, like reading it.

Ela Richmond (47:26.854)  
Take that however you will.

Ben Somers (47:29.518)  
OK.

Ben Somers (47:35.694)  
I'm gonna give such lame answers. One is like...

the dialogues, like any of the conversations between, you know, Plato, Socrates and Aristotle, any of that kind of stuff. I only get two. And.

Ela Richmond (47:53.371)  
Yes.

Ben Somers (48:03.918)  
That's too hard. I only get two, then I see more Papert's Mindstorms, rather than like, or actually like the children's machine better.

Ela Richmond (48:13.394)  
That's a good one. I haven't read that one yet, actually. I'm always like, I pride myself. I want to have like a stellar library one day and I don't have that one yet. So that, I was very surprised whenever you said his name. I haven't heard of him before.

Ben Somers (48:30.15)  
I'm like obsessed with that guy. That guy's like, if you want to try and figure out what I'm attempting to build, you can basically just read his books and more or less like the, even the campus I described is like somewhat similar to the way he envisioned. He talks about Samba schools and these different places. He, like, I really think he really had it mostly down. Just the things he was trying to do were technically infeasible at the time.

Ela Richmond (48:32.514)  
Interesting.

Ela Richmond (48:47.503)  
Interesting.

Ela Richmond (48:59.118)  
Interesting. There's, I gotta give a shout out as you're talking about this. The best way that I've currently seen this done is in Kansas, they have this thing called a learning lab. Have you heard of it?

Ben Somers (49:12.014)  
I've heard of Learning Labs, but I don't know about the one Kansas.

Ela Richmond (49:23.6)  
Am I back or no?

Ben Somers (49:25.708)  
You're back, yeah.

Ela Richmond (49:26.608)  
Okay, good. Have you heard of the learning lab in Kansas?

Ben Somers (49:31.061)  
I have not heard of that.

Ela Richmond (49:33.168)  
So this is a really cool model and it was built by, there are a couple of like really strong donors in Wichita, but what it is is it is a basically like a kid coworking space. There are seven different school models inside of it. So it's very similar to this. It is as close to this as you get and they have a ton of like amazing.

Ben Somers (49:53.038)  
Ela Richmond (49:59.41)  
resources. So they have like a podcast studio, they have a video studio, they have like what they call a mess lab, which is like a decked out science lab. They have basically like a whole print shop. They have basically any sort of like resource that you would want as a kid and as a parent. And the way that their facility works is they have rooms that people can rent. So like there are micro schools that rent them.

Ben Somers (50:17.634)  
Yeah.

Ela Richmond (50:27.57)  
There are different homeschool co-ops that rent them, and they also have a subscription model. families can purchase a month of subscription, and then they can just go in whenever. And that is a really great idea. It is, I think we're not there yet. I look at it, and it's working.

Ben Somers (50:33.645)  
Well...

Ben Somers (50:37.612)  
Wow. Get a desk or something. Wow.

Ben Somers (50:45.528)  
Wow. Yeah.

Ben Somers (50:51.67)  
Is it working?

Ela Richmond (50:55.504)  
What's interesting is the people that have the hardest time buying into it are homeschoolers. So people that are open to microschools, yeah, people that are open to microschools, people that want like an alternative type of education, like they're down. But if they don't explain it as alternative education, if they explain what they're doing as homeschooling, usually, like that's not the crowd that they...

Ben Somers (51:05.022)  
Excellent. Thanks, Clay.

Ben Somers (51:14.658)  
Yeah.

Ela Richmond (51:25.01)  
that they hang out with. It's a really, really cool space. I'd recommend going to check it out if you ever have a chance.

Ben Somers (51:33.236)  
I will go, I like flying to go look at schools and hang out with them and see what they do right and do wrong. So I actually probably will reach out to them and see what's up.

Ela Richmond (51:43.77)  
Yeah, I can introduce you. They're great. But that is like, I went there and I was like, I love this place. I can't believe there are not more of them. But I think it will take like a cultural movement shift in the definition of like, what is education? What is homeschooling? How are we doing these things for it to work?

Ben Somers (51:47.662)  
Cool.

Ben Somers (51:53.666)  
Yeah.

Ben Somers (52:01.421)  
in.

Ben Somers (52:05.23)  
True for all, like I sometimes I'll talk to other people who working on education and sometimes like it'll get competitive between different people or like I'll hear like other people get fed up with another company. And my perspective is like none of us are fighting against each other really like it's really attempting to fight the status quo. Like the amount of dollars in education, the amount of

Ela Richmond (52:30.598)  
Exactly.

Ben Somers (52:34.592)  
A room for expansion of new ideas is like ginormous. And yeah, we should figure out as a community, an ed tech, as people who are working on new things, how to like.

Ben Somers (52:54.306)  
help each other make that true. Cause if, if, if there's anything we do to crack the, put it cracks in the system, it'll have a much bigger impact for all of us, even as businesses, then it would be to, to compete for the relatively small alternative or homeschool market.

Ela Richmond (53:11.314)  
I mean, and to be quite honest,

Ben Somers (53:12.386)  
But yeah, there's going to be big cultural changes.

Ela Richmond (53:16.53)  
And to be honest, the thing that I love about OpenEd is it was started with the mindset, we celebrate when a student leaves because they're going on to find something better. And we are creating a, hopefully, this robust ecosystem of educational options because if we actually believe that kids need something different, like no child is standard, they're going to need different things, right? And so to be that...

prideful to say like, yes, you my company is going to solve every single homeschool need. Like, you just can't do it. And like, the more that people see this space as something that they can pick and choose from, the more you have to be okay with that. Like, they're going to choose the best thing for them and that's good.

Ben Somers (54:06.22)  
Yeah. And I think it's extremely good for the overall system. Like there's, when people get locked into contracts or experiences or products for too long, like right now, like you time for school, you're kind of stuck there for a long time and you don't really leave the school except if it goes like absolutely terribly. and the school makes like unilateral decisions. So you just don't get a lot of evolution.

There's not a lot of iteration. Like the good products don't float to the top. They don't become popular. It's very hard to break into the model with new things. Like if you can move into a pick a mix world or a mix and match world, I think the products will get a lot better just by nature of the fact that people are making more choices.

Ela Richmond (54:54.298)  
Yeah, very interesting. Last question. When parents haven't found out yet what clicks for their kids, what do you recommend?

Ben Somers (55:09.806)  
I think about how to answer this one.

Ben Somers (55:18.776)  
Find out what video games they play. That's like a short, that's like the most actionable piece of advice I can come up with. The other ones are maybe longer, but your kid could play lots of different video games and they choose to play a small number of them. If they read a lot, what books they read. Video games, it tends to be easier for them to choose because their games are like really made to be available to kids and easy to find and stuff like that. And hidden in their video game choices.

are a bunch of preferences about what kinds of problems they like to solve and what kinds of topics they like to think about. And so don't look at them as trivial, look at them as signal. So go hang out with your kids and play video games for an hour. And I think you'll come back thinking they're very passionate.

Ela Richmond (56:04.044)  
Very interesting. That was a perfect note to end it on. Thank you so much for coming on the podcast. This was quite interesting.

Ben Somers (56:12.782)  
This is really fun. You're great at this.

Ela Richmond (56:15.698)
