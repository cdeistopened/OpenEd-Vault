# Parent's Guide to Homeschooling Students with Dyslexia

_By Jamie Lesko, Associate Director of Student Success at OpenEd_

Traditional schools have special education departments, reading specialists, and teams of professionals to help struggling readers. So when you're homeschooling and notice your child reversing letters or struggling with basic words, the question hits hard: _Are you in over your head?_

As a former special education teacher who transitioned to homeschooling my own three children, I know this feeling intimately. Despite my training and years of experience with Wilson Reading System in the classroom, I initially felt unqualified to meet my children's needs at home. I thought, "There's no way I can match all these incredible teachers who specialize in specific subjects."

**Here's what I've learned: You don't have to become a reading specialist to guide a struggling reader to confidence.** The uncomfortable truth is that many schools still fail to produce confident readers – dyslexic or otherwise – even with all of the resources available. And as parents, we have advantages that even trained specialists don't always have.

## Understanding Dyslexia and Homeschooling

### What is Dyslexia?

Dyslexia is a neurological difference that affects how the brain processes written language. It's not about intelligence or vision – in fact, many dyslexic individuals have average or above-average intelligence. The condition affects approximately 15-20% of the population and is hereditary, often running in families.

The core challenge lies in phonological processing – the ability to recognize and manipulate the sounds in spoken language. This affects decoding (sounding out words), spelling, and reading fluency. However, dyslexia often comes with strengths in areas like spatial reasoning, creative thinking, and problem-solving.

"Reading is very complex, and teaching reading really is rocket science," explains [Kris Vassel](https://www.vasselighttutoring.com/), a seasoned reading interventionist and founder of [Vasselight Tutoring](https://www.vasselighttutoring.com/). "It's not something you can just do naturally. You have to be trained on how to do it."

### How Does Dyslexia Affect Homeschooling?

Whether you're homeschooling, considering it, or just exploring a more open approach, you are starting from a position of strength for at least 3 reasons:

1. **Self-paced learning.** Classrooms move at the speed of the average student, leaving struggling readers perpetually behind. At home, you can provide extra time without the social stigma.
2. **Customized instruction.** A parent-led approach allows you to tailor your approach to your child's specific needs. You can combine elements from different methods, adjust pacing, and incorporate your child's interests—all while still using structured literacy techniques proven effective by neuroscience research.
3. **Emotional safety.** Large classrooms can be brutal for dyslexic children—daily humiliation from reading aloud, falling behind in every subject, watching classmates master skills effortlessly. At home, you can control the environment and build confidence and skills simultaneously. I've seen this firsthand: my son would regularly be on the floor melting down when we first started homeschooling with rigid structures. But when we allowed flexibility – like letting my daughter do math at 10:30 PM when her brain was "on" and the house was quiet – everything changed.

However, none of these advantages matter if you aren't equipped with the right tools and knowledge. You _don't_ need to become a certified reading specialist yourself, but you _do_ need to recognize the boundaries of your expertise and know when to call in reinforcements.

## What You Can Do Yourself

Let's start with the obvious: **You know your child better than any teacher or specialist.** If something feels off about their reading development, trust your instincts. The key is to distinguish between normal developmental variation and genuine red flags.

**And the most reliable early indicator isn't what you might expect:**

"The inability to rhyme is one of the most reliable indicators of dyslexia," Vassel explains. "It shows a deficit in phonological awareness—a core skill that all dyslexic individuals struggle with."

Other red flags include persistent difficulty learning letter names and sounds, trouble with multi-syllable words ("pasghetti" instead of "spaghetti"), and a family history of reading struggles (dyslexia is highly hereditary).

Basic screening tools from [Savvy Learning](https://savvylearning.com/free-reading-assessment/), the [International Dyslexia Association](https://dyslexiaida.org/) and [Reading Rockets](https://www.readingrockets.org/) can't give you a formal diagnosis, but they're a good first step to decide whether professional evaluation is warranted.

Once you've made this assessment, you can start to change your approach.

Perhaps the biggest advantage you have as a homeschool parent is that you control the emotional atmosphere around reading. **Forget everything you think you know about how reading instruction should look.** Forget grade levels, peer comparisons, and anxiety-inducing reading logs that turn every book into homework. Your job is to make reading feel safe and achievable.

### Practical Strategies You Can Implement Today

**Start with the 20-minute rule.** "Reading daily at home—at least 20 minutes—is crucial," Vassel emphasizes. And it doesn't have to be your child doing all the reading. Read aloud to them. Listen to audiobooks together. Let them follow along in a physical book while hearing the story.

**Apply the two-week intervention rule.** From my special education background, I've learned to give any intervention at least two weeks before deciding if it works. If something isn't clicking after a day or two, don't abandon it immediately. But after two weeks of consistent effort, if there's no improvement, it's time to try a different approach. This prevents both giving up too quickly and persisting with ineffective methods.

**Choose books at your child's instructional level**—where they can read with 90-95% accuracy. If they're missing more than one or two words per page, the book is too hard. Use [AR BookFinder](https://www.arbookfind.com/) to check reading levels, and don't be afraid to start easier than necessary.

**Use multisensory instruction.** Engage multiple senses when teaching reading:

- **Match words with pictures** to build visual associations
- **Break down sentences, words, and syllables** systematically
- **Use systematic phonics instruction** that follows a logical progression
- **Utilize graphic novels** to combine visual and textual learning

**Leverage technology strategically.** Text-to-speech software like [Voice Dream Reader](https://www.voicedream.com/) helps children access grade-level content while building underlying skills. **Read along with audio books** to reinforce the connection between spoken and written words. [Learning Ally](https://learningally.org/) provides audio textbooks for students with documented learning disabilities, while [Bookshare](https://www.bookshare.org/) offers accessible digital books.

**Make simple environmental adjustments:**

- **Use a dyslexia-friendly font** (uses thicker lines in parts of letters)
- **Take frequent breaks** to prevent frustration and fatigue
- **Take turns reading** to reduce pressure
- **Have conversations before, during and after reading** to build comprehension

Even with this approach, your dyslexic child will make errors. As Kris Vassel advises, "When your child is reading aloud and makes an error, encourage them to self-correct. If they finish the sentence and go back to fix it, praise them for self-correcting. Train yourself to wait before jumping in. Good readers self-correct."

Wait three to five seconds before offering help. If they self-correct, celebrate it: "I love how you went back to make that make sense!" If they don't self-correct, Vassel recommends helping them figure out the word rather than telling them what it is.

"Depending on the error, help them sound out or chunk the word, but don't turn it into a phonics lesson—keep the focus on reading."

**Practice self-advocacy** by teaching your child to recognize their learning needs and communicate them to others. This skill will serve them throughout their educational journey and beyond.

## What You Should Outsource

Even with the most supportive home environment in the world, some children will need systematic phonics instruction delivered through multi-sensory methods with precise progress monitoring.

Seeking professional help doesn't make you a failure—it makes you smart. As both a former special education teacher and a homeschool parent myself, I've discovered something I call the "second person theory." Sometimes you need a second person in your child's life who can say the exact same things you've been saying, and suddenly it clicks. I can't tell you how many times I've had to swallow my pride and recognize that there might be a different person who needs to be that voice in my child's life. They're literally telling your kid the same thing you've been teaching them for months, but somehow, when it comes from a tutor or another adult, it makes all the difference.

This isn't about your inadequacy as a parent—it's about the unique dynamic that a fresh voice can bring to the learning process. Children often respond differently to instruction from someone outside the family, free from the emotional complexities of the parent-child relationship.

### Formal Assessment

While you can spot warning signs and use basic screening tools by yourself, a comprehensive evaluation provides crucial insights into your child's specific challenges and strengths. According to the [Dyslexia Center of Utah](https://www.dyslexiacenterofutah.org/post/should-i-get-a-dyslexia-diagnosis-yes-and-no-), "There is no single test for dyslexia. A 'diagnosis' is simply the professional opinion of a qualified expert, and this opinion can vary depending on the individual conducting the evaluation."

Most homeschool families have more flexibility in choosing providers but fewer built-in supports for navigating the process. OpenEd families get the best of both worlds: flexibility _and_ support.

But before investing in a costly formal evaluation, consider what you hope to gain. For example, documentation necessary for college accommodations and workplace protections under ADA; detailed insights about your child's specific profile; or targeted recommendations offering practical guidance for effective teaching approaches.

Some tutoring services provide free assessments as part of their intake process. Services like [Savvy Learning](https://savvylearning.com/) offer complimentary reading and math assessments to determine your child's current level and identify specific areas of need—often providing valuable insights without the cost of formal testing.

If you're an [OpenEd](https://opened.co/) family, our special education team can guide you through both private and school-based evaluation processes, help you understand what different assessments measure, and assist with documentation for future accommodations.

### Specialized Reading Intervention

Don't assume that buying a research-based reading program and following the manual will deliver the same results as working with a trained specialist. Both Kris and I have witnessed this firsthand. When I was teaching at a charter school, we were given the Wilson Reading System materials but no training. I thought I could figure it out – after all, I was a trained teacher. But I quickly discovered that the curriculum was complex, and without proper modeling and support, we weren't seeing the results we expected.

Kris shares a similar experience from her consulting work: "They purchased all the materials, they had the students, they had the time blocked out," she recalls. "But after months of implementation, their students weren't making the progress they thought they would, and they were about to throw it in the trash and say it wasn't effective."

The teachers had followed the manual, completed the activities, and checked all the boxes—but they lacked the nuanced understanding of how to adjust pacing, recognize error patterns, and modify instruction based on individual student responses.

The program wasn't the problem; the implementation was. "That's when they realized they needed actual training," Vassel explains. "The materials are just tools. Without proper training, even the best program becomes ineffective."

Once we got proper training and mentoring at my school, the effectiveness improved drastically. When we finally implemented the correct instructional strategies and followed the sequences properly, our students' reading progress was amazing. The structure actually made it easier for us as teachers, and the students understood what to expect.

Wilson and **[Barton Reading & Spelling System](https://bartonreading.com/)** are evidence-based curricula that can be implemented by either trained tutors or parents who complete intensive certification.

Wilson tutors typically require 60+ hours of professional training and work in clinical or school settings, though some offer private tutoring. Barton was specifically designed for parent implementation but still requires 20+ hours of initial training plus ongoing support to ensure proper delivery.

**[All About Reading](https://www.allaboutlearningpress.com/)** offers a more accessible parent-friendly approach but may lack sufficient intensity for severe dyslexia.

Last but not least, beyond their free assessment, **[Savvy Learning](https://savvylearning.com/)** provides high-dosage tutoring designed specifically for families who want expertise without sacrificing homeschool flexibility.

"High dosage tutoring is up to 20 times more effective than standard tutoring," explains Savvy's CMO Tony Mickelsen. "What child is going to have fun while learning to read or do math for 60 minutes? It's really tough. That's tough for me as an adult, let alone for the little kids."

Their approach breaks traditional hour-long sessions into 25-minute sessions, four days per week. "The kids at the end of a session with Savvy, they are hyped. They are having so much fun that they want to come back for the next session," Mickelsen notes.

Certified instructors create individualized learning plans, provide regular progress monitoring, and coordinate with existing school programs when beneficial. For OpenEd families, this eliminates the need for parent training while ensuring coordination with your overall educational approach.

### Monitoring Progress

After 3-4 months of consistent intervention, you should see measurable improvements in fluency, accuracy, or confidence. Professional providers use standardized measures to track progress and make data-driven adjustments. Parents doing intervention themselves often struggle to distinguish between genuine progress and wishful thinking. Parents note that it can feel slow, but over time, these methods work.

**Bottom line:** Professional instruction typically produces faster results with less family stress. When you're already managing a full homeschool curriculum, outsourcing the most technical subject to qualified specialists isn't a compromise—it's strategic thinking.

We're witnessing a shift where more parents are combining a homeschool-first approach with professional resources when needed. Parents can take comfort knowing that they don't need to have all the answers—or the expertise—to get started.

_**SIDEBAR: Sometimes the Problem Might Actually Be Vision:**_

_Consider that what looks like dyslexia might actually be a treatable vision issue called convergence insufficiency. [Vision Reading Academy](http://visionreadingacademy.com/) founder Krystle Cordingley shares some of the signs:_

- _Can read small words but struggles with longer ones_
- _Recognizes a word on one line but can't recognize the same word a few lines later_
- _Guesses at word endings_
- _Works hard to read but can't remember what they just read_
- _Shows physical signs of frustration when reading_

_Cordingley discovered this with her own daughter: "She was 10 years old, almost 11, and reading at a beginning first-grade level. I tried everything - all the Orton-Gillingham programs for dyslexia. Nothing was working."_

_After addressing the vision issue? "She's 13 years old now, reading at college level at over 800 words per minute."_

_**The assessment is simple:** Often takes just 5 minutes over Zoom, watching how eye muscles control movement and convergence. Learn more_ [*here](https://opened.co/blog/the-homeschool-parents-guide-to-dyslexia-when-to-diy-vs-when-to-call-the-experts#).*
