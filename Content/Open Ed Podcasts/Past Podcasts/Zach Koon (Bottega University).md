## Transcript

Ela Richmond (00:00.696)  
Welcome back to the Open Ed Podcast. I'm Ella, your host, and today we are joined by Zach Kuhn. Zach, okay, you have a crazy story. Just lay it on me. Tell me, how did you get started in homeschool? What does your day-to-day look like today?

Zach From Bottega U (00:14.914)  
Yeah, thanks for having me. I really appreciate you inviting me to be on the show. So it started back in.

2021, my wife and I were looking at schools for our children. We have three kids, by the way. All of them are spitting images of my personality, whether that's good or bad. You know, have to ask my wife, Rebecca. I don't know yet. but back in 2021, right at the height of COVID and all of this, you know, stuff going on, should I stay at home? Should I go to work? What do we need to do?

we were trying to figure out whether we wanted to put our kids in public school or private school. And we looked at a lot of the schools in our area and I have some friends who are teachers and some of them said that they didn't really enjoy working at the schools that they were at. And one of the reasons why was because they felt pressure to push students through subject matter when the students weren't ready to go through. that

really kind of bothered me. I didn't want my kids to feel like they had to do something they couldn't do yet or weren't ready to do yet. And all of my kids have different personalities and I know their learning styles. So we talked about homeschooling, brought it up.

weren't really sure if that was the best bet. Neither of us were homeschooled. Both of us went to public school growing up. I played football in high school. My wife played volleyball. So we were used to all of that. Homeschool was completely foreign to us. over the course of a year, we sat down and we talked about what our life wanted to look like. We were getting a little uncomfortable in our house. It was growing a little too small for us, which is ironic.

Zach From Bottega U (02:04.944)  
And after some thought, I brought up the idea to her that we should actually sell our house and do something completely crazy. I worked remotely at this point and I said, hey, instead of selling our house and buying a bigger house, what if we just buy a 300 square foot box and move into an RV and travel the country until we decide to settle down? So that's what we did instead. I'm in my RV right now actually. And I've got

cabinets behind me and little LED lights above my head. And it's been crazy. But ultimately, the reason to homeschool was driven by this.

feeling that we had this unmet need with the public or private schools around us. And then we were pretty much forced into it at that point because the only other options were, you know, paying thousands of dollars for a really expensive private online school, such as the local one that our university nearby offered to their primary and secondary school students, or it was homeschooling. We decided to homeschool. We like to live a more minimal and lifestyle, and we'd like to have a lot of say in how our

kids are raised and that just made the most sense. So that's why we started homeschooling and we've been homeschooling and traveling in RV for the past three and a half years.

Ela Richmond (03:24.792)  
does a day in the life look like in an RV with three kids homeschooling?

Zach From Bottega U (03:28.761)  
It's pretty crazy. We have two dogs too, two German Shepherds. and when I say 300 square foot box, I mean, it is, it's pretty tight sometimes. So.

What it looks like is, honestly, it's similar to a lot of every other parent's day to day, just in a smaller space. So we'll wake up in the morning, we'll make breakfast, the kids will get ready, and we'll have some time together. And then I will start my day going to work. And my wife is the primary teacher. I'll work through some of the subjects with the kids as well, whether it's during the day or in the evening that she can't get to, or just some other subjects that are important to us that I feel

better equipped at versus my wife and vice versa. She's better equipped to teach them subjects than I am and with kids. So we'll kind of hand one kid off to another. My son and I are very much alike. So sometimes I'll focus with him and my daughter does not really learn as well from me and it's harder for me to connect with her on that type of...

learning style, but my wife is a pro at it. So usually we'll divvy up tasks that way. And it's great. We get to spend a lot of time with our kids and I get to see them every single day. And then in the RV, we traveled the country and continue to do so and have been able to integrate our lives very

So our homeschooling sessions tend to be outside a lot of times when the weather's nice. My son is really into geology. So we got him a geology kit and he likes to go outside and collect rocks. And we like to study those. We like to find out, okay, well, how did this rock form? Why did it form? When did it form? And things like that. He's really interested in learning about that. My daughters on the other hand are not as interested in geology.

Zach From Bottega U (05:29.31)  
and rocks they like to play pretend and my daughter likes to be a veterinarian a lot of the times so she's more focused on biology animals things like that so it looks a lot like probably what everyone else does who goes into homeschooling and that's really trying to create an environment where our children learn the best we just do it in a much smaller space in a different place every couple of weeks

Ela Richmond (05:53.966)  
How have you seen your kids change since starting homeschool?

Zach From Bottega U (05:58.826)  
I've seen a lot of ownership in their lives. They take ownership of...

the things in their lives. They're very proactive about their learning. They actually enjoy it. Most of the time they do complain. I mean, we've all been kids before. Sometimes we just want to go play. And my kids are no different. And they're very strong-willed. So I like that they've taken ownership of their studies. My son will usually wake up and he'll start a lot of his independent practice.

and homework assignments that we don't need to help him with on his own. And all of them love to read. That was a big thing. What's really important to me is that we can teach them information, but what was most important to was teach them to be curious so that they are the ones directing their learning. Because we all know that when you're interested in something, you really go after it if you're driven to do so. I'm sure that with everything

that you do with Open Ed and on this podcast, you learned everything that you could about crafting a good story and putting together, developing editing skills of working with editors to make sure it looks the way that you want, how to communicate and to relate. So you worked hard to learn that. And it was all because you were passionate about it. And that's what I want my kids to do as well. And they've really started to develop that inkling and that passion for what they're interested in.

Ela Richmond (07:27.384)  
Has RV life changed your family at all? And I ask that primarily from the perspective, thinking about education, like them going and exploring a new place every little while, that I would assume obviously influences their learning a bit. How has it influenced them?

Zach From Bottega U (07:46.756)  
Yeah, I would say the biggest way that it's influenced their learning is allowing them to experience people in places that they wouldn't have otherwise had the opportunity to experience. We visit a lot of national parks, for instance, and all of our kids are very interested in science because of that, because we spend a lot of time talking about like, why is this place the way that it is? And we always try to...

incite that curiosity for them to ask questions and to look at more experiences. And it's something that I never got growing up as a kid. I grew up in...

in the Midwest in central Ohio where it's flat and everybody rides dirt bikes or play sports. And I don't regret growing up there or anything like that, but I wouldn't trade it for the world. It's definitely been a really great experience for my family. It's brought us closer together. We spend a lot more time invested in our children's lives and their lives. They're invested in our lives too. They were very open about how we feel and what we talk about. And I feel like that

That would have been harder if I was at work every single day, not being able to see my children, not really know what's going on except secondhand through what the stories that they tell, which most of the time it's, it was good, or I don't remember. Or my wife tells me secondhand, but I don't get to experience it.

I'd say in other ways too, it's definitely been challenging because it was brand new to us and we started with our with our first kid. My son is eight years old, almost nine now and

Zach From Bottega U (09:30.444)  
when we started traveling, he had just been in preschool and we weren't sure if we were doing the right thing at first because we were taking away from friends and some family that lived nearby that and he's a very extroverted person like myself. So taking that away was difficult at first, but we realized that we weren't really taking it away. We were opening up new opportunities for him to express his personality around new people and new places.

So I would say it's made us closer together, but definitely there's a sense of trying to develop that rootedness and routine that changes when you move into an RV or try something new like homeschooling when you've never done it before.

Ela Richmond (10:15.288)  
Did you ever fear your ability to do it well?

Zach From Bottega U (10:18.416)  
No, but maybe that's just because I'm a little overconfident sometimes. think that we were more concerned with like time management because there's only so many hours in a day. Can we spend the time? Tons of other far smarter people than me have put together really, really well made curricula that we follow.

And we asked my sister-in-law, it is very well versed in homeschooling curriculum and we asked her for lot of tips because she homeschools her kids, my nieces and nephew as well. her advice and some other advice in the homeschool community was really helpful. So it was really just relying on other people to really tell us what we should be doing because, you know, they were far more experienced than we were at it.

Yeah, so I never really felt a lack of confidence. It was really just being vulnerable and opening myself to realizing I don't really know what I'm doing. I'm just gonna go for it and I'm gonna ask for help along the way.

Ela Richmond (11:23.944)  
that approach to it. I think that's a strong approach. So what did that process look like in trying to find the things that worked well for your kids? Like how did y'all start? Where did you, you know, where did you go from there? Because like understanding that something's not working for your kid is one thing, but then trying to figure out how to make it work is another thing. And then having, you know, three kids who don't all learn the same way is quite challenging, especially whenever you're

trying to do it on your own, don't have teacher support, like, what do you do?

Zach From Bottega U (11:54.0)  
Yeah.

Zach From Bottega U (11:58.192)  
Yeah, so for us, we started with just one curriculum that really encapsulated all the subjects that we wanted to start with, because we felt like that would be the easiest way to get our foot in the door. Right. I'm sure that's what most people look for when they first start out. And maybe they still maybe they stick with that and that works for them. For us, we felt like if someone went through all this effort to put together a comprehensive curriculum.

Why not just use that one as long as everyone says that it's a good curriculum. And from what we heard, it was a good one and we used it and it works for our son really well. And we tried it on our daughter and it didn't work as well for her. So we had to step back a little bit and go, okay, we need to be a little bit more intentional about how we structure their.

their schedule, their learning environment and what curriculum that we're using. So we still use that first curriculum, but we've also added to it or changed it and adapted it in ways that fit our kids personalities. I would say that

Traveling in the RV helped that actually because we spend more time with our kids so we get to See them grow in their personalities develop. So we have a better understanding of What they might need and sometimes it's just good to ask them kids are a lot more intelligent that we get we give them credit for and Just asking them questions the same questions you would ask an adult. Hey, is this working for you? How do you like learning in this way? Do you like did you like it when we did that project the

day, do you like your writing and things like that. And it's been really helpful in guiding how we can teach them because it shows us how they learn. So that's been a really big eye-opener. It's just really spending a lot of time asking questions to our kids that make them feel like they're involved and in control of how they're learning.

Ela Richmond (13:53.582)  
questions, like what are some examples of those questions?

Zach From Bottega U (13:57.25)  
Yeah, so my son, he loves, he loves fiction books. And a lot of the books

that are in the science curriculum that we've found are very textbook oriented. So we really focused on, we really, really focused on books in history and science and English language arts that built in stories and narrative that helped him better understand and put in context what he was learning. Because he read like crazy, we got him a Kindle for Christmas and he's always picking out new books and asking us, hey, can I read this?

Ela Richmond (14:10.146)  
Mm-hmm.

Zach From Bottega U (14:35.356)  
me that so we use that same approach with him for for a lot of the subjects and it's been really helpful in adapting his learning and that came from just asking him because he really wasn't getting some of the subject matter in his set last year in his second grade language arts class and when we asked him about what

The issue was he really just didn't connect the dots with some of the phonics and some of the adverbial and adjective tenses that he was using. So.

When we asked him, would you like to read more books instead of doing this worksheet, he said yes. So we started looking at books that would help him learn new words and would help him put those words and those and the different types of words into context. And he's become much a much better student because of that.

Ela Richmond (15:19.256)  
Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (15:36.736)  
I love that. So I'm going to swap a little bit of the focus here, but back to what you were saying about all of these adventures that you and your family have. When it comes to being in person on these adventures, your kids, you said, have started to love science. I think that's quite unique. So what is the experience? What are you doing with them in the moment that helps them to love it? Are you asking them questions?

Are you teaching them about the place that you're going to? Like, how do you allow this to be enriching as well?

Zach From Bottega U (16:08.984)  
Yeah, so I think that...

your passion will pass down onto your kids. So one of the reasons why that my kids are passionate about the outdoors and science is really just because that's something that my wife and I are passionate about. And it's always been a core value of ours to not see our children as like a burden or an obstacle to doing what we love to do. Rather, they're a blessing that enable us to share more of our life with them. And because of that, we saw this as an experience to just integrate them into as much of our lives

as which includes just traveling and going outside. We love to hike and go backpacking. I take my kids on backpacking trips once a year, just me and one of them individually. So, and we'll take them out. And our favorite place that we've ever been was Zion National Park out in Utah. And every time we went there, just, you drive through the tunnel and you look up and there's just these towering red, orange, yellow canes.

walls all around you and it's like you understand why they call it Zion the guy who named it Zion and named one of the one of the landmarks their angels landing said this is probably where God made his footstool this is where he sent his angels because it's literally the most beautiful places we've ever seen so

Ela Richmond (17:31.618)  
Wow.

Zach From Bottega U (17:33.11)  
We were there and I was asked, I'm very interested in how the earth around us developed. So was asking questions like, so do you know why these canyons are the way that they are and how they worked and what the river that runs through, how it carved out the canyons and asking questions like that and just engaging them in conversation really helps them learn. And then national parks have been helpful too because they have junior ranger booklets and it gives them tasks that they can come

complete to get badges. So we really tried to leverage that as much as we could. Anytime we went to a national park, we would grab three of the booklets. We would make sure that they had little sashes and things and they could try to earn their badges by completing certain tasks. And it would have them learn about the park.

Ela Richmond (18:16.396)  
Mm-hmm.

Zach From Bottega U (18:24.078)  
the history of it, the geology, the environment, the animals, and that's how they would essentially figure out everything that we wanted them to learn in their science. So we don't really have to use a science curriculum because our science curriculum is outside around us.

Ela Richmond (18:41.976)  
I love that. Okay, one final question on this and then I'm going to ask you about Bottega, which is very exciting because you are also a part of Bottega, which is a partner of OpenEd and that is available to all of our OpenEd families in the marketplace. So I'll ask you about that in a second. But last question, when it comes to your family dynamic, right? Like I would imagine that some people being realistic would look at an RV, a 300 square foot box, as you said.

Zach From Bottega U (18:53.828)  
Yeah.

Ela Richmond (19:11.054)  
And say like, okay, what happens when my kids are fighting? Like what happens when there is chaos? What happens when mom wants a break? How do you deal with those practical elements?

Zach From Bottega U (19:16.292)  
Hahaha

Zach From Bottega U (19:25.2)  
Yeah, sometimes you just have to be a little sacrificial and I have to tell my wife Rebecca that she can take the truck and leave for a couple hours and my kids will be here with me and I'll have to make sure that they're covered for the day. My son can be pretty good, but sometimes he's a little, he likes to pick on his sister. that's most of the, I would say most of the arguments are started because my son is very mischievous and likes to tease them a little bit.

Ela Richmond (19:44.45)  
He

Zach From Bottega U (19:54.392)  
So yeah, I mean, it can be really difficult because we're such an enclosed space. So we have to be very patient and really demonstrate that for our kids too, because as a kid, it's really hard to be patient. So I have to be patient with the fact that, and just understanding of the fact that we're so close together, it's just going to happen. And because of that, adapt my life to the situation that we created by moving into the RV.

Ela Richmond (20:25.068)  
And has that strengthened your marriage too? Because obviously you have to work together in a way that is very different. Like if you lived close to family before, now you don't. Or like if you had a lot of friends around you, like it's definitely a different experience to just be you and your family in an RV in a part of the world, right?

Zach From Bottega U (20:34.884)  
Yeah.

Zach From Bottega U (20:43.362)  
Yes, absolutely. my our marriage goes stronger every year. I mean, we definitely have our ups and downs and you know, we get in fights. We're not perfect, but we always strive to understand each other and be very quick to forgive one another. If even even if the other person, you know, you think they're in the wrong, you're I'm not a perfect person. There's always something I probably did or definitely did most likely or said, and I have to be humble enough to admit that and just say, hey, like we're

you and I are partners, we're in this together, how can we work this out? And not being afraid to confront those moments, not backing away from them. And because it's difficult to get away from someone when they're 25 feet away from you, you really don't have a choice. So we took that in stride and we've always made it an objective of ours to come together and work through and converse through anything that we're going

through good, bad, ugly and everything in between and it's been really good for our marriage and our family.

Ela Richmond (21:50.07)  
No, I love that. Okay, let's take a little segue into the topic of Bottega. So for anybody that does not know what Bottega does, can you share kind of like, what does Bottega do? What is available to open ed families?

Zach From Bottega U (22:01.872)  
Yeah, Botega University is a 100 % online distance education university. We're accredited and recognized by the Department of Education. And it's been that way ever since the late 90s. It started off as Andrew Jackson University as a correspondence school. And it was one of the first early adopters of online and distance education as that started to become more and more.

prominent in higher ed. The Bottega University.

really saw a need to provide homeschooling families with the opportunity to leverage their flexibility and their personalized goals for their students in the same way or even better ways than a lot of traditional high schooling families have because of just the nature of being so invested in your child's learning.

So we saw this need in this desire and said, how can we?

help give students who are homeschooled or world school or unschooled the advantage that they need to get ahead in their education, potentially their careers without having to go through the four years of high school and then four to six years of undergrad and grad school. How can we help them save time, save money and really just integrate? And it's really about integration in the same way that

Zach From Bottega U (23:36.786)  
my family integrated our lives within our schooling and just the way that we interact together. take university has done the same thing. So we launched the Bottega Advantage initiative in order to provide homeschooling families and through our partners the opportunity to earn dual credit options where they can take college courses that also meet high school credit requirements and graduation requirements. So rather than having to take English

in English 11, for instance, in high school, or the equivalent. then English 101 in college, you can actually just do both of them at the same time by taking a course through Botega University that meets that requirement.

Ela Richmond (24:23.672)  
Very, very cool. And who would you say that this is for? So from my understanding, what Bottega does is it allows OpenEd families to pursue credits, especially for things like college or future paths that they might be interested in. So they can learn coding. They can learn different types of development type things. They can do quite a bit with Bottega. And there's a lot that they can look into. But

It seems like it'd be for a high school-ish student or like eighth grade-ish, or how would you explain that for a family trying to decide if it works for them?

Zach From Bottega U (24:56.857)  
Yeah.

Zach From Bottega U (25:01.998)  
Yeah, good question. The age range that we're looking at is high school age range. Eighth grade would qualify as well simply because there are some eighth graders that are ready for high school level courses at that point. So really it's between 13 and 18 and then even adults who might want to come back and earn additional credit to finish their high school diplomas. That can work out as well too. But definitely we're really aiming for families who have high school age students that want to take advantage of earning

Ela Richmond (25:12.739)  
Mm-hmm.

Zach From Bottega U (25:31.874)  
college credit and high school credit at the exact same time. And it's not just college credit that they can earn. That's definitely what most students will probably do is take a couple of courses. But the really ambitious students, the ones who...

and to be really into their learning and working ahead and taking ownership of their studies can even earn up to an associate's degree before even graduating high school. So we want to provide as many opportunities for these families as possible.

Ela Richmond (26:05.934)  
So this could be something where a family, either they have a constant conversation with their kids about what are your goals. And if a kid lays out his goals or her goals as being, want to graduate early, I want to take college credits while I'm still in high school, I want to use my open ed journey in order to do that so that you don't have to spend all the money on your own.

I want to get ahead in any way. If those sound like your kid, then this would kind of be for you. And then also, if as a parent you also want to give your kid a leg up with different types of credits or even actual skills that they can use in the real world, this would be something for them, right?

Zach From Bottega U (26:59.15)  
Yeah, absolutely. We just gotta ask our kids what they want and what they need. And homeschooling families are primed to do that because we spend more time with our kids than a lot of other families have the opportunity to. So we can really dig down and find out how they learn and what's best for them just by asking them really, really pointed and authentic questions about what they want out of life.

Ela Richmond (27:07.928)  
Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (27:24.044)  
I love it. Very, very cool. Thank you, Zach. I'm going to hit you with a couple rapid fire questions about Bottega and also your family journey, and then we'll wrap it up. So rapid fire question number one, what is a resource other than Bottega, of course, that you would recommend to families that's been really helpful and useful on your family journey?

Zach From Bottega U (27:30.682)  
Sure.

Zach From Bottega U (27:44.526)  
Yeah, the HSLDA, the Homeschool Legal Defense Association is really good for trying to find out what the laws are in your state for homeschooling and just resources for that. I would say that's number one for homeschooling. If you're looking to travel and homeschool at the same time like I am, just hop on forums or Facebook groups with other people who have done it and just ask for advice.

Ela Richmond (28:09.152)  
Are you re-registering every state that you go into or like where, how do you do that logistically?

Zach From Bottega U (28:15.374)  
Yeah, so there are some RV friendly states and they're generally the less populated states. you can look up, there are organizations that actually help you find your state residency as well. We actually were able to move to South Dakota legally because they're an RV friendly state. There's a lot that goes into it, but pretty straightforward. All we had to do was stay there one night in a campground so that I could get a receipt.

We had to go to the DMV. We had to have a physical address in South Dakota, which can actually be a mail forwarding service So it's not a PL box It's actually a company that has a physical address and that essentially rents a mailbox space for you and that is legal to do in South Dakota and a couple of other states and Yeah

Ela Richmond (29:04.322)  
Wow, that's interesting.

No, I always wonder like logistically, because I mean, if you're traveling so much, some families keep a home in one place, so then that's their place of residency. But if you don't keep a home, then what do you do?

Zach From Bottega U (29:16.976)  
Mm-hmm.

Yeah, I mean you can use a family member's address if you want to. We really like the idea of having our own address so we didn't have to rely on someone else and didn't have to put that burden on them. So South Dakota was a really great state. Florida and Texas are two other states that a lot of RV families tend to change their residency to if they're looking to actually permanently change it. But a lot of people just keep their residents in the state that they lived in. There are mail forwarding services in other states too and there are

a number of states that are just as flexible on that as well, but you always just have to look at what your state's laws are and you gotta take that step and do the research. You gotta show your kids that if they're gonna put the step forward and take that step and learn and put in the hard work that you have to do it too.

Ela Richmond (30:07.842)  
I love that. Second question, what is your favorite thing about open education? About this, I don't know if you've heard the concept yet, but the idea of open education is basically that in the past, education was closed. There was one way to do education. And now the world of education is entirely open. There are literally a million opportunities and options for every single family. The world is open. Like you choose, pick what works for your family. So yeah, what do you love most about open education?

Zach From Bottega U (30:36.41)  
Yeah, I think you covered it pretty succinctly. The world of open education is a world of innumerable options. And with that comes...

advantages and disadvantages depending on your personality. So the advantages are numerous. It has to do with you have a lot more options that you can tailor through your family and your students needs. The disadvantages are that sometimes you can have so many options that it can make you feel exhausted and overwhelmed. So having the guidance is just as important. So Open Ed, for instance, is a great resource and guidance. And that's why we partner with you and

we would hope that your students would continue to rely on you and then take advantage of Plotega and any of your other partners as well for that guidance in a world of many options.

I love it. And last question, what is your advice to a new homeschool family?

Zach From Bottega U (31:34.864)  
Just be willing to adapt and be flexible. Nothing will go the way that you think it will go. And that's the beauty of it. If you've decided to homeschool, you've decided to let go, ironically, even though I feel like I have more control over the way that we shape our lives, you have to be willing to let go that.

because there's so many things that can happen that just change your plans. And you have to be okay with that and just go with the flow. And if you can do that, then you'll be successful. And then just, again, be humble and ask for advice anywhere you can get it.
