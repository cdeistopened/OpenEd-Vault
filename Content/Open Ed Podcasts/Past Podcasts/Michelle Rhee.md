What to Do When Your Students Don't Respect You (Michelle Rhee's Story)

Thumbnail: “They ate me for lunch”

- [x] Description

Every educator knows the moment when you've lost control of your classroom. Michelle Rhee—the woman who transformed Washington DC's failing school system from worst in the nation to leading the country in academic gains—once had students who "ate her for lunch." Her first-year teaching experience was so catastrophic that parents pulled their kids from her classroom. Yet by her third year, those same parents were begging her to stay. Her transformation wasn't magic—it was strategy, structure, and an unwavering commitment to not letting eight-year-olds run her out of town. From classroom disaster to DC Schools Chancellor to venture capitalist, Michelle's journey offers powerful lessons for anyone committed to transforming how children learn.

## Episode Overview

**Guest**: Michelle Rhee - Former DC Schools Chancellor, Current VC at EO Ventures**Core Topics**: Education reform, teacher evaluation, school choice, innovation, venture capital in education**Target Audience**: OpenEd parents seeking alternatives to traditional education

## Cold Open Analysis

### Recommended Cold Open (Highest Drama Potential)

**Option 1: The Transformation Contradiction**

```Plain
[COLD OPEN - MONTAGE]
[44:14] "I've been interested in and around education for my whole career and have never really felt like the whole thing is going to be changed."
[32:48] "We know what we need to do in public education in this country and we're just refusing to do it."
[12:25] "We took a group of kids who were performing on average at the 13th percentile of nationally recognized standardized tests."
[12:43] "And by the end of that second year with us, the majority were on grade level."
[15:16] "And that really bugged the crap out of me. And I wanted to do something that was going to fix that."
```

**Why this works**:

- Creates immediate contradiction (can't be changed vs. we know how to fix it)
- Shows dramatic transformation (13th percentile to grade level)
- Emotional peak ("bugged the crap out of me")
- Ends on motivation/action
- Aligns with OpenEd audience frustration with system

**Option 2: The Brutal Honesty Hook**

```Plain
[COLD OPEN - 09:45 to 10:15]
"I had 36 kids in my classroom and they were the lowest performing kids academically and the worst behavioral. And so they freaking ate me for lunch. And some of the lowest moments of my life were in that classroom. I remember one time I got so frustrated with the kids, I was like, do you want me to just leave and go teach some rich kids somewhere? And this kid looked at me and he was like, if you want to, what are you talking about lady?"
```

**Why this works**:

- Immediate vulnerability and honesty
- Relatable struggle (overwhelmed educator)
- Surprising outcome (kids calling her out)
- Natural cliffhanger (what happened next?)

### Clip #1: The Looping Innovation

**Timestamp**: 15:39 - 16:30 + 18:56 - 19:33 (Combined)**Hook**: "Why don't teachers stay with the same kids for multiple years?"**Type**: Informative/Framework**Original Transcript**:

```Plain
[CLIP #1 - COMBINED]
[15:39-16:30] "That was just this random brainchild that my co-teacher, Michelle Jacobs and I had. We just had this idea like, if all 60 of the kids could get reading from her and math led by me, like the kids are gonna end up doing better. And the reason why I think looping is so good is because that second year, that's when we saw massive acceleration. We didn't have to spend the first month of school learning each other."

[18:56-19:33] "If you're a fan of sports, you might hear someone say, well, one of the reasons this quarterback has really struggled is he's had a new coach every year. Can you imagine trying to start over learning a new office? Kids have new teachers every single year."
```

**On-Screen Text (All Platforms)**: "Kids have new teachers every year. That's insane."

**Platform-Specific Captions**:

**Facebook**:  
Every parent knows the frustration of starting over with a new teacher each year. What if kids could stay with the same teacher for multiple years? Michelle Rhee shares how this simple "looping" concept led to massive acceleration for her students. It's about building trust and not wasting the first precious month of school. What are your thoughts on teacher continuity? \#EducationReform \#ParentingTips \#TeacherContinuity \#StudentSuccess \#MichelleRhee \#OpenEd \#Learning

**LinkedIn**:  
The "September shuffle" is a common experience in education, but is it optimal for student learning? Michelle Rhee discusses the power of "looping" – keeping students with the same teacher for multiple years. This approach fostered significant academic acceleration by eliminating the annual ramp-up time and building deeper teacher-student relationships. A compelling case for rethinking traditional grade-level transitions. \#EducationInnovation \#Leadership \#TeachingStrategies \#StudentOutcomes #EdReform \#MichelleRhee #EqualOpportunityVentures

**Instagram**:  
🤯 Kids get a new teacher EVERY. SINGLE. YEAR. Think about the wasted time! Michelle Rhee found that keeping students with the same teacher for 2+ years (looping) was a game-changer for their learning. 🚀 Less reteaching, more trust, massive acceleration.

### Clip #2: The Homework Contradiction

**Timestamp**: 12:55 - 13:30 + 21:43 - 22:13 (Combined)**Hook**: "When kids need more structure vs. when they need less"**Type**: Polarizing/Informative**Original Transcript**:

```Plain
[CLIP #2 - COMBINED]
[12:55-13:30] "We kept the kids after school. We gave them two hours of homework a night. Because for us, when you go home, it's not like our students were going to soccer practice and piano lessons. They were just going to go home and sit on the stoop all afternoon. We thought, well, do something constructive."

[21:43-22:13] "I think the context matters. I just finished reading The Anxious Generation. It really does make me think about such stark differences between when we were growing up. We'd come home from school, nobody was there. We'd go out and do whatever in the woods. That's what builds resilience and character and grit."
```

**On-Screen Text (All Platforms)**: "More homework vs. no homework. Both are wrong."

**Platform-Specific Captions**:

**Facebook**:  
The homework debate: more, less, or none at all? Michelle Rhee shares her surprising experience – from assigning two hours a night in one context to questioning its universal value after reading "The Anxious Generation." It's not a one-size-fits-all answer. The key? Understanding the _context_ of a child's life and needs. What's your take on homework? \#HomeworkDebate \#Parenting \#Education \#ContextMatters \#MichelleRhee \#TheAnxiousGeneration \#StudentWellbeing #ParentingCommunity

**LinkedIn**:  
Is the traditional homework model outdated? Michelle Rhee's experience highlights the critical importance of context in educational strategies. While structured homework served a purpose for students needing constructive after-school engagement, the insights from "The Anxious Generation" prompt a re-evaluation. Effective education adapts to individual student needs and environments, rather than applying blanket rules. \#EducationStrategy \#Leadership \#ChildDevelopment #EdReform #ContextualLearning \#MichelleRhee

**Instagram**:  
Homework: love it or hate it? 🤔 Michelle Rhee has seen both sides. Sometimes it's necessary, sometimes it's not. The real question: does it FIT the child's life and needs? Context is EVERYTHING. 🌍 Let's talk about smarter, not just more (or less), homework.  
\#Homework \#ParentingLife \#Education \#StudentNeeds \#ContextIsKey \#MichelleRhee #EdChat \#TheAnxiousGeneration #MomLife \#DadLife #ModernParenting

**TikTok**:  
Homework: 📚 More? Less? NONE? Michelle Rhee says it DEPENDS! Context is king. 👑 What worked for one group of kids might not work for another. \#EduTok \#HomeworkHacks \#ParentingTips \#ContextMatters \#MichelleRhee \#SchoolLife #Student \#TheAnxiousGeneration

### Clip #3: The Private vs. Public School Reality Check

**Timestamp**: 14:49 - 15:16**Hook**: "The uncomfortable truth about who really succeeds"**Type**: Polarizing/Emotional**Original Transcript**:

```Plain
[CLIP #3 - 14:49 to 15:16]
"I juxtaposed that to my experience in private school, where some kids who were absolute jokers, didn't work hard, weren't particularly bright, would go on to college and be successful because they inherit their father's company. And I was looking at my students every day who had such tremendous promise and aptitude, knocking it out of the park. But their life chances aren't really going to be driven by if you work hard and do the right thing, then you can live the American dream."
```

**On-Screen Text (All Platforms)**: "Rich kids who were 'jokers' vs. poor kids who were brilliant"

**Platform-Specific Captions**:

**Facebook**:  
An uncomfortable truth from Michelle Rhee: hard work and brilliance don't always guarantee success. She saw "joker" students from wealthy backgrounds inherit success, while incredibly bright students from low-income areas faced systemic barriers. It's a stark reminder that the "American Dream" isn't equally accessible. What can we do to level the playing field? \#EducationEquity \#SocialJustice \#MeritocracyMyth #SystemicChange #MichelleRhee #EqualOpportunity \#ParentDiscussion

**LinkedIn**:  
Michelle Rhee offers a sobering perspective on meritocracy. Her experiences in both private and public schools revealed that factors beyond individual effort and aptitude often dictate life chances. This challenges the narrative that hard work alone leads to success and underscores the need for systemic reforms to create genuine equal opportunity. A critical discussion for leaders invested in talent development and social mobility. \#EdEquity \#SocialMobility \#Leadership \#DEI #EducationReform \#MichelleRhee #EqualOpportunityVentures

**Instagram**:  
Is the "American Dream" a myth for some? 💔 Michelle Rhee shares a tough reality: she saw brilliant, hardworking students from tough backgrounds get overlooked, while less capable wealthy students coasted. It's not always about merit. We need to talk about REAL equity.  
\#EducationEquity \#SocialJustice #SystemicChange \#FairChance \#MichelleRhee \#TruthBomb \#Changemakers #EdReform #FutureOfEducation

**TikTok**:  
🤯 Rich kids succeeding with no effort while brilliant poor kids struggle? Michelle Rhee saw it firsthand. The system isn't always fair. 💔 \#Truth \#EducationEquity \#SocialJustice \#MichelleRhee #EdReform #MakeADifference #SystemChange #SchoolSystem

## Transcript

Isaac (00:01)  
Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. I am Isaac Morehouse and I am here with my favorite co-host, Matt Bowman. Matt, how are you?

Matt Bowman (00:08)  
Hey Isaac,

doing great. Great to be with you today.

Isaac (00:13)  
If you're listening and not watching on video, Matt has the world's biggest grin on his face, ⁓ even bigger grin than the usual Matt Bowman grin, because today we are joined by an education legend. Michelle Rhee is here with us and we're going to get into her story. But Michelle, welcome to the OpenEd Podcast.

Matt Bowman (00:18)  
Hahaha

Michelle (00:32)  
Thank you for having me. I'm super excited to be here.

Isaac (00:35)  
Absolutely. So just for those listening, if you're not familiar, Michelle has an extensive history in and around education. She cut her teeth with Teach for America. She became the CEO of the New Teacher Project for many years. She was the chancellor of the Washington DC public schools. She founded Students First and now...

She is with a venture capital firm, which seems like an interesting and unexpected turn. I think we'll get into that a little bit, but Michelle, I want to just start with going way back to your own education experience growing up as a kid. What kind of education did you have and what did that, those early years do in terms of kind of setting the stage for how you view education and what happened later in your career?

Michelle (01:27)  
So I am the child of immigrants, ⁓ Korean immigrants at that. And so it will be ⁓ unsurprising to anyone that education was just the number one priority in our household. My parents moved to this country because they wanted ⁓ to live the American dream. ⁓ But from a cultural perspective, it was very much like the way that you succeed in life is you get a great education.

That was always the focus in our household. We were always expected to ⁓ do extraordinarily well in school. When we didn't, we heard about it. ⁓ I went to a public school through sixth grade and then transitioned to a private school ⁓ in Toledo, Ohio and really got a ⁓ first rate education, I will say. ⁓ I was incredibly well prepared for the rigors of college.

⁓ So that's, you know, that was a little bit about us. you know, people make the joke all the time that, you know, when you're an Asian and you come home with a B, the parents will say you're not a B's and you're an Asian. That was exactly the mindset of my parents. Like, you know, you came home with an A, I was like, why is this not an A plus? That sort of vibe.

Isaac (02:38)  
You

It's so interesting. First, as a Michigander, I'm sorry that you grew up in Ohio, but we, I'm sure we can. ⁓ It's so interesting because I have such a, my own education experience is so far removed from that in terms of like the, ⁓ you know, heavy duty focus on academics and getting an A. I mean, my parents were, you they wanted us to do our best and do well. I was mostly homeschooled, but it.

Michelle (02:55)  
We need a Pistachos on that one.

Isaac (03:17)  
I, what I always strikes me is, cause I grew up with some people like that and some on the opposite end of the spectrum. And it doesn't always translate the way you would think into later life success. Like people who had a ton of academic focus, they almost always go to college and do well in college. But when you look 10 years after college at like what happens with people's careers, the really heavy academic or grade focused in the early years, the earlier, the less it translates.

doesn't always like map that well and versus some people who just kind of like struggled in school, didn't do well. I'm curious what you think of that because there's clearly something you took from your parents being so focused on that rigor, but knowing enough about you with all of your interest in education reform, I'm curious like, is that an over focus? Is there a problem there or are there things that are missed with that focus on the academic grades?

Michelle (04:10)  
Yeah. So it's interesting because, know, growing up, so first of all, I'm not an intellectual. And I did well in school, but I didn't do extraordinarily well. It was never, never really good enough for my mom, right? And she always used to sort of say, well, why can't you be like this Korean kid over here or that one over there? I won't name names to embarrass them. ⁓ And so I grew up sort of in that kind of environment. And what's interesting is that ⁓ those

some of those kids like flamed out really early, right, or aren't particularly doing well ⁓ now. And I think ⁓ that one of the differentiators for me is the fact that my dad was very different from most traditional ⁓ Korean men of his generation and age. ⁓ He is very ⁓ service oriented, right? So ⁓ he

He was a physician, ⁓ but my parents met because my mother was a social worker, my dad was a physician, and they went and volunteered in some poor Korean village for the summer, that kind of thing. And he really instilled that ⁓ sense of civic responsibility to us. ⁓ And when I said I was going to join Teach for America, as an example, my mother was like, fricking, not, you're not going to go teach. We didn't send you to an Ivy League college to

Matt Bowman (05:35)  
It's just.

Isaac (05:35)  
You

⁓

Michelle (05:39)  
you know, go teach public school in Baltimore. And so she was adamantly opposed to it. And my dad, ⁓ after hearing everything was like, she's gonna go, she's gonna do this, this is a good thing to do. ⁓ And so I think because I had that balance, I grew up with, ⁓ you know, a lot of experiences, ⁓ you know, volunteering, just seeing how other people live their lives.

Isaac (06:00)  
you know, it's serious.

Michelle (06:07)  
And I think it gave me a different sense of perspective and like that social justice gene, I guess that my dad had ⁓ was always a part of the equation for me.

Isaac (06:18)  
That's, I had ⁓ probably my best experiences in my youth were on summer, most summers I did various humanitarian trips to various countries and you places that were very, very impoverished and just the, the perspective shift and the understanding and the questions that it forces you to ask about how the world works and just getting outside of, know, your own little experience were absolutely second to none. So I can totally share that.

I'm curious and Matt, actually don't think I've asked you this either. When you came out of college or maybe it was in college, at what point, Michelle, did you know I want to teach? Like what sparked the interest in teaching? Did you always know that or did you stumble into it?

Michelle (07:04)  
So I, for my entire life, I have always liked kids more than adults. And so, you know, when I was young, I would babysit, I would volunteer in, you know, my high school boyfriend's mother was a elementary school teacher. I volunteered in her classroom. I'd work at summer camps, that sort of thing. ⁓ But at the same time, I also, you know, knew that teaching was not

Isaac (07:12)  
Hehehehe

Michelle (07:34)  
sort of perceived by society to be, you know, the kind of occupation that you were supposed to go into if you were a high achiever. ⁓ And so never really thought about teaching as a career. ⁓ But when I was in college, I learned about Teach for America and I thought, okay, well, this makes sense for me because it's like, it's just a short stint, right? But it's something that I know I could be good at.

and I would wanna do, and so that was sort of the gateway in for me. But then once I had that experience in Teach for America, I knew I was gonna be sort of in it for the long.

Isaac (08:16)  
Can you tell me what that was like? So you come out, you join Teach For America. I think you were in Baltimore, right? You went to the Baltimore schools. I'm guessing that this was not an easy thing to step into. what was the, you know, when you first hit the ground running there, like, was it overwhelming? Just give me your take. Cause I just, I have to imagine.

There were moments where you were like, what am I doing? Can I make it through?

Michelle (08:48)  
I mean, I had one of the toughest ⁓ first year of teaching experiences ⁓ probably in my core year. I was ⁓ assigned to a third grade classroom ⁓ at one of the worst performing elementary schools in Baltimore, Harlem Park Elementary School. ⁓

Matt Bowman (08:52)  
Thank

Michelle (09:14)  
there were four sections, sorry, I started in second grade and then I went to third. So I started in second grade, there were four sections of second graders and they were tracked, back then you know there was tracking, they were tracked by both academics and behavior and I was assigned to track four. So I had 36 kids in my classroom and they were the lowest performing kids academically and the worst behavior.

Matt Bowman (09:36)  
Thank

behavioral.

Michelle (09:45)  
And so you could only like, they freaking ate me for lunch. ⁓ And some of the lowest moments of my life were in that classroom. I remember one time I got so frustrated with the kids. I was like, do you want me to just leave and go teach some rich kids somewhere? And this kid looked at me and he was like, if you want to, what are you talking about lady? ⁓

⁓ I mean, there were a couple of parents who were super savvy who pulled their kids out of my classroom. It was that bad. I mean, it was just utter chaos. And ⁓ every day it was just like a struggle. ⁓ But a few things like really changed the trajectory of like how that year went. And ⁓

The summer between my first and second year, I was like, I am not gonna let eight-year-olds run me out of town. Like, this is ridiculous. ⁓ And so I spent the entire summer like planning. I was going to these PD sessions, et cetera. ⁓ A colleague of mine and I decided that we were gonna bring ⁓ all of our kids from both sections into one classroom together and sort of team teach.

And we did that. my second and third year, we had this group of basically 60 kids that we team taught and we looped with them. So we took them through their second and third grade year. And it was wildly different. much so that by the time I left, some of those same parents were like, where are you going? We got like some other kids that you need to be here to teach our younger kids. So it really sort of was a 180 degree turn.

in terms of my, you know, from what I was doing my first year, which was a disaster to what I left.

Isaac (11:43)  
Did you stay, it for America, ⁓ I thought it was like a one year minimum, it? Okay, but you stayed beyond that, you stayed for three.

Michelle (11:49)  
It's a two year minimum. I did

because I took that two year commitment to me in two good years and my first one was a failure that I was like, gotta be here at least for one more year.

Matt Bowman (11:56)  
Thank

Isaac (12:01)  
Was it at that point, in that three year experience, is that when you started to become more interested in education reform as a whole? Like, okay, what is leading this to happen? What is going on with the system at large? What sparked that? Or was there books or conversations or people that you ran into ⁓ that got you excited about that?

Michelle (12:25)  
Yeah, mean, that experience, my second and third year, we took a group of kids who were performing on average at like the 13th percentile of nationally recognized standardized tests. And by the end of that second year with us, my third year of teaching, the majority of were on grade level. ⁓ And it was crazy. We kept the kids after school. We gave them two hours of homework a night.

Isaac (12:43)  
How? How did you do that?

Michelle (12:55)  
⁓ you know, cause for us, were like, well, you know, when you go home, it's not like our students were then going to soccer practice and piano lessons and that sort of thing. They were just going to go home and sitting on the stoop all afternoon. we thought, well, you know, do something constructive. And we got a lot of ground to catch up on here academically. ⁓ and, ⁓ we got them really invested.

⁓ in their academics and doing well. It took a minute, right? So at first, parents were like, this is too much. What are you doing? ⁓ You're asking for too much. But as time went on, I think they saw the progress that their kids were making. They saw how proud the kids were of what they were accomplishing. And so by the end, they were fully in it as well. And I think through that experience, what I realized was that

you know, because, you know, the environment that these kids were growing up in, that did not change their health care plans, the food they were eating, you know, who their parents were, et cetera. Like none of that changed. What changed were the adults who were in front of them every single day in the classroom and what we were doing with that time. And so it really convinced me that the public education system was not working for the kids who needed it to work the most.

And ⁓ I thought I juxtaposed that to my experience in private school, where, you know, some kids who were absolute jokers, like didn't work hard, weren't particularly bright, you know, would go on to college. And I knew we're going to be successful because they, you know, inherit their father's company or what have you. And I was looking at my students every day who, so like they had such

tremendous promise and aptitude. Like they were knocking it out of the park, right? And I was thinking, but their life chances and their life outcomes are not really going to be driven based on like the American ideals of like, if you work hard and do the right thing, then you can live the American dream. I actually knew that that wasn't the case for a lot of my kids. ⁓ And that really bugged the crap out of me. And I wanted to do something that was going to fix that.

Matt Bowman (14:49)  
you

Isaac (15:16)  
It's so interesting. ahead. Yeah, go ahead.

Matt Bowman (15:16)  
Hey, Isaac, I have a quick question just on

the looping. I love the idea of teachers staying with a group of kids multi-year. I even love a multi-age group where they come in and rotate around. Was that a district standard that they were already doing? Did you ask for that? How did that policy happen?

Michelle (15:39)  
Yeah.

No, that was just this random brainchild that my co-teacher, Michelle Jacobs and I had. We just had this idea like, okay, this is what we're gonna do because she was much stronger in teaching reading and I was stronger in teaching math. And so we were like, if all 60 of the kids could get reading from her and math, know, reading led by her and math led by me, like the kids are gonna end up doing better.

we asked our principal, this woman, this phenomenal woman by the name of Linda Carver, and she was like, what do you wanna do? We were like, yeah, we're gonna jam all the kids into one classroom and we're gonna have this rotational model, right? And she was like, okay. I mean, she was open to innovation and she was bought into what we were doing. And so the interesting thing about that was that, and the reason why I think looping is so,

is so good is because that second year, like that's when we saw like massive acceleration, right? We didn't have to spend the first month of school learning each other and all this stuff. Like those kids knew exactly what the program looked like. And it's funny, used to, one thing that people don't know. So I was, my school was part of a really early experiment that Baltimore city ⁓ engaged, embarked on.

way back in the day, Kurt Schmoke was the mayor of Baltimore and he hired an outside private company called Educational Alternatives Incorporated to take over 12 of the city's lowest performing schools. So he was way ahead of his time back then. And my school was one of those schools.

And ⁓ so they were trying to like implement this model and none of the teachers at my school were particularly interested in implementing, but I didn't know any better, right? I didn't know anything. I didn't know any better. So was like, I'll do it. ⁓ And so I was actually implementing this. One of the things they taught us ⁓ was ⁓ an old school sort of program called calendar math. And the idea was you teach kids math skills through like this sort of whole calendar setup.

And so I did that and it was great. The kids loved it. And one day ⁓ someone came into the classroom and they were like, Ms. Rie, we need you over here. So I went to the door and I told one of my top students, was like, Jeffrey, take over for me. And by the time I came back, I was watching this kid and he literally was going through the entire like thing of what I did every morning down to like when I would ask the kids, what's the weather like?

I noticed that I opened the window and he opened the window as he was asking. And so that structure, the routine, it was ingrained in the kids and ⁓ it just helped them. Because for some of them, their worlds outside of school were just so chaotic and so unpredictable and whatever that they really, the structure, the predictability. ⁓

and the consistency, they just thrived in that environment.

Isaac (18:56)  
It's funny you mentioned staying with student. I have never actually had this thought before, but it just occurred to me, if you're a fan of sports at the pro level or even at the college level, you might hear sometimes someone say, well, one of the reasons this quarterback has really struggled is he's had a new coach every year for the last three years in a row. Can you imagine trying to start over learning a new office? You're thinking kids have new teachers every single year. That's like that inability to get that longer term.

That's ⁓ just such an interesting observation. Is there more of that? Like, has that become more popular since then?

Michelle (19:33)  
think it's typically a thing that people do. mean, the multi-age grouping piece, that's something that's sort of a Montessori concept, and we didn't do that. But the notion of sort of looping with kids, I don't think it's something that has ever really gained a ton of popularity. But people who have done it, both on the family side and on the teacher side, they swear by it. They're like, yes, this is the way to go.

Matt Bowman (20:01)  
Isaac, might not know, I was in a experimental K-12 in a public school. had the same teacher, K-12, and she loved it. She said it was the best thing for kids, for families, but the district organization, the teachers thought it was in a, they didn't wanna do it, they didn't wanna learn multi-age curriculum, but she, and so it only lasted like,

Matt Bowman (20:01)  
Isaac, might not know, I was in a experimental K-12 in a public school. had the same teacher, K-12, and she loved it. She said it was the best thing for kids, for families, but the district organization, the teachers thought it was in a, they didn't wanna do it, they didn't wanna learn multi-age curriculum, but she, and so it only lasted like,

four or five years, but I was three of those years. So it was super fun. really, you know, look, I didn't realize it was such a unique thing until I realized nobody's doing that. And I thought that was in the seventies and why aren't we doing more of that for sure.

Isaac (20:46)  
⁓ The other thought I had, you were talking about the kids, one of the reasons that they were successful is you demanded more of them and they had more homework and they had more. And it's interesting because Matt and I talk about ⁓ often, and I talk to people all the time, that a lot of kids today, I think have too much structured time, too much homework, too much their whole day, everything is full between sports and homework and mobile.

And one of the hard things for a lot of those parents, like especially where I live now, for example, it's this rat race. Everybody's trying to do the next best thing and the next, and it's like, Hey, back off a little bit. Give your kids a little bit of room to breathe a little bit to be kids. But, but as any of these things, it's not a universal one-stop solution. In this case, when the rest of their life is totally unstructured and chaotic, more structure and more homework and more academic demands were actually what they needed.

And it's just a good reminder that it's like, it's not just one way or the other.

Michelle (21:43)  
That's right. I think the context matters. ⁓ But to your point, I like, I just finished reading The Anxious Generation. ⁓ And afterwards, I was like, my gosh, I've ruined my kids with all this stuff. But it really does make me think about such stark differences between when we were growing up, right? Where we'd come home from school, nobody was there. We'd go out and do whatever in the woods.

Isaac (22:10)  
Yeah, you ride your bikes around as long as you're home

at dark, you know?

Michelle (22:13)  
Yeah. But you you got bullied, you watched your little brother get beat up, all those things. that's, know, hates point in all this is like, yeah, you have to live through some of that stuff. And that's what builds resilience and character and ⁓ grit and all that sort of stuff. And I think that's right. ⁓ I think when we are, we are

with some of our kids like structuring things way too much and you know, such that when that structure is not there, they're like, my God, what do I do? And they have anxiety about it. Like that's a problem.

Isaac (22:54)  
Yeah. So I want to, I want to jump ahead. So you did Teach for America. I know you had 10 years, the new teacher project. Then you became the chancellor of Washington DC public schools. So now finally you get to do all the things you want to do and put everything in place and reform everything. Right? Super easy.

Michelle (23:13)  
Super easy. Yeah. That's right. So I'd run the new teacher project for 10 years. And during those 10 years, we worked with most of the large urban school districts in the nation. And, ⁓ you know, my staff and I were always so frustrated. We're like, I isn't the superintendent doing this? Why isn't the head of HR doing that? ⁓ And we saw the promise and potential of what could be if only, you know, the district was doing what they should have been doing.

in our mind. ⁓ And so when I had the opportunity to take the job, the sort of overarching driving factor for me was like, got to put your money where your mouth is, right? You're going to be this consultant type person who's just telling people what to do versus actually like doing it yourself. ⁓ So it was just a tremendous, like it was really the opportunity of a lifetime, right? To be able to be in a mayoral control structure with the most

supportive, unbelievable mayor you possibly could have in Adrian Fenty. ⁓ So bought into like what needed to happen and was unapologetic about just like go, go, go. ⁓ And, you know, not having to deal with the school board, ⁓ being in this position where we were a city state. So we weren't, it wasn't, you know, like there were all state regulations out there that we needed to follow that were gonna kind of stymie what we wanted to do.

Matt Bowman (24:36)  
Mm.

Michelle (24:40)  
So really it was like the perfect storm of a situation that sort of led to what we were able to do there.

Isaac (24:51)  
And give me a, in a nutshell, what were you able to do there and were there things that you wanted to do that you were not able to do?

Michelle (25:00)  
⁓ So in a quick nutshell, we took the district when we took over the district in 2007, it was the lowest performing school district in the nation. It was the only school district that was on high risk status with the US Department of Education, mostly for the misuse of federal funds. 8 % of the kids were on grade level in mathematics ⁓ in the eighth grade at the time. ⁓ So literally,

The good thing for me was the bar was the floor, right? Like was in order to go up. But we went from that situation to by the time we left, DC Public Schools was leading the nation in gains on the NAEP exam. And there was no one silver bullet in terms of like how we did that. There was a lot of work that went into it and a great team that helped to drive that.

But I'd say some of the main components of what we did were, you know, we put in place a new evaluation system. And that evaluation system was distinguished by the fact that a large portion of how teachers were going to be evaluated was based on growth and student achievement. And then we put in place a compensation system.

that rewarded the most effective teachers. ⁓ my gosh, ⁓ that was a hard fought battle. I mean, there were a lot of battles in terms of closing schools and this, that and the other thing, but the teachers union contracts was the toughest. But we were able to get through it largely because of the leadership of a ⁓ guy by the name of George Parker, who was the teachers union president at the time. ⁓

Isaac (26:29)  
Did you get a lot of pushback for that?

Michelle (26:55)  
He was super unusual for a teacher's union leader. ⁓ He understood ⁓ what we were trying to do. He was aligned in terms of student achievement needing to be at the top of the priority list. he ended up, like Adrian, both of them ended up not getting re-elected for another term after we implemented all of this. ⁓

Without his leadership, we would not have been able to put that contract in place.

Matt Bowman (27:28)  
What was that year span? 2007, how many years?

Michelle (27:33)  
So I was there for about three and a half years. So 2007, 2007 to the end of 2010. And then after that, my successor, Kaia Henderson, who was fantastic, because she was there with me during the whole first three and a half years and stayed for another five years after that as chancellor. And that consistency also, like you can't underestimate.

Matt Bowman (27:36)  
And.

Yeah, good.

Michelle (27:59)  
just like teachers and having to learn a new teacher, superintendents is the same way. It's like you bring in a new superintendent, they wanna throw away all the old plans and create their new strategic plan and all that kind of stuff. And Kaia didn't have to do all that, because she had been there with me from the get-go. And so she was able to just keep going. And she's so amazing. She did a lot of things way better than I did.

⁓ And some of those things that we weren't able to do in the first term, ⁓ she was able to execute in the second term. ⁓ And I think that just consistent hard nose driving to the outcomes for that long was what allowed DC to kind of just maintain the momentum. And that momentum continued through the pandemic.

Isaac (28:51)  
Did lots of other districts start to emulate what you're doing? I mean, to go from the bottom to the top in a three year span, I'm sure was a wake up call to a lot of people. Did some of those reforms start to take off in other districts across the country?

Michelle (29:08)  
Not really. It's funny because people who aren't in education, like sometimes they'll see the data and they're like, well, why didn't everybody just do those things? Like, because it was hard. you know, my boss didn't get reelected and neither did George Parker, right? ⁓ I mean, the reality is that the only reason we were able to do what we did

Isaac (29:09)  
Hahaha

Michelle (29:37)  
in DC was because of the mayoral control and specifically because of the kind of mayor that Adrian Fethi was. ⁓ So, you know, that's a hard thing in and of itself to replicate. But knowing for other elected officials who are thinking about like making education their top priority, it was tough because Adrian was sort of like the cautionary tale.

Right? Of like, this is what happens if you take this hard stance and ⁓ you do this aggressively. And so there were some folks who were like, well, we want to do what DC did. We just want to do it nicer. ⁓ Some people called it like, you know, DC light. ⁓

Isaac (30:18)  
You

So

here's the pitch. If conditions are perfect, you'll have three years of absolute hell and then you'll lose your job. Go sign it up!

Michelle (30:31)  
Here we go. Well, who wouldn't want to do that, right?

Matt Bowman (30:35)  
Well, I need to insert here because we share this in the book and I don't want to take it down ⁓ a very pessimistic route, but both political parties want bad test scores. Both benefit. The right have advocated for bad test scores in a subtle way to justify, you know, privatization and choice. The left has always advocated for bad test scores so they could demand more funding for schools. So it's interesting that

Why didn't people replicate the success? There's pressure to not have great test scores because there's reasons on the political sides to advocate for those things. So anyway, that's a whole different discussion, but it's really interesting that what your success was not replicated and it was was feared. Right. And so it was really interesting how some of that evolved. So anyway, continue.

Michelle (31:31)  
say that like some good things didn't, I mean, you what they did in New Orleans, what they did, my ex-husband in the state of Tennessee, a deputy of mine, ⁓ Carrie Wright ⁓ has since taken over the state of Mississippi and she did amazing things there. So there are some, you know, are some bright spots here and there, but in terms of like the whole hog like model of what we utilized, that was never ⁓ duplicated and I think, you

I get why not. But all of that made me super, just turned me into this curmudgeon, right? Because I got to the point where I was like, you know what, we know what we need to do in public education in this country and we're just refusing to do it. so, you know, it's never gonna change. That was my mindset for a good while. ⁓ And then I sort of came into this, ⁓

into this world that I'm in now in venture capital. And I have regained my optimism ⁓ that I lost. So that's one of the main things of what I love about my current job is I can once again be like, okay, we can do this, let's go. ⁓

Isaac (32:48)  
Well, yeah, tell me what I totally understand what would make you just start to feel deflated and say, I need something different. ⁓ I guess two part question. How did that, what, what made venture capital the thing that took you out of education and why did you go that direction? And then what made you start to get interested again and start to look at.

the education space again and have a little bit more of that optimism. Was it just a little bit of time away was what you needed or has something shifted in the world?

Michelle (33:19)  
No, so I completely left education in about 2018 because I was so fed up. And also I was like, I am probably more harmful to the dynamic right now than I am helpful because people would evoke my name and like, people like Michelle Rhee want to evaluate teachers solely on the basis of test scores, stuff like that, which was not true, but it didn't matter, right? It was an effective scare tactic. So I was like, let me just remove myself from this situation. ⁓

Isaac (33:32)  
You

Michelle (33:49)  
And then in 2020, a colleague of mine ⁓ from the education space, had ⁓ successfully co-founded ⁓ a tech startup ⁓ and she had a successful exit from that. She called me one day, Jimena Hartzok, wonderful woman, and she said, hey, I have this idea for this new company. ⁓ It was an apprentice. The notion was we need to bring the apprenticeship model ⁓ into the modern day.

⁓ And she had implemented one herself at her prior tech company and she was like, I want to build a software platform that helps companies to start manage apprenticeship programs. And I was like, that sounds so great. I was like, good luck, girl. Let me know what you need, how I can help. She's like, no, I want you to start this with me. And I'm like, I don't know anything about the startup world. She's like, no, no, we can do this. ⁓ So my husband said to me, I think you got one more big thing in you, babe. ⁓

Matt Bowman (34:45)  
haha

Michelle (34:46)  
⁓ And so I entered the startup world ⁓ and we built Build Within. And it was like a tremendous experience, a tremendous learning experience for me. I left there after about three years and thought I was going to take a little bit of a ⁓ hiatus. And then, ⁓ and then Roland called me. So Roland, Prior and I have been friends since 2007 when ⁓ he was a 27 year old, like just had become the youngest. ⁓

ever black tenured professor at Harvard. And I was, you know, this young gun chancellor and we worked on a project together in DC public schools around paying kids to do well in school, which by the way was successful. And so we'd known each other ever since then. So he calls me and he's like, Hey, you should join us, you know, at EO Ventures. We just raised this hundred million dollar fund and, ⁓ and you should run a fund within the fund that is focused on education investments.

was like, no, thank you. I'm out of education. I love being out. I never want to get back in. It's got something to do with workforce development. He's like, whatever you want, just come on board. Which I thought was kind of crazy, but it's on brand for him. And then I talked to Bill Helman, the other founder of EO Ventures. Bill, so Bill spent 35 years at Greylock, 15 of those as managing director. So he's a legend in the venture capital space. And when I went to my first meeting with him, was like, sir.

I do not understand why you want me for this job. ⁓ I have never invested before. I don't know anything about investing. Surely you can find somebody who's more qualified than me. ⁓ And he looked at me and he said, you know, there's some stuff you're going to have to learn. He's like, but you can do it. You're smart. You'll figure it out. He's not that much. He's like, really? This is a business about picking people and you know how to do that. And I just thought it was so.

wild for me that this titan of the industry could think that an old woman like me could learn something new and be good at it, right? And I love rolling from before. I was like super intrigued. So was like, all right, I'll try. I was like, I'll do this half time for you guys. And now I'm like 80 hours a week deep in venture capital now. But Isaac, to answer your question, I think what has like turned my optimism

Isaac (36:57)  
you

Michelle (37:07)  
around is just like every day I meet with founders who feel like they are going to change the world through what they're building. And, you know, sometimes I'm like, I love the founder, don't love the idea. I love the idea. Don't love the founder. But like every now and again, I'll meet someone who I'm like, holy crap, like you, you're going to be able to do this. You are going to be able to change the game with what you're building. And that's what has like sparked my

enthusiasm back up again because some of these folks are just like they're tremendous people they have ideas that are phenomenal they need the capital to execute and like we are like down for that journey with them.

Isaac (37:51)  
It's amazing what being exposed to little pockets of people who are doing amazing things can do to completely change your mindset. remember Matt, you've run your youth entrepreneur contest for several years. And just a couple of weeks ago, you asked me to come and be one of the panelists for these final pitches. And these three kids, they're like, how old were they, Matt? Like 15, 16?

Matt Bowman (38:16)  
15, yeah.

Isaac (38:18)  
their businesses that they already have built that they're running and their pitches. It's like you can't even though it's just three kids. I'm like, if it is possible for there to be three 15 year olds in this country who are doing what they're doing, then my optimism for the future just like went through the roof. Even just three. It's like the fact that they can even exist is such a good sign. So being in venture capital, I imagine just seeing those pitches, even though not all of them are great. It's such a good exposure and reminder that

Yeah, there's a lot of tough stuff out there, but there's so many great minds, you know?

Michelle (38:51)  
Absolutely. Like yesterday, just yesterday, I met with two founders. They sent me the deck. I think it was like a cold outreach or something like this. I looked at their deck and they have their pictures. I think they must have been from their senior prom from high school. I'm not joking. I looked at the deck. like, these are 12 year olds. You can't give millions of dollars to a 12 year old. ⁓ But we decided to meet with them just, you

hear what they had to say. And it was like, compressive. was like, holy crap, I can tell because I sit in a lot of meetings, I'm like, okay, after 20 minutes, you kind of get the notion you're like, but I sat there this meeting with them, I was like, like, this is impressive stuff. Like they have, they had it all thought out. They had a really clear thesis, like the plan. Like, I was just, I was blown away. ⁓ And so it's, it's those kinds of experiences to your point, Isaac, that is just like make

this job so fun and fulfilling.

Isaac (39:54)  
Okay, so I'm gonna bring us home with a little bit of a future looking question or your prognosis on the education industry. You know, at various points, some new thing happens in the world. You know, the internet comes about and everyone's like, okay, this is gonna be the thing that totally transforms public education. And it kinda does, but it's not quite as radical as maybe people thought at first. Is it different this time?

Are we in, because I feel like since COVID, something accelerated. It's not like a new technology was created in 2020, but the fact of people having this experience of doing virtual school or just not being in school for a while and all of sudden what parents thought was possible and what they wanted shifted, like consumer preference shifted in a massive way or something. Now you add, there are some technological advances, AI and things. I mean, even just video conferencing. Let's be honest, in 2020,

A lot of people didn't even know that you could video conference with 50 people at once. Like even though you could for five years before that or more, but like it was still kind of new. So I feel like we're at a point where even the stagiest public school systems that have been set in their ways and all the incentives are for that are kind of being forced to change because they're losing enrollments. they're like, it feels like there's something happening where there actually is an opportunity for some really big changes.

across the board in education. Do you feel that? this really something big or are you like, there'll be some innovation around the edges, but we're not talking transformation.

Michelle (41:34)  
So I'm going to tell a quick little story first and then I'm going to answer the question. So ⁓ I have been really interested and focused on AR and VR in education since I came on board at the firm. ⁓ so I had an early conversation with Bill where he was like, Michelle, people have been telling me that VR is right around the corner for 30 years. guess what? It was never around the corner. He's like,

Matt Bowman (42:00)  
No.

Michelle (42:04)  
He didn't tell me to stop doing anything, but he was just like, so just keep that in mind. Because he's like, if every time I got on an airplane, I saw one or two people with the goggles, then I would think maybe something was happening. He's like, but I don't see it. And that made sense to me. So I was like, OK. But then I continued to look into this, and I read this news story about the top draft pick in the NFL. It was this kid who like,

had learned to become good, right? ⁓ With through virtual reality. And so I started talking to people in the field and somebody said to me like, you should really just start asking people you know, who have kids, like, what do they know about VR? And it was fascinating because every single parent said back to me either yes, they have a headset or they don't have one, but they're bugging the crap out of me for one.

I was like, huh. And then the data came back and it's like 30 % of kids have a headset, 50 % have used one, and only 20 % have no clue what it is. So I think that there are several things right now that might very well sort of come together and create the perfect storm of like a significance and...

catalyze a significant change ⁓ in the equation. And I think the sort of AR, VR pieces is fascinating and that could be one. I think ESAs, right? Educational savings accounts and the fact that more and more states are adopting them and more more families are utilizing them. ⁓ And then obviously AI. And I think...

Because of those three factors, putting a lot of pressure and bringing innovation in a different way to the equation, I think very well could set us down a wildly different path over the next few years.

Isaac (44:14)  
Yeah, have for, I don't know, I've been interested in and around education for my whole career as well and have never really felt when it comes to higher ed, I've had moments where I'm like, the whole thing is going to be changed. know, but K through 12, I've just never really had that feeling like, there's, yeah, there's always going to be some reforms. There'll be some vouchers in addition. There'll be some this and that, but just in the last few years, it's like, I never would have thought what 15 States in a single year could all do any essay or.

You know, I mean, even just parents that I talk to at my kids little league or whatever, before COVID, maybe one out of 20 would say something like they're thinking about something different for school. Now it's literally like three out of five say something like, like it's the majority of them are like, ⁓ we're thinking about a hybrid school or we're thinking about, like there's just this willingness and this desire for something different from the.

consumer side that I haven't seen before. So I'm with you and you are positioned to invest in all of those cool new things that come along.

Michelle (45:20)  
That's right. So if you're building in this space, hit me up. I think that we're, to your point, like I think we're at an incredibly important time. And I think that there's this huge opportunity ⁓ to build things that could significantly move the ball forward.

for our kids and the quality of education that they're getting.
