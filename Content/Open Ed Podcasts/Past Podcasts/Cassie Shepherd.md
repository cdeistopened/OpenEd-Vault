### How do I know they’re learning:

But how do you know they're learning?

Pay attention. Standardized tests measure standardized thinking. But real learning? That shows up in curiosity, confidence, and capability.

Real indicators of learning:

- Are they asking deeper questions
- Do you see them making unexpected connections
- Are they teaching concepts to siblings
- Can they apply knowledge to real life
- Do they get excited about discoveries

  

### Clip about baby

Personalized learning is very much like having a baby - right about the time you figure something out, everything changes and you adjust again.

  

### Parents for creative learners

Cassie’s seven-year-old is a wiggler. He's easily distracted. He thinks differently and outside the box.

She shared, “I think sometimes the whole reason we were supposed to homeschool was for him because I just don't think he would ever thrive in a really big classroom.”

That’s the beauty of personalized learning.

When given space to learn differently kids can:

- Flex their creativity
- Jump into more complex discussions
- Make unexpected connections

Sometimes the students who struggle most in traditional settings become the students who flourish when given space to learn differently.

  

### Seeking connection

‘I remember thinking my girls' light had gone out at school. Within three weeks of coming home, they were beaming again.'

The transformation signs:

- Tantrums disappeared
- Natural curiosity returned
- Creativity flourished
- Joy in learning reignited
- Family bonds strengthened

Cassie's powerful observation: 'When a child doesn't feel secure in their environment, they're not going to progress. A big part of that as a mother is to make sure that you are enjoying your family and enjoying being with your kids.'

  

### The right question for creative students

The wrong question is: 'How do we make creative minds fit the system?'  
The right question is: 'How do we create systems that fit creative minds?

  

### Parents trying to do it all

Can you really manage a household AND be your child's teacher?

One mom's honest journey:  
'I had a 6-month-old baby and was terrified of juggling it all. But here's what nobody tells you - when you stop rushing to morning drop-offs and afternoon pickups, you actually gain time.'

The secret? Integration, not separation.

- Laundry + audiobook lessons
- Cooking + math practice
- Yard work + nature study
- Life skills + learning moments

You're not adding a school day to your life. You're adding life to your child's education.

  

### Transitioning to personalized learning:

That first month of home education never looks like Pinterest.

It's imperfect (and that’s a good thing).

One family's journey:

- Set alarms for 6 AM (then quickly realized they didn't need to!)
- Used a card table from the garage as their first 'classroom'
- Over-planned the first few days

  

But overtime they learned to flex with each child’s needs.

The hardest part (for both parents and students) is learning how to learn differently.

  

### For parents feeling overwhelmed:

Starting to explore alternative education options? Feeling overwhelmed?

Education isn't a sprint or even a marathon. It's a daily walk with your child, discovering the world together.

Take a deep breath. Here's your permission to:

- Start small
- Adjust as you go
- Learn alongside your kids
- Change what isn't working
- Celebrate small victories

You don't need all the answers today.

  

### Educate multiple kids at once

How do you educate multiple children at once?

A practical rhythm that works for Cassie Shepherd:

- Start together (family meeting, day planning)
- Youngest to oldest individual sessions
- Independent work for older students
- Group projects after lunch
- Interest-based exploration to close

It's not about perfect scheduling. It’s about working with your family’s natural rhythm.

### What you need:

You don’t need a dedicated classroom to do personalized education.  
One family started with a card table from their garage  

Now their kids learn on the porch, in cozy corners, at kitchen counters.

  

Start with what you’ve got.

  

### Are you listening?

3 signs your child might need a different learning environment:

- Return of old behaviors (like tantrums)
- Changes in creative expression
- Morning emotional battles  
    

Your child's behavior tells a story. Are you listening?

  

### Teaching multiple kids at once:

Teaching 4 kids at once sounds chaotic  
But watch how one of our OpenEd families makes this works:

- Youngest gets focused morning time
- Older ones do independent work
- Everyone joins for group projects

  

They’ve found their family’s natural rhythm.

  

### Transformation

3 weeks — That's how long it took to see transformation when one family switched to personalized learning.

  
The light came back to their eyes  
Joy returned to learning  

Sometimes the smartest path isn't the traditional one.

### "When Lights Go Out: A Mother's Observations"

Ela: [00:00:00] You ~also ~mentioned that your kids, you felt like their light had gone out. What did that look like and how long did it take for them? You said about two weeks for it to come back on. ~What were you doing? Like, ~what do you think was contributing to their light going out as opposed to their light coming back?

Cassie: That's a good question. ~Um, ~some of the red flags that we saw and what I kind of felt like, was the. Where their light was, was going out was, I think ~there's always, I want to say ~there's always a normal adjustment ~period period. And I had seen that. I also taught, ~I was a preschool teacher for a long time.

So I see kids ~kind of ~in that first couple of weeks. There's an adjustment period. So I'm very well aware of that. ~And so ~when we first started school, ~I just, ~we had done 3 years of preschool and a year of kindergarten, ~like I had mentioned. And ~so I'd gone through those adjustment stages, ~but. Yeah. ~This time the adjustment stage was ~like ~way more dramatic.

~They would come home in, or actually it wasn't as much coming home to go to school. ~They were just in tears almost every single morning. The first couple of days ~were, ~were fine. ~Um, ~I remember thinking it was about the third day and they were just like falling to pieces. Like, I don't want to go back.

Don't make me go back. And I was like, it's okay. ~Like it's for, for us, ~I just kind of thought at that time it was the longer days. ~Right. ~They were, going from just ~a couple of, you know, ~four years of a pattern of ~just ~short school [00:01:00] days. ~And ~so the days were really long for them. ~So ~I thought, ~okay, ~it's probably just that you're having a really long day and you're tired ~and we're doing this every time.~

Right. And it just never stopped. And we got into mid October and I was like, this is far too long to be going through this stuff. ~And ~they started throwing tantrums that I hadn't seen them do in. ~Like ~years, ~like, you know, ~like toddler tantrums ~and, um, ~my degree is in family life education. So I have a lot of experience in human development and I also have experience working with ~trauma, ~trauma kids.

And I just started to ~kind of ~see some of these ~flat ~red flags ~that I was like, ~I don't think it's normal that you should not care ~this ~or that you should be so ~disrupt, like ~disruptive. ~Like, or they were disrupted. I shouldn't say that, but ~to have so much disruption in our routines, like coming home and kind of, you know, having a hard time adjust things, one of the things I did was put a baby monitor in their room to ~kind of ~hear, you know, they're twins, so they would play back and forth and I would kind of try to hear what they would be playing and I just kind of felt like when they were responding to some ~of the ~things ~that they were talking about, that was ~happening in the classroom, I was like, I don't know if [00:02:00] this feels like, ~you know, ~A very good environment.

And, my girls, ~um, you know, one kid, ~one way that kids express themselves is, ~you know, ~at that age, they were 6 years old. They can't verbalize a lot of the time their own feelings. ~Right? ~And so you kind of have to look for some of these other behavioral signs, like, Crying or tantrums that is completely out of normal.

Like it's not their normal behavior. Right? ~So ~some of these things start to stain, ~but another thing is, ~like I said, ~play, ~you can listen to their play. ~The other thing is to, ~provide ~like ~art opportunities. A lot of ~the ~times kids might draw themselves ~like ~in a situation ~or something. And, um, ~in fact, my daughter, ~she, I keep it posted nearby that she, she ~was drawing ~like, She was actually, ~I was sitting ~right here ~at this desk, and she was sitting right next to me, and she was drawing this picture.

And I looked over, it was evening, and she was just bawling her eyes out. ~And ~I was like, oh my gosh, what is wrong? And she's drawing this picture, and it had all of our family together, and all of these hearts, and it said 10 out of 10 ~on it. ~She had written Mom. ~And she's, and ~I said, ~what, ~what is wrong?

You're drawing this really cute picture of our family. ~And ~she said, I just want to be home with my family. I ~just ~remember thinking ~like, I'm, ~I'm trying to ~kind of ~suppress her feelings ~and ~saying ~like, Oh, you're, you know, ~you'll be fine. Go to school, you'll adjust, [00:03:00] you'll get through it. And she just was like, no, I don't want to be there.

I want to be home with our family. You know, we had just had a baby. ~I, ~that's when we ~kind of ~started to explore things and think, okay, ~like, ~what other options could we have? Or what could we do to have more time as a family? ~And, ~eventually we homeschooled. ~and ~when we came home, I remember it was 3 weeks after she was drawing this picture.

Another picture, we were sitting ~at our ~at our little desk. Our school room didn't look like this yet, but we were sitting in a desk that I had pulled out. It was dirty was in the garage. ~I just pulled off off a cardboard box or a cardboard table to, Or is that what it's called? Not card? Yeah.~

Cardboard table? Card table? You know what I mean, like a lifetime table. ~Um, so ~I just pulled it off and ~she was, ~we were doing school on it ~and ~she drew this ~other ~picture and it was snowing outside, but ~she, ~she drew herself in this little like red dress and ~she didn't. Well, she didn't say it was herself, but ~she says, the girl ~in this, ~in this picture is so happy and she's got snow and flowers in it.

And I said, why, why is she happy? Why is this little girl happy? And she says, cause she knows that she's loved. She knows that the heavenly father loves her ~and that, you know, and ~I just saw ~this like kind of ~this contrast ~of like, ~she ~just ~felt overwhelmingly [00:04:00] loved ~like that. ~She was home ~now. And, and really ~after that, I just saw them talking.

Start to thrive again. Their lights came back on, they completely stopped having tantrums. ~There was no crying. There wasn't any drama. ~They were just back to my little girls, you know, just little happy girls that were happy to play. And they have been that way ever since.

### Empower Your Lifestyle: Customize for Happiness

Ela: ~And like, just especially for the moms who are struggling and or finding themselves challenged, like what, what does that feel like?~

~What have you found?~

Cassie: ~You know, I love the idea that ~[00:00:00] You can make this lifestyle whatever you want, right? it's very customizable. And so if there's something where you just feel like you're dreading then maybe you need to change it, right? Like, and that's what's the that's so beautiful about it. Many of us is how we've been raised is that there's so much like, well, things are done this way and we have to produce it this way.

It's kind of that that factory line production, right? Of education. And so. I've actually found speaking with some others is they have a really hard time even knowing what it is that they want for their family. Right? Um, so for me, when I first started homeschooling is I just spent a really long time evaluating what I wanted my family to look like.

~ I think it speaks to women's natures, right? Like we have a, we it's, it's in our natures to want to, nurture others. And so, what is it that can help you fulfill that?~

### “Tell Me More About That”

  

  

  

Ela: What are some of your favorite questions to ask your kids?

Cassie: "Tell me more about that." It's not really a question, but it's my favorite response when they're drawing or explaining something. Instead of asking "What are you drawing?" which looks for a specific answer, "Tell me more" opens up conversation.

### It's like having a baby

1. [20:17] Evolution from rigid to natural learning  
    Key quote: "When I first started homeschooling, there's definitely that fear... I need to make sure that I'm homeschooling five days a week and mimicking that same school schedule... then like a couple days later I was like, I don't need to do all this. I can be more relaxed."

  

  

### Balancing Homeschooling and Family Life [08:42]

Ela: That's an incredible story, even more powerful this time than when I first heard it. Thank you for sharing. I think many parents can relate to watching their kids change or seeing confusing emotional states. Having the curiosity to say "This isn't normal, what's going on?" is so important. People often dismiss teen depression or difficult phases as just normal stages, but becoming curious as a parent and wanting to walk with them through it is crucial.

I know you use The Good and the Beautiful now - is that what you started with? How did you begin? Some people talk about starting traditionally then moving to a more flexible model at home. What does your schooling look like?

Cassie: The journey has definitely evolved over these years. I've learned so much about myself in this process - I've really blossomed because I love it and have the freedom to try different approaches. Even when I worked as a classroom teacher, there were always strict limitations on activities and curriculum.

When I first started homeschooling, I had that fear of needing to mirror traditional school - setting my alarm for 6 AM, prepping everything perfectly, doing five days a week. Then a few days in, I realized I could be more relaxed. We did maintain five days a week that first year, though things were different with COVID since co-ops and groups were shut down.

As I got more comfortable, I could let go of those preconceived notions and be more creative. It was fascinating to discover how my twins learned - whether better together or separate, hands-on or not. Then when I started teaching my boys, I had to learn all over again because they were so different.

I always tell new homeschool moms it's like having a baby - just when you figure out nursing, they start solids and everything changes. You have to adjust to different stages. What worked with my girls was different from my boys. They have different talents that I'm still discovering daily. That's what I love about it - I really know my kids and see sides of them I might have missed if they were gone all day.

Now I'm very eclectic in what I use. I started with The Good and the Beautiful and still love it because it's easy, but instead of rigidly following lessons, I use it more as a guide and bring in other books and activities. We love using literature - my older girls love to read. This year we're excited to do more art and creative projects. I have one son who loves Legos and engineering, so we give him lots of opportunities to build and draw. If we see recurring interests, we provide materials to let them explore and potentially develop passions.

  

  

  

# From Fear to Fulfillment: A Journey of Self-Discovery in Homeschooling 🌟

Ela: [00:00:00] What does your schooling look like?

Cassie: ~Yeah, that's a really good question. it's definitely evolved over the last couple of years.~ I would say one thing that has been so amazing about this journey is I've learned a lot about myself in this process, right? It's been, to, if I, I don't want to like put myself on a pedestal, but I feel like I've really blossomed because I've just loved it.

And I've been able to try things and feel like I have the freedom to do it. even when I like worked in the classroom as a teacher, you still have to do things very right ways. And I remember sometimes when I would write curriculum plans, I'm like, I don't want to, I don't want to do a certain activity because that would take so much time.

And I don't know if it would be okay or, you know, there was just limitations. And when, when I first started homeschooling, there's definitely kind of that fear that you go through, like, okay, I need to make sure that I'm homeschooling five days a week and kind of mimicking and following that same school schedule.

So, and then I just kind of really quickly realized like the first couple of days, I set my alarm at like 6 a. m. to make sure I got up and got ready and got everything prepped. [00:01:00] And then like a couple of days later, I was like, I don't need to do all this. I can be a little bit more relaxed. Right. And we did homeschool five days a week for the first year.

I feel like the first year to two years was a little different than maybe, maybe I would have originally, I don't, I don't know, just because it was COVID. I wasn't really looking for like co ops or groups or things like that, because everything was pretty much shut down and we were just all kind of like, you know, surviving in education together.

But as I just slowly became more comfortable with things, I was able to let go of. Um, some of those kind of like preconceived notions of what I was worried about in homeschool or what I wanted to do differently, um, and start exploring with that and just kind of being able to be creative with it. And, um, then also combined with the fact that my kids could, I could do it differently with each of my kids.

Like, it was really fun to kind of experiment, see how the twins kind of learned, whether they learned better together, [00:02:00] or whether they learned. Um, better separate or if we need to do more hands on activities or if they, you know, preferred different types of learning and things like that. And then, as I have introduced my boys, I feel like things were totally different with them.

Like, they were like, I felt like I was like, kind of learning all over again. Um, 1 of the pieces of advice that I always love to share with new homeschool moms is, it's very much like having a baby, like. right about the time you figure out how to either nurse or use a bottle, um, and you finally feel really comfortable with that. Then they're eating solids and they're putting food all over your face and you're worried about like the thickness of the food you're giving them and everything changes, right? Um, and so you kind of have to like adjust to these different stages that your kids go through. And I definitely felt like that.

I felt like I was like getting it down really well with my girls and then. My boys were, they just learn a little bit differently. My next son [00:03:00] was different than my girls and he has different talents. And so, you know, I'm still discovering those every single day. And again, that's one of the things I love about it is I feel like I really know my kids.

I see different sides of them that, um, I don't know if I would have ever saw if, if they were gone all day and somebody else was kind of working through some of the things that, you know, we do at home together. Um, and so it's been such a joy, um, at this point and this style, um, we, I'm very eclectic in what I use.

I love pulling from everything. I started with the good and the beautiful. I still love using them because it makes it really easy, but. Instead of following the lessons, maybe as rigid as I did in the beginning, I love to just kind of take the lesson off the page and bring in other books or assignments or things, just kind of use it as a guide to help me as well as some of the other, um, uh, curriculums that we pull from.

We love using literature. That's a big part in our, in our homeschool. My, my older girls love to read. And so we bring in lots of books and activities and then. You know, this year, I feel like we're excited to do more [00:04:00] art this year and be more creative in some of the things that we've been doing. So that's more what we've been focusing on this year.

And that's the beauty of it. I have one son who absolutely loves Legos and engineering, and he just really thrives, um, building and we can give them lots of opportunities to do that. And, um, Let him just experiment. He also draws a ton. And so he, I mean, he draws almost every single day and we just let him be creative.

We try to, we try to kind of. You know, I feel like kids, their, their interests can kind of change quickly at this age, but if it's something that we kind of see reoccurring, reoccurringly happen, we like to, to provide those opportunities for them and give them some materials to explore those interests and see if that's something that they want to continue to learn, you know, and, and develop a passion for it.

~ But as I just slowly became more comfortable with things, I was able to let go of.~

### Introduction and Guest Welcome [00:00]

Ela: Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. I'm Ela, your sometimes host, and today I'm so excited because I'm joined by Cassie Shepard. How are you doing today?

Cassie: I'm doing great. Thank you so much for having me on.

Ela: Yeah. So a little bit about you - you have four kids, you're Utah based, and you've been doing homeschool for a little while. And you also have a really popular Instagram channel.

Cassie: That's right. I'm over at Home Centered Learning on Instagram and that's my main platform. I have a website as well, homecenteredlearning.com. It's been a great way to connect with other homeschooling families and something I've been really passionate about. It's been a fun creative outlet for me to have that space and also create a community of like-minded mothers and families who embrace this lifestyle.

### Cassie's Homeschooling Journey [01:08]

Ela: Yeah, I love that. The first time I got to know you a little bit and heard from you was at an event where you shared your story and how you got started in this homeschool space. Can you share a little bit about that and the experiences you had?

Cassie: Sure. We started homeschooling almost five years ago, in November 2019. We had started public school like normal with my twin girls, who were in first grade at the time. We'd done a couple years of preschool and half-day kindergarten, and everything went really smoothly.

When we got into first grade, we started to see some red flags right out of the gate. We met with the principal and teacher as issues came up. Homeschooling wasn't really on my mind at first - we were looking more at options like maybe sending the kids for just half days.

Then I mentioned what was going on to a neighbor, and she asked if I'd ever considered homeschooling. I hadn't really thought about it before, but she planted that seed. Over the next three weeks as we explored options, we had a spiritual experience where we felt this was the right path for our family. We took a huge leap of faith and decided to pull them out and start homeschooling.

### Making the Decision to Homeschool [01:49]

Ela: Was that a difficult decision? You mentioned it wasn't on your radar before this neighbor mentioned it. I read on your website that you wrote out tons of pros and cons, and you were surprised by how many pros there were to fully pulling them out. What were some of those pros, and what was the final thing that made you make that leap?

Cassie: That's a good question. When I wrote out our pros and cons, I think some of the issue is we always just do what's been done, right? I went to public school, my husband went to public school, and that just seemed to be the next step for our kids. We hadn't really thought beyond that.

### Pros and Cons of Homeschooling [03:10]

Cassie: Education has always been really important to us. I was probably a little unusual in how much I researched schools. But when I started making that pro and con list, setting aside outside influences, I realized there were many good reasons to homeschool.

Some key pros were more family time together and being able to customize our kids' education. My girls were advanced in some areas, and I felt they weren't being challenged enough in school. We also wanted to travel and have more flexibility. I remember asking the school if I could pick up my kids just five minutes early on Thursdays for activities, and they refused, saying it would disrupt the classroom. Little inflexibilities like that made us want more freedom to explore our children's interests.

On my con list, the two main concerns quickly changed. One was socialization, and the other was managing everything with a six-month-old baby. But within about three weeks of bringing them home, I saw my girls beaming again - their light had gone out at school, but now it was back. We were especially worried about socialization, but that changed quickly, though COVID happened four months later and made things look different for the first couple years. Now that we've been doing it for five years, we feel so confident. We have a great group we do things with, and my kids have thrived.

### Initial Challenges and Adjustments [04:37]

Ela: You mentioned managing everything as a parent - being responsible for their learning, making sure they eat, keeping the house orderly, making dinner. It's a lot to juggle when you don't outsource education. What was your situation before? Did you have to quit a job, or were you already a stay-at-home mom?

Cassie: We had planned before having kids that I wanted to be a stay-at-home mom, so leaving a job wasn't something we needed to change. But there was definitely an emotional weight - having a lot on my plate for a long time. It's not something that ever really goes away, but I've learned to embrace it because while it's heavy, there's also a really high reward. For me, I'd rather have that weight and responsibility than feel disconnected from my children's lives.

### Emotional and Social Impact on Children [06:19]

Cassie: The red flags we saw - after adjusting to three years of preschool and kindergarten - were dramatic. By the third day of first grade they were falling to pieces, saying "I don't want to go back." Initially I thought it was just the longer days. But by mid-October, they were having toddler-level tantrums we hadn't seen in years.

With my degree in family life education and experience working with trauma kids, I started seeing concerning signs. I put a baby monitor in their room to hear their play conversations, and what I heard about their classroom experiences troubled me. Six-year-olds can't always verbalize their feelings, so you look for behavioral signs like crying or unusual tantrums.

My daughter was drawing one evening at my desk, tears streaming down her face. The picture showed our family together with hearts and "10 out of 10" written on it. When I asked what was wrong, she said "I just want to be home with my family." I'd been trying to suppress her feelings, telling her to adjust, but she was clear - she didn't want to be there.

Three weeks after bringing them home, she drew another picture - a girl in a red dress with snow and flowers. When I asked why the girl was happy, she said "because she knows that she's loved." After that I saw them truly thrive. The tantrums stopped, the crying ended, and they returned to being my happy little girls. They've been that way ever since.

### Balancing Homeschooling and Family Life [08:42]

Ela: That's an incredible story, even more powerful this time than when I first heard it. Thank you for sharing. I think many parents can relate to watching their kids change or seeing confusing emotional states. Having the curiosity to say "This isn't normal, what's going on?" is so important. People often dismiss teen depression or difficult phases as just normal stages, but becoming curious as a parent and wanting to walk with them through it is crucial.

I know you use The Good and the Beautiful now - is that what you started with? How did you begin? Some people talk about starting traditionally then moving to a more flexible model at home. What does your schooling look like?

Cassie: The journey has definitely evolved over these years. I've learned so much about myself in this process - I've really blossomed because I love it and have the freedom to try different approaches. Even when I worked as a classroom teacher, there were always strict limitations on activities and curriculum.

When I first started homeschooling, I had that fear of needing to mirror traditional school - setting my alarm for 6 AM, prepping everything perfectly, doing five days a week. Then a few days in, I realized I could be more relaxed. We did maintain five days a week that first year, though things were different with COVID since co-ops and groups were shut down.

As I got more comfortable, I could let go of those preconceived notions and be more creative. It was fascinating to discover how my twins learned - whether better together or separate, hands-on or not. Then when I started teaching my boys, I had to learn all over again because they were so different.

I always tell new homeschool moms it's like having a baby - just when you figure out nursing, they start solids and everything changes. You have to adjust to different stages. What worked with my girls was different from my boys. They have different talents that I'm still discovering daily. That's what I love about it - I really know my kids and see sides of them I might have missed if they were gone all day.

Now I'm very eclectic in what I use. I started with The Good and the Beautiful and still love it because it's easy, but instead of rigidly following lessons, I use it more as a guide and bring in other books and activities. We love using literature - my older girls love to read. This year we're excited to do more art and creative projects. I have one son who loves Legos and engineering, so we give him lots of opportunities to build and draw. If we see recurring interests, we provide materials to let them explore and potentially develop passions.

### Nurturing Individual Passions in Homeschooling [22:15]

Ela: How did you initially find your kids' passions and start to nurture them? And what does it look like to educate four children at once?

Cassie: For passions, I follow whatever they show interest in. I used to do formal homeschool interviews, asking "What do you love? What would you like to see different?" Now I check in periodically about their interests. Sometimes they don't know, like my girls who've loved animals for years. Sometimes I provide a feast of options. Once I was reading different subjects to my girls when they were nine or ten, and they lit up at plants and gardening. We dove into botany, plant cells, got lots of books, did hands-on activities, and brought in YouTube videos to support their interest.

### Managing Multiple Children in Homeschooling [24:53]

As for teaching four kids - you have to constantly adjust rhythms. Instead of a rigid schedule like public school, we have rough outlines. I'm more structured than some homeschool families because I feel it's good for kids to know what to expect, but I stay flexible.

We always start with morning time - a devotional where everyone's together. We set the stage for the day, discuss schedules, extracurriculars, or address any family issues. Then I work youngest to oldest. My older girls have independent work they can do - watching math lessons, completing assignments. I work with my kindergartner first, then my second grader who has simple independent work like handwriting and phonics. I meet with my girls either before or after lunch to review math and writing.

After lunch, we usually do family-style lessons where we all come together - science, history, art projects. Then the kids can relax and play, though we try to keep the whole environment learning-focused, always offering opportunities to explore their interests.

### Creating a Customized Homeschooling Lifestyle [30:00]

Ela: You mentioned meeting with each kid individually. Are you meeting in the same room? Where are the rest working? I imagine it's distracting.

Cassie: We have a rule that when I'm working one-on-one with someone in our main school room, the others can't interrupt. My girls have desks upstairs, but they do school all around the house - this morning they were doing math on the front porch while my son did his independent work on the couch.

This wasn't the case with toddlers, since interruptions are developmentally appropriate then. I wouldn't want my toddler feeling they couldn't come to me, so I'd often have them on my lap or toys on the floor while working with the others. You just push through those times.

### Rapid Fire Q&A with Cassie [34:42]

Ela: What are some of your favorite questions to ask your kids?

Cassie: "Tell me more about that." It's not really a question, but it's my favorite response when they're drawing or explaining something. Instead of asking "What are you drawing?" which looks for a specific answer, "Tell me more" opens up conversation.

Ela: What's your favorite story of something that really works for your kids?

Cassie: Hands-on things work really well. I bring in lots of manipulatives since my passion is early childhood education - movable alphabets, sandpaper letters, number boards. These work especially well for early childhood when they need more hands-on learning.

Ela: What's your favorite story of seeing your kids succeed with this flexible education model?

Cassie: Definitely my seven-year-old son. He's a wiggler, needs one-on-one attention, and is easily distracted. Sometimes I think we were meant to homeschool just for him - he wouldn't thrive in a big classroom. He has such a creative mind and thinks differently. He'll surprise me by joining complex discussions I'm having with my older girls. He loves drawing and fills notebook after notebook - we just let him follow that passion.

Ela: This has been great. Thank you for coming on. Where can people find you?

Cassie: Just my website, homecenteredlearning.com and Instagram at homecenteredlearning.

Ela: We'll definitely check out Cassie. She's incredible.

Cassie: Thank you so much. Have a great day.

Ela Richmond (00:01.523)  
Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm Ella, your sometimes host, and today I'm so excited because I'm joined by Cassie Shepherd. How are you doing today?

bcfj2mqv97 (00:09.966)  
I'm doing great. Thank you so much for having me on.

Ela Richmond (00:12.861)  
Yeah. So a little bit about you. You have four kids. You're Utah based and you've been doing homeschool for a little while. And you also have a really popular Instagram channel,

bcfj2mqv97 (00:24.35)  
That's right. Yep, you could say that. Yep, I'm over at Home Centered Learning on Instagram and that's my main platform. I have a website as well, homecenteredlearning .com and it's been a great way to connect with other homeschooling families and something I've been really passionate about. So it's been a really good, it's been a really fun creative outlet for me to have that space and also create a community of like -minded mothers and families who embrace this lifestyle.

Ela Richmond (00:27.177)  
you

Ela Richmond (00:53.341)  
Yeah, I love that. The first time I got to know you a little bit and I heard from you was at an event where you shared your story and kind of how you got started in this homeschool space. Can you kind of share a little bit about that and the experiences that you had?

bcfj2mqv97 (01:07.052)  
Sure, yeah, you bet. We started homeschooling, it was actually almost five years ago, it was November of 2019. We had started public school like normal with, I have twin girls at the time, and they were in first grade. And we just started the school year like normal, we didn't ever have any issues, and we did a couple years of preschool, and then we did just half -day kindergarten at that point, and everything went really smoothly.

When we got into first grade, we started to kind of see some red flags just kind of right out of the gate and we ran into some issues and the question kind of came up is like, well, you what are we going to do? We met with the principal, we met with the teacher and things just kind of started to evolve and change and homeschooling wasn't really on my mind when we first had the issues. We were kind of looking more at like what it might look like to send our kids like maybe half day to school and just like

stop after lunch or something, you know, and we weren't entirely quite sure what it would look like or, know, do we, anyway, we just kind of went through all of the options. But then I mentioned to kind of what was going on to a neighbor of mine and she's like, well, have you ever considered homeschooling? And I was like, no, not ever, not really. And, but she just kind of planted that little seed in my heart and.

The more that things kind of progressed, it was actually only like over three weeks as we kind of were exploring options and trying to decide what to do. We just felt like it was just, was a spiritual experience for us where we felt like this was the right path for our family. And so we just kind of jumped in. We took a huge leap of faith and decided to, to pull them out and start homeschooling.

Ela Richmond (02:54.065)  
Yeah, was that a difficult decision? You mentioned that that was not on your radar before, and then this neighbor mentions it to you. And then I believe I was reading some of your things on your website, and you said that you wrote out tons of pros and cons. And you were so surprised by how many pros there were to actually just fully pulling them out. What were some of those pros, and what was the inciting point that finally made you make that decision, make that leap?

bcfj2mqv97 (03:07.145)  
That's right.

bcfj2mqv97 (03:21.639)  
Yeah, that's a good question. So I wrote out our pros and cons and I was kind of disappointed when I really, think some of the issue is, is, you know, we always just kind of do what's always been done, right? Kind of in front of us. And I went to public school and my husband went to public school and that just kind of seemed to be like the next step for our kids. And we hadn't really thought any more beyond that.

Education has always been really important to us. I mean, we have a history of, I knew not all schools are created equally. I would do my research. I was probably a little bit abnormal when it came to researching schools, but it also just never occurred to me to do homeschooling. But as I started to make that pro and con list, when I really stopped letting everybody else around me influence my thoughts, I was like, actually, there's a lot of really good reasons to do this.

Amongst those reasons were more time together as a family. That was a big part, right? Being able to customize our kids' education was another part. We had some things where I felt like my girls were advanced and some of the things that they were doing in school, I was like, my gosh, this is so boring. I didn't feel like they were really being challenged. Some of the other things that we just kind of felt like we needed to do was

We wanted to travel, right? Again, that goes back to family time, but we just wanted to have more opportunities. We were involved in some extracurriculars, and I remember asking the schools, like, hey, can I just pick up my kids five minutes early every Thursday? And they were like, no way, you can't do that. And I was like, what? These are my kids. And they're like, it really disrupts the classroom. And I was like, what? Everybody's just getting their coats on.

And it would just make things so much easier for us, but it just, it was inflexible, right? Like some things little like that, little things like that, that we just wanted to have a little bit more freedom. We wanted to be able to explore our children's interests. That was something else that was really, really important to us. On my con list, my two top con lists, I remember thinking that they quickly changed.

Ela Richmond (05:29.929)  
Mm

bcfj2mqv97 (05:40.15)  
One was definitely socialization. I was primarily worried about socialization. and the other thing that it was is I was just worried about, I had just had a baby and he was only six months old at the time when we pulled the girls out. And my biggest concern was like, how would I take care of everybody and make sure that my older kids were getting the education they needed, but also my baby. Cause I had already, for a couple of years, I had already kind of like,

outsourced education, right? Where I didn't have to deal with that part and so I could raise my younger toddler and my baby. And so that was a big concern of mine. But I quickly learned after just a few weeks, I saw my little girls, like the way that I was describing it is I kind of felt like their light had gone out at school. And just within about three weeks, I just felt like they were beaming again. Like I just felt so good about our decision to bring them home and spend more time with them and give them

the attention that they needed and the help that they needed, as well as I saw progress immediately. And we were especially, like I said, worried about socialization. And that kind of changed real quickly because COVID happened four months later. socialization kind of looked different for us for the first couple of years, but now that we've been doing it for five years, we feel so confident and so good about things.

Ela Richmond (06:53.872)  
Yeah.

bcfj2mqv97 (07:04.322)  
We love the opportunities. have a great group that we do things with. And then I feel like my kids have thrived. They have lots of friends. It's like almost silly now. I kind of roll my eyes at myself because I'm like, that was silly to worry about it. But you just kind of do what everybody else worries about, right? That's what everybody always says about homeschooling is they're weird, socially awkward kids, but that wasn't the case for us. And then also we just, realized how much I loved being with my kids and it just felt like what motherhood was for me, like what it was supposed to be.

It was no longer just kind of like surviving between doing the dishes and doing the laundry and all and cleaning the house, kind of some of the things that don't have any relationship, right? It was weird because I was giving the relationship and the most important part with my kids to somebody else to develop. And so when I brought that home, I quickly realized how...

just how much I loved being with my kids and it was so rewarding. And I could see them progress really quickly and I was like, okay, we're gonna be fine. We're gonna be able to do this.

Ela Richmond (08:05.903)  
I love all of that you just said. You said a lot of really great things right there. One of the things that I wanted to call back to though was when you were talking about how you were feeling whenever you were weighing these options, just as you know, the parent that was going to take a lot of the burden. You're the one that's responsible for making sure that these kids learn. You're the one that's responsible for making sure that they eat and that everything's structured and that also on top of it that things are.

clean and orderly in your house as much as you want it to be and that dinner gets made and like it's a lot of stuff that now you're having to juggle whenever you don't outsource the education part of it. What was your state like what were you doing before? Did you also have to you know I guess quit a job or was were you already stay at home mom and now this was just kind of a transition because I also know that some parents have to make that decision you know am I gonna take a backseat in my career?

to make this transition as well.

bcfj2mqv97 (09:04.775)  
Absolutely. Yeah, you know, we have, we planned before we even ever had kids that I wanted to be a stay at home mom. So for me to leave a job or anything like that wasn't something that we need to change personally, but it was definitely the emotional weight. That's what I would say is, I mean, it does, it feels very heavy to be like, wow, I have a lot for a long time on my plate.

And honestly, it's not something that I feel like ever really goes away, right? And I think I've just, for me, I've learned to really embrace it because it's heavy and there's a lot, but then there's also a really high reward, right? And again, for me, it's like, I would rather have that weight and kind of bear that responsibility.

than completely not be involved in my child's life or kind of feel like that there's like a disconnect between us. And like I said, it's just it for me, it gave me what I always thought motherhood would be like, something that was like something I could find joy in. I think you almost kind of have to have that contrast where it's like before everything I was doing was just kind of shallow, even though they're all really important things. But, and then,

I just also found that I just love it. Like it doesn't feel, it doesn't, I mean, it's still hard. don't want to like say that it's not hard, but it's like worth it. Maybe that's the best way to say it. Cause I just, love being with my kids and I want to give them the best. And we feel like having them home with our family is that. And I'll also say I have a friend this year that she did have to leave her job.

Right? And it was hard, but she said, you know, I saw what was happening to my kids in school. And she said, we'll do whatever sacrifice we need to make to, to, to shift. she said that they had been, you know, you kind of get into this reactive state versus proactive, right? In your child's education. And she said, everything we were doing was reactive and I was spending so much time trying to fix issues that she said, I need to change directions and take control.

bcfj2mqv97 (11:18.958)  
moved to that proactive state and I said yeah exactly. you know I don't know I think there's always a sacrifice somewhere right it's it's it just kind of depends on like you know choosing and embracing what it is that you want.

Ela Richmond (11:33.777)  
Yeah, I think that's a very perfect way to explain it. You also mentioned that your kids, you felt like their light had gone out. What did that look like and how long did it take for them? You said about two weeks for it to come back on. What were you doing? What do you think was contributing to their light going out as opposed to their light coming back?

bcfj2mqv97 (11:52.925)  
That's a good question. Some of the red flags that we saw and what I kind of felt like was the where their light was was going out was we I think there's always I want to say there's always a normal adjustment period period and I had seen that I also taught I was a preschool teacher first a long time so I see kids kind of in that first couple of weeks there's an adjustment period so I'm very well aware of that.

And so when we first started school, just, had done three years of preschool and a year of kindergarten, like I had mentioned. And so I'd gone through those adjustment stages, but this time the adjustment stage was like way more dramatic. They would come home in, or actually it wasn't as much coming home to go to school. They were just in tears almost every single morning. The first couple of days were, were fine. I remember thinking it was about the third day and they were just like falling to pieces. Like I don't want to go back. Don't make me go back.

And I was like, it's okay. it's for us. I just kind of thought at that time it was the longer days, right? They were going from just a couple of, you know, four years of a pattern of just short school days. And so the days were really long for them. So I thought, okay, it's probably just that you're having a really long day and you're tired and we're doing this every time. Right. And it just never stopped. And we got into mid October and I was like, this is far too long to be going.

through this stuff and they started throwing tantrums that I hadn't seen them do in like years, like know, like toddler tantrums. And my degree is in family life education. So I have a lot of experience in human development and I also have experience working with trauma kids. And I just started to kind of see some of these flat red flags that I was like, I don't think it's normal that you should not care this or that you should be so disrupt like.

Ela Richmond (13:28.765)  
Mm -hmm.

bcfj2mqv97 (13:48.238)  
disruptive like or they were disrupted. I shouldn't say that but to have so much disruption in our routines like coming home and kind of you know having a hard time adjusting. One of the things I did was put a baby monitor in their room to kind of hear you know their twins so they would play back and forth and I would kind of try to hear what they would be playing and I just kind of felt like when they were responding to some of the things that they were talking about that was happening in the classroom I was like I don't know if this feels like

a very good environment and my girls, know, one way that kids express themselves is, you know, at that age, they were six years old, they can't verbalize a lot of the time their own feelings, right? And so you kind of have to look for some of these other behavioral signs like crying or tantrums that is completely out of normal. Like it's not their normal behavior, right? So some of these strength things are disdain. But another thing is, like I said, play, you can listen to their play. The other thing is to

Ela Richmond (14:40.723)  
Mm -hmm.

bcfj2mqv97 (14:47.865)  
provide like art opportunities. A lot of the times kids might draw themselves like in a situation or something and in fact my daughter, she, I keep it posted nearby, but she was drawing like, she was actually, I was sitting right here at this desk and she was sitting right next to me and she was drawing this picture and I looked over, it was evening and she was just bawling her eyes out and I was like, my gosh, what is wrong? And she's drawing this picture.

and it had all of our family together and all of these hearts and it said 10 out of 10 on it. She had written mom and I said, what is wrong? You're drawing this really cute picture of our family. And she said, I just wanna be home with my family. And I just remember thinking like, I'm trying to kind of suppress her feelings and saying like,

You'll be fine, go to school, you'll adjust, you'll get through it. And she just was like, no, I don't wanna be there. I wanna be home with our family. We had just had a baby. so that's when we kind of started to explore things and think, okay, like what other options could we have or what could we do to have more time as a family? And eventually we homeschooled. And when we came home, I remember it was three weeks after she was drawing this picture, another picture, we were sitting at our little desk.

Our school room didn't look like this yet, but we were sitting at a desk that I had pulled out. It was dirty, it was in the garage. I just pulled off off a cardboard box or a cardboard table to... Or is that what it's called? Not card? Yeah, cardboard table? Card table? You know what I mean, like a lifetime table. So I just pulled it off and she was, were doing school on it and she drew this other picture and it was snowing outside, but she drew herself in this little like,

Ela Richmond (16:24.297)  
Yeah, card table.

bcfj2mqv97 (16:36.255)  
red dress and she didn't well she didn't say it was herself but she says the girl in this in this picture is so happy and she's got snow and flowers in it and i said why why is she happy why is this little girl happy and she says because she knows that she's loved she knows that heavenly father loves her and that you know and i just saw this like kind of this contrast of like she just felt overwhelmingly loved like that she was home now and and really after that i just saw them

start to thrive again. Their lights came back on. They completely stopped having tantrums. There was no crying. There wasn't any drama. They were just back to my little girls, know, just little happy girls that were happy to play and they have been that way ever since.

Ela Richmond (17:21.149)  
Wow, that's an incredible story. It hits better this time than the last time I heard it. So thank you for sharing. think that is something that a lot of parents can relate to is just watching their kids change over time or seeing different things inside of their kids that they're just confused by, whether it be tantrums or whether it be some sort of an emotional state and just having the curiosity to say, okay, what's going on here? Because this isn't normal.

and it shouldn't be normal, you know? And I think a lot of the time there's like this stigma around teens, like teens are just depressed, like, you know, there are just stages of life where you're a little harder. But really becoming curious as a parent and becoming curious as a family and saying, okay, you know, it's possible that they're just going through something, but I would love to know what that is and love to walk with them through that.

So kudos to you for seeing those things and saying how can I help my girls. Out of curiosity, so I know that you use the good and the beautiful right now, right?

bcfj2mqv97 (18:28.745)  
Yes.

Ela Richmond (18:30.175)  
Cool. So was that what you started with or how did you start all of your stuff? Do you feel like you do like some people talk about how they start with traditional school type of thing and then they segue into more of like a flexible type of model for themselves at home. What does your schooling look like?

bcfj2mqv97 (18:49.746)  
Yeah, that's a really good question. It's definitely evolved over the last couple of years. I would say one thing that has been so amazing about this journey is I've learned a lot about myself in this process, right? It's been, mean, I don't want to put myself on a pedestal, but I feel like I've really blossomed because I've just loved it and I've been able to try things and feel like I have the freedom to do it.

Even when I worked in the classroom as a teacher, you still have to do things very right ways. And I remember sometimes when I would write curriculum plans, like, I don't want to do a certain activity because that would take so much time and I don't know if it would be okay or, know, there was just limitations. And when I first started homeschooling, there's definitely kind of that fear that you go through, like, okay, I need to make sure that I'm homeschooling five days a week and kind of mimicking and following that same school schedule.

Ela Richmond (19:23.891)  
Mm -hmm.

bcfj2mqv97 (19:48.018)  
And then I just kind of really quickly realized like the first couple days I set my alarm at like 6 a To make sure I got up and got ready and got everything prepped. then like a couple days later I was like, I don't need to do all this. I can be a little bit more relaxed, right? And we did homeschool five days a week for the first year. I feel like the first year to two years was a little different than maybe I would have originally. I don't know just because it was COVID. I wasn't really looking.

Ela Richmond (20:03.273)  
Mm -hmm.

bcfj2mqv97 (20:17.702)  
for like co -ops or groups or things like that because everything was pretty much shut down and we were just all kind of like, you know, surviving in education together. But as I just slowly became more comfortable with things, I was able to let go of some of those kind of like preconceived notions of what I was worried about in homeschool or what I wanted to do differently and start exploring with that and just kind of being able to be creative with it. then also,

Ela Richmond (20:33.855)  
Okay.

bcfj2mqv97 (20:46.683)  
combined with the fact that my kids could, I could do it differently with each of my kids. Like it was really fun to kind of experiment, see how the twins kind of learned, whether they learned better together or whether they learned better separate or if we needed to do more hands -on activities or if they, you know, preferred different types of learning and things like that. And then as I've introduced my boys, I feel like things were totally different with them.

They were like, I felt like I was like kind of learning all over again. One of the pieces of advice that I always love to share with new homeschool moms is it's very much like having a baby, like right about the time you figure out how to either nurse or use a bottle and you finally feel really comfortable with that, then they're eating solids and they're putting food all over your face and you're worried about like the thickness of the food you're giving them and everything changes, right?

And so you kind of have to like adjust to these different stages that your kids go through and I definitely felt like that what I felt like I was like getting it down really well with my girls and then My boys were they just learn a little bit differently My next son was different than my girls and he has different talents and so you know I'm still discovering those every single day and again That's one of the things I love about it is I feel like I really know my kids I see different sides of them that

I don't know if I would have ever saw if they were gone all day and somebody else was kind of working through some of the things that we do at home together. And so it's been such a joy. At this point and this style, I'm very eclectic in what I use. I love pulling from everything. I started with the Good and the Beautiful. I still love using them because it makes it really easy.

Ela Richmond (22:18.345)  
Mm -hmm.

bcfj2mqv97 (22:31.479)  
Instead of following the lessons maybe as rigid as I did in the beginning, I love to just kind of take the lesson off the page and bring in other books or assignments or things, just kind of use it as a guide to help me, as well as some of the other curriculums that we pull from. We love using literature. That's a big part in our.

in our homeschool. My older girls love to read and so we bring in lots of books and activities. And then, you know, this year I feel like we're excited to do more art this year and be more creative in some of the things that we've been doing. that's more what we've been focusing on this year and that's the beauty of it. I have one son who absolutely loves Legos and engineering and he just really thrives building and we can give him lots of opportunities to do that.

let him just experiment. also draws a ton and so he mean he draws almost every single day and we just let him be creative. try to we try to kind of you know I feel like kids their their interests can kind of change quickly at this age but if it's something that we kind of see reoccurring reoccurringly happen we like to to provide those opportunities for them and give them some materials to explore those interests and see if that's something that they want to continue to learn you know and develop a passion for.

Ela Richmond (23:43.569)  
Okay.

Yeah, I love that. How did you initially, two questions, how did you initially find your kids passions and start to nurture them? And then also, what does it look like to educate four children at once?

bcfj2mqv97 (23:58.754)  
yeah, yeah, both loaded questions. I would say as far as passions, that's a little easier. It's just whatever your kids show interest in. And sometimes I've had to provide a couple of things. often have done, sometimes they were more formal in the beginning. I'm a lot more casual now, is doing homeschool interviews with them and just saying, what is it that you love? And what is it that you wanna see different done in our home just to touch base with them, right?

I used to do that more formally at the beginning of the year and maybe it again, like halfway through just to kind of touch base. But now I just kind of do it periodically, you know, like, is there something that you are interested in that you really want to learn? A lot of the times there's an I don't know, right? And I sometimes like, I mean, my girls, that for some reason that's been animals forever. It's like years and years of animals. But I also feel like

just sometimes providing a feast of things and kind of laying out some ideas. I remember one time with my older girls just kind of reading them a list of subjects and things and I was like, and this was when they were a little bit older, they were probably nine or 10. And they were like, no, I was just going through like all these things of just like odd subjects to like, no, that doesn't sound interesting. And we got to plants.

which I don't think I would have normally in gardening. And they were like, we just want to learn so much about that. And so they were excited to learn and study botany and study plant cells. And we got lots of books and hands -on activities and then also some gardening opportunities and stuff in our yard. And I let them, we brought in YouTube videos and things that they loved to offer and to support that. So that's one way that we've encouraged some of that, right?

The other thing, let's see, remind me the other question.

Ela Richmond (25:51.423)  
So how do you successfully educate four kids at once?

bcfj2mqv97 (25:55.498)  
Okay, yeah. You have to be willing to adjust all the time to try different rhythms, to try different, you know, I always say that instead of like having a really structured schedule, again, this is more of like a public school or school type thing is to like from eight to 830, we do this and from 830 to 945, we do this and.

We have some rough outlines of where I wanna be during our school day. I am a little bit more structured, I would say, than probably some homeschool families, but I do like to maintain a rhythm because I feel like it's good for the kids. They know what to predict and they kind of know what to expect. like when we're working on our core work versus when we're working on like independent work or interest -based work or things like that, right? But I do try to be flexible. But having kind of that rhythm established where it's like,

We always have a morning time or we do a devotional where everybody's together that we come together and set the stage for the day and we talk about things like whether or not what we're going to be doing or if we have extracurriculars that day or what's going to be coming or we address issues as a family like, I've noticed.

this is not working well at this time of day or you two are arguing a lot, like what can we do to work through it, right? When we're not like in the moment and heated. So those are, that's just a really good way that we always start our days. And then at this point, when I have four of them, I break up in the morning. I work first with, I always work with the youngest to the oldest.

So my oldest girls have independent work that they can do. They know what it is. It's easy for them to do on their own and they can have a couple hours of that. They can watch, they watch like a math lesson and then they do as much math work as that they possibly can, right? So I work with my youngest son who's in kindergarten first and we just work through his work independently or I mean together and he doesn't have any independent work at this point. kindergarten I usually always have him.

bcfj2mqv97 (27:55.195)  
you know, working with me. My second grader, I work with him next and he'll do like his independent work, which is just very simple, like simple things. He does like a handwriting and a math page and he does a phonics book called Explode the Code. And so he'll work through those independently and he knows what he needs to do. And then I meet with him and we go through the rest of his like reading practice and the rest of his math lesson and things that I need to be like hands on and teach with him, right?

And then my girls, I will meet with them. It's usually either right before lunch or right after lunch, just kind of depending how our morning has gone. We come together and we go over anything that we need to do. Like we finish, we usually review their math together and we do some writing practice or other things that we just need to check in on and see what's going on. And then after lunch, we usually do some kind of like family style lesson, right? Where we all come together.

and we do like a science lesson or a history lesson or an art project or something along those lines. And then after that, we just like let the kids, you know, relax and play. But also like we try to keep the whole home environment something that's always learning, that we're always offering opportunities for them to explore their interests, like I said, and be able to kind of just see what lights their fire, right? So that's how it's working right now for us.

Ela Richmond (29:08.669)  
Mm -hmm.

Ela Richmond (29:19.272)  
Yeah.

That's so, so, so great. You mentioned that you meet with each of your kids individually. Are you meeting with them in the same room? Like are they coming to you individually? And then where are the rest of them working? Because I imagine that it's kind of distracting.

bcfj2mqv97 (29:33.871)  
Yeah, that's. Yeah, actually we have a rule they know and now that my five year olds youngest he's he took him a little bit. This you know this is his first year doing more formal school when he was a toddler we would just and I mean that's a big thing. Toddler years are very different. I've been through them with all my kids and I would let them play or have toys right here. So our main school room we we do a lot of it here in our main school room. This is the room I'm in right now and when I do independently I meet in this school room with him so.

The other kids, my girls, have desks upstairs that we have set up for them, but they do school all around the house. I would say sometimes they're up there this morning. They were outside on our front porch doing their math. My son, was doing his independent work math book on our couch while I was working with my kindergartner.

And they know there's a rule, like whenever I'm in here one on with somebody, the rule is that you can't come in and interrupt because it is a lot of interruptions. That was not the case when I had toddlers because I would expect that that's what is developmentally appropriate, right? Like I wouldn't want my toddler to feel like he couldn't come in and be with me. So I would have a lot more. would always, know, I so many days having a toddler or a baby on my lap or toys all over the floor while I'm trying to work with somebody and you just kind of push through those times.

Ela Richmond (30:39.197)  
Mm -hmm.

Ela Richmond (30:55.616)  
Yeah, no, I imagine that it's so distracting just like whenever kids are even close to each other at all, like siblings especially, they'll mess with each other, they'll talk to each other, they're distracting to each other. So yeah, I was curious about that. I'm gonna get to my rapid fire questions here in a second, but the last question that I wanted to ask you was about yourself. So you were saying that you love being with your kids and that it's taught you a new side to motherhood.

it's been such a fulfilling journey for you to go on. Can you speak a little bit to that and like just especially for the moms who are struggling and or finding themselves challenged, like what does that feel like? What have you found?

bcfj2mqv97 (31:41.269)  
You know, I love the idea that you can make this lifestyle whatever you want, right? It's very customizable. And so if there's something where you just feel like you're dreading, then maybe you need to change it, right? Like, and that's what's the, that's so beautiful about it. I feel like we don't really, many of us is how we've been raised is that there's so much like, well, things are done this way and we have to produce it this way. It's kind of that, that.

factory line production, right, of education. And so I've actually found speaking with some mothers is they have a really hard time even knowing what it is that they want for their family, right? So for me, when I first started homeschooling is I just spent a really long time evaluating what I wanted my family to look like, right? Knowing that I'm a big part of the home and raising these little souls.

and feeling again that that responsibility is, was like, I need to think about this a little bit more than just going out with my friends and being like, my gosh, you can't believe my toddler did this today and da da da da da. Just kind of, I mean, there's a time where it's healthy to vent, but I also kind of found myself just getting wrapped up in a culture that I didn't, I wasn't even speaking very kindly about my family. And I was like, this is what I've always wanted to do, and my degree is in education and family life, and this is always what I wanted.

I think it speaks to women's natures, Like we have a, it's in our natures to want to nurture others. And so what is it that can help you fulfill that, right? And what's that vision? And I spent a long time just kind of pondering on that, meditating on it, kind of trying to decide what it is that I wanted to look for our family. And then I've created it, right? Like I've gone out and I've made it happen. Like I've done what I can to

You know, and I've of course learned things along the way, but that's the only way that we can ever learn something is by trying it. And there's times where I'm like, this definitely did not work. This is not what I wanted in our family. And I'm always reevaluating. There's times where I'm just like, this is not the direction that I want us to be going. And so I'm going to shift gears and kind of help see and what tools and resources can I use to do that. So I think a big part is just figuring out what it is that you want.

Ela Richmond (33:42.409)  
Mm -hmm.

bcfj2mqv97 (34:04.331)  
how to get there and being willing to let go of the expectations of everybody else around you and the fear of what other people might think. I think that also holds a lot of people back from creating and being on that creative side versus on the, again, it's more of a reactive side. Like, well, I feel like I've gotta hurry and get all these workbooks done because if so -and -so comes over and asks my kid a question, I want them to be able to answer that question because I'm so worried that somebody's gonna think we're behind or something like that.

It's so much bigger than that, right? Like, is that really what's best for you? Is that's really what's best for your child? And I think the biggest thing is, also just, again, I keep going back to this as relationships with your children, right? Like even above all the educations, a lot of the times, and I'm sure you've heard this, but, you know, we'll see kids, especially that have been in school systems for a really long time, they kind of come home and homeschool and,

there's just this disconnection between the family or the mother and the child. And so if you're all of a sudden trying to put a teacher hat on, your kid's like, you're not my teacher. Like for nine years, it's been these other people and they don't like you kind of taking that role. Or you see kids come out of the system and they're just really, really like maybe depressed or kind of dark or have struggled or have been bullied or have really low self -esteem or things like that.

Ela Richmond (35:11.377)  
Okay.

bcfj2mqv97 (35:28.449)  
The best way is to not to come in and be like, well, here, I'm gonna help you and help you with your reading. And we're gonna spend all day focusing on reading or your math because you're so behind in math. The best thing you can do is to help them heal and to help them start to find a love for learning again. I think at Psychology 101 that when a child doesn't feel secure in their environment, they're not going to progress. And so a big part of that as a mother is to make sure that you are enjoying your family and enjoying being with your kids.

because they'll feel that and then they'll be able to start to heal or to thrive after that.

Ela Richmond (36:04.787)  
Great advice. Okay, so now we're gonna segue into our rapid fire questions. These are gonna be fun. I think you'll like them. Question number one, what are some of your favorite questions to ask your kids?

bcfj2mqv97 (36:09.449)  
Okay.

bcfj2mqv97 (36:18.731)  
Tell me more about that. That's not really a question, but that's my favorite way to like if they're drawing something or they're responding to something and you don't know what it is. You know, like your kid's drawing a picture and you're like, tell me more about your picture. And that's that way you're not saying like, what are you drawing? Right? So I love to do that versus trying to give them, you know, a specific, like I'm looking for a specific answer. I like saying, tell me more about that instead of specific questions.

Ela Richmond (36:49.161)  
That's a great one. Next question. What is your favorite story of something that really, really works for your kids? Maybe an example of like some learning thing that you do that they really love or something that you've seen that just works really well for them.

bcfj2mqv97 (37:08.013)  
Things that work really well are hands -on things, right? I bring in lot of hands -on manipulatives. My passion has been early childhood education, and so things like movable alphabets, like letters that you can manipulate, sandpaper letters, little number boards and things like that. Those are things that I really enjoy using with the kids, and I feel like it works really well for early childhood, especially when they need more hands -on working.

Ela Richmond (37:35.007)  
I love that. Last one. So back to stories. As you've taken on this journey, what is one of your favorite stories where you can just see your kids succeeding or lighting up or doing really, really well with this more flexible education model?

bcfj2mqv97 (37:53.033)  
definitely I would say hands down my little boy. I'm just starting my kindergartner. But my, my gosh, sometimes I think my seven year old, he's a wiggler and he's all kind of, he's just always been like that since a baby, you know? And I just think sometimes the whole reason we are supposed to homeschool was for him because I just don't think he would ever thrive in a really big classroom with lots of kids. He needs a lot of one -on -one attention. He's easily distracted.

He's just, he has a very, very creative mind and he thinks differently. He thinks outside the box and I am so excited to see what will become of him because he has the freedom to just kind of be his self and he'll think of things and you're just like, where did you think of that? And you know what? He surprises me the very most. Like I just, I'll be talking to my girls about something that I would consider a middle school level and he'll shoot back and I'm just like, you're brilliant.

I just didn't know a seven year old could even do this. And I just love that. So it's been such a joy to see him become, like I said, just to thrive in this environment and let him just, like I say, just be himself and give him the tools and things. we're really excited. Like I said, he just loves to draw and he draws all the time and he's always doodling. And we just love that he can do that. Like he can.

Ela Richmond (38:53.001)  
You

bcfj2mqv97 (39:19.082)  
spend all day and we have a hundred notebooks we'll hand him he just fills up notebook after notebook after notebook and so we just we're like okay if this is what you love go ahead and do it.

Ela Richmond (39:30.099)  
I love that. This has been so great and awesome. Thank you so much for coming on and for sharing everything. I will leave everything below. Is there anything specifically that you want to point people to or where people can find you?
