# Chet, Fletch, Karalee

Chet Thomas: [00:00:00] So while I was in the story department, at dreamworks

I got to work on,

saving private Ryan

Amistad,

Mouse Hunt,

Darrin Fletcher: we've got our eye on a couple of students that have been through the system 'cause we have something close to six or seven television series that will be all. over the next year and a half. And so we've been bringing some of these students in who have kind of proven themselves let's find the the best of the best. what Sneak On is, is built to do,

  

Karalee Sartin: Well, welcome to the Open Ed podcast. We are so thrilled you all are joining us today. This one is very near and dear to my heart. My name is Carol Lee Sarton. I serve on the curriculum team here at Open Ed, and I am thrilled and honored to introduce our guest today. This is Chet and Fletch from SNY on the lot. I'm actually just gonna let them introduce themselves as we get into this. So, Fletch, would you start, please?

Darrin Fletcher: You bet. I got my start in the business when I was about [00:01:00] 16 years old. I got a, a job as a layout artist for Saturday morning cartoons on television. this is back when you could only see cartoons on Saturday mornings. And, uh, I did that through high school. And then after that I jumped, into live action film as a storyboard artist. And so I was a storyboard artist for a lot, many, many years. Long time. Worked on a lot of projects, things like, um, my, my first studio picture was a little, a little film called Sandlot. and then I, you know, kind of jumped to studio picture to studio picture after that and kind of going back and forth from Los Angeles to home.

And, you're interested in what the credits look like, you can look me up on IMDB and then eventually.

Karalee Sartin: slid that in there. Fletch. I'm sorry to interrupt you. Just a little film called The Sandlot. Nobody's really ever heard of it, but.

Darrin Fletcher: Oh, wait, wait to get to Chet's resume, it's much bigger. So after that, I, um, somewhere along the road, oh, it was 2000. and I connected, uh, after the shooting at Columbine and we wanted to do something for students. Um. Uh, not knowing how to do [00:02:00] anything as far as education is concerned. We just thought, well, we can teach 'em how to make movies, I guess, if that makes a difference.

And, um,

Karalee Sartin: um.

Darrin Fletcher: and what it did is it gave, uh, students an opportunity to sort of express themselves a nonviolent, productive way and very creative and allowed them to sort of, um, express themselves. And it was. Far more effective than I originally would've thought. And from that time forward, what's that? 25 years ago? we've kind of hosted sneak on a lot the whole time while running our careers and, and, uh, making movies and, and all that sort of stuff. And now we are producers and directors on, multiple series at Angel Studios. Uh, more coming next year um, kind of keeping the slate full.

Karalee Sartin: Fantastic. Thank you so much, Flett, Chet. Good afternoon. It's so wonderful to see you. Would you give us a, a brief bio please?

Chet Thomas: Yeah, sure.

Good to see you too. Thanks [00:03:00] for having us.

Um. My route was a little bit different than Fletch's, which is what kind of makes our partnership great.

Um, I did start on production. Fletch

got me my introduction to my first job.

Um, that was many moons ago. Um, and it was just started, you know, I, that was kind of how I put myself through college.

I would work on a couple of

what was called back then, movies of the week,

and, and then. Once I had enough money, I would go to a couple semesters of school and then when I ran outta money, I'd go back and work on a couple more shows. So,

my career,

um, I finished college and decided I had seen an article

come out in the Times. Uh, magazine, time Magazine that had the cover with Spielberg, Katzen, Katzenberg, and Geffen.

And, and it was formed, they, three of 'em were forming this new studio, which was called Dreamworks, SKG.

I didn't know a whole lot about Hollywood [00:04:00] or anything like that, and I just decided that's where I wanted to go. So I left college,

moved to la, didn't have a job.

There's a whole,

um, hour long podcast of how I kinda.

Karalee Sartin: how I kind of

Chet Thomas: Made myself, uh, a parent in their, in their worlds and got in and,

um, without 'em even knowing it, I was working for them.

Um, but that was, uh, that was the start. And I was in the studio system and I got a job at Dreamworks in the story department. And, um, while in the story department, in the story department, we were just.

It's nothing too glorious and it doesn't have a whole lot of story to do with it. It's really the organization.

It's like kind of the library,

um, you know, taking the scripts in, the pages that come in from writers for different drafts, coordinating them and getting them out to the executives and all that sort of stuff. So while I was in the story department, I got to work on, um,

saving private Ryan

Amistad,

um, mouse Hunt,

[00:05:00] and. A couple of other films while in the story department. And then I jumped from the story department to feature development, which was the core group,

um, at dreamworks and at any studio that's trying to find the next feature film. Um, and so you're just networking with

other agents and assistants and other studios and producers and everybody just to kind of try and find the next.

Movie. And while I was in feature development, I was working with my boss. He, he was,

his

office was the busiest at the studio. So we had

Karalee Sartin: the studio. So we

Chet Thomas: at every given time about 20 films that we were, we had in, in one part of the movie making process or the other. And so while I was there, I got to work on, um,

Karalee Sartin: work on, uh.

Chet Thomas: let's see here, meet the parents.

Um. Small soldiers, the terminal road to Perdition,

[00:06:00] Flintstones. Um, and, and a few others got to

go out and be on the set at, on, uh, catch me if you can

for a few days. It was kind of fun to kind of pop out and,

and check that out. Um,

and, uh, and, and you know, we had a bunch of projects in various, you know, stages of production or development.

Um, and then I left there and, and, uh,

stayed with the stu same studio, but I wanted to

work with, um, or watch Steven Spielberg work on set. So I had seen him on, at the studio level in the development phases and meetings like that. And, and so I, um, was able to go and work on the movie Minority Report

and, um.

So it was kind of fun to watch him work and Tom Cruise and

the cinematographer, Yanu Kaminski, who, you know, was a cinematographer for Schindler's List and Saving Private Rh, got an Oscar for both of those and to see those guys work.

And then, um, [00:07:00] partnered with a guy named Jerry Mullen who produced Minority Report.

I was just in the, in the producing team there. And, um. He produced Minority Report. We partnered after that. He,

Jerry produced, you know, probably 18 films for Steven Spielberg and he produced, um, Schindler's List himself,

Rainman Days of Thunder, and a whole bunch of other Steven Spielberg movies. So we formed a company there and then Fletch and I continue to stay in touch.

As he mentioned, we started sneak on the lot,

you know, while I was at Dreamworks and we continued to develop That and

Then most recently we produced the film, the Best Christmas Pageant ever,

which came out this past Christmas, um, for Lionsgate,

And, uh, we were super pleased with how that did. It was quite a, quite a success in the, uh,

Karalee Sartin: uh,

Chet Thomas: in the theaters.

And so now it's streaming and it'll be

[00:08:00] hopefully in everyone's home every Christmas as a holiday tradition. So that's kind of an update of. So who we, who I am and who Fletches, I guess.

Karalee Sartin: Fantastic. Thank you both so much. Um, editor, I'm gonna jump into a, a quick little spiel here about my connection with them and I'm sure it's gonna be too long, so feel free to edit it down.

But I will also try to condense, um, well about 12-year-old me is, is really geeking out at talking to both of you. My dad is an absolute movie fanatic and so some of my earliest memories are of watching a movie with him and then. Continuing to stay on the couch for another two hours while we watched absolutely anything that we could find having to do with behind the scenes and documentaries.

And let's watch how they did this and let's hear about the philosophy behind that. And so I have also grown up just loving movies. Um. That later led into a, a very [00:09:00] brief stint, a little hobby side hobby of, of acting as background in several movies and TV shows. I am privileged to live in Atlanta where a lot of film happens. Um, so I've just gotten to be a fly on the wall on several different productions. And then last summer was privileged enough to, to attend the sneak on the lot summer filmmaking training with Flett and she. Fletch and Chet, excuse me, which was five days of intense training and preparation, followed by two nights of actually making a movie.

We shot a proof of concept show that will be pitched to Angel Studios here soon.

Darrin Fletcher: Mm-hmm.

Karalee Sartin: So now I have my own 12-year-old and she is also starting to geek out about movies. We recently watched the Hunger Games and then of course she is now diving into just hours of footage and behind the scenes. And as she watches, uh, interviews with cast and crew, they all talk about what a wonderful experience it was and how everybody who worked on those movies became like family.

And [00:10:00] she turned to me and said, mom, is that what always happens? And I just wanted to laugh and say, oh honey, you have no idea how absolutely rare that would be, that that happens on a film set. In my obviously limited experience. Film sets are incredibly stressful places. They are places where money is the bottom line. time is money, and everybody's in a hurry, and nobody is kind when they're in a hurry. Nobody is their best self when they're in a hurry, and it is a very stressful situation all the time. However, being on your set. Last summer was not a stressful situation. You two have managed to create an atmosphere while making a movie and still very focused on the bottom line.

You still have work to get done and there are still challenges and there are still problems that arise, but you two have managed to somehow rise above that and not only make really, really great [00:11:00] film, but lift everybody up around you at the same time. So number one, how do you do that? But number two, why?

Why do you do that? And why have you decided to make a curriculum that that lifts up kids instead of just focusing on the bottom line?

Darrin Fletcher: Boy, good questions. Um,

Karalee Sartin: Um.

Darrin Fletcher: you do get really close when you're working on a film just because you're, you're with these same people day in, day out for 12 to 18 hours a day and for many months. And then oftentimes you'll go on to the next project with those same people. they tend to kind of roll over to the next project. So you do get very, very close with some people. Um, you're totally right. It is a stressful place and it's not, uh, ideal for bringing out the best of self. Um, I think Chet and I early, early on saw what that looked like. Uh, when we were working on mods, uh, movies of the [00:12:00] week, Those are even more stressful 'cause they have less money in a smaller schedule. And so we saw how not to do it, right? This is, this is a, a difficult pressure cooker. And I think both of us thought, I don't like that. You know, that that's not something that appeals to me. I don't wanna work in that environment with the rest of my life. You know? Uh, I don't know how you felt about those years, uh, those years doing that check, but that's how I felt. And occasionally you'd find a, a crew that would work well together and you'd just think, this is a, what a pleasure this is. This is so much fun

Karalee Sartin: Much

Darrin Fletcher: and you'd wanna go to work every day. And those kinds of sets really brought out the best talent that everybody had. 'cause no one was afraid to say anything, you know? everybody felt that they could bring their creative self to work every day. and I think those were some of the, the. The seeds that were planted early, early on in my career.

Chet Thomas: Yeah, I mean, I think that they. Just like you said, it [00:13:00] is a stressful environment and um, and some of the people that you work with

don't handle the stress very well, and usually you only work with that person once and, and you don't bring them back on the next film.

Um, and So

over the years I think your crew gets better and better and better and more like family like you're saying.

And um, and like fledge said, man, life is just too short

too

Create more stress than you need when the stress is already there and, and when it's a high stress environment,

It's just, you know, it's great to have, you know, have fun while getting it done and, and building others and lifting others. And, and, and like you said, that's something that we've tried to

implement into sneak on the lot.

We've tried to

put certain values and concepts and ideas into the curriculum that actually build. Instead of, you know, add stress or tear down,

um, you know, [00:14:00] we can all, nothing against horror movies, but,

um, you know, we've decided to make films that, um, impact positively. Um, I don't, they, they don't always have to be uplifting because we could, you might tell a story that's,

that may have sort of a, a downer ending to it or whatever, but, um.

You know, we just try to have positive impact with anything we do. And so we try and

with it, with the curriculum that we've created within snyk on the lot, we've tried to do the same thing, instill those same principles and, and of course all the filmmakers are young

on, sneak on the lot and they usually don't have a ton of life experience, but hopefully we can in, you know, instill this great foundation.

Um, that gets 'em started off at a, you know, at a good spot and kind of

helps them continue to rise versus trying to figure it out and not doing so great and

maybe having the wrong attitude or,

or what have [00:15:00] you. But, um, hopefully getting 'em off on the right foot.

Karalee Sartin: I love that. Will you, will you tell me a little bit more about the back lot? How does that tie into the curriculum, but also what is the, the heart behind creating the back lot?

Darrin Fletcher: Oh, the back lot. This is a, this is a long journey. I'll try and keep it short. Um,

Karalee Sartin: Um,

Darrin Fletcher: when we very first started out 25 years ago, back before the internet was really anything, um. We, there came a point at which we just had to get back to work, right? We, I had spent all my savings, uh, opening up a little office that we were running kids through from the, the local high schools, trying to get a sense of how should we teach this? And the kids were just like, would not go home. You had to like, turn out the lights, you know, to send them all home. And, at one point it was like, okay, we gotta get back to work. We gotta go make some more movies. And so I had to shut down the office, but we had what we needed out of that experience.

We had the curriculum that we had built, so Chet said, well, why don't we put it online? Which was prophetic because that that's where everything was [00:16:00] going. And so we started immediately trying to put something online. And as I was sort of, uh, teaching myself action action script at the time, I downloaded the 30 day free trial of, uh, flash and started programming in Action script. And I wanted to create

Karalee Sartin: I wanted to

Darrin Fletcher: an atmosphere or an environment where the sheer navigation through the website would teach you how the film industry worked. Right. So things that you wouldn't understand how they work on the backlog in a movie studio, you would somehow intrinsically just understand by navigating through this sort of this website and that, and it really worked.

And then they killed action script, right? If you remember that. Um, and so it all went to HTML and uh, which was kind of a backward step for if you were a designer, right? If you liked really designed. Um, websites. So we kind of just went the curriculum, the standard [00:17:00] curriculum route, long before anybody was doing education online.

We were doing it 20 years earlier and, um, just now got to the place where, hey, you know what? We have a really robust, uh, curriculum and it's fantastic. We use Canvas, and Canvas is a really strong learning management system. But what if we revisited our idea of having environment that is, that kind of teaches you as you navigate it, and as we started doing so, um, it became very apparent that, uh, a game was the best way to do this.

Now that, you know, 20 years had passed and a lot of the technology was now in place that we could do the things we wanted to do or just dreamed of doing in those early days. And so. Uh, we cracked open unity and started putting a game together and thought, well, this isn't too hard. Let's keep going with this.

And then, and as we started building it out, man, it, it really started to come together in a way that I think our vision of [00:18:00] those early I. websites, what we had envisioned was now coming to pass, like, oh wow. You could walk around and you can meet people and you can have a, a, a a, like a group that you meet together in your own building, and you can have all these tools and you can go in these buildings and you can walk around and talk to people.

And it's, and by talking to these not really people, by talking to these non-player characters, they're, they teach you about. Their jobs, their their roles and what they do and how they do them. So you can talk to the cinematographer or the first assistant director or the PAs or all that stuff and you can upload your movie and you can watch other people's movies and

Karalee Sartin: other.

Darrin Fletcher: hear about opportunities.

That was the last stage is, is we wanted to implement a way where students could interact with the back lot. So they could post their poster right there on the back lot as marketing, and people could then click on that poster and then watch their movie and. real life opportunities would be available to students who were there so that they, they could read for a role and possibly [00:19:00] get cast in something and they could, um, uh, try and, uh, and be an extra, or, you know, find other people to work with.

And so these were some of the thoughts that were going through our mind, or we're still sort of very much in, in a beta stage with sneak on the lot or sneak on rather. That's what we call the the 3D version. Sneak on. Um, so we're still very much in a beta role, but it's very obvious that that's the direction we're heading because kids love it. You know, kids love navigating and playing the game and, and just having a good time. So, I think most of our development cycles now will go probably into that.

Karalee Sartin: And you have actually cast students out of sneak on, haven't you? Do I remember correctly that some of the kids in Best Christmas pageant ever were from sneak on.

Chet Thomas: We, we've done, we didn't cast any of the kids from the best gross of pageant ever, from sneak on, but we have

we have our, it is our goal to cast everything we do. So, [00:20:00] um, the Mystic Hollow that we did last year, I. We cast from people on the lot. Now we did cast a couple, or one of the gals from the best Christmas pageant ever, one of the little actresses.

Um, but we did, we did all the casting

on the back lot, and that's our plan. I mean, whether it's,

um, you know, whatever we're doing, our plan is to cast through the lot, you know, which

Karalee Sartin: which

Chet Thomas: people who are in Hollywood. It's a little strange and hard for them to gather that like. What I, it's a game. I gotta go in and upload my audition in this,

this environment that's, I got avatars and this and that, and we're like,

trust us.

I, we might be a little ahead of our time, but that's okay. We've always been ahead of our time. So this,

we're gonna help you get ahead of your time

and, uh, and so we'll, we will cast everything, um, edit, hire editors,

hire all our crew, and, um. On, on the back lot. So, um, [00:21:00] that's, that's our plan. So it will not only just be this game that they're playing and rising sort of in the ranks through their real efforts,

um, it will, it will lead to

Karalee Sartin: will lead

Chet Thomas: jobs and getting into the industry and breaking into the industry.

Um, we have had,

in the past, we've had some successes of students that have, you know,

broken into the industry through sneak on the lot, not because of the lot.

Because it didn't exist back then, but through, you know, you know, students that we've identified

that really have talent and we've helped get into the industry.

So it's our plan to do the same with, you know, with what we're doing with sneak on.

Karalee Sartin: I love that. In essence, not to put too fine of a point of it, but you are literally helping students sneak onto the Hollywood lot, which

Darrin Fletcher: That's the idea.

Karalee Sartin: the, yeah, I love it. I love that you're giving students the opportunity to interact with the real world professionals. That was one of my favorite things about being this on the set with, let me start that over. [00:22:00] love the opportunities that you are giving students to interact with the real. Professionals. That was one of my favorite things about being on set with you guys was your openness and your willingness and who you hire to find the right people who are willing to teach. So some of my favorite conversations were talking to the script supervisor and being able to say, what do you do?

And get a sense from the actual person. What they do and what they love about it. And then trying to decide could I see myself in that role, or do I definitely never wanna see myself in that role. And in seeing the costume people and the makeup people and, and everybody just doing their thing. Um, but like you said, you have, you've worked hard to hire family and to hire people who are, who are just willing to talk and to spend time on their stressful, busy set. Teaching and talking to teachers and students, which was phenomenal. And I know that that heart goes through in, in a lot as well of, yes, these are real professionals with, with real [00:23:00] jobs who are out there doing it, but they wanna invest in students and in helping others get the chances that they have gotten

Chet Thomas: i, I was just gonna add to that just for a second,

is we do that on set with the summer workshop. You know, that's our whole goal is that.

People like you, they can come and get this experience onset and interact with professionals.

And like you said, one, you will decide that you love this department or you don't love this department, but the only way you can decide that is by getting the exposure and realizing,

oh my goodness, there's so much stress in this department.

Um, and, and it was awesome because to,

you know,

those that come and participate in the, in the summer workshop. You know, day one they're pretty, you know, it's pretty segregated as to being able to tell who are the participants and who are the professionals. But what's awesome is by the end of the week,

that line is pretty blurred.

Those that are participating really like, like [00:24:00] yourself,

got in and we were turning to you to say, Hey, here's a problem that we have. We need help finding the solution. Can you run with this? And you would run with it and take it and get it done. And that takes the stress off of our shoulders.

Um, and you know, with you and everybody else that was there that year.

'cause we had some pretty high stress moments, if you recall. Um, and, um.

Karalee Sartin: and, um,

Chet Thomas: But that's, you know, that's what we've try and do in the summer workshop. And

additionally, that's what we try to do on sneak on the lot. So every film that we work on,

um, Fletch and I, we will interview,

um, individuals, professionals that are at the, the best of the best in the industry.

Uh. Interview them about their jobs and who they are and tips and their career paths and just all kinds of things about the art that they, that they participate in on the set. And um, and we put those interviews

I. In, in,

within the curriculum and within, we have an interview sort of [00:25:00] library of various crew and positions and the best of the best in the business.

And so we try to do that online too, where those that are participating and sneak on the lot online, they also have the ability to interact with professionals. Though it's through media, they're still, they're still having that participatory, um, experience with real professionals. So we try and do that.

Online and on set.

Karalee Sartin: set. Yeah, and it's incredible. You do it. So well, and I, I can't think of the saying quite, but that people will rise to the level of trust you

Chet Thomas: Mm-hmm.

Karalee Sartin: And you too are so good at just giving people high levels of trust and watching them rise. Um. I wanna go back a little bit. I feel like we've talked around the curriculum and about the curriculum, but Fletch, you mentioned in the beginning the the origins of NY on the lot and especially relating to Columbine.

And I wanna dig into that just a little bit more. So can you [00:26:00] guys take me back to the origins? You obviously had busy lives, you had successful careers. Why would you take time out of that to create a curriculum? Why add one more thing to your life?

Darrin Fletcher: Yeah, I part

Chet Thomas: Who knows.

Darrin Fletcher: part of it is because we're stupid. We're just always adding, we're always taking on probably more than we can do. Um, and by doing it, you know, a year later you're like, Hey, we did it. I can't believe we pulled that off. Um, when it first started, I think it, it was born originally out of this, just a desire to do something to make a difference.

Like I. It was just such a shock. I, I, we were, I was driving down to set, I think at the time I was working on touch by an angel and I was driving down to set, um, and I was listening to it, the Columbine shooting, live on the radio.

Karalee Sartin: a.

Darrin Fletcher: all I could think of was when was it okay to suddenly bring a, a gun to school?

Like that was just so foreign to me. Um. it is [00:27:00] 25 years later, right? And so we, I originally thought I, we gotta do something and my brother's a teacher, um, a high or was a high school teacher. And I thought at the time, well, maybe I'll go talk to him and see,

Karalee Sartin: brother,

Darrin Fletcher: is there anything I can do, can I, anything?

I don't care. I just want to, I want to make a difference in this issue, this particular issue. So I went and talked to him and I had his class.

Karalee Sartin: And.

Darrin Fletcher: This was three days after Columbine, so it was pretty fresh. And I had his class write an essay about, you can, you can write a whole page, which you can use, you can use it as a sort of cathartic exercise to sort of purge your emotions or your feelings about this topic, about what's happening.

Karalee Sartin: About,

Darrin Fletcher: Or you can like, tell me how close are you like to doing something like this? Is this. of your mind? Is this insane? Is it like, what is it like where, where are you on that scale [00:28:00] of doing something like these kids did at Columbine? And I, I still have the, the papers, I, I have probably 70, 60, 70 papers and there were three or four of 'em that said, I'm pretty close. And it just shocked me. These are my brother's students. Like, holy cow, what's going on? And, um, so that was kind of the genesis of like, we got to do something now there, there's just no way we have to do something. If there's three students of my brothers that are close, how many more are out there around the country, around the world?

And, and so that was kind of the genesis, or at least the, the motivation that propelled us into this desire to want to make a difference, um, somehow. But all we knew how to do was make movies. Which on the surface is kind of pathetic. It's kind of sad. It's like, oh, you're just entertainers, you're just whatever. But then when you start realizing it takes to make a movie, um, and you can employ every single classroom [00:29:00] of a high school or middle school into the process of making a film, right? You have marketing, you have business classes, you have. Um, advertising and acting and music. And it just goes on and on in sciences and, and, uh, you name it, there's, I can, I can employ every single class of a high school or middle school into the process of making a film.

And once we realized that, we start, started kind of thinking, Hmm, well how far can we take this? Can we, can we make a, what would it take to make a film with a bunch of students? Well, we'd need to teach them, obviously, because they don't know how to do this. teachers don't know how to do this. We're gonna have to teach teachers, which was why the workshop was born. And so it was a long sort of a process. Chet went to film school, so he came at it from a certain perspective and I went straight into the industry. So I came at it from a radically different perspective, and together I think it meshed pretty well, and we got the best of both of [00:30:00] those worlds. Um, but through the process of a year of just sitting down and working with students over and over, I don't know how many short films we made with those students that year.

There must have been 40 or 50 of them, and we made all these little films and each one we would sort of notate, well, what, what are kids getting? What aren't they getting? What are they, what did they completely not understand? And so from that experience, we kind of extrapolated the curriculum based on what students generally understood or. Totally didn't get. if you look at our curriculum, notice that our, our, we really kind of stress the development portion of filmmaking because that was the one place, students just sort of understood editing. They got software, it just made sense to them. they understood cameras and technical things about cameras. But they absolutely loathed writing. They hated writing and writing characters and coming up with ideas and all the [00:31:00] stuff that, in my opinion, is some of the funnest stuff there is in the business. But to them, they just absolutely hated writing. And so our curriculum is very, much weighted towards writing.

'cause kids don't like it and they didn't know how to do it. And so. We tried to teach that, uh, pretty heavy. Um, and that's kind of, I mean, that's where it really was born out of is this desire to, to help. There was another aspect where we saw a lot of students who were just, they were headed down dark paths.

Um, uh, it was kind of interesting. so what we noticed was they always wanted to tell stories about suicide and. These, these dark topics and we just thought, Nope, we're not gonna let you make one of those. You're gonna have to make something make something that's more pleasant, make something that's funny, just, you know, that's, everybody loves to laugh.

It doesn't matter who you're, everybody loves to laugh. Make something funny, don't make something down. We wouldn't let them make those kinds of movies 'cause [00:32:00] they go down this rabbit hole and they don't come back. So we encouraged like. Uh, this sort of positive view, like bring something to light that's that's good that people want to see, that'll make people's lives better. and that was sort of what Chet was alluding to earlier on, was trying to sort of guide students through the process of making a movie while also trying to guide them through the, the steps of life, right? And, and just how to make good decisions and how to, uh, bring light to the world as opposed to, I mean, it's so easy to bring darkness. That's simple. not many people out there bringing light. So be part of the, the light side, not the dark side. Right. If we're gonna conjure Star Wars. Um, anyway, that was kind of the, that was kind of the genesis. That's right. That.

Chet Thomas: Well, and the one thing that I'll add to that Fletch is that. Over the years, the curriculum has grown, right? So we,

we really focused in those first years on development and, and really sort of flesh that part of the curriculum out. And we've continued to flesh that [00:33:00] part of the curriculum out.

Um, but we've also, then we started to see, okay, all right.

The, the kids are starting to get development a little bit. Their stories are getting better.

But they're not looking that great. And so they're not, they're not lighting or they're not using practical lights and they're not using these sort of techniques. Oh, the camera's not moving. So we would talk, we would create a part of the curriculum that would be,

uh, you know, about,

um, practical lighting, which is any, any light that's actually on set and it's practically lit.

Right? So just using practical lights and, and, and then we would use, you know, offscreen lighting and talk about contrast and those kinds of things. And then. You know, we'd notice that we'd wanna see a little more movement, so we would, you know, build an area of the curriculum that would talk about camera movement and, and wide angles and.

Closeups. Extreme, extreme closeups and ca you know, a cowboy shot and just all kinds of different things that were a little more technical in those, in those aspects, but artistic,[00:34:00]

um, and then sound design, you know, the, the, the, the films were coming in. The sound was terrible. And so we'd focus on that.

And then at time, at the time, there was.

You know, green screen was big and, and it was just, they weren't pulling the best of keys. And so we created a whole curriculum on green screen, and then we noticed that kids were ripping off music

and we're like, okay, you can't do that. So we did a whole curriculum on copyright.

And so the curriculum has just grown and grown and grown over the years.

We continue to add to, but we just continue to put layers in. And so it's,

it's a pretty hefty curriculum. Um, you know, and. As it goes through the, as as somebody comes in, it starts off light and,

and they'll do something that's pretty simple

before we jump into the more complex concepts. But

it.

it sort of grows and ramps up in the, you know, online also.

But it's,

it's 25 years of growth and, and sort of fleshing out, which is kind of nice.

Karalee Sartin: Well, gosh, brilliant. And thank you for allowing us to learn [00:35:00] from both as teachers and as students from, you know, the mistakes of the past and just honing in making it better and better. That's just brilliant. I wanna go back to the thought that, um. Film can give everyone a place. What an amazing picture of every classroom in a school can have a part to

Darrin Fletcher: Yep.

Karalee Sartin: in making a film

Darrin Fletcher: Yep.

Karalee Sartin: that no matter what your talents are, no matter what your abilities are, no matter if you fit a traditional mold or not, there's a place for you and you are

Darrin Fletcher: Yep.

Karalee Sartin: and important, and what you have to bring is necessary to the whole process.

I love how film does that and elevates everyone.

Chet Thomas: Well, and

Karalee Sartin: Well, and

Chet Thomas: if one of the things that

expounding on what Fletch had mentioned, that, you know, you can take any class in a high school and guarantee you we can fit it into a filmmaking curriculum. But what, but what you said is, is also interesting. It takes all types,

um, it takes the creative kind. That,

that [00:36:00] maybe in high school or young, younger ages aren't accepted by others as much, and it allows them to really,

really shine and, and be able to stand up straight and

and

show what they can do, express their talents.

It takes the analytical. Right.

You know the person that's great at math. Well, we're gonna slide you right in there as a line producer,

and you're gonna do the budget and you're gonna lay out the budget and you're gonna,

you're gonna be given this amount of money and we gotta, you gotta figure out how we're going to make it work.

How you're going to keep those creative types who have no sense of

budget. A, a little like Fletch, right? The, that have no sense of budget and spending money. Now Fletch does, he does a pretty, he does a great job. But, um. But there's a, there's a place for that person who

knows numbers and, and then there's a place for that person who's super social.

Okay. We're gonna put you in the marketing team,

and we're gonna have you building the, you know, the social media platforms and, and, [00:37:00] and all, you know, everything that has to do with getting the word out right. And, uh, well, my goodness, there's, we gotta build sets. So the, the, you know, the construction.

Department down in, you know, the welding team, you know,

the classes and

the

Karalee Sartin: need some

Darrin Fletcher: for that as well. If you're gonna design and build sets. Someone's gotta design them. Someone's gotta

Chet Thomas: Absolutely. And one of the biggest parts and the most important parts on set is. Eating and being fed, and there's the culinary, and we've got lunch and we've got craft service and everybody, everybody wants to eat healthy. And so many people don't want to eat healthy. And so it's just this, I mean, anything you can imagine, any class history,

Where in the world could the history class

be in part of filmmaking? Well. Any, any movie that's not taking place today, present day is gonna have history. We're gonna do a World War II show, or we're gonna do something that took place back around the, um, revolutionary War

or the [00:38:00] invention of the television

or the car, what have you.

I mean, history is all over the place. English,

creative writing, screenplays, um, I mean, the list goes on and on and on, you know.

Darrin Fletcher: Legal

Chet Thomas: typing class that I took

was the most valuable class that to my filmmaking career ever, because I can now type, you know, I mean, it's just

any class.

Darrin Fletcher: I mean, I, I know so many guys who are stuntmen who they were, they were just jocks in high school. They liked being physical. They liked that physical activity. Great. You'd make a great stuntman. Bring it on. You know, so it, it literally, every single classroom you can possibly conceive of can be integrated one way or another into the film industry.

Chet Thomas: Yeah, web programming. We always need a website for the, for the movie.

The obvious ones are, you know, acting and theater and lighting and those kinds of things. Those are super [00:39:00] obvious, but

video production,

Karalee Sartin: the video production.

Chet Thomas: any class though,

which means, which means

Karalee Sartin: which means

Chet Thomas: film reaches every type and it allows people

of every walk of life, color heights,

you know, look,

Darrin Fletcher: matter. Yeah.

Chet Thomas: be, have an important part.

In the filmmaking process.

Karalee Sartin: gosh. Cut print. Mic drop. There's nothing left to say. I, I do realize I don't really have a good sense of how long we're supposed to go. I have one more question for you and then we should probably wrap it up with that Andrea. Ping me somehow if that is not what you're looking for. I would love for you each to just take a moment and brag a little bit about some of your success stories. Is there a specific student or a specific school, um, that comes to mind for whom curriculum or for whom film has really made a difference for them?

Chet Thomas: Yeah,

Darrin Fletcher: [00:40:00] my. Um,

Chet Thomas: we have a few.

Darrin Fletcher: we're sort of, we're continually sort of approached from students, either we used to, like we had in the past, who would approach us and say, I took sneak on the lot, you know, and, and now I'm out in Los Angeles trying to make a go of it. And that kind of stuff. That, that's a pretty frequent, um, occurrence. I think I have to go all the way back to those first uh, when we were in that office. I got so close with a number of them, it was the only time that I was actually physically teaching classroom. And so I stayed in touch with a lot of those kids, um, over the years. And one of 'em reached out to me just recently, um, who had gone on.

He wanted to be an actor. He was in the acting program at, at the, the same, uh, high school that I went to. So.

Karalee Sartin: I.

Darrin Fletcher: He, he was one of the participants of those first years, and now he's been on Broadway for 20 years or [00:41:00] so. But he reached out to me over Facebook, um, and was like, you know, changed my life. That, that one year in that building changed my life, made me realize that I could do this.

Like this could be something that I could do for a living. And, um, but he's been on Broadway now for about 20 years and. He just, it was so much fun to hear like,

Karalee Sartin: to

Darrin Fletcher: like these kinds of stories where someone who I knew well, um, who I knew was talented, he had what it took. The question is, do you have the tenacity?

Right? So the tenacity is the one aspect in this movie, in this industry, you don't have it,

Karalee Sartin: you

Darrin Fletcher: you ain't gonna make it. Like it takes a lot of tenacity. You have to be able to go and do the work every single day. I. Uh, for years and sometimes not see the benefits of it for years and keep going and keep going and keep going.

And then one day it will happen, I guarantee it. But you gotta [00:42:00] work hard and the harder you work,

Karalee Sartin: harder you

Darrin Fletcher: the more likely it is to happen, you know? So that's always fun to kind of have somebody come back who you knew had an opportunity. There was one kid who was kind of a goth kid. You know, who wore trench coats and dyed his hair black and wore makeup.

And it was just, he was a dark soul to be, to, to be sure. And he would come, uh, he would come to the building almost every day, and it was a long drive for them. There was three of 'em that came together and, uh, it was a long drive for them. about 45 minutes just to get to the building and. Uh, I knew right away that this kid was a talented writer.

Just by reading his scripts, I was like, oh, okay. This kid is way ahead of his, his age, as a writer, he wanted to direct, and I, I kept saying, man, I, if I were you and I had your skill, I'd be, I'd start with being a writer. Directing will come, start with being a writer. That's what you're really good at. He wrote [00:43:00] several of the films, uh, that year and we entered all these films in a local film festival and all these kids just cleaned up at the festival. But it was fun to watch him who's this kind of hunched over short little kid, um, go down the aisle and pick up his award because he kept winning over and over and over. by the time I think he won three or four or five, even five, I can't remember, about five. Trophies that day, and each time he would go down and get a trophy, he would grow a little, just like, know,

Karalee Sartin: know,

Darrin Fletcher: he was so proud. And so by the time he was done, that kid was like 10 feet tall. Um, and it changed his life.

And now he sells his scripts for six figures a piece in Hollywood. Um, and he's been produced multiple times. Hi. The other kid that used to come with him owns a. a movie, um, like a movie equipment rental company in Los Angeles. the girl that used to come with them, [00:44:00] I don't know if you know this, Chad, she's now, she's now an anchor, uh, for

Chet Thomas: Yeah,

Darrin Fletcher: in Los Angeles. So,

Chet Thomas: we've had,

Karalee Sartin: had

Darrin Fletcher: it's, it's kind of fun to see some of these people like come into the business and, you know, do it. It's, it's fun.

Chet Thomas: yeah, we've had, and we've had, since then, we've had lots of kids that, you know, one of the, one of the students, past year students, these, we helped them, you know, we saw the potential and we helped them get into the industry and he's probably worked on. I dunno, 10 Steven, Steven Spielberg movies. And the biggest, you know, he is, he is working on the biggest movies in Hollywood.

Um,

Darrin Fletcher: look stupid.

Chet Thomas: yeah, he's done some great stuff. And

Karalee Sartin: him.

Darrin Fletcher: You

Chet Thomas: what,

Darrin Fletcher: Steve. She met him. She worked with Steve at the workshop.

Chet Thomas: oh yeah,

Darrin Fletcher: That's

Chet Thomas: Steve, Steve was

a former student.

Darrin Fletcher: Oh yeah.

Chet Thomas: So we've had, we've had lots of. kids that, you know, we've [00:45:00] seen at different competitions and things and they're just kind of rising, rising up and there will be more success stories. Um, but we've had, we've had, we've had quite a few. I.

Karalee Sartin: we've

Darrin Fletcher: sneak on, um, we've already started talking internally about, um, how are we gonna spin this sneak on to make opportunities where we can hire. and producers and writers and people like that right off of the lot. Um, and we've got our eye on a couple of students that have been through the system uh, 'cause we've got television series that we're working on and we can't do them all.

So, um, I think we have something close to six or seven television series that will be all. over the next year and a half. And so we've been looking at possibly bringing some of these students in who have kind of proven themselves

Chet Thomas: Mm-hmm.

Darrin Fletcher: we can't, you know, what would, uh, would they respond?

How would they act? Would they be able to pull this off? Right? Because it's a big question like, can they can do it [00:46:00] their, their buddies and their friends in their garage? Can they do it when there's a lot of stress on the line and money and bigger names and. so the idea is like, let's find the the best of the best. what Sneak On is, is built to do, is to filter out and find the best of the best. And if we can do that, we're gonna pluck them out and put them in our own projects. Right? That's kind of the idea.

Karalee Sartin: Gosh. Amazing you guys. I just wanna say such a sincere and humble thank you, not only for your time today, which was so generously given, but for what you do. Thank you for. Just being so inspirational to everybody around you and, and living out bigger values than, than just the bottom line. Um, you two are so I keep saying inspirational and let me find a better word. We just have the utmost respect for you and are so honored to get to work with you and to get to use your curriculum. Thank you for what you [00:47:00] do.
