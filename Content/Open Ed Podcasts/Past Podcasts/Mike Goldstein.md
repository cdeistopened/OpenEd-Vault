## Transcript

# Mike and Ela

**Mike:** [00:00:00] When we realized we needed tons and tons of tutors, we came up with this crazy plan. Imagine like a college dorm. We'd build 14 triples, for like three kids with the bunk bed. These 40 22-year-olds will come downstairs and then all they'll do all day is tutor our students. ...

  

**Ela:** Welcome back to the Open Ed Podcast. I'm your sometimes host Ella, and I'm joined by Mike Goldstein today. Mike, can you tell me how you even got started in this whole world of education?

**Mike:** Ella, it's great to be here. Great to be with your audience. Uh, I. Was a grad student studying education policy at Harvard. I thought I would help mayors and governors do big stuff and instead I found myself opening a tiny little charter school that was my grad school project, um, this little school in Boston.

and that's how I got started. I.

**Ela:** And when was this? What was the year

**Mike:** So I graduated in 1998 with my [00:01:00] little master's degree. I applied that year to the Massachusetts Department of Education Charter School. It's like, Hey, here's our 50 page plan. Can we open our own little public school? They said, no. Rejected. There were, that year there were like 50 teams that applied, eight were approved, and my application was number nine, so it was close, but no cigar.

They were probably right to reject me. I didn't, I didn't really know what I was doing, but in any case, uh, I applied again the following year they approved it, and so the school opened in September of 2000.

**Ela:** Interesting. Okay. And was this at the very beginning of like alternative education type of things? Like what was happening in the education world as you were opening this charter school?

**Mike:** So the big picture at the time were a few things were going on at the national level. I think charter schools kind of took off in roughly early nineties, and so by now in Massachusetts there were a handful of these. There were already a few charter schools in Boston. We [00:02:00] might have been the seventh, let's say, something like that.

Um. And the second high school. So that was what Boston, the other thing that was happening was the national level, no Child Left Behind was passed right around that time, a year later. And so it was like Ted Kennedy from Massachusetts combines with President George Bush, the, you know, the second, and they passed this law around standardized tests and accountability for schools.

So that was sort of the big picture and the little picture.

**Ela:** Very fascinating. So whenever you began this charter school, what was your vision with it?

**Mike:** So I thought that for a lot of kids they would describe high school as boring and in suburban public schools. It seemed like the problem was there was a cohort of kids where maybe it was a little boring, but still worked pretty well. A lot of those kids went to college. I was one of those kids and then, you know, would do reasonably well in life.

And then there was like a lower track where like those kids actually didn't [00:03:00] do very well. And, but that was the suburban schools in high poverty areas, like in downtown Boston, um, in the areas that, that we were Dorchester, Roxbury, Mattapan, Hyde Park. These were very poor kids, so it was a school, entirely a system basically mostly serving poor children.

And if you went to their high schools, it was like the high track wasn't even necessarily going to college that frequently. It was like everybody was sort of in trouble. And so the idea was, let's start a school that's hopefully less boring, but it helps kids become the first in their family to go on to graduate from college.

That was the mission.

**Ela:** Interesting. And so what happened next that that like deepened you into the education space?

**Mike:** So what happened next was I got lucky and hired a great principal who'd been a teacher for 33 years. So imagine me like I'm the nerdy grad student with the spreadsheets, doesn't really know what he's doing, thinks he's smart, false, and [00:04:00] then assault of the earth guy who'd been like Massachusetts Teacher of the Year who like connected.

Every kid dealt with every challenge tight with every parent. Parents love this guy. He would like call them all day and all night on his phone and like check in with them. And so we had like a good school going because of this guy named Charlie. Who's since passed. Wonderful guy. And we were trying different things.

We were trying to integrate project-based learning into the school that wasn't really going that well. But what did start to go well was giving kids a lot of one-on-one tutoring. So we started to change the school. It was always heavy on building relationships and then getting kids to try really hard.

That was always at the core, but. From a curriculum point of view, we started dialing back on the project-based learning and dialing up on a lot of math and English, sort of one-on-one tutoring to help these ninth graders and 10th graders catch up on [00:05:00] stuff that they've nominally been taught in grades 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

Like what's a fraction? How do you add them? Um, how do you multiply them and you know, what's an adverb? Stuff like that. There was a lot of filling in. What they didn't know when they arrived at age 14 to the school. And that was really much better done with tutors one-on-one than it was done with a classroom, um, of, you know, 20 kids.

Yeah.

**Ela:** So you, so you have found that at least at this moment, um, in, in this history that you're painting for us, that. Every student has a very different background of education and so they all have very different gaps. Um, and so whenever you were coming into this moment of like, okay, one-on-one support, one-on-one tutoring, like the gaps that were being filled were different for every student, but then it would allow for this more comprehensive education.

**Mike:** I think that there's a mix of that, but even where kids have the same gap, [00:06:00] so I happen to say fractions. Let's say there's some kids and you could loosely divide them. Some don't even know what a fraction is. Some can do like multiplying fractions 'cause it's easy, but they can't subtract fractions 'cause you gotta change the denominator.

Like who knows where they are? You could, and what most schools do is you divide 'em into rough groups and then the teacher helps them. I think that part is okay, but the mechanism of helping when somebody is confused. Is usually the teacher has to stop talking and get the kid to try to blurt out what's in their head.

And so it's not just that every kid is different in what they're missing, even when they're missing the same thing, the path to get them caught up. Is often you might respond differently to tutoring than me, be easier for our tutor to help us one at a time instead of helping us concurrently. It could be that when a tutor is explaining stuff to you, [00:07:00] can't quite grasp what they mean 'cause I have a different giant question mark in my mind.

And that's the advantage of one-on-one instruction versus let's say a even a small group of five kids who roughly have the same, you know, academic shortcoming.

**Ela:** Everybody's perspective. I mean, may, maybe that's a general statement. Um, I could assume that it would. It would be a, um, an objection by people whenever you say that, that we don't have enough teachers anyways. Right. And, um, how, how do you recommend people do this? It, like nowadays I guess we have AI and like all these different ways to possibly scale the one-on-one aspect of it. Um. But it's, it's been fascinating sitting in, in between this world of like, okay, uh, personalized ed versus a standardized approach that needs to optimize itself for scale. Right? Um, I would assume that most teachers [00:08:00] in a public school degree that one-on-one is best, right? But they. They say that they can't do it, right.

It's like, it was like, I would love to do this, but unfortunately we can't. What is your approach to that and like, um, how did you solve for that? So like in your charter, were there enough teachers that you could do this one-on-one approach or like how did y'all approach that scale problem?

**Mike:** Yeah, so it's a great question and it goes to almost the core fisher or dividing line in my career. Um, so remember the first problem, Ella, that I had to solve was just we have a small number of kids and I'm like, wow, Isha and Janelle and Adam, they all benefit when they get one-on-one. I just need to invent a way for us to have a lot more.

Capacity, but it's only for one tiny school, so I don't have to try to solve it at scale. So what we did was we had a school building with two floors. That was the school [00:09:00] and, but we, when we bought the building, it was a three story building and the idea was originally, oh great, we'll rent out the top floor and that'll help us pay the mortgage on sort of the other two floors.

That was the original plan for the charter school when we got that. When we realized we needed tons and tons of tutors, we came up with this crazy plan that we would build it out as a dorm. Imagine like a college dorm. We'd get, we'd build 14 triples, like, you know, those bedrooms for like three kids with the bunk bed.

We'd recruit 42. Full-time Tutors to say sort of like Teach for America style. They're gonna come to us for one year. They won't have to pay for housing. They're gonna live in a triple, they're gonna live on the top floor of the school. And every day at 8:00 AM these 40 people, these 40, 22-year-olds will come downstairs and then all they'll do all day is tutor [00:10:00] our students.

And that was how we built enough capacity for our little school.

**Ela:** So fascinating, um, that that is definitely great entrepreneurship right there. You're not thinking about the problem the same way that, that it approaches you, which is, okay, we need tutors. Uh, we need teachers to teach more. How do we find more teachers? It's like, well, actually there's this subset of the population that would. Love an opportunity to live in this area or love an opportunity to take a gap year or love an opportunity to see if teaching is even right for them. Right. Um, that's super fascinating. Did you, so like, what was that like building that out? Did you have to get people on board? Was that, did anybody say No.

**Mike:** Yeah, so fascinating. So first of all, there's a Harvard even case study about this particular thing. 'cause it was sort of like a weird moment for a little nonprofit board. And what happened was I was like, Hey, I have this crazy idea, but here's why I [00:11:00] think legally it would work. Here's why financially it could work, blah, blah, blah.

And luckily we had really good people on the board, which include some donors who put some money against it. So we were able to raise some charitable money to kind of pay for the build out of this empty floor. Just imagine building these bedrooms and the common area and all that stuff. So it seemed like a nice dorm with air conditioning, all this other stuff.

And then we recruited and we, the first year we got like maybe 250 people to apply for these 40 or so full-time tutoring slots. And these were all recent college grads. So. Today is a Friday when we're recording. So Monday I happened to be having dinner with one of these people who back in, you know, the early two thousands, Laura, she was one of these first 40 tutors.

She had just graduated from Princeton. She didn't know if she wanted to be a teacher. She liked the idea of a year of public service. She didn't mind basically eating macaroni and cheese for a year. [00:12:00] And she, you know, like, you know, Princeton grad, like super capable and she went on, she was one of our first tutors.

Phenomenal with the kids and she's gone on to have a great, you know, career in education. It just happens like thinking of her because. She and her husband are having dinner with my wife and me on Monday, so it's like fresh in my head. Lot of people like that, that were just so passionate and wanted to give and what they liked about the job.

They're like, I think I'm good with one or two kids at a time. I don't know if I'm good with 25 kids at a time. 'cause that's like a whole different thing. And it became an on-ramp for a lot of people to get into education and other people were like, this is my year. I did it. I loved it. Now I'm going to med school.

And. They grew up and became doctors.

**Ela:** So fascinating. I love stories like that where you do something entirely unconventional, um, to solve for a, a unique problem. Like this is a problem a lot of people have, right? Um, but you've solved it entirely unconventionally [00:13:00] and honestly, forever, I will not think about that problem the same way. Um. So moving us forward a little bit, I'm curious what questions have been like the pillar of your, um, your career in education?

Like what have you been trying to understand, solve for? Um. You know, most entrepreneurs, most people that are especially in the thought space, are asking questions like, I mean, you and I were talking earlier, right? Like, what, what actually helps an individual child to flourish, right? Um, what are the, the guiding questions that you've been asking for your entire career?

**Mike:** So. I've been lucky in that a lot of times what I've been first curious about is. If we measure whatever we're doing, whether it's operating a school or tutoring or something, how can we measure and know for sure if it's really helping kids or not? And for that, I've been [00:14:00] really lucky. The arc of my career has been joined often by economists who love to run randomized control trials.

So these are social scientists that are really good at answering this question because, for example, in a charter school. If we have 50 new kids, there might've been 500 kids who applied and we randomly drew them out of the hat. And so a Harvard MIT economist can come in, take all of those names and say, look, we'll track how all of these kids do over the next 5, 10, 15 years.

The ones that randomly were assigned to your little school or to your little tutoring program, and everybody else who ended up at any other place. And so. The question of impact and causal impact at a very nerdy level. I've really loved the kind of working like, so that's been one question. A second question LAU asked before, which is scale and that's where [00:15:00] what I often see, and I bet this will resonate with a lot of the open-end listeners so often.

Various educators figure out something that works in a very boutique way, meaning they're very passionate about it, they create a little program, and because they're so passionate and skilled for those kids, it works really well. Then it attracts attention in some way, and it gets scaled, quote unquote.

But in a weird way, the way often scaling happens is you take an idea. Then somebody who's like a boss level person, like a state department of education or a school superintendent, like a big boss, they'll say, Hey, this is working here. Now everybody should do X. When you interview and you observe and you know people that are actual teachers or school leaders and X has been [00:16:00] imposed on them, you say, well, how's that going?

Almost always their answer is some version of, they're half-assing it. They're like, well. You know the big thing this year is we're supposed to teach phonics. Okay? So we're doing it. But you know, like my question might be, are you fascinated by it? Are you obsessed with it? How are you checking if it's working?

Are you in the classrooms all the time to see if the kids are responding? They're like, nah, it's just this year's thing to do.

**Ela:** Hmm.

**Mike:** the arc of my career, and I think some other, you know, thinkers in this space that I think are more anchored in school choice to say, Hey, that's the way the world works.

Like what I've come to be is like a cheerful, like I've got a smile on my face, but I'm often like cautionary it's people try to scale up the stuff because you get farther and farther from the adults really, genuinely care about the quality. Whatever that thing [00:17:00] is, and so kids are on the receiving end, often of interventions that some adult thought would be good, but they've been diluted so much that from the kid's point of view, it's like, what are we even doing?

give you an example. Yeah, so here's an example that I've heard from our dinner table where kids are like, there's this idea in high schools where it's like, oh, we need to have more connectivity between the adults and the kids. Let's create small group advisory. So this word advisory caught traction, and it's like every teacher, here's your seven kids, you're gonna meet with them every morning for like 15 minutes.

And in a couple schools where they really pioneered this. The, they became like a little family. Those seven kids. And the teacher, it was great. But when you see it, when it scaled, it's like the math teacher's like, all right, principal told me to do something dumb called advisory. Hey kids, here's what's gonna happen.

Uh, if I'm forced to, [00:18:00] I'll nominally teach you a curriculum, but I don't care if you really do your homework for other classes. I'll just kind of go through the motions of it and. When we're not really held accountable for advisory, look, I'd rather just get ready for my period one geometry class. And you guys, I'm sure you have stuff to do or chat you wanna do with your friends or whatever you wanna do.

Prep for a quiz that's coming up later today. You do you I'll do me during advisory period. So that's like a classic where. The people who created this advisory protocol are like, oh my God, we're building so much social cohesion in a school. Whereas my kids would be like, yeah, that's the dumb first 15 minutes.

We could easily cut that from the schedule.

**Ela:** That is so fascinating. I have a, a personal anecdote of this, um, and it's something that I've been kind of marinating on just subconsciously and slightly consciously I guess. But, um, it's this idea of you don't know all the variables, right? So like in high school, I had this one teacher that thought it'd be an awesome idea to do like a Shark Tank [00:19:00] style.

Everybody has.

to think up a business and then present it. Um, but. While it has worked in other, in other schools and in other classrooms for my classroom. I don't feel like I got anything out of it. Um, and I didn't then. Um, and I, I was reflecting on it recently because I had thought about that from the perspective of now like a person that appreciates and enjoys entrepreneurship, how would I give that experience to another kid? Um, and just thinking through my experience, like what are the variables that were associated that actually probably made it, um, not go correctly. One of them, for example, is. What did he

do in the lead up? So he decided that we were gonna make this a, you know, a lesson. And then he, he put us into groups and he made this our priority. But like, it, I think most of teaching is part art, part science, right? So

like the science is what they put into all the books and what they say, like, this is the, [00:20:00] this is a lesson plan, but then like the art part is. But are your, are your students motivated? You know, are they bought in? Like what is all of their prior knowledge?

Um, whenever they're thinking about how this impacts them personally, right? Like how are they doing that? Um, and then I mean, even things like, for example, if you're doing this in a class classroom with self-directed learners and people that are used to things like entrepreneurship, it'll obviously take a lot better than if you're doing it in a classroom with people that, um. Are literally so unfamiliar with it. Like I growing up had a really awesome school experience, but I was really good at school. Like I was really good at getting the right answers. Um, and so something like a class like that just created a ton of stress and anxiety because I was like, I was like, I don't know if this is right or not.

I like, and um, something like that for example, where you have this idea, you have these things that, that has worked before, but you can't. Realistically, uh, dive [00:21:00] into all of the possible variables that make it work. Right. And so whenever you're

trying to.

replicate it, or like as a teacher, whenever you're trying to teach your kids, um, sometimes it, it, it doesn't work. Um, what is your thought about like, I would say in, in the education space especially, there are a lot of very idealistic people, right? Where you have ideals about like. It'd be awesome if everybody was an entrepreneur and it would be awesome if everybody got a custom education and it would be awesome if, you know, fill in the blank. Um, but like you were saying, like that does not guarantee success. It doesn't guarantee flourishing. Like even if you gave one kid the exact same right, quote unquote customized schedule, right? It doesn't make it. A hundred percent guaranteed that they're going to be competent and capable adults. Right. So, um, how do you deal with like the idealism versus trying to actually make it work on the [00:22:00] day-to-day level?

**Mike:** That's a great question. I think that I've always anchored first. On direct observation of what's happening. So for example, to use your Shark Tank analogy, let's say you and I would jump in and audit on Zoom 10 classes around the country that had some kind of shark tank thing going on, and we just eyeballed it a little bit.

We'd probably rate a few of those classes as like an eight outta 10. 'cause we're like, oh, you could just see the engagement and the kids are following. Or we just chatted with a couple kids and they're like, this class is really awesome. And we're like, check, check, check. This sounds good. We'd probably see a couple at the other end where for various reasons it's just an unhappy kind of two or three outta 10 type class where.

It could be the teaching is bad. It could be the teaching is inauthentic. It could be the teaching is reasonable, but the kids really don't like it. It could be what you were sort of saying, which is like [00:23:00] the teacher's operating up here, but the kids are missing so much prior knowledge that. The, you know, it's like the teacher would be doing a good job for a more skilled entrepreneurship student, but they're doing a very bad job for a beginner.

All of those things could be true. I think. The tribe that I tend to professionally associate are people like me that are almost like first journalists. I need to see it and see what's going on. The teacher level, the curriculum level, the, you know, school level, the reform level, the policy level, it's all like, let's go look downstream from that.

Like, and that's how you form basic hypotheses of like, I think it's working. I think it's failing. Downstream, then you can go to the Economist, right, and like measure something. But there's a much earlier phase. A challenge with idealists in education is they find it very [00:24:00] disturbing usually to look at the real work because often you know it's not going that well and it doesn't.

Like it doesn't matter what your particular idealistic view is or the pet thing that you love, it's just schooling is really hard. And so the fight I often get into, and I think the easy way that I cut through bullshit versus real is I, I'm quickly talking to professional people in education and saying, oh, just describe like.

You know, like when you were in the classrooms last week, like just describe to me what you saw. And then certain people will jump in and other people, they kind of evade a little bit and they'll sort of say something, that's not what I saw like last Thursday. And I'll just be like, no, no, no. Like literally what was the day, where were you?

Who did you see? And you realize a lot of people in this space. They're doing some version of telling [00:25:00] teachers and school leaders what to do by creating curriculum or training or interventions or something policy. They're not willing to hold themselves accountable. They literally won't look. I would say most people who create curriculum do it in, in a room like a office room.

And a lot of these don't include a lot of my friends, like people that I know that weren't, they're not actually in the schools watching lessons not go well. Or if they don't go well, then they're sort of like, oh yeah, the teacher sucked. It's like, I don't know, like if you're a playwright and you write a bad play, bad scene, you could say the actors failed and maybe occasionally that's true.

But a lot of times it's like, no, you, you should be accountable. Why don't you try to write a new scene? You know? And I think we need more of that in education. Just eyeball what's going on, reasonable person, [00:26:00] and then decide what you need to change

**Ela:** Interesting. So. Given all of that. Right.

and.

what it seems like you're saying is there is no perfect way. Right? Like, like as much as we would love to find the perfect thing for every single school to do and for every single student to flourish, there is no perfect way. So do you think that that scale is possible with that?

Or like, whenever you're, whenever you're saying that. You know that it is best for a teacher to be like a journalist, um, to be like a researcher, to see their lesson as something that they can improve upon. Um, that they are basically like taking this thing and they're presenting it to their kids and their kids might.

Take onto some of it and might reject some of it, and then they can slowly get better over time. Um, that really reminded me of something that Michael Horn, who,

Um,

[00:27:00] we were both talking about before, had said about Clay Christiansen, which was, he took his class multiple times, um, multiple years. And so over the

years he saw

Clay would get into an argument with the students.

he would.

see that the areas where they had made a point that he didn't realize, and then he would change his lesson because of it. Um. But like that happens in one classroom, right? Not 100 simultaneously. So do you think that scale is possible for this approach or no?

**Mike:** I would put it this way, I've, I've, I think choice is the mechanism that maximizes quality overall, and I don't think it's a perfect system. It's just better than all the other sort of more top down type systems. And so. I think there's a lot of skilled teachers out there that are like, you know, I just think of their, they're craftsmen, craftswomen, like they care deeply [00:28:00] about excellence and they have different paths for that.

They have different definitions of that, and some of them are better than others at either leaning into systems that the school is providing, like, Hey, we can give you some coaching. And some people like take advantage of that. Some people are held back by the sort of systems that the school puts in.

Like they were doing well with their hand chosen curriculum, and then the district gets a new one and now they're not playing to their strength teacher who loved teaching Shakespeare. And then the district's like, well, we don't think it's relevant anymore. We're gonna teach these other books. That teacher might lose all of her mojo.

You know, like, so I feel like I wanna maximize choices at the kid and parent level. The individual teacher level, the institutional level, rather than sort of imagining scaled systems that are top-down delivery of, Hey, here's the syllabus we're all gonna [00:29:00] use 'cause we figured out that it's optimized for everybody, or something like that.

I, they each have their obvious perils, but I sort of lean more towards lots of people making their own choices and therefore increasing authenticity. One by one, by one adding up to like, you know, 70 million kids versus including some bad decisions along the way, but always at like the little level instead of like, Hey, I'm in charge of California's education system, so I'm gonna impose this on, you know, whatever it is.

Millions of kids and it doesn't really work in real life.

**Ela:** Yeah, I, I've definitely seen that time and time again. We've talked a lot about where the teacher comes in, especially in either a traditional setting or like, um, maybe a micro school setting where there is some sort of a primary teacher, maybe that is the parent. What about in the systems, like traditional public school, traditional private school charter? Where's the role of the parent in that?

**Mike:** [00:30:00] So I think there's a few things here. I think that in. Some cities, poor parents have been given a lot more options and therefore they can operate more like middle and upper middle class families. So I think there's always been a lot of choice. A lot of times families exercise choice by we're gonna move to the following school district.

And so that's the way we exercise choice. Then we'll go to the system that we like. Sometimes, particularly at the high school level, a kid might have a whole bunch of different types of schools. It could be public, private, charter and they have some agency and and choices there. So I think the number one thing a parent gets to do is pick, hopefully, sometimes this is very constrained for parents.

Where is your kid going to school or, or with older kids, if my kid's not doing well in school A, can I get them over to school B? And so I think that's a very, the first and primary kind of mechanism of how parents interact with schools. I wrote a book actually a long time ago. This [00:31:00] is not a bestseller.

You do not need to read it, but it's about parent, teacher to parent communication. It's a book about phone calls where one thing we did in our little charter school. Was all of the teachers would proactively call up all the parents. So I would call up your mom and dad if I was a teacher, and I'd say, Hey, little Ella, she's having some strengths over here.

She's struggling over here. I want you to praise her for this. She had a great moment in blah, blah, blah. And so there was a lot of like proactive communication, not to the parent. Council, not an email blast of like, here's what the whole school is doing. It'd be like just about Ella, just about the kid.

Right. And so I think that can be very valuable, but often schools resist that type of one-to-one. They're just like, well, they can read the report card. They don't like to do a lot of granular thing. Private schools are much more likely to really trying to be authentically having back and forth [00:32:00] conversations with parents.

I think that's often a strength of private schools. Traditional public schools rarely want to do that. Like certainly past the elementary school level. The, the middle school teacher will say, well, you know, I got 130 kids. I don't want to have 130 conversations. The private school would say, yeah, well you have to, because that's what parents are paying for.

They, they want to feel like they, their kid is known, and that's a legitimate goal. So I, I and then I think obviously parenting. You're either lucky, like, I don't know. I honestly feel we're pretty lucky. We have two kids, like you mentioned, Ella, you were good at school.

Our two kids are pretty good at school and not like school comes easy. Doesn't mean they don't have to work hard, doesn't mean they don't have challenges. It just means like I think schools, I wish they were much better with the parents that have kids for whom school is not coming easily. Like. It's just an uphill march every day.

It could be social, it could be [00:33:00] academic, it could be emotional, it could be a whole bunch of things, but I feel like often there's tension between school school's sort of saying, Hey, we are what we are. You gotta get your kid to suck it up, and the kid's just not thriving and the parent wants help and accommodation from the school.

I think that's why choice is important because. You're probably not gonna be able to negotiate your way to change the school very much. That's why I'm skeptical of like the parent council and the, you know, the school board and all that stuff. I think better to have exit the right to exit and just find a new place that you're like, this is much more fits my kiddo like, and so that's why I would love to see a lot more models pop up, a lot more choices for families just to try for that group of kids where school is just not coming easily.

So they need different ways.

**Ela:** Do you think the barrier to entry should be lower? So like, I mean, [00:34:00] use, uh, I'll use my family as an example. So my family, I've, there's four of us total. Um. All of my siblings did a different type of education. It was not intentional, but like for example, my, one of my younger brothers actually ended up going to four or five schools in between, um, like eighth grade and his finishing high school because he was chasing different things and there were.

Different priorities in his,

mind. So first he went to a couple schools for football,

and then he um, moved cities and decided that that wasn't his priority anymore. So then he decided to go to a school that was entirely different and it had, um, different things that it was, it was known for, um. Most parents, like my parents are very, very relaxed about that.

They knew that he was doing well. We, we've all been good at school. They knew he would thrive in most places, but most parents have a sort of, uh, hesitancy or fear of putting their kids in so many different situations. Like most parents [00:35:00] would look at that and I mean, even I, I look at that and I'm like, he went to a lot of schools. Um. How many times should you be trying to rinse and repeat, like, as a parent I can, I can imagine that there's a sort of hesitancy to say, okay, this school's not working, we're gonna try another one. This school's not working too. We're gonna try another one. And like. That commitment to continuing to try and figure out like, how do I solve this problem?

Is it really the school? Is it extra support on the side? Like how do you figure that out as a parent? Because obviously like parents don't necessarily want to try a new school every year, right.

**Mike:** Yeah, it's a great question. So the way I think about it is. Most kids, if they're gonna switch schools, switch once, if you will. That's the most common pattern. If they're switching. So if they leave, for example, the local public school district and they switch to a private, that's usually a one-time change.

You know, may maybe, like I'm talking about during [00:36:00] their K eight experience, maybe they're going to a different place for high school. 'cause the K eight runs out of, you know, years if you will. But there's a lot of like one time changes. I think if we focus on the kids that either for opportunities, sounds like.

Your brother is an unusual one. Usually the multiple switchers are because they're not thriving in school A nor school B, nor school C. And it's like, but I still think it's the right move to fight for your kid to. It's not a huge number of total cases, but it's like keep trying until you find something.

You're trying to have, you know, the best childhood you possibly can, and I'm sure you're working the problem at both ends as a parent, as best you can. I don't know that we're always giving parents very good tools. I feel like the clinical precision of people who work with kids that aren't doing well in school.

Is not equal to the clinical precision we expect of pediatricians, for example. [00:37:00] So if you see a pediatrician and she says, Ella, I think there's an issue with your gallbladder, and then you go to another one, they're very likely gonna make the same diagnosis and like they're gonna like, not always, but they're.

Directionally, they're pretty aligned. If somebody sees a kid who's struggling, they could see five different experts in air quotes. They have five different stories to tell, like what your kid needs. Oh, you need therapy, you need medication. You're a DHD. You're on the spectrum. You need this, you need that.

They're all over the place, diagnostically and on possible fixes or accommodations. That's not good. It's just our sector is not really that strong in precision. And so what parents usually have to do, which I think is very hard, is try to use their social networks to find people that are unusually good.

At helping that type of problem, and it shouldn't be that hard. [00:38:00] Whereas if you told me today like, oh, you have an issue with a valve in your heart, you're gonna do heart surgery, you would be able to navigate the health system and probably find a really good surgeon. Like it's just more findable. I think it's much harder to find like the kind of expertise people need as parents to help.

Their kids. So you see a revolving door, not just sometimes of schools for strugglers, but of therapists, tutors, coaches, mentors. That's also a kind of more hidden revolving door too. But I, I do think the parents should have the right, and we should just make it easier, like should always be a rooting for the kid to find something where they feel like they're thriving.

**Ela:** What would be your approach from like a tactical perspective like. On the ground. If your student was struggling, let's say with school, like something just was not clicking in the school that they were at, what would be your first, this is what we're doing. We're talking to [00:39:00] the kid, we're, you know, asking exactly what's not working or like what, what exactly would you be searching for?

**Mike:** I think it's different with little kids and big kids, so I'll use a 15-year-old as an example. I think you start with a 15-year-old by trying to understand their story from their perspective. So, you know, first thing is, can I get them talking? And genuinely, a lot of times kids open up, but not always.

They're trying to size you up too. It's like, why are we talking and whatever? But you're, you're trying to do that. You're trying to hear what's going on. You might have a lot of background knowledge sometimes from, you know, mom who's told you her version of the story or from the school, their version of the story.

So you're able to interview them well, and I think the first thing you're trying to do is. Understand the movie that's playing in that kid's head. So if the kid's not doing well, but they have a view of what's been happening to them and why it is, and you know, you gotta know that in order to kind of begin a conversation about [00:40:00] different, I think the second thing is you're almost shopping for.

What's an area where you think we can work together on a productive change? For example, some kids are very open to the idea of changing the school that they're currently attending, but some kids are like, I got my people here. There's no way I wanna change schools. I'm not thriving here, but I don't wanna change.

I fear change or whatever. It's okay for the moment. Let's assume that door is closed. Can we work on something else? Do you have a sport? Do you have a hobby? Do you have an art? Do you have a part-time job? What is it you want? I think with a, a kid who's older, you're just patrolling for where can we get an early win in your life?

And together put that up on the board where you have some earned pride. It's something that you're authentically like, yeah, I actually would want to. Get physically fit. I don't know how to navigate the world of [00:41:00] personal trainers and I don't want, I can't do any of the school sports. I'm not good at like basketball and volleyball, whatever.

Like what else is there? You're like, oh, well there's this like fitness thing. There's a rock climbing thing, there's a martial arts thing, there's different paths. And the kid might perk up and say, oh, how would I even get going? And like, I don't want my friends to know about that. They'll make fun of me.

Okay. Like there's a lot of things you gotta get through, but you're trying to put one win on the board. If you can do that. A kid and parent level up, it's like, okay, maybe I'll reopen one of those doors that I wasn't willing to open before. 'cause I have a sense of momentum. You gotta get momentum.

**Ela:** I love that I actually, um, am deeply convicted by the idea that a great childhood, um, in a great childhood, a child learns what they can win at Like Like good adults usually have had moments where they have built self-esteem because they've found what they can win at. And [00:42:00] like there are games that everybody gets to play because of, you know, the traditional aspect of them. But then if your kid is not winning at those games, you have to find untraditional ways that they can win because it is so important for a thriving adult, I believe to. Have found those things and to dive into them deeper and like for that to be normal, it's like, yes, you can win at this. Go run. Go do it.

Go do it. It's awesome.

**Mike:** I so agree with you, and one of the things I've been thinking about lately is you see these education savings accounts and some of those monies are spent on, you know, in a way that I find very appealing extracurriculars and helping kids kind of find. That earned victory, something they are good at. And once you get reasonably good at something, you have a sense of pride, but you also in it intellectually opens up a whole new thing.

Like how could I go from good to great? It's fascinating and you can only. Explore that if you make it to being pretty good, [00:43:00] right? So the idea of climbing the ladder of expertise, all of these great things like the social connection that you start to feel if you happen to be good, like if you're good enough at music, that you can be in a band, that can be a huge unlock.

Then you have your little tribe of people and you're, you know, you're doing stuff together. Those things all require, maybe not excellence in something, but goodness in something. And I think there's. A number of teens who would describe themselves. I'm not really good at anything. I'm sort of okay and there's nothing I do well enough to kind of enjoy that.

I wanna spend additional hours on it, and I feel like that's a, that's a warning sign. And I do think education savings accounts could be used to help kids find more of, oh, I stumbled into this thing and now I love it and I'm good at it.

**Ela:** Yeah. I wanna spend the last, uh, part of this interview just chatting about a question that you surfaced at the very beginning of us talking, which was this question of, um, [00:44:00] so like everybody's focused on the kids that are not doing very well. Then there's this other subset of kids that are doing very, very well.

But then you had mentioned that there's this, there's. A really large actually population of kids.

that are just doing average. Like they're not doing great, but they're not doing terribly. Um, and I think this segues pretty well because I would SI would, I would bet. That most of these kids are in that population of people that have not found the things that they're great at, um, but they're also not being pushed to find the things that they're great at. I would love you to frame this like problem and question that you're asking for, for parents just like that are curious about it, and then, um, yeah, and then we can dive in a little bit deeper.

**Mike:** It's a great question. I think parents get easy information in two ways, and then the stuff you're asking about. It doesn't quite get called. So the easy information you get as a parent is if your kid goes to any type of formal school, you get a report card and often standardized test scores on top of that.

So you get that [00:45:00] from a school. So you know how your kid more or less is doing from eight to three, and then. You know, you go usually every year to the doctor and your kid gets checkup and you know, hopefully, most of the time it's just sort of like, yep, another good year. Everything's in good shape or, okay, like I noticed this and maybe the spine curvature is a little, I want to do a screen for scoliosis.

Who knows? Maybe they notice something, but you get pretty good information in those two ways, academic, physical. The rest, you're kind of on your own as a parent. You're sort of patrolling it through dinner table and going on walks and like trading notes maybe with the spouse or other key people in the kid's life and the kid, and you're like, this kid have a sense of purpose.

Do they have friends and are those. Good friends, what are their social skills? Are they nice and polite people? Do they have things that they love, you know, uh, activities? Do they [00:46:00] have hobbies? Do they do any pleasure reading? Or is that gone? Or was it never there? How much bad time is there? Which could either be like aimless, sort of like, I mean, I think there's a healthy version of boredom, but I don't think like five hours a day of scrolling can be called like healthy bored.

You see, it's that stuff that I think what's hard for a parent is you're not getting information the way you get it from a doctor who either who sort of says everything is normal. Except for X, so that makes you reassured. Or the school, which is at least telling you how is this kiddo doing relative to other kids.

And so you're sort of like, oh, well you're a B student and okay, I get that. You're like D student, yikes. What's going on? And you sort of understand where they are relative to others. I think it's hard for parents to figure out. [00:47:00] How's my kid doing overall, like in a way they're awash with information and observation, but it's hard to like have an external perspective and often because you're so close to the situation, it's the classic, like you can't see the forest for the trees.

You're right next to the tree. In a way, as a parent, you are one of the trees, right? So it's like you're all these like little trees like right next to each other and nobody's zooming out. And I do think a really valuable service that could emerge. I would love to see it emerge. We haven't talked yet about the barriers to starting new services that would serve families well, but I'm hoping as the education savings accounts mature a little bit.

A 360 degree evaluation of your kid is a service that I think a lot of parents would love. Like I want a pragmatic person or a person that's aligned with my values [00:48:00] and practical to somehow let me know, like, how is this going? And a lot of times I think what could be beneficial is. For a kid who's struggling, they might be good at some things and, but the parent is just getting hit over the head that they're not doing well in school.

So it sort of poisons the parent kid relationship. Whereas a more holistic evaluation might say, you know, your kid is like really good at like getting their sort of chores done. They're so helpful. Like they're unusually helpful to grandma, or, I noticed this and that. Like if you look at the whole kid, there's a lot of good things, but.

They find school boring. So the main job that they have, they're always gonna be at a deficit, but it just sort of makes them seem to their parents like they're struggling as a kid or from the kid's point of view, it's like, oh, my parents are always disappointed. Whereas if you look at how we think of adults a lot of times and school's over, you [00:49:00] look at them across a whole bunch of domains and you can be forgiving of an area where they're.

Bad because they have so many other good appealing qualities. And so I think a lot of people have like a lot of good appealing qualities and a couple things where they're weak. But the problem from a child's point of view is like school is your job. Usually that is what a parent is taught in our society and like what if you're just not good at school?

You might be good at four other sort of domains of life and you're not good at school and you're always kind of presented as like a failure. That's not good.

**Ela:** Yeah, that's interesting. Um, just for the sake of, of thinking through this together, so, um. My question whenever you were saying like, I would love to see a 360 evaluation of a kid, like my question is like against what? Right? So like there for, for businesses, there's like the ENPS kind of a survey where it's like, it's like rating wise.

I wonder if that would just be like as simple as that [00:50:00] is it would be effective. Like scale of one to 10, how are you feeling about these? Like, you know, 30 things in your life, you ask your kid occasionally. The things that they're like really not feeling great about. You're just like, okay, maybe that's an interesting like, um, temp check.

That would be enough. What do you think about that?

**Mike:** I think it might be. So I'll tell you a little story. Maybe we can leave it here. You'll find it. Find, so this guy known named Marty West, a great scholar and he's the dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education. And a couple months ago he was like, oh, Mike, I know you've been curious lately about teenage flourishing.

And it made me think, he's like, do you know who the smartest guy at Harvard is? And I'm like, oh my gosh. Like Marty knows a lot of people at Harvard. Harvard has a lot of smart people, a lot of dumb people too, but a lot of smart people. And like, what a weird framing. Marty. He's like the smartest guy at Harvard.

I was like, oh, do tell. And you know, I was like, is this guy like a Nobel Prize winner? Like who's the [00:51:00] smartest? The smartest person at Harvard, he said, is a guy named Tyler who runs this tiny little center, it's called the Center for Human Flourishing. So it's like, I've never heard of this place. It's across from a little ice cream shop in Harvard Square.

They've got this office and the Center for Human Flourishing Studies. Human flourishing, not surprising. And the way they do that is some version of what you said. It's like these holistic scale of one to 10 rating type questions that they use first tier with adults to ask how are you doing overall? But they have a teenage version of it.

And I do think like. That is a very valuable tool for some families. Like it could be good. I think for others I feel like they need more of a qualitative, like, well, what are we really talking about? I need something deeper than, you know, sort of a scale of one to 10. Sometimes I think there's concrete metrics that could be really valuable, like your Fitbit watch can give you your [00:52:00] sleep score.

I think for kids who don't move around very much, like it'd be really great if they could start setting a goal of getting 8,000 steps a day and you know, like. Tracking that. So I think both the, what's really going on, big picture and how to measure it, I think might be more expansive potentially of what families would ultimately find very valuable.

'cause in the end, sometimes what you're seeking is reassurance. Sometimes what you're seeking is diagnosis, and sometimes what you're seeing is what you're seeking rather is behavior change. And so. I think depending on your purpose of what exactly your goal is as a parent, and it's, I mean, I'm a parent, so it's like at different moments in time you're seeking different things.

And so I think a, I could imagine a lot of different people in that space of helping parents get some perspective, and I'm hopeful that a lot more [00:53:00] services can be offered to families to kind of help kids get where they need to get. And maybe, I guess overall big picture, I'd love to see some distribution of, you know, in a school district like Boston where I am, I mean they spend a lot in a school district that I don't think many parents are very happy with and usually exit at the first chance they get, they spend like $30,000 per kid per year on the public school system here.

Yeah. So it's sort of like you start to think, wow. If those parents had 30,000 of actual cash per year and they spent $18,000 to send the kid to the Catholic school and they could spend $12,000 to like, help the kid find hobbies or if the kid has mental health issue, get them a good therapist or whatever, like, whatever you need, you know, like that could be really cool.

I hope we move more in that direction. There is a lot of, in some places, a lot of public money being spent. It'd be great to have the parents just have more control of that cash. I think even though I will [00:54:00] stipulate, not every family spends that perfectly. And I would also stipulate sometimes, you know, like it's, uh, the lack of oversight can be problematic on average.

I just think a lot more kids would end up thriving.

**Ela:** Wow. That is an awesome note. To end this, thank you so much for coming on the podcast for all of your thoughts. Where can people find you if they want to learn more about you and read more of your stuff and find you?

**Mike:** Uh, I have a website called mike goldstein education.com, which is very nerdy. I don't know if it's like perfect for the parent audience, but you can certainly find me in a lot of stuff I've written and a lot of the stuff that I've learned.

**Ela:** Love it. Well, thank you so much again, and I hope that everybody gets to check you out.

**Mike:** Alright, thank you.
