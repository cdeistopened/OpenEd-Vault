In this episode of the OpenEd podcast, we sit down with Joey Mascio, founder of Sidekick to Hero, a program designed to teach self-development skills to teenagers. Joey, a former middle school teacher and Disneyland performer, shares his insights on the importance of teaching cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and other personal growth techniques to young people.

Key Themes:

1. The gap in traditional education around self-development and resilience
2. Using storytelling and gamification to engage teens in personal growth
3. The impact of technology on teen mental health and productivity
4. Reframing negative thoughts and building self-confidence
5. The importance of real-world action in learning and growth

### Highlights:

The Missing Piece in Education  
Joey reflects on his time as a teacher: "There's no education, no class, no curriculum that really teaches self-development, resilience, or anything like that. We find this stuff as adults, and we always say, 'I wish I knew this when I was a teen.'"

Rewriting Our Stories  
Drawing from his own experiences with bullying, Joey explains: "I was rewriting my unhelpful thoughts that weren't getting me the results I wanted. Teens are capable of doing this, but they don't know they can. They're not aware of the difference between the facts around them and their stories or thoughts about those facts."

The Hero's Journey in Personal Development  
Joey describes his approach: "Sidekick to Hero is my way of teaching CBT and other self-development concepts to teens. The hero is the person in the story who rises up to change the ending. Nobody else in the story does that – it's the hero."

Technology as a Tool, Not a Lifestyle  
On the impact of excessive screen time, Joey notes: "If you play Fortnite for four hours and get to level 95, when you turn it off and look around in your real life, there's been no change, no improvement. It doesn't transfer over, and your real life is not improving."

Closing Thought:  
"Teens can do so much more than they're currently doing. They just have to change their mind about themselves so they can change their story."

This episode offers valuable insights for parents, educators, and teens themselves on the importance of self-development skills and how to cultivate them in a world full of distractions. Joey Mascio's Sidekick to Hero program presents an innovative approach to teaching these crucial life skills, emphasizing real-world application and personal growth.

### Long Clips

1. ~~**Sidekick to hero. Cut some of the fluff from here if possible.**~~

  

~~You can start working on this from here: [https://riverside.fm/dashboard/editor/274e9f25-f0b5-483c-958a-b89e473cd21d/66facace6538727821a575db](https://riverside.fm/dashboard/editor/274e9f25-f0b5-483c-958a-b89e473cd21d/66facace6538727821a575db)~~

~~Joey (14:26.566)~~  
~~Like, Sidekick to Hero is my way of teaching CBT and other self -development to...~~

~~Joey (14:32.073)~~  
~~teens because they kind of get that concept. So I love Joseph Campbell's the hero's journey. I teach that to the teens and I say the hero is the person in the story who rises up to change the ending. Nobody else in the story does. It's the hero that does it. Harry Potter rises up right to change the end of the story. Luke Skywalker rises up right to change the end of the story. Katniss Everdeen rises up to change the end of the story. The sidekick doesn't. Now~~

~~Joey (15:01.419)~~  
~~The sidekick is on the hero's team. And this is a very important distinction. It's not victim. I'm not talking about villains. I'm not talking about any of that. Like you have to recognize your teen is acting like a sidekick because a sidekick has the goals of the hero. All right. The victim often does it in NPC, the non -playable character.~~

~~Joey (15:25.279)~~  
~~There's just a person walking down the street in the movie in Jurassic Park and a dinosaur eats them, right? We know nothing about them. They don't have the same goals as the hero does, but the sidekick does. And that's how I felt when I was a teen. I felt like I had all these goals and these things that I wanted. I wanted to do all these awesome things, but I had a stutter. I looked weird. I was pasty white skin, so I was called Casper, you know, but I wanted to be on stage. I wanted to be the center of attention.~~

~~Joey (15:53.555)~~  
~~and I wanted to be known in that way for being funny, but I felt people were laughing at me in a bad way. And so I was like, man, it's just, I want that, but I can't get it. And when you give up and go, well, I'll never be able to get that, that's sidekick mode. That's when you're thinking like a sidekick. Now it's not bad to think like a sidekick. We all think like a sidekick. I was thinking like a sidekick earlier today, right? It's something that we have to be aware of. And I teach teens how to catch themselves.~~

~~Joey (16:22.793)~~  
~~when they're thinking like a sidekick and go, wait a minute, I don't have to be thinking this way. Let me kick myself into hero mode and think like a hero. And when you think like a hero, you're gonna get hero results. And a hero result is the result that you want. And so that's my approach when I pitch it to teens. That's the whole framing.~~

### Short clips

1. ~~**How much our own narratives matter:**~~  
      
    ~~My way of thinking my whole life wasn't necessarily right. As a kid, I was bullied in middle school. Kids called me "moon head" because of the shape of my head, comparing me to Mac Tonight from the McDonald's commercials.~~
    
    ~~That bullying shook my confidence for weeks. But one day, I decided, "You know what? Yeah, I do have a big head, and I'm still freaking awesome." I thought I was cheating the system, but what I was really doing was coaching myself. I was rewriting my unhelpful thoughts that weren't getting me the results I wanted.~~
    
    ~~Teens are capable of doing this, but they don't know they can. They're not aware of the difference between the facts around them and their stories or thoughts about those facts. They think statements like "I'm weird looking and nobody's going to like me" are facts. But these are opinions that can be rewritten.~~  
    
2. **The role of tech/gamification**  
      
    [https://riverside.fm/shared/exported-clip/d29709ff0cc4741e086c](https://riverside.fm/shared/exported-clip/d29709ff0cc4741e086c)  
    teens know it, man. They, just like you said, we all know it for ourselves. Teens know it. They know they spend too much time on screens. They get it. And deep down, they know it's stopping them from reaching their real life goals. Because the way I pitch it to my teens are, I'm like, guys, if you play Fortnite for four hours, right, and you get to level 95, yes, when you turn it off, you look around in your real life.
    
    and there's been no change, no improvement. It doesn't transfer over and your real life is not improving. Guys, get that concept. That's nuts. That's nuts that we spend so much time trying to up -level a fictional character in a fake world and then we turn it off and we're experiencing all this kind of like depression and lethargy and all this stuff. It's not a surprise that we do that. And I get it.  
    
3.   
    
    1. **On lack of curriculums that teach you about SEL**

## Polished Transcript

### Introduction [00:02]

**Charlie Deist:** Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm Charlie Deist, here today with Joey Masio of Sidekick to Hero. Joey, how are you doing?

**Joey Masio:** I'm doing fantastic. It's a beautiful day.

**Charlie:** It looks that way where you are, and likewise here. We'll channel that outdoor energy into our indoor conversation. I've been eager to talk with you ever since seeing your booth at the Utah Fits All vendor fair back in June. You weren't there personally, but you had some great help handing out flyers, which caught my eye.

**Joey:** I think so, yeah.

**Charlie:** I believe there was a sticker giveaway. I grabbed one for my daughter, and she loved it. She might be a bit young for Sidekick to Hero, but this is an exciting time to pursue what we're calling open education. It's broader than traditional homeschooling categories. People are finding that whether you're in Utah with access to programs like Open Ed or Utah Fits All, there are opportunities to customize and mix-match different curriculums to find what works for your child.

Let's start by having you talk about what you're doing with Sidekick to Hero – the structure of the program and how you see it fitting into the broader ecosystem of what's happening in education today.

### The Genesis of Sidekick to Hero [01:36]

**Joey:** Definitely. I was remiss not to be at that convention. I do like to be mysterious, but that weekend I was at the GHC convention in California.

What I noticed at these conventions is something I observed as a middle school teacher. I taught English and theater for seven years, and halfway through, I volunteered to be the teacher in the discipline office in Southern California. I realized I was encountering many teens there – both troubled teens and the general population – who ended up there for various reasons.

One thing missing from their education was how to use their brain effectively. They didn't understand how their brain affects them, how it sometimes plays tricks on us, and how it does things that get us further away from our goals. This would lead these kids to end up in the discipline office for various reasons.

It also causes teens and adults everywhere to do things like procrastinate, self-doubt, and other counterproductive behaviors. It hit me during that time that there's no education, no class, no curriculum that really teaches self-development, resilience, or anything like that. We find this stuff as adults. We discover these books and love them, and we always say the same thing: "I wish I knew this when I was a teen."

### The Hidden Curriculum [03:29]

**Charlie:** Exactly. I think it was actually the little postcard you were giving out that caught my eye, with the cover of "Deep Work" by Cal Newport and "Atomic Habits" by James Clear. He's got the perfect name for what he does. His whole thing is about how you don't lack motivation, you lack clarity. These are things that, if I had learned as a kid, could have saved me so many frustrated hours.

You've got a whole list of books on your website, but I'm curious how you break these down. Do you need to do like the Cliff Notes version for teenagers? I imagine that past a certain age, you can just read the source material directly. But how do you actually approach this sort of hidden curriculum or the real-world skills that are absent in the traditional school model?

### Teaching Self-Development to Teens [04:29]

**Joey:** When teaching concepts from these books in my Sidekick to Hero curriculum, I've found that they're often way longer than they need to be. Many could really be pamphlets. The stories in books like "Atomic Habits" are great, but the concepts are what teens need at this point. They need them quicker and in video format with a lot of humor. That's what I do.

My background is in theater. I was the only actor in Disney history to have played both Darth Maul and the Mad Hatter during my nine-year stint as a Disneyland performer. So, I bring that theatrical background to my teaching.

I make short videos that are fun and engaging and teach teens these important skills. They're simple when it comes down to it. I recently heard from a new mom in our homeschool co-op who noticed a difference in her kids' attitude and confidence after just the first two videos they watched. It doesn't take much to introduce a new way of thinking that we all should adopt.

Kids are programmed to think negatively as a protective mechanism, but it's often unnecessary. If you introduce these concepts in a way where kids go, "Yeah, that makes sense," using humor, stories, and metaphors, they realize they don't have to think that way anymore. They start experiencing positive change.

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Teens [09:31]

**Charlie:** You mention CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) on your website. Can you talk about CBT a little bit for those who might not be familiar with that term?

**Joey:** CBT, or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, says that what we think affects our behavior. Our behavior can be how we react outwardly or inwardly – our actions and our feelings. CBT posits that the solution to almost any problem is to identify the thought causing you to feel and take actions that are getting you results you don't want.

I have my master's in education and took a couple of classes that dabbled in CBT, but it was when I was in that middle school discipline office that I decided to get certified. I became a certified life coach through the Life Coach School with Brooke Castillo. She teaches what she calls "the model," which is her version of cognitive behavioral therapy.

That certification was just as rigorous and expensive as my master's program, but I learned so much. The biggest thing I learned was that my way of thinking my whole life wasn't necessarily right. As a kid, I was bullied in middle school. Kids called me "moon head" because of the shape of my head, comparing me to Mac Tonight from the McDonald's commercials.

That bullying shook my confidence for weeks. But one day, I decided, "You know what? Yeah, I do have a big head, and I'm still freaking awesome." I thought I was cheating the system, but what I was really doing was coaching myself. I was rewriting my unhelpful thoughts that weren't getting me the results I wanted.

Teens are capable of doing this, but they don't know they can. They're not aware of the difference between the facts around them and their stories or thoughts about those facts. They think statements like "I'm weird looking and nobody's going to like me" are facts. But these are opinions that can be rewritten.

That's a skill that should be taught to every single adolescent. If they want to be successful, they need to know how to build self-confidence and push forward after failure. Without these skills, even great book smarts won't be enough in the real world because they'll be stopping themselves with unhelpful "sidekick thoughts," as I call them.

### The Hero's Journey in Sidekick to Hero [14:24]

**Charlie:** You break down your program into four arenas, and it just clicked that the acronym – Headspace, Emotions, Relationships, Objectives – adds up to HERO. The name Sidekick to Hero says it all, but can you explain how you conceive of that progression? It sounds like you're saying we can consider ourselves a sidekick in life or be the main character of our story. Is that another one of these reframes? Can you talk through some of these four arenas and what each one represents as a skill set?

**Joey:** Sidekick to Hero is my way of teaching CBT and other self-development concepts to teens because they understand that concept. I love Joseph Campbell's hero's journey. I teach that to the teens and explain that the hero is the person in the story who rises up to change the ending. Nobody else in the story does that – it's the hero.

The sidekick is on the hero's team, which is an important distinction. It's not about being a victim or a villain. A sidekick has the same goals as the hero, unlike an NPC (non-playable character) who's just there in the background.

That's how I felt as a teen. I had goals and things I wanted, but I faced challenges like a stutter and being teased for my appearance. I wanted to be on stage and be the center of attention, but I felt people were laughing at me in a bad way. When you give up and think, "I'll never be able to get that," that's sidekick mode.

It's not inherently bad to think like a sidekick – we all do sometimes. I teach teens how to catch themselves when they're thinking like a sidekick and shift into hero mode. When you think like a hero, you get hero results. A hero result is the result you want.

In Sidekick to Hero, teens start by creating a hero name for themselves. It's their name plus a descriptor, like "Joey the Creator." This helps them channel a new mindset and motivate themselves when needed.

### The Four Hero Arenas [17:37]

The four hero arenas in Sidekick to Hero are:

1. Headspace: What they're thinking
2. Emotions: How they're dealing with their feelings
3. Relationships: How they're dealing with other people
4. Objectives: How they're dealing with their goals (including procrastination)

In the program, these arenas are presented like stages in a video game. Each "stage" has challenges for teens to complete in the real world. When they complete these challenges, they can claim points and coins in the app, which also serves as a journal for self-reflection.

Teens can choose which arena to focus on based on their needs and interests. Some might start with the Objectives arena to learn about entrepreneurship or overcoming procrastination, while others might spend more time in the Emotions arena. It's really like a choose-your-own-adventure experience.

### Balancing Screen Time and Real-World Experiences [21:31]

**Charlie:** You're speaking about the gamification element, which I find really interesting. I want to use that as a lever to explore the idea of balancing screens and the real world. It's usually framed as an either/or situation, and we all know kids (and adults) spend too much time on screens. We want to do better but don't really know how.

One answer could be reframing what we're doing on the computer to be oriented towards getting us out in the real world. It sounds like that's what your experience is doing – creating real-world quests where the computer is a tool, a means to an end. Being in touch with all these teenagers who are really in the thick of it, what do you see as the state of the union on teens and screens? How do you conceive of that problem?

**Joey:** Teens know they spend too much time on screens. They get it. Deep down, they know it's stopping them from reaching their real-life goals. I explain it to them like this: If you play Fortnite for four hours and get to level 95, when you turn it off and look around in your real life, there's been no change, no improvement. It doesn't transfer over, and your real life is not improving.

I love video games, but there's a time and a place for them. Technology is a tool, but we've created this false narrative that if we're not constantly connected, we're missing out. I teach teens the concept of "more and before" – spend more time living your own life before you live somebody else's life in a video game or on YouTube.

### Sidekick to Hero: A Tool for Real-World Growth [24:28]

**Charlie:** You make the point that you don't need a smartphone for this. You can actually get the whole program for less than the cost of a cell phone subscription. I think it's $250 a year or $25 a month, which seems like a perfect fit for any open ed families looking for something to slot into a custom-built curriculum.

What I love about this is that if you're a parent wondering about the right balance between screen time for educational purposes and real-world experiences, you've answered that. The curriculum – or quests, as you call them – take you out of the computer with some structure and frameworks to try things in the real world. It's real support for anyone interested in self-directed learning, providing guidance that might be lacking if a kid is left entirely to their own devices.

### The Anxious Generation and Technology [26:52]

**Charlie:** Have you followed any of the discussion around Jonathan Haidt's new book, "The Anxious Generation"?

**Joey:** No, I haven't read that one, but I've read one of his other books. Can you give me the pamphlet version?

**Charlie:** Sure. Haidt presents data showing a sharp increase in mental health issues, including suicides, coinciding with the advent of smartphones, particularly around 2012 with the introduction of the front-facing camera and the rise of social media platforms. This led to people constantly comparing themselves to others, resulting in different but equally concerning problems for both boys and girls.

Haidt points to various aspects of our technology use that lead to more anxiety. While he doesn't claim to have a silver bullet, he recommends certain societal changes, like establishing a cultural expectation that children don't get their first cell phone until they're 16. He suggests enforcing these norms not through laws, but through culture and convention.

Ultimately, I think it's up to parents and young people themselves to make the decision to break from the pack and take ownership of their lives.

### Empowering Teens to Make Informed Choices [28:29]

**Joey:** That's what I'm hoping to do. I'd love it if all parents followed that counsel – no cell phone until they're 16, no smartphone until they're 18. That's probably what my wife and I are going to do. But I'm hoping to inspire teens and tweens to make that choice for themselves.

I explain to them that platforms like YouTube, Minecraft, and TikTok are designed to hook their attention so other people can make money. When I pitch it to teens that way, saying, "They created their product to hook you specifically, so you waste your life while they make money off your attention," they start to get it.

Yes, it's fun, but not for long, as you mentioned about your college experience with video games. That's why I created really short videos in my program. It's designed so a teen can log in on Monday, watch a four-minute video, complete a challenge over the next day or two, and then come back to report. It's not meant for binging – it's meant for small consumption followed by real-world action. Because when they're doing, that's when they're learning.

### One-Sentence Book Summaries [30:54]

**Charlie:** Let's play a quick improv game called One Sentence Summaries. I'll give you the title of a book you teach, and you give me the pamphlet version in as few words as possible. Ready?

1. Carol Dweck, "Growth Mindset"**Joey:** You do not have to stay stuck.
2. Simon Sinek, "The Infinite Game"**Joey:** Play like the game never ends.
3. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, "Antifragile"**Joey:** When you break, you get stronger.
4. Napoleon Hill, "Own Your Own Mind"**Joey:** Don't let your thoughts control you. You control them.
5. Dave Ramsey, "Total Money Makeover"**Joey:** Stop spending money!

### Closing Thoughts [32:58]

**Charlie:** We've covered a lot of ground in just 30 minutes. For someone considering this program, what's the best place for them to go to learn more?

**Joey:** They can go to [sidekicktohero.com](http://sidekicktohero.com/) or [joemascio.com](http://joemascio.com/). Both will have links to learn more and start a two-week free trial.

**Charlie:** Excellent. We'll make sure our families are aware of this opportunity. Any closing thoughts or words of wisdom, Joey? Are you working on a book of your own?

**Joey:** Yes, one day that will be coming. To any teens listening, or parents who can pass this on to their teens: You can do so much more than you're currently doing. You just have to change your mind about yourself so you can change your story.

**Charlie:** Change your mind, change your story. Joey Mascio, thanks so much.

**Joey:** Hey, thank you very much, Charlie.

I'm doing fantastic, man. It's a beautiful day.

Charlie Deist (00:14.276)  
It looks like it back there and likewise where I am. we're just going to, you know, channel that outdoor weather into our indoor conversation. But there's a lot that I wanted to talk about with you ever since first seeing your booth at the Utah fits all vendor fair back in when was that? think June and you were, you were, were conspicuously absent, but you had some very, very nice help there who were handing out flyers and caught my eye.

Joey (00:34.793)  
I think so, yeah.

Charlie Deist (00:44.004)  
I think there was a little sticker giveaway or something. I grabbed one for my daughter. She loved that. She's maybe not old enough yet for something like Sidekick to Hero. But you know, this is kind of an exciting time to be pursuing what we're calling an open education. It's a little bit broader than the traditional categories of homeschool. know, people are finding that today, you know, whether you're in Utah and you have access to programs like Open Ed,

Utah fits all there's all these opportunities to kind of customize mix and match different curriculums, find what works for your child. And, and so, you know, I want to kind of jump off by giving you a chance to talk a little bit about what you're doing with sidekick to hero, just sort of the structure of the program and how you see it fitting into the broader ecosystem of what's happening in education today.

Joey (01:36.071)  
Yeah, definitely. I was like remiss to not be at that convention. I I do like to be mysterious, right? I maintain, be a man of mystery. But that weekend I was down at the GHC convention in California and...

What I noticed at these conventions is something I noticed when I was a middle school teacher. So I was a middle school teacher for seven years, halfway through my stint as an English and theater teacher. I volunteered to be the teacher in the discipline office, and this was in Southern California. And I realized that in the discipline office, I was running into a lot of teens, both the troubled teens, as you might call them, but also just kind of the more the gen pop, that would make their way in there for various reasons. And one of the things that

was missed, like that was missing from their education was on how to use their brain, right? Like on how their brain is, is affecting them, how our brain sometimes plays us, plays tricks on us and how it does things that get us further away from our goals. And it would get these kids to end up in the discipline office for various reasons.

but it also causes teens and adults everywhere to do things like procrastinate, to self doubt, to do all those things. And it hit me during that time that there is no education, no class, no curriculum really that teaches self development, resilience, anything like that. We find this stuff as adults. We find these books and we love them and we always say the same thing.

Any adult I talk to, they say, I wish I knew this when I was a teen. Right?

Charlie Deist (03:29.092)  
Yep, no, and I think it was actually the little postcard you were giving out that caught my eye with the cover of Deep Work by Cal Newport, Atomic Habits.

by what's it he's got the perfect name for for what he did James clear. Right right. One of those one of those guys who who must have been you know named before his name turned out to be prophetic because his whole thing is about you know you don't lack motivation you lack clarity and and these are things that yeah if I had learned these as a kid it could have saved me so many frustrated hours and you you've got a whole list of books on your website but I'm curious how you break these down you know do you need to

Joey (03:44.022)  
James clear. Yep.

Joey (03:56.191)  
Right?

Charlie Deist (04:10.594)  
do like the Cliff Notes version for teenagers? I mean, I imagine that past a certain age, you can just read the source material directly. But how do you actually approach these sort of the hidden curriculum or the real world skills that are absent in the traditional school model?

Joey (04:29.285)  
yeah, so when teaching concepts from these books, because that's what I do in my curriculum in Sidekick to Hero, I teach them from these books and other self -development gurus. Here's the thing about these books. They are way longer than they need to be.

And like they could really be pamphlets. A lot of these can be pamphlets. Now it's really good to go and like have stories and whatnot, like especially in Atomic Habits, like each chapter starts with a story. cool. And the stories are great, but the concepts are what the teens need at this point. And they need them a lot quicker. And they need them in video format with a lot of humor. And that's what I do. Like my background.

is theater. was the only actor in Disney history, because I was a Disneyland performer for nine years. I was the only actor in Disney history to have played both Darth Maul and the Mad Hatter. So brag.

Charlie Deist (05:29.126)  
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I gotta stop you there. When were you at Disneyland? gotta know, maybe our paths crossed. Maybe I got a photo with you at one point.

Joey (05:39.637)  
Maybe, maybe it was 2002 to 2000, no, was 2001, 2009.

Charlie Deist (05:49.956)  
Wow, so right in the grips of sort phantom menace mania, I have a confession, is that I saw the Star Wars episode one seven times in theaters when it came out. was.

Joey (06:03.039)  
Seven?

Charlie Deist (06:03.926)  
Seven times and I grew up in the area where George Lucas had his studio and he put money out to all the theaters to retrofit their sound systems so that they would have the THX sound experience. And there was one theater in particular that I lived right by that where you really kind of decked it out. And so there was so much energy. I felt like I was at kind of the hub of that. And that was also around the time that I was going to Disneyland. So who knows, maybe our paths crossed.

Joey (06:16.532)  
Right.

Joey (06:32.257)  
I gotta ask you, Charlie, when you went to the movie, any of those seven times, did you have the Anakin braid?

Charlie Deist (06:38.436)  
No, I did not. didn't never never grew out my hair. It never had the rat tail, but maybe it's not too late.

Joey (06:43.053)  
Ha ha.

Not too late, man, not too late. So yeah, so with my background as an actor, I'm a professional improv comedian. I've been doing that for over 20 years. So I make short videos that are fun and engaging and that teach teens these important skills. And they're simple really when...

Charlie Deist (06:47.533)  
So yeah.

Joey (07:06.001)  
it comes down to it. Like I literally just got off the phone with my wife. She's coming back from our homeschool co -op that she takes the kids to. And we give everybody in the homeschool co -op just free access to Sidekick to Hero. And a new mom this year just told my wife and she was like, I noticed a difference after the first two videos my kids watched. Like there's a big difference in their attitude and their kind of confidence. And I'm like, yeah, cause it doesn't take much.

to introduce something like use, I use humor to open up their brain. And then I put in a new way of thinking that we all should be thinking, you know, cause like kids, they're, they're programmed to just think negatively. And it's a protective mechanism that our brain does. It's one of those things our brain does try to protect us from harm, but it's often doing it unnecessarily. And so if you just introduce some of these concepts,

in a way where the kids are like, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I use humor and stories and metaphors. They go, well I don't have to think that way anymore. That's great. I don't have to believe maybe what other people say about me or I don't have to believe that me looking different is bad. Me looking different could be awesome. I never considered that before. And then they start experiencing this change.

Charlie Deist (08:28.954)  
Right, right.

You know, I think you mentioned you don't need to read the whole books in most cases. I was writing about atomic habits before I'd ever read the whole book. I don't even know if I've still read the whole book. but, but I've written about it extensively because the concepts, once you hear them, they click in this way that, know, you start seeing the world through that light and you can never go back to seeing it the old way. And, know, you can kind of have in my mind, the mental models from, from James clear the sort of, you know, incremental change, stacking habits.

So you go from one to another, replacing a previous pattern or behavior with some kind of a new behavior. And I'm realizing that one of the reasons that it clicked is because it's sort of a rehash of a lot of the older literature that's been out there in cognitive behavioral therapy.

And you use that term on your website. I've been a big fan of that for a long time because I had some issues with intrusive thoughts, negative thoughts, things that would come about. talk about CBT a little bit for those who might not be familiar with that term.

Joey (09:31.338)  
Mm

Yeah, yeah, I love it. CBT, cognitive behavioral therapy says what we think affects our behavior. Now our behavior can be things like how we react outwardly, how we react inwardly, so our actions and our feelings, right? That's the behavior that we have. And so CBT says the solution to almost any problem is to identify the thought that's causing you to feel.

and take actions that's getting you results that you don't want. So I have my masters in education. I took a couple of classes that dabbled in it, but it was when I was in that middle school discipline office, I decided to go get certified. I became a certified life coach through the life coach school with Brooke Castillo. And she teaches what she calls the model, which is just her version of the cognitive behavioral therapy.

And that was like way more rigorous and just as expensive as my master's program. But I learned so much. And the biggest thing I learned was my way of thinking my whole life was right. Because when I was a kid, I would, you know, I was bullied in middle school. Kids called me moon head because the shape of my head and I have a pointy chin and a large head. So they call me moon head because of the McDonald's commercial with the guy with the, mean, here, I'll show you him.

I keep them here because I show this to teens when I coach them. But do you remember this commercial with Mac tonight?

Charlie Deist (11:04.546)  
I I do, yeah. That's a throwback.

Joey (11:06.387)  
Yeah, yeah, those listening, go Google Mac tonight McDonald's, right? And so they saw similarity and they said, he's moon head. So I like that made me sick whenever I'd see them for weeks, they'd be bullying me. And I really like I was shaken. My confidence was shaken. And then one day I had just decided I go into the full story in the program, but one day I just decided, I mean, you know what? Yeah, I do have a big head and I'm still freaking awesome. And

I thought I was just cheating the system. thought, well, you know, I'll just, I'm supposed to think I have a big head, I'm a weirdo and nobody's ever gonna like me, but you know what? I'm just gonna cheat. I'm just gonna cheat. And I'm just gonna say instead that I'm really awesome. And that worked. And I thought I was faking it till I was making it kind of a deal. But what I was doing is I was just coaching myself. I was rewriting my unhelpful thoughts that were not getting me the results that I wanted. And...

I was able to do that and teens are able to do this, but they don't know they can A, they don't know they can and B, they're not aware of the difference between the facts around them and their stories or their thoughts about those facts. They would think that, well, I'm weird looking and nobody's gonna like me is just a fact. Kids throw around the word fact all the time. yeah, hashtag facts. And in zero situations, is it actually a fact?

what they're talking about, right? It's just an opinion that they really love. So they go, fucks, and they don't know how to separate their opinions of themselves, other people's opinions of themselves, separate that into a different category and go, this is rewritable. I can rewrite the way I think about myself. And that's a skill that should be taught to every single adolescent. Every single teen should know how to do that.

if they wanna be successful because the three Rs are great, right? Reading, writing, arithmetic, that's great. But if you don't have the skills to build self -confidence, to push forward after failure, then you won't be able to use your great book smarts when you're out there in the real world because you'll just be stopping yourself with all these unhelpful sidekick thoughts, which is what I call them.

Charlie Deist (13:26.374)  
you

That's awesome. mean, the, the hidden curriculum I mentioned earlier is, a term that we've been throwing around for the sort of, you know, the practical real world skills, but, but you break it down into the four arenas and it just clicked that the acronym headspace, emotions, relationships, objectives add up to hero. the name sort of, you know, says it all sidekick to hero, but, people might know, know, the hero's journey. how do you conceive of that progression for.

I'm gonna impute or what you're saying there is that you know, we can consider ourselves sort of a sidekick in life or we can be kind of the main character of our story we can or something to that effect and that that's another one of these kind of reframes but Correct me where I might be getting getting off base or getting ahead of myself and then talk through some of these four arenas and what each one represents as a as a skill set

Joey (14:10.536)  
Mm.

Hmm.

Joey (14:24.844)  
Yeah, of course. Like, Sidekick to Hero is my way of teaching CBT and other self -development to...

teens because they kind of get that concept. So I love Joseph Campbell's the hero's journey. I teach that to the teens and I say the hero is the person in the story who rises up to change the ending. Nobody else in the story does. It's the hero that does it. Harry Potter rises up right to change the end of the story. Luke Skywalker rises up right to change the end of the story. Katniss Everdeen rises up to change the end of the story. The sidekick doesn't. Now

The sidekick is on the hero's team. And this is a very important distinction. It's not victim. I'm not talking about villains. I'm not talking about any of that. Like you have to recognize your teen is acting like a sidekick because a sidekick has the goals of the hero. All right. The victim often does it in NPC, the non -playable character.

There's just a person walking down the street in the movie in Jurassic Park and a dinosaur eats them, right? We know nothing about them. They don't have the same goals as the hero does, but the sidekick does. And that's how I felt when I was a teen. I felt like I had all these goals and these things that I wanted. I wanted to do all these awesome things, but I had a stutter. I looked weird. I was pasty white skin, so I was called Casper, you know, but I wanted to be on stage. I wanted to be the center of attention.

and I wanted to be known in that way for being funny, but I felt people were laughing at me in a bad way. And so I was like, man, it's just, I want that, but I can't get it. And when you give up and go, well, I'll never be able to get that, that's sidekick mode. That's when you're thinking like a sidekick. Now it's not bad to think like a sidekick. We all think like a sidekick. I was thinking like a sidekick earlier today, right? It's something that we have to be aware of. And I teach teens how to catch themselves.

Joey (16:22.793)  
when they're thinking like a sidekick and go, wait a minute, I don't have to be thinking this way. Let me kick myself into hero mode and think like a hero. And when you think like a hero, you're gonna get hero results. And a hero result is the result that you want. And so that's my approach when I pitch it to teens. That's the whole framing.

Right? The scaffolding, everything I teach kind of lives in. When the teens sign up for Sidekick to Hero, the first thing they do is they come up with a hero name. There's onboarding videos. They have to come up with this hero name that they can identify with. It's their name, the blank. So I'm Joey the Creator. You know, and whenever I want to motivate myself or get out of a slump, I go, you know what? What would Joey the Creator think right now? And I can instantly channel a new mindset and get to work.

on doing the things that I need to do. So first off, is that clear before I move on to the arenas?

Joey (17:25.329)  
Awesome. I can't hear you. I don't know what happened. I don't know if that's okay.

Charlie Deist (17:29.286)  
Sorry, that's me. I was muted. Perfect. I was just going to ask you what your creator name was, but you beat me to the punch. So continue with those four arenas.

Joey (17:37.533)  
Yes, yes. So in Sidekick to Hero, I realized after coaching teens for five years, I was like, you know what? I say a lot of the same things over and over and over again. Every teen problem fits into four categories. And I call these the hero arenas. And it's headspace is what they're thinking. Emotions, how they're dealing with their feelings.

relationships, which is how they're dealing with other people, and objectives, which is how they're dealing with their goals. That's the procrastination one, right? And so in Sidekick to Hero, the videos are separated into these hero arenas. I try not to use any educational terms in Sidekick to Hero. I don't use courses, I don't use lessons.

I say play through the four hero arenas in any order you want to. Each arena has a bunch of stages for you to complete. Like Mario, back in the day, Super Mario, had the stages, know, stage one, you know, whatever, and you would complete that. And so, and each video in the stage, right, what we would call the lesson, but don't tell the teens that, but each lesson has a challenge that is extended to them, kind of like a quest.

for them to go complete in the real world. Because Sidekick to Hero is a game, but they don't play it in Sidekick to Hero, they play it in the real world. And when they go out into the real world and they start three new conversations, or they start the habit of making their bed, or they get mad at their brother and sister, but don't yell at them, right? Whatever their challenge is, then they can come back to the game and...

claim those coins and points that go with it and then do a little self -reflection in the app and it kind of keeps that for them as a journal because I think that's important that kind of self -reflection and so they get to pick some teams come in and they'll just start with just the objectives arena you know and they'll just want to double down on that because they want to learn about being an entrepreneur or they want to learn about you know stop stopping procrastination and things like that.

Joey (19:56.955)  
Others will spend a lot of time in the emotions. And so it's really like a choose your own adventure.

Charlie Deist (20:02.138)  
Yeah, so you're speaking about the sort of gamification element, which I find really interesting and I want to use that as a lever to play with this idea a little bit of

you know, we hear a lot about the balance between screens and the real world, and it's usually framed as sort of an either or, and everybody knows kids spend too much time on screens. Everyone knows that adults spend too much time on our cell phones. We all know it's a problem. We all want to do better and we don't really know how to do it. I think the one answer could be, this is where I want to get your opinion. You know,

Are there ways that we can again, reframe what we're doing on the computer to be oriented towards getting us out in the real world? It sounds like that's what, your experience is doing. It's you're creating the real world quest and the computer is a tool. It's a means to the end. I actually have a sticker that I keep on my monitor that says, finish your work and go outside. cause it's just, I need that reminder. Otherwise I'll forget that, you know, the virtual world here we're talking, but this is sort of meant to be a bridge to

get people to think differently about their life and life is still lived in the real world. I want to ask, you know, being in touch with with all these teenagers who are really in the thick of it. What do you see as like the what's the state of the union on teens and screens like and how do you conceive of that problem?

Joey (21:31.925)  
yeah, teens know it, man. They, just like you said, we all know it for ourselves. Teens know it. They know they spend too much time on screens. They get it. And deep down, they know it's stopping them from reaching their real life goals. Because the way I pitch it to my teens are, I'm like, guys, if you play Fortnite for four hours, right, and you get to level 95, yes, when you turn it off, you look around in your real life.

and there's been no change, no improvement. It doesn't transfer over and your real life is not improving. Guys, get that concept. That's nuts. That's nuts that we spend so much time trying to up -level a fictional character in a fake world and then we turn it off and we're experiencing all this kind of like depression and lethargy and all this stuff. It's not a surprise that we do that. And I get it. Like I love video games.

but there's a time and a place for it. And I love the word you used. You said, technology is a tool. I did this reel. It was one of my favorite reels I've done, right, for my Instagram account where I have a hammer and I'm going through regular life and I'm hammering. So I'm brushing my teeth and I'm hammering. I'm trying to sleep and I'm just hammering, but I can't sleep because I'm hammering. I'm eating cereal, it's going everywhere because I'm hammering. And I'm like, a phone is a tool to use and it would be

silly of us to use a tool all the time. But phones are designed to do that. And we've created this false narrative that, if I don't have it, if I'm not on there, if I'm not doing it, then I'm not keeping up with the Joneses or my friends. I'm gonna miss out on things. But technology is a tool to help us live our life better. And a video game is totally a tool and it has its place. But I teach teens the concept

of more and before. So I want you to live your own life more and before you live somebody else's life in a video game or on YouTube or something like that. So you spend more time, whether it's homework or goals, working out, starting a business, whatever it is, interacting with family, more time before you turn on Minecraft and log in an hour. Right? So, cause most often it's viewed the other way around. Let me just get my stuff done real fast.

Joey (23:59.113)  
so I can get my four hours of video games in a day. But I'm like, no, spend more time living your own life before you kind of relax, use that tool to relax at the end of a hard day's work.

Charlie Deist (24:14.307)  
Right and you make the point that you know, don't need a smartphone for this You can actually get the whole program for less than the cost of a cell phone subscription I think it's a two hundred dollars a year or twenty dollars a month which which I'll mention or it

Joey (24:28.5)  
Yeah.

The price just went up at beginning of September, so it's $25 a month now or $250 a year.

Charlie Deist (24:38.425)  
Well, hey, it's perfect fit for any open ed families that are looking for something to slot into a custom built period. It would be right, right in line with that. And, and what I love about this, you know, if you are a parent and you're wondering what's the right balance between, know, I'm already doing Khan Academy for math. So my kids already on the computer for that. And we're doing, you know, they're watching, you know, if you've got a virtual curriculum and all these areas, you know, you might be thinking, do I want to add in another?

Virtual program, but I think you've answered that that the curriculum take and you don't use that term but you use it, you know the quests take you out of the computer with some structure with some some frameworks to to try things in the real world. So it's a it's a real support for anyone. We use these buzzwords like self -directed learning, but you know, it's not a guarantee that a kid left to their own devices is going to

Pick a quest and commit to it. They could just you know, twiddle their thumbs and granted when I was a kid I did spend a lot of there was a lot of wasted time. I like to think that maybe some of those video games Gave me something but but I think that that's a pretty elaborate

rationalization, know, Tony Hawk Pro Skater gave me that feeling of being the hero but without and you know, I actually had an epiphany was my freshman year of college and I brought my N64 or whatever the console was to my dorm and my first semester I played copious video games was just streaming TV shows and I felt emptier than I'd ever felt in my entire life. My grades were mediocre. You know, my social life was okay, but it was just I could feel

Joey (26:15.498)  
Yep.

Charlie Deist (26:21.148)  
life sort of slipping between my fingertips. and I had kind of a, know, to be, to be honest, I think, this is a relatable for a lot of young people today. I had the, the mental health crisis and, it wasn't until I found that, you know, there was a life to live out there and, I needed to, you know, level up. and then I found CBT and some of these other tools, but, I, I'm curious, have you followed any of the discussion around Jonathan Heights new book, the anxious

generation.

Joey (26:52.985)  
Ooh, no. I've heard of that. I've read one of his other books. I actually forget the name of it right now, but give me the pamphlet version.

Charlie Deist (27:03.397)  
Sure, right. That's really, you know, I was listening to the audiobook on a drive recently, but I would sum it up as he ushers the data showing the sharp

Increase in mental health issues including, you know, tragically suicides when you have the advent of Not just smartphones, but specifically in 2012 you had the advent of the front -facing camera and all of these social media platforms where people are suddenly comparing themselves to other people and any kind of it's different problems by and large for for For for boys and girls, but it's the same same thing where you do see a very sudden spike

And so he points to all the things embedded in our use of technology that lead to more anxiety. And it's kind of a depressing message. he doesn't claim to have a silver bullet. He recommends certain things like rituals that we could bring back as a society where the societal expectation is that you don't get your first cell phone until you're 16. And enforce those things not through the law, but just through culture and

and kind of convention. I think that it's really up to parents and really ultimately young people themselves to make that decision to break from the pack and take ownership over your life.

Joey (28:29.589)  
Yeah, that's what I'm hoping to do. Like I would love it if all parents followed that counsel. No cell phone till they're 16, no smartphone till they're 18. Like that's what me and my wife are probably gonna do is something along those lines. But I'm hoping to inspire the teens and the tweens to go, you know what? Like I don't even wanna dabble in that because I recognize that it's built to...

latch onto my brain so other people can make money. And when I pitch it to teens that way, I'm like, look, YouTube, Minecraft, like TikTok, they're playing you for a fool, dude. They created their product in such a way to hook you specifically, so you waste your life while they make money off of your attention.

And I'm like, that's, yeah, it's fun, but that's all that is for you and not for long. As you said, like when you were doing the copious amounts of all of that, it's not fun for long. So for, yeah, for me, like my program is virtual cause it's the only way to really do a program like this and scale it and get it out there to all the teens. But that's why I created really short videos. Like it's designed like in a way where a teen can log in on Monday, watch a four minute video.

right, in one of the stages that they're on. And it says, the challenge might be, all right, take the next day or two to think about this or do this and then come back and report. And then on Wednesday, they can come back and they can do a little report and they can jump over and listen to my podcast episode that I put up on there, you know, and they get points for that too in the game, you know, and like if they're coming in, they're just checking in. It's not meant for binging. It's meant for small consumption and then go out and do because.

When they're doing, that's when they're learning.

Charlie Deist (30:26.278)  
Alright, now I didn't prep you on this, but I know that you are an improv actor and so I'm thinking we're gonna try little improv game here. The game is called One Sentence Summaries and I've got the list of books that you teach, but I'm gonna put you on the spot and have you give us, I'm gonna say a title of a book and in as few words as possible, you're gonna try to sum up the pamphlet version of that book, okay?

Joey (30:33.949)  
All right.

Joey (30:52.209)  
Okay, alright, this is gonna be fun.

Charlie Deist (30:54.775)  
All right, let's start with Stephen Covey. Well, you know, let's do a different one just because that one's seven habits of a highly effective people. That might be hard to put it. Let's go. Carol Dweck, Growth Mindset.

Joey (31:07.743)  
All right.

Joey (31:13.843)  
you do not have to stay stuck.

Charlie Deist (31:17.349)  
Beautiful. Simon Sinek, The Infinite Game.

Joey (31:24.051)  
That's redundant. Hold on, give me a second.

Joey (31:29.237)  
Play like the game never ends.

Charlie Deist (31:32.474)  
Alright, here's a tough one. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, anti -fragile.

Joey (31:38.301)  
Love this book.

Charlie Deist (31:42.147)  
You can't just use the subtitle.

Joey (31:43.787)  
Yeah, I know, I know, I'm trying not to. So, okay, when you break, you get stronger.

Charlie Deist (31:53.731)  
Love it, love it. One more, let's do two more. Napoleon Hill, Own Your Own Mind.

Joey (32:09.545)  
Don't let your thoughts control you. You control them.

Charlie Deist (32:14.807)  
And the last one is going to be a crowd pleaser. Dave Ramsey, Total Money Makeover. What's the Cliff Notes version? Okay, perfect.

Joey (32:20.245)  
Stop spending money!

Joey (32:25.609)  
There you go, that's it.

Charlie Deist (32:28.518)  
Awesome. Wow. Well, man, we've covered a lot of ground. It's hard to believe this is only been a 30 minutes. It feels like we've done a whole semester's worth of material. But just to kind of start to wrap things up, I do want to give some sort of practical.

Joey (32:58.793)  
Yeah, sidekicktohero .com or joemascio .com. Both will have the links to learn more about it and start a two week free trial.

Charlie Deist (33:07.745)  
Awesome. yeah, we'll make sure that that our families are aware of the opportunity here and and and Joey any any closing thoughts or words of wisdom you working on on a book of your own or anything like that.

Joey (33:19.549)  
Yeah, yes, one day that will be coming. Teens, if you are listening to this, or parents, you can tell your teens this. They can do so much more than they're currently doing. They just have to change their mind about themself so they can change their story.

Charlie Deist (33:44.943)  
Change your mind, change your story. Joey Mascio, thanks so much.

Joey (33:48.871)
