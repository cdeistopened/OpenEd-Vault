**Podcast Intro & Transition Outline**

---

### **Welcome (1–2 sentences)**

“Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast, I’m Charlie Deist, sometimes known as the OpenEd newsletter guy, coming out from the shadows, away from my usual office and screen into the sun for a concersation with a very special guest, Anjan Katta, who is the founder of Daylight Computer - probably my favorite

Anjan, welcome to the podcast.

  

So Anjin, before we get into the actual product, I want to start with your story.

There’s a WIRED article about the Daylight that talks about DAylight returning computing to its hippie ideals. It’s one of the interesting facts about silicon valley that a lot of the giants had this powerful combination of a technical background, but also this sort of freewheeling creativity.

Our audience of this podcast is mostly parents not technologists, and I think they’ll want to hear more about your relationship to learning and education, and how that ultimately led you to create this beautiful piece of technology.

  

  

  

So full disclosure, I was an early adopter of the Daylight. I think I got in on the first or second round… And my basic expectation was that it would be like a bigger kindle, maybe a bit faster, better internet, more of the apps that I’m already using. And it’s all of those things.

But where I think it’s surprised me is not just how much faster and more responsive it is, but how it could actually replace 90% of what I do on my laptop and desktop.

I’m not there yet.. large I think because of habit. It’s become a habit to just sit down at my desk with a mouse and keyboard…

  

But since I’ve started using transript as my main form of typing, I’m realizing that if I can build up that muscle memory, I can make this shift.

  

Today we’re diving into the future of education and technology with Anjan Katta, founder of Daylight Computer.”

(Guest responds: _“Thanks for having me.”_)

---

### **Transition Monologue (3–4 paragraphs)**

“There’s a clip I want to share before we get into it. Joe Liemandt, principal of Alpha School, talks about a future where for under $1,000, a kid could have a tablet that gives them access to all the world’s knowledge. That line really stuck with me. Because the truth is—that tablet already exists. It’s called the Daylight Computer. And the bigger point is, the tools are already out there. What’s missing isn’t the hardware, it’s knowing how to combine the right pieces together. That’s what we try to do at OpenEd: bring together the best resources, tools, and practices into a coherent experience for families.

I’ve often said I wouldn’t hand my kids an iPad as a learning device. And that’s not just a personal quirk—there’s research showing how traditional backlit screens can dysregulate kids’ nervous systems, disrupting sleep, attention, and even long-term eye health. Myopia rates, for example, have skyrocketed in countries where kids spend most of their time studying on screens indoors. The Daylight team talks about this as ‘evolutionary mismatch’—our biology simply isn’t built for constant flickering blue light and dopamine-spiking apps.

So the deeper question isn’t just: ‘Can we put all the world’s knowledge into a kid’s hands?’ It’s: ‘Can we do it in a way that respects their physiology, their psychology, and their need to grow up wise?’ That’s the piece I think we’re all grappling with. Technology is a double-edged sword—it can empower or it can erode—and the challenge is to design and combine it with enough wisdom that the benefits outweigh the costs.

That’s why I think this conversation with you, Anjan, is so powerful. Daylight is an attempt to realign technology with health, attention, and human flourishing. I want to play you this clip from Joe and then hear your thoughts on how Daylight fits into that vision.”

  

  

  

Got it — let’s drop the canvas and go back to your **original notes**, but cleaned up and organized into a **logical flow** you can use while prepping. I’ll keep your voice in it, with short transitions so you can riff naturally.

## **Podcast Notes (Organized)**

### **1. Welcome**

- Keep it short: _“Welcome back to the show. Today we’re talking about the future of education and technology with Anjan Katta, founder of Daylight Computer.”_
- Then let Anjan say: _“Thanks for having me.”_

---

### **2. Opening Monologue / Setup for First Question**

- Transition into:
    - Joe Liemandt (Alpha School) clip — idea of a sub-$1,000 tablet giving kids access to all the world’s knowledge.
    - Comment: _“That future is already here. It’s called the Daylight Computer. The tools exist. What’s missing is how we combine them into a humane, effective learning environment. That’s what OpenEd tries to do.”_
- Your perspective:
    - _“I wouldn’t give my kids an iPad as a learning device. With the iPad, my daughter gets right up in it. The behavior it encourages is dysregulated.”_
    - Contrast: Daylight’s design is more humane—like a Kindle but much faster, distraction-free, sunlight-readable.

---

### **3. Framing the False Dichotomy**

- “There’s this false contrast people set up: textbooks vs. Chromebooks, AI/adaptive apps vs. pen and paper.”
- “Daylight offers something in-between—technology that’s fast, capable, but not overstimulating.”

---

### **4. Screens, Kids, and Regulation**

- The ‘zombie kid’ stereotype is wrong — kids on iPads aren’t stupefied, they’re overstimulated.
- When you take it away, tantrums happen because they haven’t learned regulation.
- Research tie-in:
    - Backlit flickering screens overstimulate dopamine systems.
    - Blue light disrupts circadian rhythm, sleep, attention.
    - Myopia rates in Asia skyrocketed with early, screen-heavy education.

---

### **5. Screen Technology & Surfaces**

- Why Daylight matters:
    - Flicker-free, sunlight-readable, no harmful blue light.
    - Feels like paper, not like glassy pixels.
    - Hardware alone solves part of the problem before even touching software.
- Quote from Anjan: _“Technology is at its best when it’s invisible.”_
- Frame: computing as medium → not immersive VR that makes you nauseous, but subtle surfaces that blend into learning environments.

---

### **6. Broader Vision**

- “People say Apple has exhausted the features of the pocket computer. Thinner, shinier—but not making our lives better.”
- Future of Daylight:
    - Beyond tablets → interactive classroom surfaces, distraction-free workstations, humane computing platforms.

  

  

For kids or teens who have an inkling of an idea, but dont know where to start…

  

Steve Jobs coming back to the pocket computer… touch screens had made it more doable… maybe the 3g network…

  

How do you start prototyping…

  

How do you get funding?

  

  

- Wisdom needed:
    - Tech is a double-edged sword. We have “paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, and godlike technology” (E.O. Wilson quote).
    - Without wisdom, tech harms kids. With wisdom, it empowers.

---

### **7. First Question Launch**

After the setup monologue + Joe Liemandt clip:

- _“Anjan, I want to get your take. Do you see Daylight as the realization of this vision—that all the world’s knowledge can fit in a kid’s hands—but in a way that doesn’t compromise their health and attention?”_

---

Would you like me to also **insert the ADHD thread** right after the “Screens, Kids, and Regulation” section, so it ties into Anjan’s personal experience with distraction and overstimulation? That could make for a natural pivot into his backstory.

## Rough Transcript

# Anjan Katta

**Charlie Deist:** Welcome back to the Open Ed Podcast. I'm Charlie Deed, sometimes known as the open ed newsletter guy coming out from the shadows, away from my usual indoor desk, into the sunlight for a conversation with Angen Kata, founder of Daylight Computer. Probably my favorite piece of hardware, maybe my favorite piece of technology.

Uh, Andre, welcome to the podcast.

**Anjan:** Thanks for having me on Charlie. It's, uh, delightful to be here.

**Charlie Deist:** I wanna start with your story. There's a wired article the title is something about how, daylight, is returning computing to its hippie ideals.

And it's one of these interesting facts about Silicon Valley that a lot of the giants, you know, you think of Steve Jobs, Stewart Brand or a lot of the people that were around in the, the early days of Silicon Valley, they had this combination of a technical background but also this very sort of freewheeling creativity.

**Anjan:** Right. Yeah. A lot of people don't know this, but. The sort of essence of computing. The early pioneers who were behind it, they were all hippies. Like the core big idea they had was the human potential movement is we as humans could be and do so much more and feel. Then what society conditions us to be.

And the idea for computers is they are our friends, our sidekicks, our exoskeleton to help us be the best versions of ourself. And so there's a funny way that, that, that is the core idea of computing and what computing has become. Since then is totally different and totally the opposite of that. Uh, instead of an expansion of who you are, it's uh, it's ASO disassociation.

Right. It's a, it's a mechanization. It's, it's, it's take, it's a dehumanization. It's taking away. So many aspects of our human and just, it's all about the mind. It's all about the mind. It's all about the mind. It's all about productivity, about efficiency. And frankly, you don't even get that, how distracting it is.

So I think that sort of mirrors my own life and what, what led me to Daylight, which is I think ever since I'm a kid, I've just been a very sensitive person. Um. You know, a DHD, uh, stimuli, novelty, uh, always fidgeting, running around really hyper, uh, and very susceptible to lights. Uh, I have seasonal effective disorder, so I'm sensitive to light.

I, I, I need to be outside if I'm stuck inside all the time. And. I think I was sensitive to the seasons and that's where, you know, seasonal effect disorder really comes to be. Um, my sleep was sensitive, so blue light always would just keep me up like it would definitely affect everybody around me, but for me it really would overstimulate my nervous system to regulate me and keep me up at night.

And so. I think I sort of just shut down all my body and all my sensitivity 'cause life was just too overstimulating, the sort of artificialness of reality and found my home in books. My dad's a psychiatrist, so our house was covered in all sorts of crazy books, you know, so reality is one way, but here's the deep truth of it.

And, whether that's for food or for economics. And so I think I just ended up spending a lot of my life from here. And I grew up in a small town. There wasn't that much to do. Books became my way. And so starting from that place of like learning and being in my head. And being analytical and always accumulating knowledge.

I think that just took me to computers where computers were another way to get really smart and be in my head and do more. I found you could find books online for free and articles and Wikipedia, and so, um, the books around me were never as limitless as what I could find online. And I just like tried to consume as much information as possible. And so I would read and read and read for hours and my eyes were sensitive, so at a certain point, um, they thought I had glaucoma, but it was actually just such extreme eye strain from being on computers.

And so I think the story was, I was just going more and more into my head more and more into consuming into information. Um, trying to get smarter. Trying to get smarter and. I think that is actually a reflection of what computers are and what computers try to be, which is, they're just about, they're completely heady.

They're com, they're totally disembody you, and their promise is like, Hey, you're gonna be very way smarter. Hey, you're gonna be able to think better thoughts. And I think the thing I faced in my personal life is, oh my God, like, this is fraudulent in the sense like I'm reading more, I'm trying to get smarter.

But I'm so dysregulated. My circadian rhythms are so toast. I'm so disembodied. I don't remember what I'm reading the next day. I don't even know what I learned. I'm not able to articulate it 'cause my brain and nervous system is frazzled. And so I learned, I'm basically just pretending. Because when you so fetishize the mind and getting smarter and learning and you don't take care of all of your being, it's sort of fake.

And so I think seeing that in my own life and facing it and the grief of you're not actually getting smarter here, you're not actually learning as much as you are, made me realize there is no real learning thinking, true contemplation, um, through true expansion. Of yourself if you don't take care of the entire stack of your being, um, your mind, body and spirit, your nervous system.

And so the point of daylight was like, oh wow, okay. This has hit me as a key wisdom of my life. How do we now refactor computers to now reflect this as well?

**Charlie Deist:** I heard recently someone describe the internet as like, the library of Alexandria times 10 or times a hundred, but the limiting. Factor on what allows us to absorb it is, is not the amount of information or even the interface that we use to interact with it. It's literally the screen.

And I've had that experience too. Uh, I was on screens a lot growing up, you know, video games, computers. I remember the first, uh. Uh, Macintosh. That was the one with kind of the swivels, the screen on the swivel. And I, I'm sure I was just glued to that thing for hours and my eyesight started to deteriorate.

Around my sophomore year of high school, I started to have to strain to be able to see the whiteboard in the classroom. And ev for the next maybe 10 years, my eyesight just kept getting worse and worse. That myopia, progressive, uh, deterioration, it's also, I think, mirrored in what you're describing with the, the hyper compression into this headspace. There there was a term, uh, Marshall McLuhan used to describe modernity.

It's talking about like the hypertrophy of the eye,

**Anjan:** mm

**Charlie Deist:** have literally where your eye muscles get locked. Locked in on, on closeup, and that's basically what nearsightedness is. But we also have it at kind of a mental level where like we, we. Abstract ourselves into the machine almost. You use the term dysregulate, what in your research is the connection between the screens that we use and some of those underlying symptoms?

**Anjan:** Right. My first impression was like, oh, it's just these algorithms. They're so addicting. It's the fact that you can open 300 tabs and you get 20 links. Uh, it it, it's only the software that's the problem. . To be totally frank, even upstream of that, I thought the problem was myself. I don't have enough willpower, I don't have enough discipline.

I'm not good enough. And so once I got over, beating myself up, which I think is a very honest experience with computers today, is you blame yourself for not being good enough 'cause of the way you used it. And then you sort of realize, wait a minute, the software here is a huge perpetrator. These things are diabolically designed.

To be as addicting as possible. That is dramatically different than early computers. That's even dramatically different than computers 20 years ago. But the next layer that really opened me up, and that's where daylight comes from. That energy of, oh my God, this is where we have to start, is I didn't quite appreciate how much this screen, the light of a computer, the appearance of a computer.

Actually deeply plays a role in the way it's dysregulating. And what I learned is the blue light number one from computers, this thing called flicker, uh, which I could explain in a second from computers. , It's sort of, it's brightness mismatch, the rest of the environment. That's number third. And number four is the oversaturated colors in high contrast that a computer has all go together.

, And number five would be, you know, it keeps us indoors. All five of these really contribute to dysregulating you at a vagal and nervous system level, , at a breathing and tidal volume level, , at blink rates.

And to your point, the associated mood tone, cognitive tone, because that comes from, like you're saying, the hypertrophy of the eyes, , your dopamine system, your melatonin and circadian system, and all the metabolic processes that come out of that. , That's a lot, but it, it's a fancy way of saying basically your body gets put on high alert, high arousal, high stimulation when you're on a computer.

And so some simple ways to describe what this is is. Because of the combination of all these things. Um, the simplest tagline to describe it would be basically your computer is trying its best job to simulate a Vegas casino in terms of its light environment. You know, the Vegas casino blocks out all the natural light.

They have incredibly bright lights. It's a ton of blue light. Um, it's all flashing and flickering, and it's all extremely oversaturated. They do that 'cause they have figured out to a science, this is how you put this human in their nervous system and physiological state to be most susceptible to getting stuck into these dopamine loops.

Most stuck into these consumptive stimming loops. And so that's essentially in a smaller way what our computer is doing to us. Um. And just one small example that I find so illustrative is when we feel more tense, when we use a computer, one of the reasons why is there's a phenomena called screen apnea.

, And so there is sleep apnea. That's the common one, which is while you sleep, you don't breathe. Um, and there's a whole host of problems in your life that comes from that. Well, some researchers realized there is sort of the equivalent of that for screens and they call it screen apnea. And basically because you have sympathetic overregulation and not enough parasympathetic, um, and this sort of, .

Deer in the headlights response you get with the light of a computer. Um, you actually, when you're on a computer, the screen apnea phenomenon is one. You breathe less. You literally take less breaths per minute. And number two, your tidal volume is less, meaning you actually breathe shallower. And the combination of these two is you're dysregulated.

Um, you're a bit more anxious. So I could go on, but there's a litany of ways that computers physiologically actually put us in a place that then makes us dysregulated for the rest of our day, but also then more susceptible to the dopamine slot machines that are the YouTubes and tiktoks and the feeds.

And so it's a vicious cycle that builds on top of each other. And so I was like, we have to start with light. You know that same Vegas casino slot machine? On the side of a beautiful river, you're in Northern California, the, the Yuba River or something. It, it's not as addicting. There is something about the design of the entire light environment that plays a role.

And so that's sort of why we wanted to reinvent the screen of a computer to, to really get at the heart of the way the computer uses light to affect us.

**Charlie Deist:** Well, I'm just gonna briefly just show this is my daylight. I was an early adopter, so I think I got in, maybe in the, the second or third round that, that you guys were shipping these. And I was super excited to get my hands on one, and it was one of these things where the, the ad, and maybe I'll show a clip of the ad,

First of all, you can just see this for the people watching. . It's like a Kindle. It's just like a Kindle, but it's perfectly responsive. It's, it's fast. Uh, and so I think, you know, one way to look at it is basically like a faster, more responsive Kindle. Uh, but another way is really like it's a replacement for your laptop or your desktop.

Um, I could have a whole separate conversation about the combination of the new dictation tools to totally kind of change the way that, that, uh, we interact with computers. Less of this, you know, hunched over. Typing locked in, in a more expansive state where you're, maybe you're using the stylus a little bit and you're speaking and you're interacting in it with, with a much more kind of de, a little bit detached.

Maybe even. It's, it's putting it back in its place as a, a tool rather than a machine. But I think I see a lot of debate about the classroom and, and same thing for homeschoolers doing sort of like distance learning or virtual learning. There's this debate about like Chromebook versus textbook or, adaptive apps versus pen and paper.

Which one is better for, for kids learning and kids cognition. And I think that there's sort of a false dichotomy there. Like we, we can have now, uh, because of the E ink technology. What was the technological, breakthrough that, that allowed this and how did you come to understand E Inc as being such a, break from traditional screens?

**Anjan:** Right. So I sort of had this notion like, how do we rethink a computer to be healthy, physically healthy, mental, mentally healthy, and then hopefully intellectually healthy? And so. I was like looking around, how do I change light? Um, you know, over time I don't wanna change ergonomics. I'd wanna change EMFs, I'd wanna change materials to be natural.

There's, there's a whole swath of ways to sort of make it more humanistic. But then when it was light, it was like, it comes back to light. And I was like, okay.. What's like my favorite environment to think and learn something. It's like outside, under a tree with like a moleskin in my hands, right?

Thinking and doodling and this, and so I was like, this paper is just calm. There's of course many beautiful benefits to paper. You never need to charge it. It's there. It lasts forever. But even putting that aside, just the way paper is so calm, you can use it outside in the sun, you know? Even at nighttime it's.

Obviously you need to have a lamp or something, but it's just, it doesn't demand, it doesn't put strain on me. It doesn't, it's not intense in the way a computer is. And so I was like, is there a way to make a piece of paper digital? Right? Like if I could control Spotify from a piece of paper, if I could read my homework that I would have to have or a PDF or a contract I'm doing, or do my emails, like write my emails by hand and send them out. Like, why do I need to go to a computer? And so you very quickly turn to Kindles and e Inc. As the best version of this digital paper. Something that's analog, but actually has computational capabilities and can have apps and, PDFs and docs.

The main problem we ran into when we then tried to use these turn kindles into basically iPad replacements or Chromebook replacements, , is the screen is so slow. The actual screen technology is so slow. You can't actually use it for computer stuff. You can't scroll, you can't zoom in, you can't type easily on the keyboard.

You can't scroll through results and search. It's good for Harry Potter and it's not good for what I wanted, which was it, to replace my iPad for it to replace, you know, my laptop. And so we went on, um. Six year journey of basically figuring out how to make these ePaper screens, , fast enough that they could actually be able to replace what we have to do with a computer, whether it's in school or work or it's a Spotify or Audible or, .

A book you're trying to read while also retaining the sort of analog paper-like benefits of no blue light, no flicker. Be able to use it outdoors, be able to use it at nighttime, be able to have it in a way that's not overstimulating, um, for you. And I essentially found an old Japanese technology that some crazy professors that's been spending 30 plus years working on and connected it with another material science breakthrough from the Netherlands and from Florida State.

And long story short, I was like, okay, if we put this all together, um, maybe this could solve this like key technical problem that makes it so slow. And, uh, I thought we would do it in two years and, uh, it took six years and, uh.

**Charlie Deist:** I mean, talk a little more about that. Like, as a learning process, you're, you're connecting the dots between these different fields. The information, the knowledge hadn't been synthesized into any single source. You had to connect the dots, like how did you put yourself in the position?

Those dots just as like a microcosm of how, how innovation happens.

**Anjan:** And I think there's such a good lesson in this. I'm so glad you asked this question. There's such a good lesson for I think the wider world here, that there's so many innovations that we all would just say we obviously want that are just like waiting there for, because of structural reasons, and I'll explain what I mean is I think the entire reason I was able to come up with this is because I was not in the field.

Uh, 'cause I was completely new and completely naive to this. I think that's the entire reason I was able to do it. , Why? It's because everybody else in the field who believed in these sort of call it paper-like computer screens, the best they could do is what came in the Kindle. Um, and believe it or not, that was invented in the nineties.

, It even starts earlier in the seventies. If you go all the way back and all the people who believed in it basically just got like, ran out of juice. Like they've persisted for five years, they persisted for 10 years, but after 15 they're like, I can't do this anymore. So the entire, like when you go talk to the key professors, when you talk to the companies,

they, they all had the right idea, but they were too early and it just took too long to create a lot of these underlying material science process technologies. Lithography etching, gel polymers, dichroic dyes. I, I could go on. And so it was like everybody in this field is like, this is a graveyard. This is a dead end.

For, for 20 years, everybody's saying has been saying it's three years away and look, nothing has ever worked out. And so of course I had to get really lucky, but when I started to look, I did it with open eyes. I didn't know that this has been a graveyard of a field and some of the key breakthroughs happened, you know, in like 2008.

In 2012. In 2015, in 2018, uh, it's sort of interesting that it's so proportional almost, and it's like the people who tried in 2010, they didn't have those other breakthroughs, the people who tried in 2014, the people who tried in 2003. And so I just showed up and finally. After like 30 years, enough of the underlying technologies had matured enough.

And because I was not a professor in one particular field, I wasn't working for Apple in one display division, I was willing to look at a much broader, I was not a specialist, much broader set of things. And so one of the crucial papers was not even from displays, it was used in other opto electronic applications.

And I, I brought it together. And so I think that combination of being naive enough to look widely, to not be jaded when everybody else is like, this is dead. Um, it's, I guess sometimes it takes an outsider or a beginner's mind allowed me to sort of put this all together and be like, this works. On paper and everybody, every expert, I'm like, they're like, no, no, no, no.

There's no way this works. They couldn't ever say specifically, and I'd give them my math and I'd say like, here, there's so many photons. This is how they did F, this is the da, da, da angles, and can you prove my math's wrong? And they go, nah, but it's not gonna work. And whatever my personality type is, I'm like, oh, you haven't told me this wrong.

So I kept going and going and going and going. And the Japanese professor was generous enough to take me under his wing. Provided his lab to create the first prototypes. And uh, so Japan was where we did this. And it turns out it sort of worked. And so it just told, tells me how many other fields are there, where if a beginner came in was curious.

It did take me two years of deeply studying, being part of it, going to every conference, reading the textbooks. I did have to put my work in, but I'm like, how many other fields are out there that if somebody came in and was curious in two years, you can go to the edge of human innovation. You know, I was the average and by the end of it, you know.

No one else has come up with this. And so I think that's, uh, very empowering for how many other things.

**Charlie Deist:** Yeah. And, and a variation of the story I feel like comes up so many times. It's kind of like a version of the hero's journey in a way. But it's, it's, it's like the story of entrepreneurship, rebel academics, people that, you know, crack the problem that's alluded the field for a long time.

And the common thread seems to be they had that mindset of either, not knowing that it was impossible or not taking. Taking that as a final answer from the people who are supposedly the experts in the field. And you know, an entrepreneur seems to be like. It's, you have to be the, the ultimate autodidact.

Like you have to be able to dive into so many different fields. And, and you mentioned that you got access to the Japanese professor's lab, but just to get to that point, you were kind of operating on a little bit of faith that you, that the answer was possible before you could see it. You had to have the faith that, that this would actually be possible, , at this point.

What's to stop one of these big tech giants from coming in, whether it's Amazon with their Kindles or Apple, and kind of taking the underlying technology and just, you know, putting their operating system on it.

**Anjan:** We spent two years making, um, an RB and Linux, that's a, um, uh, sort of solos. Uh, we had to throw it away, but the idea was we truly wanted our own operating system that had no, no, no. So there could be no Google tracking, no spying, no like a really, privacy and security and sovereignty matter a lot to me.

But, uh, turns out that's, you need a lot more resources to, to get that to, to production. So that's another day. But, um, to answer your question. , The sort of anti-capitalist answer here is I just want, in some sense to show the world guys there is a total other way to do computers that don't need to be so unhealthy.

. Now it does have a trade off. The computers are black and white. They're gray scale, right? So they're not for Netflix, they're not for playing Fortnite. But the whole point is there's a lot of other stuff on computers where you don't really need oversaturated stimulating colors if you're listening to an audio book or reading a book, you know, whatever it may be.

I think it would be delightful if people realize this was a way and at all different price points. 'cause obviously a startup has so little scale, things have to be expensive and even then you don't make much money. I think it'd be delightful for people to adopt this and all schools and Chromebooks and tablets and so on could have this technology.

And so long term I, I am actually not opposed to that. Maybe my investors would not enjoy me. Saying this. So, so that's I think one perspective on it. The second perspective is it just turns out it's really difficult to copy us on this. There are some very, very subtle technologies.

We have like five patents on it, and these companies can be pretty brutal, so they will eventually find a way to copy you, but it there, there's a lot of different process technologies that there's one manufacturer in the world right now that can actually implement our IP and we have an exclusivity with them for the next couple years.

So that helps, at least in the short term.. You know, we get a chance to actually, uh, bring this into the world and now get s squished so quickly. And the third thing is, I think generally companies are pretty pessimistic, cynical about things like this. Like who wants a healthier black and white computer?

People are dumb. They just want colors. They just wanna get distracted. So I think they sort of. They call it the innovator's dilemma. It's like, not that they can't do it, they just think it's small and dumb and unrealistic, and then by the time, you know, it proves people aren't dumb. They actually do wanna reclaim their health.

They wanna reclaim their attention. They want to not piss away their time. Uh, by that time, you know, it's too late. Sort of the, the small guy out now has his own momentum, so.

**Charlie Deist:** In some sense the consumer appetite for shiny objects functions as a bit of a moat for you guys, but, um, that you still have this, uh, a little bit more niche audience of more concerned. Consumers who are, , worried about their relationship with technology. And I think probably there are no, are no consumers who are more concerned about screens than like parents with their kids.

And, and you hear all this talk about the Zombify kid after being on an iPad for an hour in some cases. They might not even become zombie is the wrong analogy because they're, they're overstimulated, and when you take the object away from them, maybe they kinda look like a zombie when they're glued into it, but then they're dysregulated, right.

So their their

**Anjan:** They're a monster.

**Charlie Deist:** exactly, they're key. They're queued up and, and, and it's not good. And I, and they, they, handful of times I've sort of. Made the mistake of, uh, of, of letting my, my kids who are, you know, three and, and six, the ones that we've let use the, the iPad on occasion, uh, and, and you know, just watching Daniel Tiger or whatever, it's like, it, it, I definitely don't want that to be.

The default of how they interact with with devices. But at the same time, I do see the potential for personalized learning and there are all these adaptive AI apps that are coming out and it feels like you could be sort of. Leaving, uh, money on the table or, or, or leaving, you know, learning on the table by just refusing to use technology altogether.

So that, that's where I think, you know, this technology, whether it's in the schools or parents who are being more selective. I think it's worth, uh, you know, seriously considering, given that kids are spending so much time even outside of school on their devices, uh, the time that, that we wanna put them on devices when they're in school, it has to be more intentional and we, we can't ignore what, what seems like just a, a lot of mounting evidence that this has very real effects and the effects are not.

Evenly distributed. Some kids might do fine on a, on a regular Chromebook, but, but the people like you more sensitive kid. And I, I think I might be in the same boat. I don't know if it's a gene or a lot of genes, but, uh,

**Anjan:** Especially those of us Neurodiverse, we're, we're the, the ones most susceptible to the way existing computers are built. Oh.

**Charlie Deist:** right. So, so tell us about, you know, what's the new initiative with Daylight Kids?

**Anjan:** I think the, the high level thing to share here also is not to say that, um. Yeah, because we've made a healthier screen, we've made a healthier computer. Like that's the important part. The important part is actually just being outside, being in the dirt, like having your hands on physical things like playing with other kids, playing with other people.

That to me is the real sauce. The reason we exist is because it's unrealistic and probably not in the best interest of your child's development. To be a Luddite to completely get away with technology. So the point of daylight is almost like the least computer possible, and you do what you need to and you put it away and you go out to, you go outside and you put your hands in the dirt and you play with other people.

And, and that's the high level of how we think about this, is there are aspects of technology that are either hard to get rid of because school has them or they're actually useful, like an audiobook or a Spotify or, or it's. Actually a very powerful way to stimulate your own kids' learning and thinking and curiosity and expression.

Some of the adaptive learning apps that you're talking about, you know, people know about Khan Academy. There's new things like reading.com and Ava and Alpha Schools, um, and time back, which, um, for all intents and purposes are sort of like 80% book, 20% teacher, and the teacher is sort of embedded in it. Um, so it's like personalized to you, or, and the same way a tutor sort of is like, okay, that's too difficult for you.

Let's do this. Okay. You didn't seem quite get that. Let me do that. Basically, instead of needing a tutor to be there, the actual quote unquote textbook has that. And so that's inherently digital. And so the hope is daylight gives you a safe, healthy, clean way to be able to access, um, these things. And I, I love the promise here is not like.

Uh, my kid's gonna be like a million times smarter though. That may, may. Maybe that's directionally also true. It's instead of now four hours and more tantrums and more, you know, like difficulty. To have the kid be engaged or do it, it gets done in an hour or 45 minutes and they're engaged and now there's more time.

And now you don't have all these negative associations and emotions around learning or reading or this. And frankly, I, I think this idea that we need YouTube and games is the only way to sort of keep kids engaged, I don't think is true. It's like sugary candy, if that's all that's there, they're gonna pick it every time over hummus and carrots.

But if hummus and carrots are there, they objectively taste good. If your senses haven't been. Ruined by the other things. And so, uh, we, we came up with daylight kids. Um, and it basically has kids software. It's blocked from the internet and, and distracting apps. It's just got like books and drawing and stories and learning apps.

Um, it's just sort of the, the good parts of the digital world. Um, and the goal here is to just allow a little bit of digital into your life without it taking over.

**Charlie Deist:** I, my last question here, last direction I want to go is sort of thinking about the future and different futures that could evolve. We've all seen Apple Vision Pro and add a lot of fanfare at first. I feel like there there's some sense in which. Most people still kind of recoil at the idea of full on virtual reality.

It's still a little too like dystopian. Um, and whenever I put those things on, I just immediately get motion sickness, like really bad, and I wanna run in the other direction. I, I sort of wonder, you know, they just release the iPhone 17 and it's basically the same iPhone, just a little bit slimmer, a little bit shinier, and that seems to be like apple's only trick these days.

It's just, you know, thin, thinner, and shinier.

**Anjan:** it shinier.

**Charlie Deist:** Right, right. I, I wonder if Steve Jobs might have been more on this bandwagon, like if the technology had existed, if he'd be designing, you know, a beautiful full, full desktop. I mean, I mean like your whole desktop is a surface, is a computable surface that you can write on and draw on and, you know, uh, and I think I heard you talk in another interview a little bit about that as sort of the, the, the big picture vision.

Um, can you speak to that a little bit and sort of, uh, you know. How could this, I don't know, maybe how could it be integrated into the classroom or, uh, what are, what are some futures that you see with, where are we gonna go with computers?

**Anjan:** I think regardless of what future you map out, one of the key question for human society is, what is a wise relationship to technology look like? I, I think it's as simple as that. And the point of daylight is what's the best wisdoms we can bring together? Of what makes a thriving human. Um, and it turns out you can't have any discussion if you don't have health.

You know, you can have everything in the world, but if your health's not there and you start going up the stack, you can have everything in the world. But if your nervous system is shot, you won't be able to enjoy it. And so if we can start with the principles of what's the stack that allows, uh, a whole human that can then thrive, then the goal is of computers or this is okay, what are the different.

Capacities a human has that we can take advantage of. And one of them is to be spatial, right? And so now we're making basically a fat piece of paper with the tablet, and that's always the way I relate to what a tablet is. It's a fat, magical piece of paper. But to your point, why can't whiteboards? Why can't our desks, why can't other things be calm?

Feel analog. So be part of our house or interior design. Not be impinging on our attention or nervous system, but when you want to sort of be like, okay, what's my plan for the week? Or like, what's the habits streak I'm on? Or what's this like physiotherapy thing I want to be doing? Um, you've, maybe you've seen these skylight calendars and things like that.

It's nice to potentially have these computational surfaces. And so in lieu of not having them, this is my. Place. You can see I, I try to do the, an analog, uh, equivalent of it. Um, and, uh, I would not recommend this. This is a little bit like conspiracy theory. It's always sunny in Philadelphia style, but, uh, I think this is sort of our vision is how do we have computers that, um, magically disappear into your environment, but give you magic back?

And, uh, I think of Tom Riddle's diary in Harry Potter as w. The most inspiring example of what technology can be, which is for all intents and purpose, or the newspapers, if, if serious blacks shouting on it, um, or the marauders map. But for all intents and purposes, they feel analog, but they're magical.

They can react to you. They have their intelligence, they can help you. And to me, that's where, that's where I want computers to go, where it's not about computers, it's about magical. Objects and surfaces we have in our world. And none of that matters if it's not respectful of your attention, your nervous system, your health.

And so, you know, in the short term, it'll look like potentially us making a healthy phone, a, a desktop monitor, um, with a daylight screen. But further than that, I think it'd be really cool. Uh, it's, we're we're talking about the long term here to make a, like you said, computational surfaces. Yeah.

**Charlie Deist:** It's, it's a future. I'm very excited, uh, for and, and hope that, that I'll be able to remain a, an early adopter. It's. The only piece of technology that I, uh, feel good about bringing into my, my bedroom and, and even, you know, into my bed for bedtime reading, I often will just switch it onto airplane mode and put it under my pillowcase.

And, uh, actually I love, I love how the, the case that it came in, you guys send a little, it's like a little pillowcase around the computer and, uh, I feel like if I were to ever go camping, uh, I'd bring that along and I would just use that as my pillow. Um, I know that there's more exciting things coming and the feature that I'm most excited about that I saw you demoing on your Twitter the other day is this little yellow button here on the side.

Can you tell me more about why you installed this button before it had a, a function?

**Anjan:** Oh, I'm so glad you asked. Um, I feel like, yeah, there's sort of two main form factors of computers are like, oh, I need to do real work, and you need to like sit on your laptop or desktop and be hunched over and your shoulders hurt and you're clicking and clacking away, and it's not necessarily the best environment.

For, for you, but it's where you have to be or you're on your phone, but then, you know, your, your pinky is crooked and you're holding something and it's small. And so it's felt like, you know, we, these are the two main ways we've been able to do things with computers. And I've always felt like the key part of a tablet is, it's sort of like holding a book or a legal pad.

It's very, as you're saying, lean back. It's a little more expansive. You can be on a couch, you can be on the grass, you can be in a picnic table. Um, it allows you to be in a far greater. Variety of environments, especially this guy where you can see it outside, but you previously couldn't do serious work on a tablet because you know, tablet keyboard is hard, but.

What really changes? This is voice. 'cause if a computer can understand you and you can just speak into it to type and dictate and ask it to change things and hey, bold this and justify that, and here I'm gonna dictate this, you know, part of what I'm doing. Then this actually becomes a serious computer.

There's, this is no longer at a huge disadvantage to you at your desktop with a Click-Clack keyboard, and so the point of that button on the side is regardless of where you are in the operating system. We want it to make it super, super easy. We call it the walkie talkie button for you to be able to just talk and, and dictate into the thing.

And so our, our hope is this sort of creates a new dimension of lean back computing that allows you to still be, to, to do the stuff you really have to do for school or work or whatever.

**Charlie Deist:** I mean, I'm a big fan of the voice dictation already just on my, on my desktop and, and once I need to start to exercise the muscle of using the daylight as my, my primary device. And I feel like there's kind of a learning curve with all these things. You have to, you know, I feel like I'm sort of like the old person who's adapting to a, a smartphone or something after years of only using word processing on a, on a desktop.

But, uh, it, it's the, the possibilities I think for. For kids' education, get, you know, getting the academic stuff done in a shorter amount of time, but then also just being able to let your imagination. Run wild and to do your own deep research into the things you're interested in, uh, to, to be able to be reading and, and click that button and ask a question about what's on the screen and have it fill in with that context.

This is the, the future of computing. I'm, I'm certain of that, and, uh. And I think you guys are, are doing a lot of, uh, a lot of good by, by trying to, um, reclaim the soul of the original Silicon Valley ideas that, that sort of freewheeling creativity. Um, anything else I know Daylight Kids is, is ramping up.

Uh, and, and I want our, our families to know that. That, uh, you know, daylight computers would be reimbursable with their technology allowance. So if your kid is dysregulated, being in front of the computer too much, this is something that is, is worth a try. And the di device, you know, it's, it's under a thousand or what, what's kind of the price point?

Um.

**Anjan:** SE 7 29 with our Kids bundle. Uh.

**Charlie Deist:** Fantastic. So, uh, any, any kind of closing comments or things that you, you wish, you know, speak to the, the kid in the audience or the, the, the child of the, the parent who's listening, um, who might be someone like you growing up, like speak to that child right now.

**Anjan:** Um, I love the way one of our customers said it. They're like, my kid loves the daylight because when they previously had an iPad, they were only allowed 45 minutes of screen time a week. And I give them unlimited screen time with the daylight and it, it turns out, like, you know, being able to, there's something called brilliant.org, which is like sort of like an educational game type thing.

It turns out that's more interesting than picking on your sister, but less interesting than your backyard. And like that is, that is what daylight is for. So I, I would say is it sort of allows you to have the engaging aspects of a computer without it being bad for you and for parents, the way I would think about it is daylight is sort of a guilt-free or healthier iPad.

So you can think about it as replacing an iPad or if you don't wanna give your 4-year-old an iPad. Um, here is like, you know, sort of. A middle ground rather than giving them nothing. Or an 8-year-old who's really getting into reading daylight is a really great, uh, tool for that. And then the other use case is this holidays we're launching a keyboard case.

And so you can sort of use daylight as a Chromebook replacement. So for schoolwork and all the things where you'll, you're forced to use a Chromebook, our hope is here's a way for that to be a lot, uh, a lot more healthy. And so sort of an iPad replacement and a Chromebook replacement. And a lot of people use it as their secondary device as well.

So it's sort of weekends and nights. And mornings. Uh, it's a daylight, no other device is allowed into the bedroom except the daylight. And then for, for their normal day, they can use their windows or Mac. But whenever, um. It's something more flexible. They're able to read something on a daylight, read the newspaper, um, listen to Spotify, uh, connect it to their speakers or whatever it is.

But, uh, yeah, our hope is a lot more kids can, um, not be so dysregulated by computers and not have to be totally Luddites. So

**Charlie Deist:** And, and adults too. I'm, uh, setting a New Year's resolution for myself. I know it's only September, but by January 1st, I want to be writing the open-end daily. I want my default to be writing it. With my new keyboard case or even better, would be with voice dictation. So Angen, please tell me that I'm gonna be able to get access to the voice dictation before next year.

**Anjan:** A amazing, we're we're, we're working hard. We're, uh, we're, uh, we're, we're finally getting the resources we need to, to hire the folks to do it, but I appreciate knowing that you can be one of the first people on the list.

**Charlie Deist:** Alright, thanks again Anja, and it's been a pleasure talking with you. And go check it out. Daylight Computer, daylight Kids. Uh, we'll, we'll, hope to have you back on before long.

**Anjan:** Hey, thanks for hosting us and uh, our goal is just to show people there can be hope. Computers don't need to be so terrible for you. There is another way and these big companies will not let you know this. So I'm glad podcasts like you exist so we can, uh, you know, be the rebels.

**Charlie Deist:** All right, onward. Thanks An.

**Anjan:** Hey, bye.
