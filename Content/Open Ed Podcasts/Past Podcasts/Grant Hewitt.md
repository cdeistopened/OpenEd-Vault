Grant Hewitt: [00:00:00] There are very few times in American history, where

all experienced the exact same pain point. even 9 11, it sparked amazing patriotism across America. But if you were in New York or Washington on 9 11, your feelings are vastly different than Grant Hewitt, watching it on the Today Show. Except now we're talking about parents and COVID and school closures, and almost every parent in America for two weeks experienced the exact same thing. And so what I witnessed happened in the movement is that

Isaac: Welcome back to the Open Ed Podcast. I am excited to have my colleague Grant Hewitt with me.

Grant has been around the education, education policy, education choice space for a long time in a lot of capacities and has seen every different [00:01:00] approach in many different states.

So I want to kind of start with, like, historically for ever since the advent of compulsory public school in the early 1900s. You really had public school and then you had private schools, which were, uh, either very expensive or, um, you know, maybe parochial Catholic schools, uh, that had some scholarships and things, but it's a pretty small number of people that were in private school and then maybe around the 60s.

Homeschooling kind of became this idea, this thing, it was mostly illegal, but there was a small number of people doing it became a real movement in the eighties and nineties became legalized, became more popular until quite recently. I mean, there were efforts in the nineties for things like vouchers, but on a large scale.

Until probably close to 2000, you really had public school, private school, if you could afford it or homeschool where you're completely on your own and using your own [00:02:00] resources and whatever. So, um, and you know, you're paying tax dollars to support the public school system, but you don't use it. You don't get those taxes back.

That was kind of where we were. And the earliest school choice stuff, at least that I was familiar with, a lot of it came from recommendations from Milton Friedman's book on the idea of vouchers. Hey, if you don't actually use the public school, how about you just get a voucher that lets you use it to pay for a private school?

Um, so we've had vouchers since then in the last 20 years, and especially in the last five. The number of different things out there that are like, it's just, it's crazy. It's proliferated. So I want to kind of sit and like, I want to get your snapshot of the landscape of everything that's out there between, I didn't even mention charter schools, the charter school movement.

The vouchers for private schools, now you have education savings accounts, you have tuition tax credits, you have virtual programs that are run by a public school that like [00:03:00] serve homeschoolers or like part time students in Richmond, it's this crazy, crazy explosion of options. I want to know your real take thoughts on the pros and cons of some of these things.

So I don't know where you want to start.

Grant Hewitt: Yeah, so it's been, it's been a journey. Um, so I, I got into the private school choice space. As a kid, I was a product of philanthropic school choice. So I have a learning disability. That disability made it very hard to learn in a traditional setting. But it wasn't debilitating. It was, it was just made it harder. My mother looked for something different. Didn't see it. Raised by a single mom and she was talking to her colleagues and they said, well, there's this church that has a private school that helps kids with special needs. Maybe it's a place for your, for your child. I [00:04:00] didn't know until I was in my thirties that that was actually paid for by the church, uh, that it wasn't out of my own family's hands.

And my life was like exploded at that moment because when I learned that, I was also in the process of helping Nevada bring forward the first universal education savings account after it had been passed in Arizona and Florida, but in limited capacities. And that was in 2015 and that's from there. see an explosion of conversations around educational freedom.

The courts shut down the education savings account program in Nevada, but in 2021, 2021, we see universal choice come to West Virginia through an education savings account. Um, and you had vouchers in Indiana that are ginormous and taking over, uh, there. I mean, I think they have over 60, 000 people getting vouchers, uh, in Indiana.[00:05:00]

And so you had this explosion and all of it's driven to your point by this concept of Milton Friedman, creating a market, creating the free market in education, and how do you do that? Uh, and what do you see to do that for a long time? I think the, the folks on the school choice side, when you aren't gonna hear me talk about choice, school choice a lot.

I, I believe in calling this educational freedom. How do you empower families to access the freedom that they have? and I don't think we're asking parents, uh, what we're seeing in this movement today is about parents being given more freedom. I think it's actually about parents taking back. The freedom that they've always had as parents. And so we're seeing this momentum across the country happen. Um, I hate to say it in politics, people get a little envious of others. So when you get a state that gets excited, you get neighboring states that are like, well, I have to do something. Um, and actually we saw that in Arizona. [00:06:00] So we see West Virginia go fully universal in 20.

I believe it was 21 in 22. Arizona's like, whoa, whoa. We've been doing this a long time. I have to be universal and so they go they go that route as well You start seeing these dominoes start to start to fall whether you're in iowa or arkansas,

Isaac: There are times when federalism works as it was intended to.

Grant Hewitt: So but then you get exciting new experiments so you get what's happening in oklahoma Um, which is is very interesting and this is a This is a, was pitched as a refundable tax credit. How it implemented was, was very different, but this is actually two tax credits. There's a tuition tax credit of 7, 000.

If you are going to a private school, uh, acts very similar to a voucher on, on, In practice, but the way it's legally done is a little different, but then there's a homeschool tax credit of, I believe it's 2, 000 that allows families just to deduct off their taxes with [00:07:00] a simple checkbox. Like, did I do this?

This is the, the, the most freedom we see. It's a small dollar, but it's there. Uh, you have A couple other programs that started during the pandemic. Idaho has strong students strong families. This is a micro grant program. This allows for supplemental dollars to follow kids into their hand into their family's hands to provide supplemental action.

You don't have to leave the public school to get access to this money. Programs similar to that exist in Kansas with Kansas Keep and in Ohio with Ohio ACE, allowing them, families, to do that as well. These mainly came out of the pandemic, but some are going to stick around. Idaho's is going to stick around.

It was formula funded, it's in their budget, and they're going to have this ongoing micro grant concept for families. So what school choice? Uh, was is now to me educational freedom, which then [00:08:00] opens up, uh, Isaac, a much bigger conversation. So what is open enrollment mean in that? What is, um, part time enrollment in Kansas mean in that?

What does it mean to rethink how you formulate your education? And obviously, we're talking a lot about that at open end, but the ability to truly customize and open enrollment. You know, people who are opposed to these programs love to talk about the lack of uptake, the lack of number of families who are actually utilizing all these programs that exist. But I think it's a culture shift has to happen and is happening in America to make people more interested in customizing their education or, as I like to say, owning that process and versus it being a government service. And I think ultimately underlying is a government question.

Isaac: There's a funny little, uh, anecdote I stumbled across earlier this week in terms of the uptake, because I think I heard from you one time, some crazy number that [00:09:00] there's Hundreds, thousands of different sort of school choice type programs across the country. You have all sorts of different school districts that have virtual charters or that have these, this or that option.

So like theoretically, and then, and the percentage of people that are eligible for them versus the percentage that actually, you know, enroll in them is quite low. But when you look at when you start to look into the details, I was looking just recently, I think it was in Tennessee, and they have some kind of program.

It's kind of like an ESA type of a thing. Um, but when you look at the fine print, it's like students, you have to be in one of three counties. You have to have attended a specific school for at least three years and then go to transfer to some other school and it lasts you one year and you're like, by the time I fill out all the criteria and paperwork, I get it for one year.

I'm not going to, most people have never heard of it. It's not marketed. Whoever runs it doesn't have an interest in marketing it. And even if it [00:10:00] were, It's like, okay, so technically maybe 20, 000 students could qualify, but that's 20, 000 students this year. And it's always a different 20, 000 every year. And it's like, there's so many that are actually not truly universal or easy to access.

So it's, it's kind of a misleading thing to say that the uptake is really low.

Grant Hewitt: it's really it's really funny you mentioned that it's like the world's worst choose your own adventure book. you're choosing your own adventure trying to get qualified only to then fall off and not be qualified. It's it exists as a as an opportunity to experiment with choice in Tennessee, but fell far short of its dream.

Now we expect Tennessee to bring it back this year and have more conversations about it. But. But you hit on something really important. The people that administer these programs don't have an incentive to drive enrollment in these programs. They are program administrators. They're just there to make sure they're operating.

Uh, [00:11:00] sometimes.

Isaac: in many cases, their job gets harder, the more enrollments there are and they, and they don't have the ability to have like incentive bonuses and things like that. That's often explicitly prohibited. So

Grant Hewitt: Well, you also run into this, this situation where we fixed it. The movement has fixed this, but historically, everybody thought education programs needed to be in Department of Education. then you were setting up these freedom esque programs in places whose whole mission was to keep people in the system. weren't actually designed to think about how to empower somebody to get outside the system. They were designed to be inside. So you have this Poor state, uh, state bureaucrat who's sitting in an office going, my job is to help families get out and everybody else in his building is like, no, no, that is not happening. Um, and so I think the move that we saw in 2015 to move these programs to, uh, in [00:12:00] that case in Nevada to Treasury. Uh, and we've seen that model. We repeated over and over, um, creates the right incentive structure. And I think it's important for people to understand why in 2015, they moved the program into treasury.

And that's because it was a fundamental. shift of, um, was this a banking product or was this an educational program? So what was the purpose of an education savings account? And we can, we can credit this to Senator Becky Harris in Nevada, who was the chairman of education, and she saw the bill and it was on in her committee and she goes, This isn't an education bill and she called treasury and asked us to review it in treasury and we looked at it and she goes what is it it sure looks like a bank account that like you're putting money in and then you're spending it on allowable things sure looks like a health savings account if you ask me and next thing I knew There was a bunch of [00:13:00] red lines in a bill, and suddenly it's in Treasury, which, which was fine, because it really set the right incentives.

You know, what is the, what is the role of government in these programs? It's to ensure the money moves appropriately, and that the guardrails are met. And that's not about the education side of the program, it's about the process.

Isaac: yeah. And so that, that's a great, I want to put a pin on that one for a second, because Many people listening, if you came from a more radical homeschool background, like I did, that's like, we're just used to being completely outside of the system. Uh, we know that we're not going to get the tax dollars back that are going to the public school, but in return nobody bugs us We're completely left alone.

You know, it depends on the state you're in you're not completely left alone But so when we have these conversations about, you know, education freedom stuff, there's always the option Yeah, as long as it's legal and it pretty much is in every state. Yeah, you can just opt out of the system You're not going to get any money back [00:14:00] from you're not going to get any any government money or get your taxes back You But you do your thing.

That is always on the table. Anyone who is in a position where they're capable of doing that. And then, then great. Then you move to the next thing. Okay. If there is a concern that there are people who are not going to be able to afford. A type of education that, you know, maybe they want and someone, it could be a private foundation or it could be a government wants to help fund people who can't afford it to do some form of, you know, free, free education, educational freedom, both of those entities, whether it's a private foundation or a government, they had, they now face a problem.

What is the best mechanism? To get money to people who want it for an education. Do we just start a school ourselves and run the school, which is what both public and private schools do. That's like the first thought we'll just run the whole thing, but then that's very uniform. Now everybody's crammed into the same system.

Okay. Do we have like. We create grants for [00:15:00] multiple types of schools and you kind of government kind of does that with like charter schools in some ways. It's sort of like, Hey, there's some room to compete and try to become a government school. That's different. There's some room for that. Private foundations do stuff like that.

Then there's the next level down. Well, what if we just gave the money directly to the recipients? Is, and, and then like put some kind of strictures around it. So they're not, let's say using it for drugs or something like that. And it's, and it's creating this problem that's worse than what we would set out to solve.

And again, put aside whether this is coming through government or a private foundation, they both face these same problems. Now governments have some additional political considerations and all kinds of other things involved. But at the end of the day, that's kind of what we're, so like put aside for a second, if, whether you think government should just have nothing to do with education at all.

That's fine. But given that they do, and that there's this desire to get funds to help more people have a quality education, that's where all of these [00:16:00] conversations come in. There's they all, all ways to get money to people, to help them with an education are not created equal. So a charter school and a voucher and an ESA and a tax credit, they all have different pros and cons.

They have unintended consequences. They have weird bedfellows and weird enemies you wouldn't expect. So I think that's, what's interesting to me is like. How do we try to judge and compare? So I would love to ask you kind of one at a time. Give me like a quick take on a couple of these options, like vouchers, biggest pro biggest con limitation voucher is like government takes money and gives it to somebody, but it's not, it's not cash.

It's like, uh, a ticket that can only buy certain things, which is tuition at an accredited private school. Give me like the pros and cons of vouchers

Grant Hewitt: Yeah, I mean, the pro, very simple to understand most of the time. Uh, you know, pick a private school. Uh, let's use Indiana as an example here. Uh, you pick the private school. The private school goes through the process of helping you register for the [00:17:00] voucher. It says the incentives are aligned. The private school's looking for money.

The private school's going to help family. Family gets out there, uh, can get the check. The check goes direct from government to private school. Um, and then, uh, There's no, very little chance of fraud here. It's very clean. Um, bureaucrats and legislative officials are excited because they know it's going to an accredited school.

Um, so everybody's kind of really happy about the safe box that you're in. Uh, Con, and I've said this on the, on the trail a lot, talking about educational freedom. Um, many times, unfortunately you can't. Tell much of a difference in the education of a child in a, in a public school, private school, charter school, maybe that the paint tastes better on the wall, but it's just, it's, it's still kids in rows.

It's desks. Maybe get a little bit more freedom. So, You're moving kids from one box to another box. Is that box better? [00:18:00] Maybe. Is it nicer? Probably. But you're not transforming the educational outcome or trajectory of a child.

Isaac: and you, and you have that, you kind of have that choke point of the accreditation cartel, let's say. And so if we're saying, Hey, it can go to not just a public school, but any accredited school. Okay. Then the next question becomes, Why does the accreditation process result in all of the schools looking so similar?

And you have two options, right? You can say, well, let's keep the voucher idea and let's change what it means to be accredited. Let's redefine accreditation and let's open that up. Or you can say, let's, let's run the funds somewhere else. Let's not just give them to accredited schools. Let's give them to something broader than that.

Cause the other issue that vouchers have is constitutionally in most States, you have separation of church and state. Right? You can't give money from a government to a religious institution, but some of the, some of the better schools are [00:19:00] religious. So if, if instead, you can give the money as a grant to the parents, And allow them to spend it.

They can spend it on a religious institution. So something like a tax credit, which they get a refundable tax credit given tip, just like you would get a tax credit for anything else. But the fact that it's refundable means you get it, even if you didn't pay that much, um, then you can use that to apply it to whatever.

So am I correct? And like, that was kind of the next step in the school choice conversation after vouchers or no.

Grant Hewitt: know, so you had vouchers, then you had tax credit scholarships.

Isaac: Okay.

Grant Hewitt: are tax credits that are Corporate tax credits that are given to corporations who fund scholarship organizations Who then write checks to families and they can use them on schools Uh now many times these still look a lot like vouchers.

So you get um, you get The company writes a check to a non profit. That non [00:20:00] profit has kids apply for those scholarship dollars. Those kids select which school they're going to. And then the check is sent from scholarship organization over to The school tuition is taken care of, you're moving on. Now, why this has gotten kind of interesting is in some places you get private schools who open up their own foundations to, uh, to accept tax credit money into those foundations to then be able to fund kids to go back to their same schools.

So you get a lot of people playing in the. In the sandbox, trying to get families to do it. Um, there are, are places that limit the number of scholarship granting organizations. But again, these tax credits, uh, have some of the similar pitfalls as, as maybe a voucher in the sense that we're back to accredited schools.

Uh, we can get religious schools now, um, but with some Supreme Court changes, we can get religious schools now and regular vouchers. where they're really scary. [00:21:00] isn't guaranteed. So I now have kids who are in schools and let's say we have an economic downturn and suddenly the scholarship granting organization cannot meet the demand.

Of their number of scholarships you've got. So now you've got kids who are having to have their education Uprooted in the middle of maybe their elementary school or the junior high and they're having to find new schools Because they don't have have funding available. So this uh, these programs are much more susceptible to the economic uh conditions of the country and where people are going they're also uh, unfortunately subject to the political realities. And so in Florida, uh, when we had some of the Disney issues blowing up in Florida, it changed how companies wanted to write checks, where they were giving money to. And so when politics gets involved, everything gets crazy. I think the [00:22:00] only thing everybody who listens to this can agree is we should get politics out of education and Right now, tax credits to scholarship organizations are politically, uh, affected and economically affected.

Makes it very difficult.

Isaac: It's funny. Um, We mentioned Milton Friedman because he was kind of the, you know, one of the early voucher guys, but I'll never forget. He has this little framework. I don't even remember where 1 of his books, but of the 4 ways to spend money, and you can spend your own money on yourself. You're going to be the most judicious and the most efficient when you do that, you can spend your own money.

On someone else, like buying them a gift. You're not going to be quite as scrutinous. Like if the thing you buy isn't the best value, you don't have to live with it, but you do want it to be nice. Cause it's a gift and it's your money. You can spend someone else's money on yourself. Uh, you're going to do a pretty good job.

Not quite as good as if it was your own money, but you're going to, and then, and then the worst is someone else's money on someone else. I get, I get to [00:23:00] spend grants money on a stranger I've never met before. How good a job am I going to do of making sure that those dollars are well used? And I think that's kind of when you, when you say, okay, government wants to get in the game of helping people have access to education, uh, what's the best way to do it?

The closer that those dollars can be to the parents and the students. The more efficient, the better the outcome is going to be. But those mechanisms that come in between, there's so many different ways and they all have trade offs, you know, if we were to start from scratch, you know, you think about, uh, with food, if you want to help more people have access to food.

Well, currently government has various like food stamp programs and things. I think few people would say, you know what we should do. Government should take over the entire supply chain for foods, open its own grocery stores, source everything, do all the marketing, do all the like, no, we have a very robust competitive market for food.

Just give people food stamps or bridge cards or whatever, and then go pick it from the grocery stores. [00:24:00] If we were starting from scratch, I think education, that would be kind of a no brainer, but we're starting from a spot today. Where the entire industry is dominated by government run institutions. And they are in most States, the largest employer in that state.

They're, they're not, they're not going anywhere anytime soon, whether you like it or not. And so the question is public schools do exist, but we want more than that for people. How do we try to get there in like the way that's the most feasible, the most efficient that has the least, you know, problems associated with it.

And, uh, I mean, as you can see, like, I think the fact that you can have a thousand different experiments is, is going to help tremendously, but this is not an easy. Fix. It's not something you can just simplify overnight. I

Grant Hewitt: No, it's, it's not. And you talk about the other programs that are, that are kind of direct to beneficiary type, uh, operations, you know, food stamps, EBT cards, social security, these things, they all have one thing kind of [00:25:00] in common. They are, they're dealing with adults. while food stamps, you obviously are feeding children at homes, the risk tolerance that society seems to have around education is incredibly different than they have helping a senior citizen, giving them money, money to live on Social Security.

There's just so much more, I guess, less, less risk tolerance for dealing with kids. And at the core of the educational freedom discussion. Is do we trust parents? That's, that's the core. It doesn't forget about everything else. you trust the parent to lead the child's educational journey to a point at which the child can lead their own educational journey?

Isaac: actually like to change the question slightly, uh, because I think if you ask, do you trust parents? It's too easy to fall into the Nirvana [00:26:00] fallacy where you compare how well the parents are going to do to some fictionalized ideal of like what would be the best case scenario. I like the question, who is more likely to produce the better outcome parents having control or bureaucrats having control.

And I will side with parents every time. That doesn't mean that I don't acknowledge that there are plenty of individual cases where parents are going to do a bad job as, as all of us do on many things. But I want to, I want to compare apples to apples. Like, look, the options on the table are parents having more control on this scale or bureaucrats having more control.

And I w I would go the parent side every time, but I don't want to compare it to some like idealized vision. That's not possible. You know,

Grant Hewitt: that's fair. I think, I think the movement has taken a dramatic shift. And I think we have to acknowledge COVID as, as a, as a point in this discussion.

Isaac: changed everything. I mean, I can tell you grant just anecdotally as, as homeschooling my whole [00:27:00] life, since COVID you cannot go out in public with your kids. A day without other parents asking you about why your kids are in school, you homeschool and saying they're thinking about it. They're curious about it and having a positive reaction to it.

That was not the case. Pre COVID. You would have that sometimes, but like, it's like universal now, like everyone is suddenly curious about what more might be possible for their child educationally in a way that was not the case before.

Grant Hewitt: but I think so this is that's right. And I think it's important to recognize I for a long time had been looking for a way to talk about this and find the commonality and common ground that people could talk about educational freedom. There are very few times in American history, where you can find one demographic of people who have one thing in common with each other, who.

all experienced the exact same pain point. even 9 11, it sparked [00:28:00] amazing patriotism across America. But if you were in New York or Washington on 9 11, your experience and your feelings are vastly different than Grant Hewitt, who was at the Texas Christian University dorm room, um, that morning watching it on the Today Show. Except now we're talking about parents and COVID and school closures, and almost every parent in America for two weeks in March of 2020 experienced the exact same thing. And so what I witnessed happened in the movement is that what I like to call parent on parent violence dramatically decreased. It used to be you were judging other parents, parents were judging each other when their kids went to school, and now you see parents going, What works for you works for you, man.

That's great. Like we didn't that didn't happen without COVID. And [00:29:00] then you get this concept of does learning happen everywhere. It doesn't just happen in a classroom. There were some states you want to talk about educational freedom to another degree. There were some states that were ahead. New Hampshire had a program called Learn Everywhere where you were starting to accredit learning in K 12 that happened outside, whether it was 4 H or internships with businesses.

Like that was pre COVID, but getting people to talk about it, totally different conversation after COVID, the idea that you could be a student in a public school and a private school at the same time, or a public school and a home school or a public school and a hybrid, that was very different. I think one of the things that really changed is what became innovative in education shifted after COVID.

And so, um, micro schools, uh, school choice platforms shifted, but really, uh, it used to be pre COVID what technology was at the ed tech business was [00:30:00] huge. Uh, that's what was called innovation was a, some new curriculum, or maybe it's a VR goggles. What became innovative post COVID was how did a school or an education system about staffing differently, the building differently, and time differently.

Isaac: Yep.

Grant Hewitt: that's what really became innovative. And so as you saw this explosion of a thousand flowers blooming across America, you were seeing people, everyday entrepreneurs like yourself, Isaac and others, who are saying, I'm going to rethink the classroom. I'm going to rethink. Who is a teacher? I'm going to rethink, how do I fund that?

I'm going to rethink all these things that have led to an explosion of innovative learning environments, but they all have really one thing in common. They're rethinking, uh, their staffing, who they're rethinking, where and how, and they're rethinking when,

Isaac: Yeah. [00:31:00] And then this is a, this is a good, uh, transition to, to talk about the, sort of the last item on here, ESAs and. First, I want to mention micro schools, micro schools, and the essays are related, but they're, but they're separate. So that the concept of the micro school, um, it's, it's so simple, you know, imagine, imagine if you're a teacher in the public school system and you're, you know, maybe in your first couple of years, maybe you're making 50 grand in benefits or something.

Uh, and you're teaching a classroom of 20, 30 kids, and you have a lot of strictures put on you. You gotta, you gotta teach to the tests. You gotta do all kinds of things coming from the state, local, and federal level. Not easy. And then you have this realization. What if I just taught like 10 kids and each of them was able to pay me like five or six grand for a year and I had this highly tailored 10 kid and maybe some of them can bring their sibling that it doesn't even have to be like strict [00:32:00] age delineation and and like I'm a really talented teacher and I have a bunch of upside here and you think about families if they can afford that.

Wow. That's such a great experience. And so like the micro school concept has always been there, but that funding component, it's the, if they can afford it, you introduce ESAs, let's just give parents a spending account and they can use it on private school tuition. If they want, they can use it for classes.

They can use it for books. Now, suddenly. You've got a lot of public school teachers, private school teachers, homeschool moms, all of the above saying, I can run a micro school. Um, and I don't even need a building. There are churches that are vacant six days a week. There are all kinds of places where we can go.

And homeschoolers have been doing things like this a little more loosely called co ops for a long time. But this micro school concept, I think just the word itself. Helped capture a large chunk of the market who would be turned off by the idea of homeschooling Because they kind of like the the school [00:33:00] component But they all understand every advocate of schooling is a fan of smaller class sizes and a better parent You know teacher to student ratio and like a micro school.

It's like a little less heavy duty It's not so bureaucratically top heavy a little more flexible It's a closer relationship with teacher to and so it's been interesting to see You This explosion of like, like what's old is new again. This is like the old one room schoolhouse, you know, I mean, it's back.

Um, and so ESA is, I think, and they've been like, all of a sudden in the span of a couple years, it went from like one or two or three states to 17 states have some kind of ESA. And there's a lot of really cool, exciting things there. But there's also some interesting and weird side effects and some unanswered questions about how to administer these darn things and some weird incentives at play.

I would love your good, bad, and ugly on ESAs.

Grant Hewitt: a whole podcast on this, but super high level. ESAs are the, [00:34:00] are the second best thing that we have today to getting to a mixed economy in education, to getting to a place where money is flowing and you still have the monopoly there and money can get to families. Um, the ESA movement since 2015 has, has gone through a couple of iterations, but uh, really in 2020, 2021, the, the movement as a whole got behind universal.

Access to essays, which was, which was really big. What, what the, what we learned, uh, intuitively we didn't understand, but we, we, we learned it eventually was that. It didn't matter how much freedom you wanted to provide if it was for a hundred kids or a thousand kids or a million kids. The opposition to freedom was going to fight it at the exact same level as as if it was a million kid program or a hundred kid program. Um, they just viewed it as such a threat [00:35:00] to the ecosystem of their existence that that that happened. So the shift to universal became huge. And you started getting the dominoes to drop, whether it's West Virginia, uh, sorry, uh, Arizona, Iowa, um, Arkansas, Florida, you know, coalesces around seven programs and creates a universal concept.

So, great movement on this front. Now, every kid can apply. Here's, here's where it fell short. Um, It fell short because at the same time the movement was so focused on getting every kid in the program, it forgot to protect the back door of how the money flows out the program. And now you see post West Virginia and Arizona, a ratcheting down of the allowable expenses ESA.

So it's starting to look more and more like a voucher. Where you are finding accredited school [00:36:00] language. You're finding, um, licensed teachers as tutors. Um, you're not seeing this freedom of the ecosystem, uh, start to develop. And the more you ratchet down how it can be spent, the more you Uh, create market forces that do not drive innovation, and it creates a lack of or stagnant growth of the education market.

Isaac: Cause if you're, if you're a potential vendor and you want to offer some unique kind of educational experience to people who have these ESA dollars, and you just don't know year to year, semester to semester, how the criteria are going to change and whether you'll be eligible, you're not going to sink a lot into, you know, building that out, making it a big thing.

So there's been a little bit of a stagnation in the ecosystem on the vendor side. Cause there's been lack of clarity, but then you also just think about the incentives for whatever nonprofit government agency or for profit wins a [00:37:00] contract to administer these things. If the idea is people can get dollars and they can spend them on all kinds of things and they can submit them for reimbursement or buy them directly on a marketplace or both, there's.

Like, it's very hard to imagine a scenario where the lawmakers that issue this thing, they want it to be a good PR win and a political win. And it looks bad for them if there's one newspaper story that says, we found a family that used ESA dollars to buy a trip to Disney World and they claim it was an educational expense.

This, this is, this is a fraud. This is a scam. This is being abused. Whether or not it's true, whether or not Disney World is educational, it's going to look bad. So the lawmakers have an incentive to go to whoever is running these things and be like, Hey, I don't care what you do, but don't make me embarrassed by approving something that's going to look bad.

So those administrators, what are, what's their incentive? Risk aversion, they, they get no upside for taking a chance and approving, uh, a swing set or a bicycle. That could be a cool [00:38:00] educational thing. It's only downside risk. So over time they're going to want to like narrow, narrow, narrow, narrow. Um, so it's, it's this, it's this process, like you can kind of predict where it's going, but it's, um, it's also like a high administrative burden to make all these choices.

So if you're, you know, when you think about other. More private industries, they will simply bake in. An allowable percent of like fraud and abuse like retail. They're like, Hey, we know we're going to have employee theft and it's going to be roughly this much. And we'll bake that in. Yeah, we'll try to limit it, but we can't get it to zero and we're not going to be scared of it not being zero.

But you don't have that approach here because of the politics of it. If you run this as an administrator and you say, look, we're going to have like two and a half percent fraud and misuse. And we're going to reimburse things that we shouldn't have. We'll eat the cost. We can bake that in, uh, that's okay financially, but it's not okay from a political PR standpoint.

If you come up with that one time, somebody bought a, uh, you know, some [00:39:00] hemp or, uh, uh, a bong, you know what I mean? Uh, they get reimbursed for a bong or a six pack of Bud Light and it's like game over. Right.

Grant Hewitt: we're, we're not going to talk about it, but they still use the same example out of Arizona. That occurred in like 2015 or 2014 as justification in every debate in the country around the essays, there was one bad spin, and it, we still talk about it, but I think you're hitting on something you used a word.

that to everybody listening is like it's in common sense you said misuse of funds this is how we talk about the misuse of medicaid dollars medicare dollars it's misuse in education when you talk about an education savings account the only word used is fraud no one uses misuse In fact, you can't find it anywhere.

Everybody's like, no fraud, no fraud. you had the same [00:40:00] requirement on Medicaid as you did on an education savings account, we wouldn't be treating anybody in this country. We wouldn't write a check in healthcare, they don't. There's just something different about how people get their heads around kind of usage.

And this kind of usage, and I do believe, however you want to frame the question, it continues to come back to a deep rooted belief in parents. And do you believe if the neighbor across the street has the ability to educate your kid, educate their kid, or not? And that's just the reality that we sit in. Uh, I said earlier that education savings accounts are the second best. towards the free market. What we're seeing in Oklahoma in their homeschool tax credit is by far the best. it is a simple check the box, trust the family that they actually did it. Uh, but look at Oklahoma in their two tax credit, direct tax credit programs, not scholarship program, but [00:41:00] direct 7, 000 for people choosing a private school accredited. Or 2, 000 for homeschooling. They didn't trust those homeschoolers enough to do it. They're only giving them two grand. And, and when you look at the appropriation allowed under those tax credits, they are vastly different. that was one of the things I wanted to point out about ESAs. We have yet to see an ESA, sorry. I say yet, Arizona does this, but in most ESA programs, they're still funded by an appropriation. So you are still at the mercy every single fiscal year to having the debate at the legislature much are we going to fund the program and that in and of itself limits freedom and we shouldn't have that. But you know, I think there's another conversation we had another time last week. About the ecosystem and the development of unconventional learning models in this country. They [00:42:00] have, they have exploded. I would contend, though, they exploded to meet the demand of families, not access to government money. The National Microschooling Center based in Las Vegas, Nevada has some really interesting research on this where they point out that I think it's less than 10 percent of micro school leaders that they talked to actually accept any government money and families are finding ways to pay for this education differently.

They're finding ways, um, to negotiate differently. They're thinking, okay, I can't afford five days. I'm going to pay for two days. Uh, can I volunteer my services to the school to get my kid

Isaac: No, I mean, that's, I was going to point out about Oklahoma. It's so funny. Even the fact that they're like, okay, seven grand for private school, which will probably cover half of tuition, uh, you know, two grand for homeschoolers. It almost like acknowledges how freaking efficient these [00:43:00] homeschool parents are.

You know, the average, the average cost, if you factor in federal state, whatever for a public school student is like 15 to 20 K a year in most states. These homes, I've never met a more resourceful group in my life than homeschool moms. And this is not, by the way, we like trust parents. They can educate their kids.

For those of you who have thought about taking your kids and take control of their education, you, it doesn't mean you are literally teaching them every subject and you have to be a genius. It's just, Can parents figure out the right mix of environment resources and activities that are good for their kids?

That's really what it is. It's not like you being a genius and teaching them, but these these homeschool moms It's incredible what they will pull off The way that they will find bargains and find things in the efficiency with which they can have their kids have an excellent world class education on an absolute shoestring.

It like shows you what's possible. So this idea that it's only possible to have a great education. If you can spend 15, 20 grand a kid, like that's totally [00:44:00] untrue. If you remove some of these hurdles and people can kind of realize. How much, especially when you have a thriving ecosystem in some of the cities I've lived with a great homeschool community, how much people can come together and pool their resources and do things very, very efficiently.

Grant Hewitt: The truth is families will figure it out. Parents will figure it out. I, I've always drawn to this, this mom I met in Las Vegas. Her name is Patricia Farley. Patricia Farley has four kids. Two of them are adopted. They're all very different kids. Um, her kids. We're all in all types of schools and, and, you know, but mainly private and public schools, there was a time in Patricia's last five years that she had a kid in a micro school, a kid in a charter, a kid in a virtual, like they were just everywhere because you found what was needed for that child.

And she went and did it. And one of the things she would tell every parent she talked to is you can do it. You just have to decide that you want that ownership over the process. [00:45:00] not outsource it and that's the that's the transitioning that's happening in america is we are Seeing the shift of government service To a product that's value you value that product you're going to do a lot of things to make that product better Um, but the the other thing we have learned over the last, you know, five six years That is super important to anybody listening is that you what families really want You Is to not be forced into one solution or the other and I call this don't force the divorce Don't force a family into a zero sum game Where you can't have support of your neighborhood school and you can't homeschool or you can't go to private can have it all if the system is willing to evolve Into a into a place where it is able to Uh, segmentable or you bundleable you [00:46:00] can figure out how you want to do that if you unbundle education, but families don't want to be forced into a one size fits all solution.

They want flexibility but they also everybody has an affinity for their local school. I have an affinity for the school across the street. Doesn't mean my, the kids go there, but I love that school. It's great. Don't force that divorce. And families will be a lot more open to having a big and open honest conversation about education. But when they feel like their local school is being attacked, I don't care what they say about the condition of education in America. They think their neighborhood school is, it's why they moved there for years. I mean, we didn't talk about the ultimate school choice or educational freedom, and that's where you buy your house.

Isaac: Yeah.

Grant Hewitt: And that's the, for many Americans, still the majority of Americans, that's the only form of choice they [00:47:00] have is where do they buy their house? So we should, we should take this and have another conversation about how do we fix that problem? Cause that's a very different problem, but that's, that's school choice to the average American. Where do I buy my house?

Isaac: Uh, as you were describing the don't, don't force the divorce, you know, Hey, I want my, I want my high school sports team and band and I want my online homeschool. Um, it's almost like what we need is an open education. Right grant.

Grant Hewitt: It is. It is. Uh, you know, absolutely. I want to leave, I want to, I want to give you this one too. For years, people have looked at Idaho's micro grant program and been so confused by it because ESA take rates were less than 10%. Like, people just didn't take them. The when you didn't force the divorce when when the Idaho team [00:48:00] created a program that didn't force parents to leave their school, but gave them access to resources to customize their education.

They only gave them 50 million to start with that 50 million was gone in 48 hours and ended up being about 25 percent of the Idaho education population got access to that money. Instantly. Why? We didn't force a fake decision. We didn't say, I've got to be out of this school to get access to this. We said, here's the resources you need to customize your education.

If you want to stay in your public school, stay in your public school. We don't care. It was gone instantly. This is where the market is. This is where families are. much less restrictive and families are looking to be able to have what they like and what they need at the same time.

Isaac: I love it. Grant. What an awesome spot to end. Uh, I think I've got like 50 [00:49:00] million rabbit trails to go down now. You you're, you're an encyclopedic and your knowledge of all these States and programs. Thank you so much for having the conversation. Thanks everybody for listening.
