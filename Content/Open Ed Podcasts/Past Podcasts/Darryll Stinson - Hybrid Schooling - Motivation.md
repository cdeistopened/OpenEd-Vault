## **Repost Variation 1: The Gratitude Framework**

```Plain
This man changed everything for our family with one simple question.

When Matt Bowman first suggested I could pull my kids out of school for learning adventures, I thought he was trying to get them expelled.

"Is that even allowed?" was my first reaction.

But that conversation planted a seed: What if there was a different way?

The law of exposure is real: the mind when stretched never returns to its original form.

My kids experienced that firsthand. They listened to my business calls in the car and were ready to run companies by summer's end. They saw the Grand Canyon. They missed more school than the attendance secretary wanted but stayed on honor roll and student council.

Most importantly, they learned they have a say in their future.

Here's what I know now that I wish I knew then: Your parental instincts about what's best for your child are probably right. The question isn't whether you're qualified to make educational decisions for your kids.

The question is: Are you ready to discover what becomes possible when you stop accepting limitations that don't actually exist?

Thanks Matt Bowman for opening my mind to what was possible. Sometimes the most important conversations start with "Is that even allowed?"

## **Repost Variation 2: The Transformation Story**

```Plain
"Our kids are way smarter. They would listen to me do sales calls in the car. They're ready to run businesses now."

That's what I discovered when I took Matt Bowman's "crazy" advice.

I've always been a disruptor by nature. I've spent my career helping people break free from systems that don't serve them. But when it came to my kids' education, I was just following rules without question.

Then Matt suggested something that sounded insane: "Just pull them out of school for a couple weeks and take them on some learning adventures."

"This dude is trying to get my kids expelled," I thought.

But I couldn't unhear that question: What if there was a different way?

We tested it. The kids went wild at first—they wanted to be in school. But we saw the Grand Canyon. They listened to my business calls and were ready to run companies. They missed significant school time but kept their honor roll status and student council positions.

The law of exposure hit hard: the mind when stretched never returns to its original form.

Now they notice the rigidity when they're back in traditional school. They miss the adventure. They've learned they have a say in their future.

Sometimes the advice that sounds craziest is exactly what we need to hear.

## **Repost Variation 4: The "Disrupted the Disruptor" Framework**

```Plain
Plot twist: The disruptor got disrupted.

I've spent my career helping people break free from systems that don't serve them. My TEDx talk has 2+ million views teaching transformation. But when it came to my kids' education, I was following rules without question.

Then Matt Bowman said something that stopped me cold: "Just pull them out of school for a couple weeks and take them on some learning adventures."

"Is that even allowed?" I asked.
"This dude is trying to get my kids expelled," I thought.

But here's the thing about real disruptors—we recognize truth when we hear it.

That conversation planted a question I couldn't ignore: What if there was a different way?

We tested it. My kids went from traditional students to entrepreneurs-in-training. They listened to my business calls and were ready to run companies. They experienced real learning adventures. They maintained honor roll status while missing significant school time.

The law of exposure: the mind when stretched never returns to its original form.

Sometimes you need another disruptor to show you where you've stopped disrupting.

Thanks Matt Bowman for reminding me that educational freedom isn't just theory—it's available to every family willing to ask "What if?"

\#disruptor \#educationalfreedom \#transformation

## **Repost Variation 5: The "Permission" Framework**

```Plain
"Now they're at school, but they notice the rigidity. Now they're at school, but they miss the adventure."

That's what happened after my kids tasted educational freedom.

I needed permission to believe it was possible. Matt Bowman gave me that permission with one conversation.

"Just try it out for a bit," he said. "You don't have to make a fork-in-the-road decision right now. Just pull them out of school for a couple weeks and take them on some learning adventures."

I thought he was crazy. "This dude is trying to get my kids expelled."

But sometimes we need someone else to give us permission to do what we already know is right.

The result? My kids are way smarter. They listen to my business calls and are ready to run companies. They've experienced real learning that matters to them. They maintained honor roll while missing significant school time.

The law of exposure is real: the mind when stretched never returns to its original form.

Here's your permission: You have way more educational freedom than you think. The question isn't whether you're allowed to make different choices for your child's education.

The question is: Are you ready to give yourself permission to explore what's possible?

# Darryll Stinson

**Darryll Stinson:** [00:00:00] your freedom reminds people of their lack thereof. And the truth is, is that all the feedback that we were excited sort of getting where we were, like putting our toe in the water with, like letting 'em know what was going on. The deep part of it, it was all a response because if this was a better pathway, then that would remind them that man, they could have thought of something different The law of exposure, the mind went stretched, never returns back to its original

**Matt Bowman:** Wow. Well said.

**Darryll Stinson:** So now they're at school, but they notice the rigidity. Now they're at school, but they missed the adventure.

  

**Matt Bowman:** Hello everyone. Welcome to the Open Ed podcast today. This is Matt Bowman, the host today. We're so excited to have one of my favorite people on our show today. His name's Daryl Stinson. You're gonna get to know his story and, uh, I've always just been an admirer of what he's accomplished in his life. So, [00:01:00] buckle up, stay tuned, listen in, and, uh, you're gonna enjoy the journey with me.

**Matt Bowman:** So Darrell, welcome to the Open Ed podcast.

**Darryll Stinson:** Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Thank you for having me, bro. I'm so excited to get into it with you today.

**Matt Bowman:** It is great to see you again. So, uh, we're gonna start with your childhood and I just want to hear kind of how, where you grew up, what was schooling like, what was learning viewed as, kind of the contrast between the two, what motivated you in schooling? And then take us through kind of childhood into high school and then we'll stop there.

**Matt Bowman:** And then it kind of, I wanna hear your college. Decision tree like where, how you chose and how athletics fit in. And we'll go to that point. So,

**Matt Bowman:** Daryl, tell us

**Darryll Stinson:** Nah. Cool, man. Yeah, I'm originally from Jackson, Michigan, so home of Tony Dungy for all the sports

**Darryll Stinson:** fans out there. Um, about an hour. The west, uh, hour west of Detroit. Um, hour south of Michigan State. Um, so, um, man, for [00:02:00] me. My mom was a junior senior. She's in between junior and senior year. Um, when she had me, my father was a freshman in college.

**Darryll Stinson:** Um, they had just lost, uh, my brother before me a few days after. Um, I was, he was born

**Darryll Stinson:** and so like, I was sort of like, uh, the child that was like, you know, the makeup for the one that they were grieving.

**Darryll Stinson:** Um, and so my mom really clung. She was really overprotective of me. I. Um, I had some of the same health complications that he died from in early on, so lots of real severe asthma, um, pneumonia. Um, and my mom was really frightened by that. My dad was chasing the dream in college and trying to, you know, make it to the NFL. He's a very, really good athlete as well, just like I was, I got it from him. It runs in our family and, uh, mom was just trying to make it, she actually ended up going to school for a little bit, um, trying to like work out, you know. Being a mom, um, [00:03:00] you know, trying to still keep this guy around to be around his son and then trying to like, figure out how to take care of me and she just couldn't keep up with it. So she, um, you know, dropped outta school even though she was like really smart. Um, I was like a engineer, um, in school to be one and, um. You know, had to take care of me. Um, and was really scared that since my father was like in college, chasing the dream, that, and not like, as active in my life, that I would be like soft or like lack the presence of a real father. Um, so she was real hard on me, um, and kind of the old way of, you know.

**Darryll Stinson:** Parenting where she, you know, she used to spank me a lot and, um, you know, anytime I would want to like cry or talk back, she just threatened me or hit me in the mouth and say, you better stop crying, or, boy, I gave you something to cry about. And, um, it just sort of created this thing in me where like I, I, I thought like I.

**Darryll Stinson:** My emotions, my, uh, who I was authentically was not okay. Uh, I wasn't supposed to be emotional in the ways that I was. Um, [00:04:00] and it wasn't just her, it was my community that didn't respect it. It was growing up in low income in the streets, basically. You know, it wasn't cool to be an emotional dude in a creative, even though that's who I was at my core. Um, and you know, I know we're talking to a lot of parents that are listening to this, you know. I say, always ask questions to your child about what they're going through and ask, you know, ask more than once. Um, because sometimes the first answer that we, you know, kids learn, we learn our parents and we learn how to tell 'em what they need to hear or enough just to check their box of the check in. And I sort of played that system with my mom and it was a very dangerous system that we were playing because she was living with the illusion that I was fine and I was building. Internal hatred for myself,

**Darryll Stinson:** because I wasn't being who I was meant to be in the world. I was being what other people sort of liked and loved and accepted.

**Darryll Stinson:** So I actually changed everything about myself to fit in with other people. I went from being an all a student who [00:05:00] was on this trajectory to be, you know. You know, uh, uh, probably Summa Ude, you know, to skipping school, selling drugs, living the wrong lifestyle. Um, all because I wanted to fit in with this, you know, essentially this group of black students who were teasing me for talking white. Um, and sports was the thing that enabled me to not have to like, deal with that emotional insecurity. 'cause people didn't care if I was going to the basement party with the black people or the bonfires with the whites. All they cared about is that I was, um. You know, playing against a lot of soon to be NFL and NBA athletes. Uh, so I fell in love with what that was doing for my ego and, um, how that was causing people to give the illusion of love towards me while meanwhile developing a deep insecurity, not knowing who loved me for me, and who loved me for what they could get. From me. Um, so I was just [00:06:00] conflicted inside. And because of the way that I was raised both by my mother and my um, community, I didn't know how to express that I was even struggling and needed help.

**Darryll Stinson:** So we say we're going through it, ask for help. I didn't have the tools internally to access my emotion, and I told myself somehow I wasn't an emotional person. Now, this was the guy who was called a crybaby when he was younger. But because of the suppression and and identity shifting, I then became a person who didn't believe he was emotional and couldn't access emotion at all.

**Darryll Stinson:** 'cause I had suppressed my ability to feel it for so long, both with busyness and with drugs. And so long story short, I ended up getting hurt after, you know, going to Central Michigan on a full ride scholarship. Uh, to play football and, um, was supposed to be one of the next greatest athletes to come outta the state of Michigan. Um, many people know I played with like Antonio Brown, Eric Fisher, um, Draymond Green came outta my state for basketball. He was number one. I was number three. [00:07:00] So haya level athlete. Supposed to be the next thing. Got injured, actually played after back surgery for two years because of opioids and drug addiction and, uh, nerve killings and epidural shots in my back and. Everything changed when they kicked me off the team because my opioid abuse was thinning my blood to the point where every time I made contact on the field, my nose would bleed

**Matt Bowman:** Really?

**Darryll Stinson:** the coaches kicked me off. 'cause they knew that clearly it wasn't allergies like I was telling 'em it was.

**Darryll Stinson:** And I was forced to face all that emotion that I had suppressed. That I truly didn't know who I was outside of sports. And I didn't know if people liked me for me or if they just liked me for sports because I wasn't showing them me. And at this point, this had been going on from seventh grade till college, um, my junior year in college. And so I didn't even know me. I didn't know my authentic laugh.

**Darryll Stinson:** I didn't know my voice, I didn't know who I was on the inside. And so long story short, I ended up in [00:08:00] the psychiatric unit, um, from multiple suicide attempts and, um, you know, a very low, um, dark wrestle with depression. I found faith there. Two people came and witnessed to me about Christ, and I put my faith in Christ in a psychiatric unit. It gave me hope. It gave me purpose. It gave me a belief that I was here for a reason. Um, and then I found out about self-care. I did my first journal entry, saw my first counselor, did my first mindfulness exercise, and I started to see that there was this whole world that I can access in here that. Would inform the success that I wanted and craved so bad. And so I say I had a system of success as a high level athlete. I didn't have a system of self-care. And I left there determined to follow my purpose, but not at the cost of my personal health. And so, um, just a new paradigm for me where self-care was first instead of left to the margins of my life and had a lot of success, um, growing up.

**Darryll Stinson:** [00:09:00] Um, and I'll kind of pause there to let you chime in a bit.

**Matt Bowman:** Well, thank you Darrell for, for being so raw on those emotions and, uh, sharing all of that. I'd heard snips and, and pieces of that story in our conversations before, but I. That's some, that's some deep, uh, emotions you, you've learned to manage and deal with. So congratulations,

**Matt Bowman:** you've got to that point.

**Matt Bowman:** That's super cool. Thanks for sharing.

**Matt Bowman:** Uh, before we move forward, 'cause I want to

**Darryll Stinson:** Yeah,

**Matt Bowman:** then where your career took you reflect back for those parents who have kids in middle school and high school, uh, that are struggling with some of these things. A great advice to just. Talk to them, ask 'em questions multiple times, different ways.

**Matt Bowman:** Reflect back on what was, what was schooling was, was it anything, or was it just your means to play sports

**Darryll Stinson:** Yeah.

**Matt Bowman:** reckon, you know, what, what has been the learning part of that from an [00:10:00] academic side? And

**Darryll Stinson:** Uh,

**Matt Bowman:** did that matter as much as you thought it should have back in the, you know, like, talk to that a

**Darryll Stinson:** yeah, well, I mean, I mean, I was a knucklehead kid, so a I didn't know. I mean, I think deep aside, 'cause I was a nerd on the inside, I, I knew schooling and education was important and I desired to be all that I was here on the planet to be. But like, you know, I was running the streets. So like I.

**Darryll Stinson:** You know, school was just the thing that was in the way of sports.

**Darryll Stinson:** It was just the thing that was taking a long time to learn. It was busy work, it wasn't like anything. Um, so I just kind of knew how to get by and knew how to cheat and all of that stuff. And you know, I graduated high school with like a three point, like five, six GPA

**Darryll Stinson:** and then

**Matt Bowman:** Because you could perform, you knew how to jump through those hoops. Yep.

**Darryll Stinson:** And actually college I did start to have very low academic performance.

**Darryll Stinson:** 'cause I was just like, you know, it was harder to get by in college. So, you know, you actually got a couple of papers. I couldn't reverse, I couldn't sweet talk to teachers. Um, but I always tell people I [00:11:00] have, I, I had the fortune to have the right degree, but when I graduated I didn't have the experience 'cause I knew how to. Get through class, but class wasn't getting through me.

**Darryll Stinson:** Um, so I was fortunate to, uh, my, one of my, my first real job outside of college was to work for the university. I actually got a paid internship as a senior working for my alma mater in the communications department. And as a university employee, once they hired me in, um, I had the benefit to take classes for free. So as a graduate student. I actually went back and took undergraduate

**Darryll Stinson:** courses and some of those core communication classes, public speaking, three 50. Our introduction to public speaking was one of the first courses I retook

**Darryll Stinson:** as a graduate student. One of the best decisions I've ever made. I had a professor, Adam Barto, shout out to him who. Saw my potential, my [00:12:00] trajectory, and took me under his tutelage, made me a teacher's assistant immediately, even though I couldn't even put two sentences together. I was coming off of a, you know. Suicide attempt. So I was still deeply insecure and you know, I had concussions from sports and A DHD and all these things, so I was a terrible communicator, but I had a story to share.

**Darryll Stinson:** And so he helped me to learn the craft and helped me to learn about, you know, being myself a communicator. And then helped me also to become better at teaching others how to do the same.

**Darryll Stinson:** So, you know, education, once I, you know. Awakened, if you will, became extremely important and I and I, that wasn't the only class I went back and retook.

**Matt Bowman:** Well, that's a great point. We often say, choose your why or know your why, and learning needs to start with a why, especially as you get older into the college age years. If you don't know why you're studying something or learning something, it just doesn't [00:13:00] stick. But you had your why. You wanted to go back to undergrad classes that you were choosing.

**Matt Bowman:** You weren't being compelled to take those. You wanted to take those, and just that effort of wanting

**Darryll Stinson:** Yep.

**Matt Bowman:** ignites learning in a way that a compulsory program never does.

**Darryll Stinson:** Exactly. Exactly. Totally, man. So you get that. Um, now I will say for people, you know, I. I teach, you know, I worked with a lot of students in higher ed as well and mentored a lot of students over the course of the year. Spoke at a lot of high schools and colleges as a speaker, but this, this, this whole conversation around am I living my dream or my parents' dream for me is a really big conversation

**Darryll Stinson:** and it is challenging when parents. Sometimes have a limited view of who they think their kid is, because sometimes the kid doesn't even feel safe to be fully expressed in the home

**Darryll Stinson:** and unbeknownst to the parents, they don't know, you know, Um, but you can always tell when your kids feel more [00:14:00] free around their friends than they do around you. You might not know what else is in their heart to do, um, because they're not. Like, you know, being all of who they are around you. And so I would find myself a lot as, you know, a faculty staff member on campus. And even as you know, our, my church was on a college campus, so we did a lot of mentorship, um, of students in college and everyone trying to find their career path. And I just think that we need to do more due diligence as parents of really helping our kids to discover their dream, you know, work situation in life and how they want to spend, you know, their talents and. And so, you know, I would just double click there and just say for anybody in that phase with people, just ask more discovery questions.

**Darryll Stinson:** I wish, um, I had parents that would've asked me more questions and didn't assume just because I said I wanted to be a professional athlete, that that was everything in my [00:15:00] heart to do.

**Darryll Stinson:** Um, and I wish they knew me more holistically. Um, and sometimes when you've got a kid who's really good at something, you're like, but you're great at it, but you're great at math, but you're great at sports.

**Darryll Stinson:** And it's like, yeah, but I would be great at something else if I developed it. You know? And so just be more curious instead of prescriptive. Um,

**Matt Bowman:** Oh, I love that. And also, just to add to what you were saying, uh, chapter in, in our book that we just published is parents don't, don't let your reputation get in the way of your kids.

**Darryll Stinson:** Mm,

**Matt Bowman:** it's so easy to have the parent reputation drive.

**Darryll Stinson:** Yes.

**Matt Bowman:** you are allowing your children to do and learn, and you just gotta get out of that.

**Matt Bowman:** You gotta let the child lead and do and become instead and give up your, oh, I get to be able to say this at a family union or at the church setting, or whatever. Sometimes that reputation of the parent is the biggest [00:16:00] stumbling block for a child to, to become creative.

**Darryll Stinson:** right. Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm glad you brought that up. That's a great point.

**Darryll Stinson:** A hundred percent. Mm-hmm.

**Matt Bowman:** So tell, so what, so you were working at the college then what? What was your next job after that?

**Darryll Stinson:** Uh, so then, uh, did really well there. Won two awards in higher education for marketing and branding as part of that team, and took that success and took a leap of faith and became a speaker, you know, felt the calling to do so. Um, and I started in marketing consultant and basically ran that play for about seven years where I was a marketing consultant.

**Darryll Stinson:** By day. Um, and, uh, excuse me, I was a more like a volunteer pastor by day marketing consultant by night. Um, marketing consulting just paid better. So that's why I say by day, 'cause they paid the bills, pastor, they paid nothing. Um, and so I was doing that for seven years. Man. Lots of teaching, preaching. Discipleship in churches. [00:17:00] Um, primarily a local church, but you know, obviously some guest appearances here and there. And then a ton of like marketing, consulting, training, um, a handful of like. Athletic teams that wanted me to come be like motivational speaker. And I just kept hiring coaches, hiring coaches, getting better, getting better, getting out there, getting better, getting out there. 'cause I was just so committed to changing as many lives as possible 'cause I had to survive suicide. So I just, well like man, I wanna save any, as many people as I can. Um, and then I sort of, you know, I had always trained speakers to some degree. But it wasn't until like after my Ted Talk, um, came out and it did 2.1 million views in a year and a half, and I was on tour doing all these stages in the spirit of changing the world that I, I, uh, this is embarrassing that meant, but I realized that I, my story alone wasn't gonna change the world. I know that everyone's like, no, [00:18:00] duh, Sherlock. Like that was your epiphany in this story. But I mean, when you're, when you watch people drop, pull out, um, a sandwich bag of o of pills that they were getting ready to overdose on that night, but they came to hear you 'cause they saw your banner or, or the speaker when they were on campus. And when you've got. Drones of people when I'm doing churches coming and putting their faith in Christ 'cause of this moving testimony, like, you think you're gonna change the world,

**Darryll Stinson:** right? And so like it just realized that like, man, I'm doing everything and there's still this, I just ripped it. I mean, God just used me.

**Darryll Stinson:** It was astonishing. I poured my heart out like everyone was in awe of what just happened. But there's this like dude in the back with his arms crossed with glasses on. And I done did everything that I could to reach this person. And then I realized like, oh, okay, I'm just not his cup of tea,

**Matt Bowman:** Right.

**Darryll Stinson:** or he doesn't [00:19:00] need encouragement, he needs training.

**Darryll Stinson:** You know, like, or whatever that was. And it was like, oh, this moment where I'm like, it's only gonna change. The world is only gonna change when I help. Other people to articulate their genius, to share their story with other people. And when we all do that, 'cause I believe all of our world's problems are locked into a person, every problem that exists is because some person is an unwilling to share their solution to that problem. And if they are sharing it, they're sharing it in a. Small level instead of a big level, they're hoarding it instead of sharing it with as many people as possible. Because I believe that God locks solutions inside of people. And so, um, uh, man, I started to really pour into other communicators so that they can get their messages out there.

**Darryll Stinson:** And you know, that's where you and I'm

**Darryll Stinson:** at.

**Matt Bowman:** that's how you amplify that impact.

**Darryll Stinson:** Exactly. To get them to share and, and, and, and what I learned is. When you speak in congruence with who you are, [00:20:00] while you are giving speeches, God is working on you

**Matt Bowman:** Great

**Darryll Stinson:** everything you teach, you have to ingest first, so it becomes one of the greatest forms of personal development. Because if I'm gonna teach people to be creative, innovative, forward thinking, have better mental health, have grow their business, whatever the thing is, then I gotta then practice what I preach and it makes me accountable to my own transformation. And so, uh, I, I do a lot of transformation work and personal development because you can't separate what you say with your lips from how you're living your life. And that's a big part of what I help

**Matt Bowman:** So true.

**Matt Bowman:** Well said, darl. Well, yeah, again, listeners, you're, we're getting gold, gold nuggets from an expert here. Thank you, darl.

**Matt Bowman:** Uh, let's, let's, let's continue down a personal path. Uh, your family. Tell us a little about what you can about your wife and kids.

**Darryll Stinson:** Yeah, totally man. So, uh, [00:21:00] met my wife when I was a freshman in college. It's not a pretty story. It wasn't like I saw her across the room and knew she was my wife. In fact, I was dating somebody else. She was doing her thing and it was like not a good experience. Um, we kind of messed around in college a bit and went our separate ways.

**Darryll Stinson:** And then, um, when we both like gave our hearts to Christ, we ended up attending the same church and, uh,

**Matt Bowman:** Where were you living

**Darryll Stinson:** Uh, we was in Mount Pleasant, Michigan.

**Darryll Stinson:** Still, I was still, yeah, still doing my thing. I was working for the university and all

**Matt Bowman:** Okay.

**Darryll Stinson:** and, um, and uh, we started doing bible studies, you know, like trying to keep it together, hold it till marriage, you know, as Christians.

**Darryll Stinson:** And, you know, one time she, uh. We're supposed to go to the library to have Bible study and she says, you know, you should just do it at your place. And I tell the people that Bible study turned into body study, you know, so, you know, we had a baby after that. [00:22:00] And um, uh, I have three daughters. Um, one son. Uh, my daughters are 11, 8 6 and my son is two. And, uh, we have one in the oven

**Matt Bowman:** Oh, you do?

**Matt Bowman:** I did not know that.

**Matt Bowman:** Congratulations.

**Darryll Stinson:** Thank you. So baby number five is on the way. Uh, we're not having more. We wouldn't have had this one if I did reschedule my surgery. Uh, but man, three girls, a boy and another missed mystery child on the way. Um, uh, I can tell you vulnerably for this audience, I know this probably serve some people that like it was really challenging for me to be a parent in the beginning. Um, you know, I told you about my father. He did end up coming in my life or, you know, more actively around three, um, and then a little bit more around five. And then he was, you know, pretty much joint custody from there on up. Um, but I was always like little brother to him more than son. I.

**Matt Bowman:** Okay.

**Darryll Stinson:** Because his, he didn't have, his [00:23:00] father was like the, the, the most disconnected father you could ever imagine.

**Darryll Stinson:** Like he, you know, never mentored, never taught, never did any of that stuff. Dads do. He was just kind of just around. and then my, my dad, my mom and dad were never together, so I didn't grow up with this family unit. Um, my mom moved to Detroit from Jackson, Michigan. Um, when I. Went to high school and so, um. You know, there's a big part of that where mom was, you know, in Detroit, and I'm just growing up with dad and, and you know, Jackson and doing my own thing. So I didn't have a good model for how to be a father, um, or a husband. Um, I always tell people that like, um, I, I used, we didn't have a formal dining room growing up.

**Darryll Stinson:** We used to just eat, kind of standing up. And so I ate like that for the first couple years of our marriage. Like my mom, my wife would make. Sit down dinner and I wouldn't be standing up and I'd scarf it down and she'd like be ready to say prayer and I had no idea why she's taking so long to [00:24:00] eat.

**Matt Bowman:** Wow,

**Darryll Stinson:** And it took, it took me a long time to rewire my nervous system to where I felt normal sitting down at the dinner table, just having connected family meal. Um, on top of that, you know, parent-wise, like it was very much like physically present, but emotionally absent parenting. Um, and so it was challenging for me to connect on an emotional level with my kids. Um, I always felt like they, um, had joy that I didn't have. You know, I had to grow up real fast. My mom had two younger sisters by another, um, man.

**Darryll Stinson:** And so I was often, you know, babysitting a lot growing up. So, you know, my ability to just like play and giggle and board games was very low with my children. You know, my tension span for that stuff was very short. And you add that on top of the fact that I was a suicide survivor and living with this urgency of life. So it was very hard for me just to be like. Oh, I just spent this time playing a video game for an hour instead of like doing a webinar and changing [00:25:00] someone's life.

**Darryll Stinson:** Um, so the parenting journey was extremely hard for me, and, and if I'm honest, it still is one of my biggest insecurities. Um, and you and I met at a time where, I've always been a disruptor by nature. I've always wanted to go against the grain. I never wanted to fit in any box, so I already hated traditional education and, and especially when I learned how to communicate and actually like, shift and transform behavior. I hated how things were being taught 'cause they were not transformative and they, they were just, it was like the slowest way to learn information ever. I already was like, I wish I could find a different way for my kids. And so then I met you and I'm like, wait, what? Like, people are like doing this. And then I'll never forget our conversation we had and you're like, dude, just try it out for a bit. You don't have to [00:26:00] like, you don't have to like make a, like a, a fork in the road decision right now, man.

**Darryll Stinson:** Just pull 'em outta school for a couple weeks and take 'em on some learning adventures and see how they go. And I'm like. This dude is trying to get my kids expelled.

**Matt Bowman:** I remember your first question was, is that allowed? Right.

**Darryll Stinson:** I'm like, is this dude serious? And then I'm like, it is. 'cause he's white and I'm black. I can't do that. Like, I'm going to jail. Like, I don't know what's going on. And, and, and it, it just, my, I am telling you, like, we talk about paradigms, right? Like I just couldn't, my, I couldn't wrap my mind around it. I was like, it's a scam.

**Darryll Stinson:** It's only because whatever, like,

**Darryll Stinson:** and so, but it opened, it, it, it, it, it sat with me and I couldn't unhear it. And so like you and I had

**Matt Bowman:** To say that

**Darryll Stinson:** Yeah. I couldn't unhear, I couldn't unhear like, like what if. What if it was possible that there was a different [00:27:00] way to have my child self-direct their own learning?

**Darryll Stinson:** Like what if there was a different way to do it that wasn't career suicide or sabotage,

**Matt Bowman:** wasn't closing doors. Yeah.

**Darryll Stinson:** wasn't closing doors or shutting down opportunity or ruining a child's future. It was actually one of the most powerful, empowering things we could do. What if? And it just, I couldn't unhear that question. And so, you know, long story short, I think we just ended up trying and doing it.

**Darryll Stinson:** I think, well, what it was is we took the summer.

**Matt Bowman:** Yeah.

**Darryll Stinson:** And we said, okay, let's pretend

**Darryll Stinson:** that we're running at home education during the summer to know if we wanna send them to school or not for the year. That's kind of what we were making. And the kids were going wild, by the way. Like, Like, they, they wanted to be in school.

**Darryll Stinson:** My oldest to, or my oldest. My oldest two wanted to be in school. My youngest one could, she could care less [00:28:00] like, but the oldest who really wanted the social interaction, the schedule, they were used to the friends that they were around. So they did not wanna be missing out on anything. And it was challenging.

**Darryll Stinson:** 'cause again, I was like. They're kids, right? They don't know what they don't know. They might hate me now and love me later for this tough just choice that I made. So I'm like, I owe it to them to just be like, I'm not gonna let a, you know, 7-year-old and a 9-year-old. Tell me what to do. And I'm like, all right, we're gonna run this play and we're gonna do summer school.

**Darryll Stinson:** So we did it. It was fun. We took trips, we went across the country. We saw the Grand Canyon and. Loved it. It was like we're learning so much more stuff. Our kids are way smarter. They would listen to me do sales calls in the car. They're ready to run businesses now, like this is, this is the dream. And they did not want to keep it the dream. They wanted to go back to school. So I was like, okay, this, Matt told me about this. It's fine. Let 'em do what they wanna do. It's self-directed. It's not forced. All right, cool. [00:29:00] So

**Matt Bowman:** and especially, lemme just make, make a point here for our listeners. We never criticize the choice to send your child to the boundary District school.

**Matt Bowman:** If that's the choice you're making kudos. We applaud that. Just make that a choice instead of a default.

**Matt Bowman:** There's, it's my only option.

**Darryll Stinson:** yes, yes, a hundred percent. So they chose to go back and, and, but here's what happened. The law of exposure, the mind went stretched, never returns back to its original

**Matt Bowman:** Wow. Well said.

**Darryll Stinson:** So now they're at school, but they notice the rigidity. Now they're at school, but they missed the adventure. Now they see dad's going to Colorado and they want to go, but they can't go 'cause they got choir, you know?

**Darryll Stinson:** And then they're like, oh. And I'm like, well, you

**Darryll Stinson:** know. [00:30:00] You can just come.

**Matt Bowman:** It's your

**Darryll Stinson:** Hey, my friend Matt, my friend Matt said we, we can do whatever we want. Just send him a note. And we did, bro, we pulled him out. We took him on some of my travel trips. We, you know, took longer extended vacations. We broke the system. We had high levels of anxiety, of thinking we were foolish, uh, we were gonna get our kids kicked out.

**Darryll Stinson:** We also were kind of worried about the social perception that like, oh, they can just do whatever they want and we're in the matrix. So, um, that sucks. You know? What are you doing going on an adventure while you stay in school? You know, and it's like. We felt bad about that, that I felt like our kids were like, kind of becoming better than a little bit.

**Darryll Stinson:** Um, I know it was a weird dynamic. It's still one of my concerns, to be honest with you. Um,

**Matt Bowman:** because why? Why do Darryl's kids get to do that?

**Darryll Stinson:** [00:31:00] why, why wait you, because they, the, they missed it was more than, I think it was like over a hundred days of school or something crazy. It was like they missed like half of school, like. Still had good grades and still were like student council leaders somehow.

**Darryll Stinson:** And still, and still it worked out perfectly fine. 'cause they'd be dinking around half the time in school anyways. And you could just catch up. And now my kids, now I got the entrepreneur bug. Now my daughter starts a new business every, you know, 90 days and just burns our money in the ground and, and, but. They're, they're expressed, they're learning, and they see that they have a, uh, say in their future. And so, you know, currently we're running that play right now, and we're still like hybrid, you know, model where, you know, there's a lot of self-directed learning at home and experience, which a lot is just job shadowing us [00:32:00] and being in exposed. Um, and then they're in school, enrolled in, um, you know, doing all the normal things. All the other children do.

**Matt Bowman:** Oh, Darrell, that summary is, is priceless. That is such a great way to capture that, mix, that hybrid that.

**Matt Bowman:** You know, people don't know what to call it. We call it open education, which is just tapping into all the resources available, merging those with your child's interests

**Matt Bowman:** and, and wrapping around the resources you can find, like you are doing exactly what we, we advocate, Darryl, that parents do.

**Matt Bowman:** And it's still not easy, it's messy. Uh, we, we want to make sure parents grant themselves permission. To be messy and know that it's still in the benefit of your children. Uh, you're teaching them principles of, of taking control and ownership of their own life, their own education, their own [00:33:00] learning. Those are skills and values that you, you're passing on that are infinitely more, more important.

**Matt Bowman:** So that's just so awesome. And tell us about your wife's experience with that, because a lot of. Dads and moms have these conversations back and forth of, oh, but you're just off working and I've gotta, you know, deal with the hybrid schedule and like, talk about that negotiation. 'cause we, we talk a lot about family needs, need to be also identified and can't be ignored.

**Matt Bowman:** Uh, there are family needs that need to be mixed in with the education design. So tell us about her thoughts and perceptions and experience.

**Darryll Stinson:** Totally. So my wife, um, actually has her master's degree in science administration. I like just have a bachelor's. Um, I do actually want to get my master's for whatever reason. Like, I just, I wanna get, I would've love to have my PhD to be honest with you. Um, but, uh, it's weird because I'm so non-traditional, [00:34:00] but I want it for other reasons. Um,

**Matt Bowman:** You have a Y.

**Darryll Stinson:** yeah, yeah, yeah. But my wife is like, my, my point is number one, so. She has her master's degree. Her, parents are all like traditional. They, they're like, don't break the box. Like that's, that's like their MO as a family, like they have for decades. Every holiday ate dinner at two o'clock, like just running the same play forever. Like dinner's not even at two, bro. It's like, it's like, it's like thought somebody over the course of the last 40 years would've been like, maybe we should try five

**Darryll Stinson:** dinner to this, you know? But no, two o'clock. So anyways, um,

**Matt Bowman:** So she's had to first, you know, face that.

**Darryll Stinson:** yes. And one of the people we, me, I love her family and one of the people we both respect the most out of that side of the family is her grandma.

**Darryll Stinson:** Her grandma was um, and the assistant to a dean of a uni, or the president of the university, assistant to [00:35:00] the president of the university for like her entire career as tenure. And so I say all that to say like the thought pulling our children out of school. I mean, you would've thought we were switching religions.

**Matt Bowman:** Right.

**Darryll Stinson:** And doesn't it feel like that sometimes when we think about pulling our kids and doing something different than what, you know, culture says is acceptable. We feel like, yo, we're changing religions here. Like we're violating sacred, we're cows. Like, it's like, it's, it's, it's, it's a, it's a, it feels vulnerable and exposed and scary. So for her it was a lot. She was just like. And because she didn't have the, she didn't meet you. She just knew. I, I always talk to people and say, everybody's amazing, right? So I'm like, oh, I met this guy, Mike Tech High at the time, right? And he's amazing. Him, he said he, can we pull our schools kids outta school?

**Darryll Stinson:** And she's like, so I'm like, bro, you're gonna have to help me with this conversation. So, So, I'm like, send me a podcast, some resources. Explain this to her. So you got on a call with [00:36:00] us. Um, it did help that I was coaching you on your

**Darryll Stinson:** TED Talk at the time. just helped her to start to see like, Hey, this is not an unwise decision. Like this is just an option. Let's just look at it as an option. And so I think that was helpful to go from like, okay, like I'm not forcing you to do this right now. It isn't as scary as you think. Let's get you in the mindset of possibility and thinking of it as an option.

**Matt Bowman:** Yep,

**Darryll Stinson:** And so, yeah, so that was really helpful for her journey.

**Darryll Stinson:** And then from there, I mean, that experiment was helpful too, um, to, you know, be able to have that summer with our kids where we could see the benefit of alternative education and supplemental education in a different way of educating. Um, and then, um, into their own like. Lack of fulfillment when they went back into the belly of the beast. So, you know, after we tried it for that summer, I think she was on the other side, I think she flipped and changed and saw it and she was more like, man, now I feel bad. Like now I feel [00:37:00] like I'm sending them into something that's less good for them.

**Matt Bowman:** Right.

**Darryll Stinson:** So it was a big

**Darryll Stinson:** change

**Matt Bowman:** the tough emotion too,

**Darryll Stinson:** Oh it is.

**Darryll Stinson:** Oh, it's a big thing. Like am I now like. Again, I had to ask myself a question. No, they want to go, but now am I doing the thing where like it's clearly better and I'm like letting them

**Darryll Stinson:** choose their life. And yeah. And now it's like I'm making a decision that's not the best for them as a father is, is that, you know, is a worry or a concern that I had, um, not a truth that I was facing, but a worry or a concern that I had. So, you know, we're still navigating that man. There's part of us that still feels like that. Not just 'cause of the the education, but if I can be honest with you, the food. The food is terrible.

**Darryll Stinson:** Um, and there's a whole level of what I'm learning about healthy eating and, you know, what we're putting in our food that's just like, I don't even want them to, you know, stay after school for practice and eat processed

**Darryll Stinson:** food, um, that, you know, uh, [00:38:00] doesn't serve them and their body well.

**Darryll Stinson:** So,

**Matt Bowman:** interesting whole tangent that we could go down.

**Matt Bowman:** Uh, but it's just the idea that our kids are more than just students in a desk,

**Matt Bowman:** right? That are empty brains that need to be filled with a lecture like that. There's so much more in schooling.

**Darryll Stinson:** Yeah.

**Matt Bowman:** That happens around food, fitness, you know, nutrition, knowledge, social, uh, attitudes, political, like all of that is wrapped up into what happens and it's, it's hard to know how to navigate that.

**Matt Bowman:** And so, you know, very interesting that you brought up a completely different category

**Matt Bowman:** of something that matters to your family.

**Matt Bowman:** And each of your children are different and have different needs on nutrition. Right. So yeah, I can totally see that. So, well, super interesting. anything else on the [00:39:00] learning journey of your wife or how has she dealt, dealt with her family?

**Matt Bowman:** What, what tools and strategies did she do to embrace that difference with a, a family that's not used to change?

**Darryll Stinson:** totally. All right. I know this is a podcast, but I need all the listeners to help your boy out. Don't tell nobody. Downtown, but I don't think her parents know. I don't think they know, man, what you don't know won't hurt you. You

**Matt Bowman:** All right.

**Darryll Stinson:** So, so, so, so they, I don't think they really know. Um, the times that we kind of tried to poke and mention and, oh, well, don't they have school?

**Darryll Stinson:** You know, it's like, yeah, it's cool. It's alright. You know, because it's not worth the argument. They it. Because here's the thing, here's the thing that I would say, I think this is important for your listeners. Sometimes your freedom reminds people of their lack thereof. And the truth is, is that all the feedback that we were excited sort of getting where we were, like putting our toe in the water [00:40:00] with, like letting 'em know what was going on. The deep part of it, it was all a response because if this was a better pathway, then that would remind them that man, they could have thought of something different or a better way to parent, or, and I think they were, were rubbing off on like, well, if you're doing a, a different quote, unquote, better way. We did a, a, a way that wasn't of highest service and that is confronting to face that reality. So we had to learn that that's what we were dealing with and just be like, you know, we don't wanna create that tension, or, and that's not even our belief,

**Darryll Stinson:** but that's, you know, their

**Darryll Stinson:** interpretation of our behavior. And so we just left it alone.

**Matt Bowman:** Yeah. I respect that. I really do. I think it's, uh, you know, sometimes when new sc new things are discovered in one's life, you, you push that on everybody because you want them to all to know.

**Matt Bowman:** And sometimes, you know, even what you said [00:41:00] earlier, you could never unhear

**Matt Bowman:** what. You and I chatted about sometimes people rather not hear some of that because it makes them question, makes them feel some guilt, anxiety, doubt of what they chose, even though you don't want them to.

**Matt Bowman:** 'cause you know, you're definitely not retro applying judgment.

**Matt Bowman:** Uh, but you don't want them to feel that. And so you're being sensitive that I, I, I respect that. I'm a hundred percent.

**Darryll Stinson:** Yeah.

**Matt Bowman:** Super interesting.

**Matt Bowman:** Well, good. Well tell us now, let's, you know, kind of end we're at, uh, as we wrap up here, I wanna have people hear about your, your leadership coaching, uh, programs.

**Matt Bowman:** How, how to, like, what have you found from that? I know you're doing, you're, you're doing your own podcast. We're gonna, you know, I hope to be on that one day.

**Darryll Stinson:** Come

**Matt Bowman:** Um, so tell us about your leadership coaching services as well as. Who have you had on [00:42:00] your podcast? What are some interesting stories you've heard that others can, and then how do they find you?

**Darryll Stinson:** Yeah, totally. Thank you, man. Appreciate that. Um, number one, um, I help people to turn their message into a movement, right? And so a lot of people come to me because they're like, Hey, I know that, you know, public speaking storytelling is a great way to make an impact. And it's a great way to generate leads for a movement, a cause, you know, everything is a story. Your brand is a story. Your, you know, products that you sell is a story. Your, uh, personal identity and signature speech includes a big hero's journey of a story in it. So they, you know, a storytelling is a very valuable skill and our ability to articulate it is something that often has to be coached and trained out of us. Um, so, you know, old paradigm of communication training is like. You learn mechanics, vocal tonality, where to stand on stage, sort of this, you know, loose framework of what to say to structure your [00:43:00] speech this way. And then you go be a, you know, professional, polished speaker. Uh, I think, you know, that paradigm is very much fading, um, to black. Um, and now people want authenticity, connection, experiences, that type of thing. Um, and so, uh, it takes it. Uh, a person who can help you to read the label when you're inside the bottle. Right? So, you know, we oftentimes, you know, many people have experts curse where what's foundational to us is revelational to other people. We have this way of explaining what we do that is like techie and geeky and, um. Uh, you know, industry jargon, but it is not clear to someone to follow those beliefs in that past. So even some of the language you hear me describe open ed with, I'm sure y'all can take and go use, right? Because I'm like condensing [00:44:00] decades in today's, I'm, I'm, I'm making something short and concise and potent.

**Darryll Stinson:** There's a lot of like tools that you can learn to be able to communicate in that way, but what's most important. Is that you are able to be sensitive and read the room. Okay. And that just has to be trained. It's hard to learn it without like, like really like training. Like it, like you train for a gym, you gotta train to speak.

**Darryll Stinson:** 'cause there's so much of it that's just in your, uh, because we communicate all the time. Talk on the cell phone, talk to our wives. We have a lot of programming in how we say things. Um, we never intentionally said, well, if I were to say it intentionally, how would I say it? If I were to say it with more passion?

**Darryll Stinson:** How would I say it? We, we didn't build it that way, and so we're not used to just being in that mode, and so we gotta have it provoked out of us. We gotta have it pulled out of us. I always say, I know your authentic voice when I watch you argue. [00:45:00] You don't gotta think about how you sound. You don't gotta think about if your points or your PowerPoint is, is matching, or you're like, I got something on my heart and I'm gonna express it. You gonna hear this? And I'm like, oh. Oh, okay. Okay, so you don't have to sound like a robot, so you don't need notes, so you don't need this. What you need is permission to say what's on your heart and mind and enough craft and skills so that you're not just emotionally vomiting on people. Okay? So anywhere, any person who has a story to share, they understand that I want to use this as a means to make an impact in the lives of other people. And I wanna do it in a way that grows a movement, an organization, a cause. Man, I'm one of the best of the world of being able to help people do that. And the reason why is because it was one of my greatest areas of insecurity and weakness. I used to be so afraid to speak in front of people that I used to fake, like I had to go to the bathroom. So nobody would call on me and ask me to say, what's your name and [00:46:00] your favorite animal? One of my first speeches, I wrote it out word for word, read it into a recorder, strung the headphones up through my jacket, left one headphone in to give the audience the appearance that I forgot to take my headphones out, hit play on the recording and started to recite what the recording was saying. The problem is that I got off sync 'cause I talk a lot faster than I read, and so I started to repeat multiple sentences. I have A-D-H-D-P-T-S-D, dyslexia, clinical depression, concussions from sports. So there was a whole period of time where I had to learn. How to focus on mindfulness, and my counselor made me practice on focusing on one tooth at a time that I was brushing, and I couldn't think about work, couldn't think about what I was doing next, could think about nothing but the sensation of the tooth that I was brushing in order to [00:47:00] train my mind to stop losing its train of thought. When I started to put together my early speeches, I used Robert Pluck Nick's emotion wheel chart to pick which emotion I was feeling. 'cause I didn't even have vocabulary for emotions. But what I had, Matt was a calling to speak in a willingness. To overcome that insecurity, to overcome that inadequacy, to overcome that lack of ability to surrender to that calling to speak because I felt like I was living a second chance life, Matt. I still feel like I'm living a second chance life, and so. I believe that if you're gonna communicate, you better do it like you called Principle number one, you gotta be a thermo, a thermostat, and not a thermometer. You gotta stop coming in there fodder in the beginning. Thank you for bringing me out today and having me out here and taking five minutes to warm up before you say something worth listening to.

**Darryll Stinson:** People are giving [00:48:00] you a portion of their lifespan. Say something worth listening to be a thermostat. Set the temperature so when there's a 500 person room and 300 people show up, or there's a 500 person room and 120 people show up and it's awkward and it's a lot of space and it's quiet. Don't be like, ah, man, well, you know, you know, it's kind of, no.

**Darryll Stinson:** Come in there and set it off. Come in there and set the tone. a thermostat and guess what's gonna happen? They're gonna start to raise their temperature to you a lot. People always ask me, you know, sometimes I get an event planners that are like, Hey man, like, uh, can you do something engaging? And I'm like, oh God, their last speaker was boring. I said, man, I can do something. Engage. I don't do engagement. I am engaging, so I'm the show, right? I don't need PowerPoints, flickers, gimmicks, tricks, card games, tools. Although I do know how to do a lot of that [00:49:00] stuff. I don't need none of that. All I need is this conviction because it is. People don't move, take action unless they're moved emotionally. It don't matter what you say. Open education, better pathway. Who cares until they're moved emotionally. Until they feel like, oh man, maybe I'm limiting the possibility by being stuck in a paradigm until they feel that, hmm, they ain't changing their behavior. So we have to access that part in ourselves as communicator and allow ourselves to feel the depth of our message, lest we rob the audience of its possibility of execution. Vulnerability is not a tactic or a tool. It is a way of life that says, if I'm gonna ask you to change, I must first go there within myself. And man, um, I think like we're coming into an age, Matt, where if you're not communicating like that, [00:50:00] you're not gonna get a spot because everything else that you're gonna say, I can save money. And I can put it in chat GBT and it can say it quicker, better, and more thoroughly

**Matt Bowman:** Yeah.

**Darryll Stinson:** for free or or the pro subscription. So you better have something to say that moves me. So you better have something to say that has some conviction in it, so you better have something to say. That only comes from being so deeply connected to something that you pull out an angle that can only be extracted from human application or else you're gonna be out of a job and thumbing for donations.

**Matt Bowman:** Wow, Darrell, you have provided some insights that are beyond what I even had hoped for. So that was super, super nice,

**Darryll Stinson:** Yeah.

**Matt Bowman:** impactful, value oriented. Anyone [00:51:00] listening can, can really feel that, that passion you have, Darrell, and

**Matt Bowman:** I've always loved it and always been admirer of it. So

**Darryll Stinson:** Thank

**Matt Bowman:** how, how do people find you?

**Darryll Stinson:** Man at Stinson speaks, my last name speaks at, um, on most of the platforms. So you can just Google my name, I'm pretty Googleable. Um, email dar@darlstinson.com. Just reach out any way that I can be helpful. Um, I got a retreat coming up in August at a, I want you to come out if you can, but B, anybody that I. Just listening to this is welcome to join. We do 'em once a quarter. Um, I do a lot of networking events and, uh, uh, out, uh, throughout Franklin in the Nashville region. Um, and then, um, I'm hosting our TEDx conference in the spring of 26 here and better believe Matt Bowman's on our radar because it is a, uh, TEDx, uh, cool springs, the youth event.

**Darryll Stinson:** And so, uh, we'll only have about two adult speakers, and I just think you'd be a great addition to the lineup while we elevate these. You know, brilliant students in our community and bring a couple of like [00:52:00] heroes from abroad.

**Darryll Stinson:** Um, you know, I think he'd be a good headliner adult speaker that, you know, is speaking to a very relevant topic that all the parents in the room are gonna wanna know about. And a lot of their kids are gonna be, you know, doing a little bit of that anyways. So, I don't know, there's some alignment there. And, um. We should chat about it. So, man, tap in. Maybe you'll see Matt at the TEDx conference. Um, and if not, man, just get your message out there to the world because, uh, our world needs it. People are hurting, they're confused, they're questioning, they're worried about their future. And, uh, they're looking for answers that many of the listeners on this podcast have within them. So

**Darryll Stinson:** I hope

**Matt Bowman:** Well, it's been a pleasure, Darryl, and I've got a copy of our open education book.

**Darryll Stinson:** Let's go. Thank you.

**Darryll Stinson:** Thank you. Appreciate you.
