Build Around It

You don't have to choose between work and customized learning. Build around the system, not against it.

Sunny Simkin, a single working mom reveals how she transformed her children's education without leaving public school. After struggling with math herself, she refused to let her daughter face the same challenges. Instead of fighting the system, she built around it - combining public school with targeted programs like Mathnasium, Ninja Warrior classes, and specialized music education.

Learn how she:

- Identified her children's unique learning styles
- Found creative alternatives to traditional sports
- Improved her daughter's math performance
- Balanced work and educational enrichment
- Discovered hidden local resources

Plus: Get specific recommendations for after-school programs that actually work, including Let's Play Music, Soccer Shots, and more. Perfect for working parents who want to personalize their kids' education without homeschooling.

## Thought

"Math Anxiety: Breaking the 'Just Try Harder' Cycle"

When a child struggles with math, the default response is often "just try harder." But what if the problem isn't effort, but approach?

One OpenEd parent shares how her daughter – brilliant in every other subject – consistently tested below standard in math. Sound familiar?

The breakthrough came when she realized: This wasn't about effort. Her daughter needed a different way to learn.

Instead of doubling down on what wasn't working, she:

- Addressed the anxiety first. _Add Mathnasium plug here, on how Mathnasium removes Math anxiety first and foremost._
- Found alternative teaching methods
- Used gamified learning tools. _Another Mathnasium Plug opportunity._
- Built foundational skills at her daughter's pace

The result? Her daughter moved from "significantly below standard" to "just below standard" – a huge win that proved the problem was never about trying harder.

Remember: Your child isn't broken. They might just need a different path.

– Charlie

  

  

## Trend "The Rise of Educational Detective Work"

  

Parents are becoming educational detectives, piecing together personalized learning experiences for their kids – even while keeping them in traditional schools.

Take Sunny, a single working mom with two kids in public school. Rather than accepting a one-size-fits-all approach, she:

- Enrolled her daughter in Mathnasium to address math struggles
- Found a comprehensive music program that made learning piano fun
- Discovered "ninja warrior" classes for her son after traditional sports didn't click
- Used social media to network with other parents and find unique opportunities

This hybrid approach – combining traditional schooling with customized enrichment – is gaining traction as parents realize they don't have to choose between public school and personalization.

  

## Tool

The Parent Detective Toolkit: How to Uncover Your Child's Learning Style

Ever wish you had a crystal ball to understand what makes your child tick? While we can't offer magic, we can share this practical framework from our OpenEd parents for discovering your child's learning preferences and interests.

Step 1: Observation Journal  
Create a simple notes page in your phone with these columns:

- What gets them excited?
- When do they lose track of time?
- What makes them shut down?
- What do they talk about unprompted?

Step 2: The Social Network

- Join local parent groups on Facebook
- Follow district/community center activity pages
- Connect with other parents at pickup/dropoff
- Ask "What's working for your family?"

Step 3: The Test Drive Method  
Before committing to expensive programs:

- Try a single class/session first
- Watch for both during AND after-class reactions
- Ask "Are you glad you went?" after each session
- Look for patterns in their responses

Pro Tip: One OpenEd mom's rule of thumb: "We complete the season we commit to, then reevaluate. This teaches both commitment and the importance of giving things a fair chance while keeping the door open for change."

Remember: You're not looking for instant success – you're gathering clues about how your child learns best.

Want more detective work tips? Join our OpenEd parent community forum where families share their discovery stories and strategies.

That's all for today!

**15 - How to Overcome Math Anxiety**

> [!important] You've got to work with her harder on it ~~And I kind of was a little bit like~~ you have her for 7 hours of the day and I only get her for the few after school that she's not in her extracurricular activities What am I supposed to do ~~Like how You know~~ why isn't the need being met here in the school ~~But once you kind of can expand that sort of~~ okay this is the way that they're teaching it is not the way that she needs to learn it She needs to develop skills to overcome that the anxiety first and foremost that accompanies math so that she can clear a path toward learning So it kind of got to the point where we needed to take emergency intervention And I've got her in Mathnasium now Mathnasium's whole model is remove the anxiety build the confidence and build the foundational skills wherever they're at so that they can actually learn One of the things that they told me is I'm so glad you're bringing them in now bringing her in now ~~in 4th grade because once she gets to junior high once there's algebra if she doesn't have the basic foundational math that she needs from these grades then she's never going to catch up And that was such a validating conversation for me to have because it really like gave me this insight like oh I did do as well as I could but I didn't have those foundational skills that I should have been building in my elementary school years So yeah how am I supposed to catch up when I never had my solid footing in the first place~~

  

Here’s this clip on Riverside too: [https://riverside.fm/dashboard/editor/preview/319c6ce6-666d-4960-8349-af13eb9d214d/671fede9f95aa2dcf48e3a3a?share-token=6140fc8dd4bb71e356e9&content-shared=recording-preview](https://riverside.fm/dashboard/editor/preview/319c6ce6-666d-4960-8349-af13eb9d214d/671fede9f95aa2dcf48e3a3a?share-token=6140fc8dd4bb71e356e9&content-shared=recording-preview)

**16 - Customizing Education**

> [!important] ~~It was something along the lines of like it concretizes it's like the the mind-body connection kind of a thing um and so it's like there's so many different paths there are so many different options for your child um what has that experience been like though you know starting with the the I guess everything that you get inside of public school so like the traditional schooling model And then saying okay now for every single thing I'm going to start first with my kid understanding my kid understanding what their passions are understanding what they might be interested in understanding what they might be challenged by And then I'm going to help fill the gaps in because~~ I don't expect my school to fill the gaps in better than I can myself ~~Yeah Yeah I think that's the first step Identifying that yeah there might be places that school just can't keep up with~~ Public school is a great option for my kids It serves them so far in a way that I'm happy with It provides them the social outlets that they need It gives them well-rounded education There are aspects of their curriculums that are really really working well for them ~~in ways that I feel really grateful that they have access to particularly you know my experience~~ as a single working mom ~~I do~~ it also fills the need of me being able to work in the daytime ~~that's one thing that is always something I'm trying to solve for In my kids' education I want to customize it exactly how I want but I have to do that within the structure of what kind of support I'm actually able to give them during the daytime~~ Fortunately I have been able to identify my kids' particular learning styles and their social needs and and the things that bring them joy and motivation and try to just really feed into all of those curiosities and make sure that they have some sort of outlet for them not just kind of assume that school will handle it all ~~So I've got both of my kids in a really really cool comprehensive music education program that they take after school in a group setting that teaches them every aspect of musicianship up to and including like how to play piano~~

- [My Education growing up](https://clip.opus.pro/clip/P1101920qRW8?editType=normal#5)
    
    my education experience growing up took a few twists and turns. I grew up in a suburb of Kansas City, Kansas, where there were some of the best...
    
    schools in the country, the class sizes were limited to 15. I don't think I ever had more than 10 to 13 kids in any of my classes. And the education structure was so based on critical thinking and really like a really comprehensive learning, learning the skill of learning. And
    
    It was a great place to grow up, great place to go to basically all of my elementary school years. I moved to Utah right before I started junior high and found that it was a completely different learning model where there were a lot bigger class sizes, so a lot less personalized attention. The learning structure was really more of a
    
    memorize facts to regurgitate for tests and then move on. So it was really difficult for me to adapt to that kind of learning style, but I think the perspective that I have from having both experiences has really informed the way that I take...
    
    my kids' education and the way that I want them to be able to, yeah, like you said, customize their educational paths to be more tailored and to kind of identify and fill in the gaps that are left by their public school education.

- [When do you push your kids vs pull back?](https://clip.opus.pro/clip/P1101920qRW8?editType=normal#11)
    
    as a parent, there's the balance between knowing that something is good for your kid and then also listening to them. And sometimes your kids just don't want to, let's say they're tired. They don't want to go back to dance class. You know, they're tired. They don't want to continue doing piano lessons. When do you push them to do that versus pulling back and saying, OK, this is something that you don't actually like and it's OK?
    
    Sunny (16:59.863)  
    Mm -hmm. Mm -hmm? Yeah. -huh.
    
    Sunny (17:09.491)  
    Yeah, no, that's really important.
    
    We discuss everything that we're gonna sign up for prior and we discuss the amount of time. So we're signed up for something, then we complete the season. That's what we are committed to. We're gonna take it, if it doesn't, if it's not a great fit for us, we're gonna complete the commitment that we've made. We're gonna learn from the challenges that we had and then we're gonna reevaluate whether it's something we wanna do for the next one. I am pretty, because the thing is,
    
    you're absolutely right. Kids may love dance, but they don't want to go after they've been at school for seven hours. And the other thing that we do is just regular check -ins. Dance is probably the one because it's a huge time commitment for Clue. And sometimes she's just like, every time she doesn't want to go, we go. And then when I pick her up, say, are you glad you went? And the answer is always yes. And when it starts becoming no, then I
    
    Ela Richmond (17:58.509)  
    Mm -hmm.
    
    Sunny (18:12.951)  
    know it's time to reevaluate whether this is actually a good fit for her life.

## Rough Transcript

Ela Richmond (00:01.122)  
Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm your sometimes host, Ella Richmond. And today I have on Sunny Simkin. She's a mom of two. She is a single parent. She works inside of the learning division with so many amazing, amazing individuals. And today she's going to share her story about how she is helping her kids to create their own personalized learning experience while they're still in public school. So we've talked often about how open education is broader than just

You know, homeschool, it's broader than just Montessori. It's broader than just public school or private school. It is customizing your child's education. And I think your story perfectly encapsulates what this all means. So welcome to the podcast.

Sunny (00:44.641)  
Thanks, I'm excited to be here.

Ela Richmond (00:46.55)  
Yeah, so we were talking a little bit before we started recording and you were telling me about your experience and how really getting started as a parent and getting started in this open education movement and space, it all started with your learning experience. Can you kind of give a background onto that?

Sunny (01:04.629)  
Yeah, my education experience growing up took a few twists and turns. I grew up in a suburb of Kansas City, Kansas, where there were some of the best...

schools in the country, the class sizes were limited to 15. I don't think I ever had more than 10 to 13 kids in any of my classes. And the education structure was so based on critical thinking and really like a really comprehensive learning, learning the skill of learning. And

It was a great place to grow up, great place to go to basically all of my elementary school years. I moved to Utah right before I started junior high and found that it was a completely different learning model where there were a lot bigger class sizes, so a lot less personalized attention. The learning structure was really more of a

memorize facts to regurgitate for tests and then move on. So it was really difficult for me to adapt to that kind of learning style, but I think the perspective that I have from having both experiences has really informed the way that I take...

my kids' education and the way that I want them to be able to, yeah, like you said, customize their educational paths to be more tailored and to kind of identify and fill in the gaps that are left by their public school education.

Ela Richmond (02:52.706)  
Yeah, that's incredible. And then you were also explaining that you had a really hard time with math and like that was that was the thing that started to eliminate to you that, okay, one size fits all does not work. Right. Like you grew up believing that you just couldn't get this. So this this was a failure on your part. And then, you know, over time as an adult. Right. So you grew up as a child believing that this is a failure on your part. Right. You just can't get it. Something's wrong with you. And then as an adult, you come back to understand.

that it's not you, maybe it's the way you're learning, maybe it's the way that these concepts are being explained to you. And that starts to broaden your perspective on your children's lives, right?

Sunny (03:30.879)  
Absolutely. So math was the big one for me that I just couldn't get. And at that point, there just weren't as many options available. And there also was kind of this belief system that you go to school and school does the teaching. And if you're not learning, it's your fault and you need to try harder.

And so there wasn't any kind of intervention because it was put back on my shoulders. Well, it's your job. Do better and then you'll get it. If you just try harder, then you'll get it. Well, because of years of years and years of just really struggling to hang on, I didn't build the necessary math foundations that I needed to carry me through college. And when I went to college, I completed every single course for my major.

but

failed math so many times that I am actually not even allowed to take math again at my university. I have to take it at a different college and transfer the credits over, which means I would also at this point have to start over and take the lowest level math. So we're looking at like probably four semesters worth of math to transfer over to my college to get the degree that I've done all of the rest of the work for. It's so frustrating.

So early on though, it's given me the ability to identify that my daughter who is in fourth grade has the exact same struggles with math that I have.

Sunny (05:14.115)  
Knowing that there's no amount of try harder that will get her to be able to understand and learn math in just the classroom setting, it's given me such great perspective to reach outward and say, what are options available to me to fill in these gaps in math? She on her standardized testing has tested significantly below standard in every single math.

and she is not

Stupid. She's not. She's such a smart girl. She consistently tests way over average in every other thing. It's not her fault. It is however math is taught in school is not meeting her specific needs. I remember there was one parent teacher conference that I had where the teacher was like, she's super behind in math. You've got to work with her harder on it. And I kind of

was a little bit like, you have her for seven hours of the day and I only get her for the few after school that she's not in her extracurricular activities. What am I supposed to do? Why isn't the need being met here in this school? But once you kind of...

can expand that sort of, OK, the way that they're teaching it is not the way that she needs to learn it. She needs to develop skills to overcome the anxiety, first and foremost, that accompanies math so that she can clear a path toward learning it. So.

Sunny (06:54.035)  
It kind of got to the point where we needed to take emergency intervention. And I've got her in Mathnasium now. Mathnasium's whole model is remove the anxiety, build the confidence, and build the foundational skills wherever they're at so that they can actually learn. One of the things that they told me is, I'm so glad you're bringing them in now, bringing her in now in fourth grade because...

Once she gets to junior high, once there's algebra, if she doesn't have the basic foundational math that she needs from these grades, then she's never gonna catch up. And that was such a validating.

conversation for me to have because it really like gave me this insight like if I I did do as well as I could but I didn't have those foundational those foundational skills that I should have been building in my in my elementary school years so yeah how am I supposed to catch up when I never had my solid footing in the first place so she's now enrolled in classes in Mathnasium and then the other aspect that

we've added is adding some of our open ed homeroom resources. We've got amazing math programs that gamify math, that make it accessible, that are something that she'd rather do than worksheets. So that's another way that we reinforce just integrating math into our life and our systems and making it more accessible and making it more enjoyable and less scary so that she can build what she needs to

take her through the whole rest of her educational journey.

Ela Richmond (08:41.122)  
love that with this specific story and just like this specific, it's a challenge and a struggle initially, right? You don't start with the thought, okay, this is it, it's too late. don't, like this, we're writing her off. She's just not good at math and maybe we can find other things that she's good at. But recognizing that it honestly could be a learning style. It could be like you were saying,

We have home and resources with Open Ed, which are awesome for a lot of our Open Ed families. like the games, the worksheets, the different ways of memorizing things, the different ways of learning things. There are so many approaches to education. There are so many approaches to math. I was just reading something the other day where it was talking about how when kids use their fingers actually for math, it's actually really, really good.

Sunny (09:21.482)  
Okay.

Ela Richmond (09:35.054)  
and why it was something along the lines of like it concretizes, it's like the mind -body connection kind of a thing. And so it's like there's so many different paths, there's so many different options for your child. What has that experience been like though, you know, starting with the, I guess everything that you get inside of public school, so like the traditional schooling model, right? And then saying, okay, now for every single thing, I'm going to start

Sunny (09:43.484)  
Bye.

Sunny (10:00.769)  
Thanks.

Ela Richmond (10:04.92)  
first with my kid, understanding my kid, understanding what their passions are, understanding what they might be interested in, understanding what they might be challenged by. And then I'm going to help fill the gaps in because I don't expect my school to fill the gaps in better than I can myself.

Sunny (10:08.461)  
huh.

Sunny (10:22.409)  
Yep. Yeah, I think that's the first step. Identifying that...

Yeah, there might be places that school just can't keep up with. Public school is a great option for my kids. serves them so far in a way that I'm happy with. It provides them the social outlets that they need. It gives them well -rounded education. There are aspects of their curriculums that are really, really working well for them in ways that I feel really grateful that they have access to. Particularly, you

my experience as a single working mom, I do...

It also fills the need of me being able to work in the daytime. That's one thing that is always something I'm trying to solve for in my kids' education. I want to customize it exactly how I want, but I have to do that within the structure of what I'm actually, like what kind of support I'm actually able to give them during the daytime. Fortunately, I have been able to identify my kids' learning styles and their social needs and the, you

the things that bring them joy and motivation and try to just really feed into all of those curiosities and make sure that they have some sort of outlet for them, not just kind of assume that school will handle it all. So I've got both of my kids in a really, really cool comprehensive music education program that they take after school in a group setting that teaches them every aspect of musicianship.

Sunny (12:03.081)  
Up to and including like how to play piano. So my daughter's learning piano. My son is just kind of starting on it my daughter is Nuts for theater. So she takes theater classes. She's also in Like a company competitive dance team because her social needs and her achievement needs are high She wants to be a part of everything. She wants to learn everything she can she's so curious about science and nature

and everything, so she does Kiwi Co -Creates too. We've got the Kiwi boxes that come. So just any way that she can be just on the scene with people doing stuff, that's where she wants to be. My son is less inclined to be a part of every single team, but he's been able to find a couple of things that are meaningful for him that are outside of school, that give him an outlet for the things that he needs his outlet for.

after you know trying soccer and and t -ball and all of the standard things we found a ninja warrior class that teaches him like parkour and tumbling around and just getting this crazy energy out that's been a great fit for him but it is just fun kind of looking out to all of the you know I didn't even know that ninja warrior classes existed but there are so many cool options to just kind of like

their curiosity and their needs for that expansion of knowledge that comes beyond the classroom.

Ela Richmond (13:40.64)  
I love this. were saying that, I mean, you talked about it in terms of discovery, right? Like you're discovering these things that are inside of your kids or these curiosities, these things that bring them joy. And then you also mentioned like their needs. like social needs as opposed to, you know, other types of needs. How do you find these things out? And how are you also finding different opportunities for them to try out?

Sunny (14:07.155)  
Hmm. that's... That's an interesting question. I just really keep my eyes and ears open. I really pay attention to what my kids like.

I talk to a lot of other parents and see what are you up to? What have you got your kids into? What are things that are working for you? That's how I found out about the Ninja Warrior class, for example. And I was kind of lamenting to one of my daughter's dance friends' moms. We've both got our kids, our daughters in dance. We're doing all of these performances and everything. And I was lamenting to her. I'm like, gosh, Clu has so many things and we haven't found Kitsa.

his thing yet? How do we find his thing? And he she told me, well, we've got art. I've got my boys in this Ninja Warrior. And I was like, what? So there's a lot of listening. There's a lot of conversations that happen for sure. I also try on my own, like social media every now and again, I'll just post, hey, this is a place that we have really gotten a lot out of. And I've I know I've discovered I discovered Let's Play Music, the music program that my kids are in.

from a social media post that somebody else put up, hey I've got my kids in this and they have their recital today. I just type them right away, what is this program, tell me about it. Look into it myself and it's perfect fit. I feel so like I'm just like, if I would have had this music education as a kid, it's so incredible. I've got so many gaps in my music education that they're having felt that I'm learning along with them and it's so exciting.

you know, go through them with the program. So yeah, I think just kind of knowing how to put out there what you're doing and invite others to tell you what they're doing is a huge thing. But very much...

Sunny (16:07.531)  
You know, the root of it all has to be really paying attention to your kid, being involved with their teachers, checking in with them. What are his needs? Where are their struggles? What does she excel at? can I, know, like being really open and, and, like just communicating with their teachers, it's, you know, reveals to me where they want more, where they're struggling. And then I can take that.

information and go back to all of these many resources and say how can I how can I meet that need.

Ela Richmond (16:45.132)  
Yeah, I love that. When, you know, as a parent, there's the balance between knowing that something is good for your kid and then also listening to them. And sometimes your kids just don't want to, let's say they're tired. They don't want to go back to dance class. You know, they're tired. They don't want to continue doing piano lessons. When do you push them to do that versus pulling back and saying, OK, this is something that you don't actually like and it's OK?

Sunny (16:59.863)  
Mm -hmm. Mm -hmm? Yeah. -huh.

Sunny (17:09.491)  
Yeah, no, that's really important.

We discuss everything that we're gonna sign up for prior and we discuss the amount of time. So we're signed up for something, then we complete the season. That's what we are committed to. We're gonna take it, if it doesn't, if it's not a great fit for us, we're gonna complete the commitment that we've made. We're gonna learn from the challenges that we had and then we're gonna reevaluate whether it's something we wanna do for the next one. I am pretty, because the thing is,

you're absolutely right. Kids may love dance, but they don't want to go after they've been at school for seven hours. And the other thing that we do is just regular check -ins. Dance is probably the one because it's a huge time commitment for Clue. And sometimes she's just like, every time she doesn't want to go, we go. And then when I pick her up, say, are you glad you went? And the answer is always yes. And when it starts becoming no, then I

Ela Richmond (17:58.509)  
Mm -hmm.

Sunny (18:12.951)  
know it's time to reevaluate whether this is actually a good fit for her life.

Ela Richmond (18:18.786)  
love that. Recently, especially on the podcast, but also just in broader conversations, something that stuck out to me a lot is in this open education journey and every single family's open education journey, what's really, really, really important is parents paying attention to their kid. And that's the only way that you're going to notice things. It's the small things that matter. It's, you know, her starting to say, no, I'm actually not enjoying this or

Sunny (18:38.135)  
Mm.

Sunny (18:43.243)  
Thank you.

Ela Richmond (18:48.588)  
yes, this is continuously fun, even though she might be tired, or even though there might be things that frustrate her about it, or maybe she starts saying no and then you start digging a little and you start learning that maybe there are classmates that she doesn't enjoy, or there's always another story, but being a parent that sees your role as, in a way, like a detective, like I'm a detective trying to figure out what my kids' passions are, how to help them to become.

Sunny (18:48.833)  
Mm Mm -hmm.

Sunny (18:55.809)  
Yeah.

Sunny (19:02.643)  
Absolutely.

Ela Richmond (19:16.456)  
know, the humans that they could potentially be. Like, that's exciting to me.

Sunny (19:20.317)  
Absolutely, I agree completely. And it just deepens the relationship that you have with them at the same time because they feel seen and heard and valued and validated. And so, yeah, I mean, there's really just no downside to getting to know who your kids are instead of trying to make them into something else.

Ela Richmond (19:42.368)  
Yeah. So what's interesting to me is with your kids inside of a public school, how are you present inside of that, you know, that, that educational experience? Are you, you know, keeping tabs on how they're learning or like, how do you make sure that, I guess also there are tests and things that show you that maybe your daughter's not doing the best in math and maybe there's something wrong there, but how do you make sure that you keep a pulse on something that you don't have?

complete control over. Because I feel like a lot of parents are in that boat where it's like you don't have complete control over it but then it's like okay well I do want to be partially involved and I do want to make sure that I fill in the gaps.

Sunny (20:13.461)  
Hmm.

Sunny (20:18.433)  
All

Sunny (20:22.198)  
Yeah.

Yeah, you know, I don't know that I'm doing as well as I wish or at least I don't know that you have to kind of pick.

what battles you want to face and also kind of identify where challenges can be learning experiences and end up being valuable and weigh that out in is this too disruptive? Do I want it?

Ela Richmond (20:41.581)  
Yes.

Ela Richmond (20:56.93)  
Mm -hmm.

Sunny (20:57.847)  
This is, it's hard to explain my point, but I work all day. I don't have the chance to volunteer in my kids' If I wasn't working all day, I would absolutely be like that parent that volunteers in the classroom and it goes on all of the field trips and all of those things. It would be awesome to be able to take like a more hands -on involvement.

Like I said, I do check in with the teachers more often than just parent -teacher conference. I try to give them their balance. little, they're spread thin and I get that too, but I do check in. I have my kids involved in some small group.

extra kind of programs within the school too. But there are things that I check in with that I'm like, my daughter for example, she is a rule follower. She wants to be a great student. And when she has kids, particularly in her last year's class, there were kids, it was kind of an out of control class. was kind of well known throughout the school that this particular class was extra rowdy. And that was really, really difficult for her.

ramped up her anxiety. She wants everyone to listen to the teacher. She wants everyone to be on their best behavior and it is so distracting to her learning process when there's a chaotic environment. That one was a struggle for me. I wished that I had more power to intervene because I knew that that was actually disrupting. It wasn't a challenge that she was gonna gain great, you know, like...

benefit from necessarily. So I think there's always a give and take and a cost benefit analysis when it comes to public school. I think it's always wise to be open to...

Sunny (22:59.279)  
What is the word I'm looking for? To be open to just questioning. Okay, this is a part that we might need to edit a little bit. I'm having trouble formulating my thoughts. Scrutinize. I think maybe that's the word I'm looking for. Scrutinize what is the cost benefit. Help me work through what I'm trying to say.

Ela Richmond (23:15.584)  
Well, I can...

Ela Richmond (23:25.696)  
No, think this is absolutely, completely such a good point that you're making. Because what it is in this open education, it's almost like a dance, right? It's like the dance between, okay, I would love and I want to personalize my kids' education to the maximum degree I want to uncover all of the things that they could potentially be incredible at. I want to help them and facilitate them as best as I can. And then the other side, which is...

Okay, as a parent, what are my constraints? And what do I need help with? And what other things are other people better experts at? And I think that's something that a lot of parents feel, where there's a lot of pressure, especially inside of the open education movement, for everybody to be perfect and for every parent to just personalize their kid's education to the best possible way and for everybody to get it right.

Sunny (23:57.566)  
and

Sunny (24:04.533)  
Mm -hmm.

Sunny (24:23.393)  
Mm

Ela Richmond (24:24.982)  
And I think it's refreshing to remember that there is no right. Like, you as a parent are gonna know your kid best. And when you have constraints, it's okay. They will figure it out. And they're very resilient. And it's about doing your best with what you have. But I think that's why it's so important to highlight and feature stories like yours where it's like, okay, you are a working mom, you're a single parent, you have two kids that are quite...

Sunny (24:30.134)  
Yes.

Sunny (24:43.393)  
Yes.

Ela Richmond (24:54.04)  
quite involved. You have them in a public school, but you're also trying to create these new educational experiences for them so that they can experience so much more of the world, so that they can experience so much more of themselves. And it's a hard thing to do, but it's such a valuable commitment for you.

Sunny (25:13.783)  
Right. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's exactly right because the scrutiny that you give...

you know, that you give your public school, I think it's wise to not be, you know, in this mindset that they're going to handle everything. And it's if, and like you said, to call back to the earlier conversation, if you can't figure it out, then it's, then you need to work harder model to be able to be open to making those adjustments. But then in the, in the open ed world also being not only knowing your kids to your point, but knowing yourself, what do I have the

capacity to do and what do I have the capacity to contribute to my kids education? Do I want to fill that role of their primary educator? What is my obligation or responsibility if that's something that I choose to take on? And just constantly weighing the costs and benefits to make sure that you're landing on something that's the right fit for your whole family.

Ela Richmond (26:15.276)  
I love that. This has been incredible. Thank you so much for sharing your whole story. The note that I wanted to end on was, do you have any resources that you would recommend to other families, other people that have just worked incredibly well for you?

Sunny (26:33.195)  
just like programs and stuff that my kids are involved in or in general.

Ela Richmond (26:36.832)  
Yeah, programs, people that you follow.

Sunny (26:39.355)  
I absolutely could not recommend more highly the Let's Play music program. They have a sound beginnings program that is like toddler age up to age five, I want to say. And then three years of comprehensive music education from five to about eight. And then there's a continuing program that keeps the comprehensive music education, but with more of a focus on piano playing.

It has been an unbelievable way for my kids to learn music and not hate taking piano lessons. The piano player's dilemma is that everyone in adulthood...

is glad that they know how to play piano and they all hated practicing and going to lessons when they were when they were a kid. They're glad they know now let's solve that dilemma by making the education part of it more fun as well and kids learn really well in group settings in that age group so I highly recommend the Let's Play Music program. A program that we got a lot of great use out of in the years that we were still exploring soccer is

a program called Soccer Shots. Rather than just the like Hunger Games style of melee soccer games that we were getting from our rec center experiences, the Soccer Shots program teaches them actual drills and skills and makes it all incorporate like incorporates a lot of play into the soccer instruction. That was an awesome program for us.

And then, yeah, there are so many, especially in my area that I live in, so many incredible arts programs. This is my area here in Utah is so richly populated with so many arts, dance, music, theater, so many cool programs like that. I will shout out Mathnasium, Clue for the very first time ever got one step higher. So she's not significantly below standard.

Sunny (28:48.485)  
She's just below standards now in math and we are taking that as a win. So, Mathnasium, it's expensive. I wish it was a little more accessible. I feel like those kinds of educational foundations shouldn't just be for, you know, shouldn't cause financial burden, but it really has filled the need that we were desperate for in the time that we needed it.

Yeah, I mean, I could go on. You want to wrap up with that question. I'll talk for another hour.

Ela Richmond (29:13.688)  
That's incredible.

Ela Richmond (29:19.455)  
No, I think that's so important for parents specifically to share all of the things that are working for them and their kids because all it is is a choose your own adventure. It's okay now that you know of something new, now that you know of something that's working for somebody else. It doesn't mean that it's going to work for your kid, but there you go, it's another option. And that's the...

Sunny (29:37.595)  
Exactly. And so many times you don't know them until you until someone tells you so you don't even know what to ask so I agree.

Ela Richmond (29:41.409)  
Exactly.

Exactly. Well, thank you so, so, so much for coming on the podcast. This has been incredible.

Sunny (29:49.313)  
Thanks all, I appreciate it.
