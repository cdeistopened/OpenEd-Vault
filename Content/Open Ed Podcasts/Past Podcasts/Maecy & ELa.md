## Transcript

Ela (00:00.693)  
Welcome back to theOkay, very good. Now we're going to basically work the same process that we just worked for this podcast, but with a different transcript Open Ed podcast. I'm your sometimes host Ella Richmond and today I'm joined by Macy. So Macy, let's jump in straight away. Tell me how many kids do you have and how long have you been homeschooling?

Maecy (00:13.39)  
So I have five children. We've homeschooled for about 13 years. And I would say, I don't know, seven years with OpenEd, like three as a parent before, and then four as an employee of MyTechHigh and OpenEd.

Ela (00:28.917)  
Wow. Okay. And so what initially got you interested in homeschool?

Maecy (00:33.908)  
So my oldest is our biological daughter. She's really precocious. She was just going at a fast pace and she just didn't like the worksheets. So that was her. And then we adopted our four youngest kids and they just had special needs. We went to the school, did IEP. We just felt like we needed to like be together as a family and bond a little bit. And then also I just felt like we couldn't do worse at home.

That was kind of the beginning of it.

Ela (01:05.173)  
Was, for your first daughter, was homeschool something that you were really familiar with? Like, did people around you do it as well?

Maecy (01:12.64)  
I knew one family member who did it. And so that was kind of a mentor experience to talk to her and say, okay, what do we do? I was pretty hesitant to jump into something new. And so I initially went to like K-12 online to kind of have something to finish out the school year. Cause I felt really hesitant about joining in right away with not any plan. So.

Yeah, we did K-12 for the end of that school year and then by that time I kind of had my ducks in a row to get started for the next school year with homeschooling.

Ela (01:48.001)  
What did homeschool look like for you back then?

Maecy (01:51.79)  
I didn't love the online format with my students. It wasn't a good fit for our family. And so I started talking to people, getting more connected with those who were in kind of the homeschooling realm. is before Facebooks and groups were really a big thing. So I just found a few moms. We started meeting at a local library. We started creating what we wanted to see. So we had

some game groups, some PE groups, and then it got a little bit more organized. started a nonprofit family group at a local church. just rented space and it's called Owls in Ogden and they are still running today. yeah, so we would do some of our academics at home. But homeschool was really kind of a misnomer for us because

We would start to go places. We would create field trip Fridays, events at museums, things like that. And then just lots of small groups where we would get together for science or other things. And then all the moms started teaching subjects at OWLs. And so we would go there once a week for a full day on site.

Maecy (03:15.262)  
yeah.

Ela (03:15.329)  
That's really, really cool. so, okay, so walk me through this as a parent. Like what was your experience learning about homeschool for the first time, for the very beginning? What was your experience navigating that with your daughter?

Maecy (03:29.72)  
So, you know, you initially think that homeschool means staying at home and reading books and curriculum all day every day. And I found that my kids still had social needs. So it was really important for us to create these groups and experiences. And it's just been really fun for them to have, you know, all kinds of groups. We've done service groups. We've done, I mean, clear to now they're going to homeschool prom with their friends. So.

It's nice, we've been able to do some hybridization now. But as I was first learning about it, I just kind of had to create what I wanted for my vision for what my kids needed. And it's a really unique like learning disabilities, social challenges and things. So we just had to make it.

Ela (04:19.157)  
Yeah, and what does that look like homeschooling for a special needs child? Obviously, that's a little different. And through OpenEd, it's kind of nice because then you get access to the IEPs while you're also at home. But what does that look like as a parent trying to navigate all that? Because there's one thing trying to learn homeschool for a child that does not have certain learning disabilities or whatever certain challenges you're dealing with. Yeah, could you paint that out for me? And then also,

What are a couple of the challenges that you did have to deal with and how did you deal with them?

Maecy (04:53.72)  
Okay, so our family, we just had the unique challenge of adoption and trying to create our family in the first place. So we were meeting with various types of family therapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, all kinds of helps to try and get these kids a good...

like into a good place. It's hard to do academics when you've got those challenges going on. So I really needed to meet those fundamental needs first. Some days just looked like holding people who are crying and other days we could listen to audio books. We just kind of dived into things like baking and cooking and just things to connect first. And then we would try and add in, you know, academics as we could.

I had to be okay with allowing them to be a little bit behind as far as like catching up in math. So my oldest adopted student was five when we adopted and he didn't catch up academically for probably three or four years because it just took that amount of time to meet the emotional needs while we were trying to fit everything else in. So

I would just purchase curriculum that I thought would work. Online just really didn't work in this situation. It was just hard for them to sit there and they would be off looking at email or, you know, whatever. I just couldn't keep them structured online. And so we would do a lot of schooling together. So we would do all of our science together. We would do all of our reading together. And then I would

do individual assignments for the older kids who could do more where they would just do kind of a additional activity and bring back a report or something. So a lot of group learning that way. Like I said, my oldest daughter, since she was really motivated, able to read well, I could assign her things. She largely taught herself through books and curriculum.

Maecy (07:12.696)  
And that was a great learning style for her. She ended up getting an associates through Open Ed at age 17 through the SNO program that's now kind of the Ignite program. But the nice thing is everyone could work at their own pace. With IEPs, they want you to catch up super fast. So we opted not to utilize IEPs because I didn't want them to catch up fast when I felt like their emotional needs needed to be met first.

Ela (07:41.419)  
and why? So when you looked at your children and you had one voice from external sources telling you, hey, you know, they need to be further along and they're not. And your internal voice saying, hey, I think actually my kids are exactly where they need to be for right now because I need to nurture them emotionally and in an entirely different way. Yeah. How did you, did you struggle with that at all? Or like, how did you manage that deciding what to do next?

Maecy (08:09.176)  
We loved our school. They were so supportive, our public school, they wanted to help. The IUPs were great. I just felt like we've just adopted these kids from foster care. There's a lot of trauma. I don't need to be forcing math down their throat. We need to make a relationship. They need to know that they're safe. And so I drew, I am certified as a teacher and I could see.

these people are not in a place to learn. They're anxious, they're scared, they're traumatized, they need to be safe. So we did a lot of reading in forts or coloring. Instead of official handwriting, we would put shaving cream and they would write letters in there. We tried to make it fun so it wasn't like, we're doing school. It was, we're doing these fun activities. And then as they felt safe, would...

dig into it more or they, could see, they're super excited about this science part that we're talking about. So we'd plant a garden, we did beekeeping, we did chickens, we did, you know, so they're learning life cycles in kind of really fun ways that are kind of unofficial ways rather than like a book with assignments. And so that's kind of like the direction that we went for our particular needs. So.

Ela (09:32.021)  
And as a mom, was that difficult to be patient around that?

Maecy (09:36.334)  
Um, I think once we, and I had to talk to my husband over to this cause he's like, what are we doing? But, um, I could just see, cause when I was at the public school, I was there every day for behavioral issues, for updating IEPs. Even my daughter that was our biological daughter, I was having IEPs for gifted and talented for her because

She would finish so fast and then just read books all day. And I thought, well, she could do more at home than just sit and read a book, you know? So I think by the time that I finally went out and with the help of a mentor, and this isn't to diss on public schools, like I'm a public school teacher myself, but I just felt like I could meet my individual students' needs at home better in our situation.

Ela (10:30.131)  
And then what conversation finally convinced your husband or like was it just the accumulation of conversations?

Maecy (10:38.554)  
Um, it was going to be just for a year to meet people's emotional needs. And we were planning to put them back into mainstream mainstream school after that. And then the year went so well and the kids were having so much fun and we were enjoying our connection together that we were like, okay, we'll do it for another year. And then that's how it's been every year since then. And now

You know, I've just learned more and more as you connect with other families that have had students graduate, you see, okay, maybe I don't have to have an accredited traditional diploma to be successful. I could have a homeschool diploma or transcripts or ACT score or portfolio or even get a GED. This may not be, you know, a mark of future success. So.

Ela (11:18.807)  
Mm-hmm.

Maecy (11:34.734)  
I've just gained confidence each year and I'm pretty open with my kids. Like I've asked them each year, do you have any desire to go back to a public school or would you like to try or would you want to do anything hybrid? So this year for the first year, my two youngest that are left at home wanted to try public school. They're coming back next year, but they got to have the chance. So, and they really enjoyed like trying all kinds of different things.

Ela (12:04.809)  
Yeah, I love that. I love that. And so what made you initially decide that you were going to send them back to public school?

Maecy (12:11.182)  
I've always wanted them to have a choice. I don't want them to feel like mom says you have to homeschool and this is what we're going to do. I feel like if, at least in my family situation, having the student feel like they have ownership over what they're doing makes them just want to soar. So my daughter, she's 17 and public school has been a good experience this last year. She's gotten

She wants to open a preschool daycare when she's done. And so she's done like their early childhood at the school. And that's been a great fit for her to be able to take their classes and get certifications. She's got like the, CPR and all the other things that she's gonna need for being able to open her own daycare. And then they just wanted the experience. They just wanted to see what's this all about. So.

Ela (12:43.659)  
Ha!

Ela (13:10.465)  
Dang, and so what was that experience like for them? Did, as a parent, like you're obviously watching and observing and watching them experience this new thing.

Maecy (13:18.316)  
Yeah, I think what we'll probably end up doing next year is kind of like a hybrid. We'll do some academics at home, finish up the early childhood education. She's doing some stuff at the trade school. We might do some early college classes through OC online. So rather than doing like a full day at the public school, she just wants to continue the part she's interested in, the early childhood. So we're going to make a big hybrid schedule.

Ela (13:47.787)  
That's cool. How are you planning? You mentioned like all of these different cool things that you have your kids in. How are you planning this at the beginning of the year and figuring out what to put them into?

Maecy (13:59.118)  
I think flexibility has been key for me. Like we'll start with the general plan and by the maybe month two, we're switching over to something else. But some things that have stayed consistent for me with our, my oldest could do online. She did finish up doing like the associates online and that was a good fit for her. But for my other kids, we stayed consistent. I just stuck with sex and math for.

I wanted them to be able to still get an ACT if they wanted to go to a college after. And that's just been a good fit for our needs. It's a spiral-based curriculum that is really good at preparing for the math on the ACT or the GED. So that part has stayed pretty consistent. Other than that, I've tried, and I would say my curriculum for our kids looks different as their different needs come up. So.

Just really staying connected through group, Facebook groups, other parents. Yeah.

Maecy (15:09.42)  
I'm sorry Ella, can't hear you now. There you go.

Ela (15:11.745)  
Sorry about that. There we go, we're back. Okay, and so when it comes to staying connected with your kids, when their interests change or when a curriculum's not working or when a subject is just not hitting, how do you make sure that you are seeing that and then also adjusting when necessary?

Maecy (15:32.152)  
So once we got to the point where people could read, I would give them assignments and then we would do like a checking in after and I would say, how did this go for you? Like, it looks like this was a struggle. Do we need to go back and go over fractions and whatever it might be. And so sometimes we do supplemental things like Khan Academy is free or free home and resources through OpenEd.

We use mystery science a lot because that was good to like just kind of have an opening part for all ages. And then I'd have the older kids to go and do extra things along with mystery science. And so we're all learning together at the...

at the co-ops and things, they could adjust for the different levels in the classes. So I wasn't always my students only teacher. Like they have had lots of different teachers through our co-ops and various classes we've joined. So I just keep in touch with, what's nice is their academics don't take that long. My husband's like, you guys have only done school for three hours. And I'm like, well, do you want me to have them do more math assignments? like the academics look.

kind of short, but you're learning all day long. Once they're done with the specific book work, they're projects outside or I've mentioned all of our gardening and homesteading kind of stuff. They're helping me can, they're going with friends on hikes and geology experiences. And my daughter did a robotics club in the basement of the Leonardo that went to...

competitions. So we're just finding cool things and it changes all year round as the cool things come up. Like, yes, we're going to do that or so. I don't do a lot of Facebook. hmm. Largely that and then just hive mind in all of the Facebook or all of the homeschool groups that we're in. We're in Weber Davis County and there's a lot of homeschoolers up here.

Ela (17:27.297)  
How do you find these things?

Really?

Maecy (17:46.668)  
And we're involved in both counties pretty heavily. My kids have done AYSO soccer, other things. So we have church groups. have lots of, I mean, they have lots of friends, lots of opportunities to find different things. And as the things come up, we join up. So.

Ela (18:06.785)  
Did you ever run into any of the problems? know whenever somebody thinks about homeschool and definitely in the past, the stigma was that homeschool kids were unsocialized. Did you ever run into that or like, it seems like your kids are heavily socialized.

Maecy (18:22.302)  
I think homeschooling is a misnomer for us. I would say that amount of time that we're home is maybe three hours for the book work academics. Everything else is out, about, with friends, field trips, co-ops, fun things. I mean, we'll take off and go ski. We've had skiing passes the last five years. We ski several times a week with friends. They do.

kayaking, we go see the salmon when they spawn at our lake. do, you know, it's just a lifestyle, not really just academics. So.

Ela (19:01.011)  
Interesting. Do you think that that takes people time to get used to? Like this difference between education can be interwoven into a lifestyle that you want to create with your family, not necessarily this like this idea of education that we have, right, is similar to the work day, right? Like we have this idea that work looks like you clock in at nine, you're in till five, and then your free time exists in the hours before and after work.

But there's a lot of work that's becoming a lot more flexible nowadays. And similarly with school, there's this idea that, okay, you drop them off at eight, you pick them up at four, right? And like, that is the model and like free time exists outside of that and family time exists outside of that. Was that hard for you to re almost discover this idea of education that was integrated into a life design almost?

Maecy (19:32.419)  
Yeah.

Maecy (19:53.472)  
Yeah, I would say the first year that we were homeschooling and I was trying to create public school at home, that was really frustrating. And people would have meltdowns in the middle and I would let we have to school till this certain amount of time. And I had to really relax my ideas of what it would look like. And we've had the opportunity to live in a trailer and travel across the United States for six months. did travel schooling and

I think people feel I'm pretty relaxed and that we don't have like a super rigid schedule other than math and we do a lot of reading, but we do every subject every week. I bet I'm very flexible. If we have a snow day and it's the first snow of the year, we go out and play in the snow and then we come back and we buckle down. that's kind of as I've seen my older three.

succeed. I don't feel as rigid about what we have to do every day as long as they're invested in what they're learning. They're the ones that are kind of running the show. They want to, they are excited about what they're doing.

Ela (21:13.525)  
Was that hard as a public school teacher to accept?

Maecy (21:19.266)  
Yeah, yeah, I have a traditional diploma. I went to traditional college and feeling like, my goodness, am I gonna fail my kids? And I recently had a scare because my oldest daughter did get that associates, but she never had an official high school diploma and she played at the Mayo Clinic and they wanted a diploma. I was like.

What are we going to do? So I printed a homeschool diploma out and I signed it and they accepted that. yeah, they don't care if it's accredited or not. They just want a paper to file in their diploma spot. So and it was like a plan for the FBI. It was like super intense, her onboarding and paperwork. So I thought, oh, no, this is fabulous job and she doesn't have an accredited diploma. But they

Ela (21:50.624)  
Really?

Maecy (22:14.606)  
Yeah, she offered like the associates her 8 high ACT score, her transcripts, but they just wanted that paper. So I printed it out and it worked. So I was really worried, but yeah.

Ela (22:24.045)  
my gosh.

Ela (22:27.777)  
So you mentioned that a lot of your kids are successful. Paint that out for me. So what are your kids doing now? And that is a worry of a lot of homeschool families is, what is my kid going to do afterwards? Am I setting them on a path where they're only going to be able to do alternative type of things? Or can at some point they opt into, for example, becoming a doctor or becoming a lawyer? Can at some point they choose a non-alternative path? Can I start them on an alternative path and then

Maecy (22:36.803)  
Yeah.

Ela (22:57.025)  
Can they choose it for themselves?

Maecy (22:58.946)  
That was what I was really worried about with her because we did the non-traditional route with her and then she's in a kind of traditional job. And I was worried. And so she's doing very well working for the Mayo Clinic. She is going to continue on to do her bachelor's in the evenings, but she's, I'm surprised they were really excited about her. They were excited about a homeschool experience. They said they see that homeschool students have a

history of academic excellence and hard work and just excitement about what they're learning. And so I felt like that was a plus for her when she applied, even though we had to make that document. So she's doing really well. And then my second son, chose to go to our Ogden Weybar Tech School in the HVAC. And he was able to get the majority of that done and he can work in that industry.

So that's exciting for him. My third son had some pretty major learning disabilities. So we just did non-traditional homeschool diploma for him, but he can work construction, things like that. The thing that was so good for him is that we could work at his pace. It just took him years and years to learn how to read and...

when he would go to public school before we pulled him out, he was just so anxious that he would just come home and be sick, like actual literal sick where he lost weight. And so, yeah, he, I just feel like we would have lost him. So I told you about my daughter that wants to open the preschool. And then my last daughter is just enjoying public school right now. She might go back for the last year and have a traditional diploma. So

Ela (24:29.349)  
no.

Maecy (24:52.962)  
They all kind of did their own things.

Ela (24:56.841)  
Yeah, that's awesome. And as a parent, like how does that make you feel? I mean, do you have like once they're all out, what then? What are you going to do then?

Maecy (25:08.59)  
Well, I am loving my current role at Open Ed because I get to kind of mentor or support families that are on this not traditional track who are seeking like a home school or Open Ed certificate. So I spend most of my days talking to families about how they can set up a schedule to best meet their students needs.

If they want to hybridize, we do that. If they want to do some of our early college programs, we've had kids graduate with bachelors from SNHU in our programs. So in ninth grade, we've got bachelors. So it's really cool to be able to talk to families about and reassure them a little bit about that. We love both tracks. Like a accredited diploma is great. My daughter's doing that. These non-accredited options are also really great.

Ela (25:47.5)  
Mm-hmm.

Maecy (26:04.226)  
and you can just do amazing things. It's nice to customize for students in sports or like professional dance and they need to fit a schedule around what they're doing. So I love it. So fun.

Ela (26:19.361)  
How would you say it was different to home school for your special needs students? if a family member or first off, how would somebody, how would you recommend somebody confirm that their child is special needs if they have questions or figure out the specific challenges that they're going to have to deal with with education and learning first?

Maecy (26:45.622)  
I would say it's really helpful to rule out things and to get specific diagnoses. It was helpful for us. So we went to, we did genetic testing so that when my son does have an issue with genetics that we needed to address and then we went to a neuropsychologist that could confirm these are some specific areas like executive function or

just general IQ. Like these are some strategies or ways to help your student learn in a better way. These are things that will reinforce the things that they've already learned. It was helpful to have, professional help in those instances. We did have speech therapy, like I mentioned. Occupational therapy was helpful for even just like holding a pencil correctly and, yeah. And then,

Ela (27:40.497)  
wow.

Maecy (27:44.268)  
You know, we always went to the eye doctor. Some of them needed glasses. So I do think it's helpful to include professionals in learning those things. He did not have like a specific learning disability like dyslexia, but we did do some specialized curriculum for reading like Barton and he's just the kind of student that needs to have things repeated often. So.

rather than mastery-based kind of learning, we would need to go over it and then come back to earlier concepts. And so I just had to learn to teach him differently.

Ela (28:24.567)  
And what did that look like for you as a parent like day to day? I've talked to a couple of my friends and they always say that homeschooling multiple kids is always tough, but you had a couple of Special needs kids that you're homeschooling. So obviously that's a little tougher. What is that like doing all of it at once?

Maecy (28:41.452)  
Well, for my one that is pretty self-motivated, I could just give her assignments. We would check in at the end of the day. She learned well that way. For the others, we would do group things like science. I was pretty heavily involved for many years. And then at the co-ops and things, I had classes to prepare for. You know, I was teaching anatomy, teaching choir, teaching things. it was a lot of the same kind of teacher prep that I would do for.

lesson plans like I would in public school. And then I would have to set time aside for individual specific tutoring sessions basically.

Ela (29:24.125)  
No, it's so fascinating to talk through like what it looks like for every single individual kid because there's obviously challenges no matter what kind of kid you are. Like I go back to my journey and I can look at certain ways that I learned whether it was like lectures. I was always really good with lectures. I loved them. But some kids don't learn well like that and some kids need hands-on. And just figuring out the differences there and then

Maecy (29:46.563)  
Thank

Maecy (29:50.83)  
I know.

Ela (29:53.813)  
And then finding the challenges that are keeping your students from succeeding in the best possible way. Like, that's so important.

Maecy (30:00.802)  
Uh-huh.

Yeah, well, I had to figure out about myself that I don't learn well math from lectures. I learned really well from reading the book and having time to go back up to what it said. And I was not super confident about teaching math until I started learning the lesson in Saxon math. And then I would teach and I was like, I totally get this. This is easy. Where I had

of struggled in math a little bit in high school and college but I feel really confident now because I learned my learning style that I didn't know.

Ela (30:39.765)  
Yeah. As an open ed, somebody that works with a lot of our families inside of the program too, what do you see as something common that a lot of families struggle with?

Maecy (30:54.242)  
I think the rare family is one that plans to homeschool from the beginning. So I think the biggest struggle that I see is our families that are jumping in midstream for some of the same reasons that I did. Either they can see there's academic issues, social issues, bullying, medical issues, and then they're kind of forced into homeschooling.

and they don't know where to turn or where to start. So that's a big issue. Families contact us often about, okay, we're gonna try and jump in. What do I do? How do I connect with people? How can I fund this? What if I'm a working parent? So just like how to make it work. So.

Ela (31:47.307)  
Yeah, that's awesome. All right. I'm to do some rapid fire questions. Some of my favorite, favorite ways to end the episode. Question number one, what is the best resource that has been helpful for your family?

Maecy (31:51.554)  
Okay.

Maecy (32:03.8)  
probably Facebook groups to get connected.

Ela (32:08.043)  
How would you recommend somebody goes into a Facebook group and get involved?

Maecy (32:12.578)  
Sometimes they can be hard to find just because of how they're named. But if you get on and you just start searching homeschooling in my area or something like that, then you can connect with people who maybe are already farther along the path. It's just a lot of mentoring and helping each other.

Ela (32:31.805)  
of that second question. What is the best piece of advice you to give to a new homeschool family, especially one that has a special needs child?

Maecy (32:41.08)  
Trust your gut. Do what you need to do for your kid.

Ela (32:47.625)  
and it'll all work out.

Maecy (32:49.198)  
I can only say you just have to keep adjusting. It might not look the same as you initially thought.

Ela (32:57.025)  
That's a great answer. Okay. And last piece of advice. What is something that surprised you on your journey?

Maecy (33:03.872)  
much I loved it, how much my kids loved it. I thought it was going to be this intense job that I had to do and just how much it strengthened our family relationships and really helped my students and myself gain self-confidence.

Ela (33:24.715)  
I love that. Thank you so much, Macy, for coming on the podcast. And I'm pretty sure that people will have been familiar with you a little bit because you talk to a lot of family members every week. But it was really cool to hear your story and then also to hear how much you have learned and grown and been able to do for your family through homeschooling.

Maecy (33:32.846)  
I

Maecy (33:44.014)  
Thanks, Hala.
