### 💡 THOUGHT

## **CELEBRATING THE DEAD ENDS**

"Great! Now you know what you don't want to do.” Rose told her son after he quit his mailroom job at a rock climbing company, “And that's just as important as knowing what you want to do or what you want to try."

What had seemed like a perfect fit became miserable fast—and that was valuable.

Career paths aren't linear. They're elimination rounds where each "no" redirects you to better options. These clarifying moments help you discover not just what excites you, but what definitely doesn't.

### 📊 TREND

## **THE COLLEGE GRAD REVERSAL**

College graduates are struggling more than the general workforce for the first time in… ever?

Since at least the 1800s, new technology has benefitted those with more education. Industrialization, computers, and robotics replaced manual labor while creating opportunities for knowledge workers with degrees.

What's different now? Derek Thompson writes in The Atlantic that recent college graduates face a 5.8% unemployment rate – the worst relative gap compared to overall unemployment in 40 years.

New York Fed data reveals this historical shift comes from:

1. Post-pandemic tech industry contraction
2. College degrees providing diminishing returns since 2010
3. Entry-level knowledge work being automated

"The collective delusion surrounding the primacy of four-year degrees is tipping," says Mike Rowe, "and when it falls, it's going to go splat."

What matters now isn't the credential, but what you can actually do.

  

### 📊 TREND: THE SKILLS ACQUISITION REVOLUTION

## **HIGH SCHOOLERS LANDING $70,000 JOBS**

While colleges face declining enrollment, a different trend is emerging: high school juniors receiving job offers with $70,000 starting salaries.

The Wall Street Journal reports companies facing skilled worker shortages are going directly to high schools, recruiting students before they even consider college. One welding student described the experience as "like I'm an athlete getting all this attention from all these pro teams."

This shift marks a radical departure from the "college for all" mindset that has dominated educational guidance for decades. Key drivers behind this trend:

- **Critical labor shortages** in skilled trades that can't be outsourced
- **Astronomical college costs** prompting families to reconsider the ROI of four-year degrees
- **Industry-school partnerships** creating direct pipelines from classroom to career
- **Hands-on learning programs** that prepare students for immediate employment

The message is clear: for many young people, the most lucrative educational path might not run through a university campus but through specialized skills training that begins in high school.

### 🔨 TOOL

## **FIND YOUR PATH WITHOUT DEBT**

"I want students to know you don't have to go to an Ivy League school. You don't have to go somewhere where you're coming out with $100,000, $200,000 of debt because of a college degree," says Rose Ybaben.

Her service, [Soaring2College](https://soaring2college.com/), helps families create personalized post-high school plans that don't default to expensive four-year degrees.

Rose's approach is different. She starts with ninth graders, opening dialogue years before decisions are rushed. Her motto: "Together we can do it."

What you get:

- Four-year high school roadmaps tailored to each student
- Exploration of educational, career, and volunteer opportunities
- Support for traditional and non-traditional paths

Two other free tools that complement Rose's approach:

[CareerOneStop Self-Assessments](https://www.careeronestop.org/ExploreCareers/Assessments/self-assessments.aspx) - Department of Labor tools that match interests to careers in under 30 minutes.

[O*NET Interest Profiler](https://www.mynextmove.org/explore/ip) - Shows which careers fit your interests with which education levels.

**Word of the Day**

### Multipotentiality

**Multipotentiality** [mul-ti-po-ten-shee-AL-i-tee], _noun_: The state of having many exceptional talents or interests, potentially leading to various career paths.

A common trait among self-directed learners, multipotentiality can make traditional career selection challenging—but becomes a superpower in an era demanding adaptability and cross-disciplinary thinking.

"📢 NEW EPISODE: Why College Might NOT Be The Next Step For Your Teen

'Adulthood is just filled with do-over after do-over. You just get to try anything you want to try.'

Is your teen feeling the pressure to figure out their entire future at 17? Our latest episode features education experts Rose Ybaben and Danielle Randall discussing why the traditional college path isn't the only option—and why discovering what you don't want can be more valuable than you think.

For the social media clip, I still believe the combined clip with the mailroom story would be most effective:

```Plain


[CLIP #1 - COMBINED]
[35:08.238-35:34.41] Andrea: "That's what I've been talking to my recent graduate about is how exciting it is to enter adulthood because adulthood is just filled with do-over after do-over. You just get to try anything you want to try. And there are of course some limitations, mostly money. But if you can figure out the money piece, adulthood is just one adventure after another, pursuing any learning that you want to pursue for the rest of your life."

[19:41.681-20:10.913] Rose: "A great example, my son, first job ever, he was in a mail room of this huge company. He was excited because it was a rock climbing company, right? So it was rock climbing and outdoors and he was in that mail room and was miserable. And so I said to him, great, I love it. Now you know what you don't want to do. And that's just as important as knowing what you want to do or what you want to try."
