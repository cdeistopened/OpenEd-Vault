## 💡 THOUGHT

### YOU ARE ENOUGH

"Am I enough to help him?"

This question haunts every parent at some point—especially when facing a child's learning challenges. For Laura Feller, whose son struggled with learning disabilities and whose youngest didn't speak until age three, that doubt felt overwhelming.

Her answer should be framed on every homeschooling parent's wall: "Yes, I am enough to help him. My husband is enough. As a family, we are enough."

Why? Because we don't have to do it alone.

The myth of the superhero homeschool parent—the one who masters every subject, never loses patience, and always knows exactly what their child needs—has discouraged too many families from taking control of their children's education.

The truth is both simpler and more powerful: You don't need to be an expert in everything. You just need to be an expert in connecting your child with the right resources and community.

Today, Laura's once-struggling boys are thriving. The child who couldn't speak at three? He's now performing in Matilda on stage. Their secret wasn't parental perfection—it was persistence through the hard times when everything felt overwhelming.

When you feel like giving up, remember: "There is no give up because life continues and kids grow and they need us to keep learning and growing with them."

We have a community, we have resources in the community that can help us manage and, um, find the pathway that's best for him. And that's been the case for, for all of our children. My youngest wasn't talking at all until he was three and now he's, He's going to be in a production of Matilda on stage and, um, the, the things that, that our boys have been able to accomplish [00:01:00] with the freedom to explore and find those things that are passions for, for them as outlets has helped.
