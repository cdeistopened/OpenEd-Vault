# YouTube Description

Two Hollywood veterans who worked on Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, and The Sandlot reveal why they started teaching kids filmmaking after Columbine—and how their students are now working on Spielberg films and Broadway.

Chet Thomas (Dreamworks story department, The Best Christmas Pageant Ever) and Darrin Fletcher (storyboard artist turned director/producer) created Sneak On The Lot after the Columbine shooting shook them into action. What started as a response to violence has become Hollywood's most unconventional talent pipeline—a video game where students learn filmmaking and actually get cast in real productions. They've built a 25-year curriculum that employs every classroom subject in making films, proving that whether you're a math nerd, a jock, or a goth kid who writes in the corner, there's a place for you in film.
