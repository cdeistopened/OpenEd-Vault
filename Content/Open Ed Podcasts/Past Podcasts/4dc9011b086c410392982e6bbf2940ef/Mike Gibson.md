**Title:**

Genius Is as Common as Dirt — John Taylor Gatto

**Description:**

“If we suppress genius, it’s because we don’t know how to manage a population of educated men and women. The solution? Let them manage themselves.”

**Caption:**

Gatto’s take hits hard: genius is common. Systems that fear autonomy try to manage it out of us. The fix is simple—trust educated people to manage themselves.
