Preview: From degrees to doing—plus a teen survey to map next steps.

3 Quick Bites

🍎 Doing beats degrees

🍎 Work is non‑linear now

🍎 Career guide + teen survey

# **Doing beats degrees**

Employers keep saying the quiet part out loud: “We can’t find skilled workers.” Not more diplomas—workers who can actually ship. Michelle Rhee’s pivot from K‑12 to apprenticeships makes the point: the old sequence (learn for years, then do) is upside down. Teen careers are “crypto, cannabis, creators”—not majors with tidy pathways. The fix isn’t a pep talk about passion; it’s giving kids reps. Exposure helps, but doing sticks. Shadow a baker. Ship a simple website. Run a small event. Get feedback (from someone who isn’t your mom). Of course, entry-level is still “learning on the job”—which is just the boring term for apprenticeship. The minute you admit that, you stop waiting for the “right credential” and start building signals that matter: evidence, references, and results.

# **Work is non‑linear now**

Michael Horn’s read is blunt: higher ed sits upstream from K‑12. If college misfires, everything behind it misfires. Meanwhile, the job market stopped pretending to be a ladder. People switch roles every few years, swirl through gigs, and find purpose in or outside of work (both answers are fine). The practical triad is exposure → doing → networks. Get teens in rooms with real practitioners, let them perform low‑stakes work, and grow the relationships that de‑risk the next step. AI quietly makes this easier: simulations for “reps” before live fire, proofs of work that beat a GPA, and portfolio artifacts hiring managers can trust more than AI-filtered resumes. Let’s be honest: the degree was always a proxy. The future is porous school walls, smaller bets, and more authentic signals.

# **Career guide + teen survey**

We updated our no-theory career prep guide to include new perspectives from Michael Horn and Michelle Rhee, plus a 5-question survey teens can take to steer them to the best career prep resources. The guide shows how to swap “four years, then hope” for a portfolio of signals—references, shipped work, short apprenticeships—and how families can de‑risk each move without getting stuck in perfection hunting. **Remember:** The goal isn’t to find The One Job; it’s to build momentum, evidence, and options teens can cash in—degree optional.
