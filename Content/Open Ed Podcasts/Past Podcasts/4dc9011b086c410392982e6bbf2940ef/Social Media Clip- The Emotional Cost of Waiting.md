**Full Arc:**

> Kris: They know, even in preschool, they know they're not like their peers. They know they're behind. And so the longer you delay, the harder it gets for them—and that changes the entire family dynamic. It hurts the parent, it hurts the siblings, it hurts the child. As they get older, they lose their self-esteem. They start getting anxiety. They come home crying and in tears, and it is heartbreaking to see them that way. The longer you wait, the harder it gets. But early intervention really does change everything. They deserve the best.
