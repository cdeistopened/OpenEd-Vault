Transcript:

**Jean Eddy:** [00:00:00] Middle school kids have brains that are as thirsty, um, as, as willing to take in information as toddlers, that their brains are just so absorbent at that point in time, this is the time to start intro, introducing all kinds of things.

A young person who was like 13 years old is not totally wedded to what his friends say. Wait until he's 15 and the story changes, but this is an opportunity. They're wide open, they're willing to explore .

This is all about having conversations. It's about having conversations about, gee, what, what happened in school today? Did you really like that or didn't you like that?
