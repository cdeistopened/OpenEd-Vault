"What child is going to have fun learning to read for 60 minutes?"

@savvylearningco's Tony Mickelsen exposed the secret to reading success:

It's not:  
❌ Expensive curricula  
❌ Longer tutoring sessions  
❌ Pushing harder

It's understanding how children actually learn:  
✅ 25 minutes, 4x weekly  
✅ Consistency that builds momentum  
✅ Making it fun enough they want to come back

This "high-dosage" approach is 20X more effective than traditional tutoring.

Your child's reading struggles might not be about ability—they might be about approach.

Tony Mickelsen from Savvy Learning reveals why traditional 60-minute tutoring sessions are setting kids up to fail.

"What child is going to have fun learning to read for 60 minutes? That's tough for me as an adult, let alone for the little kids."

The solution? High-dosage tutoring: 25 minutes, 4 times weekly. Research shows it's 20X more effective because it works WITH children's natural attention spans, not against them.

When kids remain engaged throughout the entire session, every minute becomes productive. Even better: "They are hyped. They are having so much fun that they want to come back for the next session."

Watch the full explanation and learn more about this game-changing approach.

66% of American children struggle with reading, and 70% of them never catch up. But what if there was a solution that's 20x more effective than traditional methods?

Tony Mickelsen of @savvy-education-inc explains how their high-dosage tutoring approach transforms reading education through shorter, more frequent sessions that work with—not against—children's natural attention spans.

"What child is going to have fun learning to read for 60 minutes?" Mickelsen asks.

The secret to reading success isn't what most people think. It's not expensive curricula, longer sessions, or pushing harder. It's understanding how children actually learn: shorter, frequent sessions that build momentum and make learning enjoyable.

Watch this clip from the OpenEd podcast to understand why less truly is more when it comes to reading intervention.
