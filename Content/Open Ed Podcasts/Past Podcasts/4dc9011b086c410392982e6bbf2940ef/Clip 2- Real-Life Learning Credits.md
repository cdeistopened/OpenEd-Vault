[CLIP #2 - 29:02 to 29:56]
"One of the things that we're going to do is actually give transcript credit for real-life learning. If you have a high schooler who has been working at Chick-fil-A and recently moved up to Shift Leader, has taken on all these responsibilities, is learning so much about interpersonal communication and management and time management and customer service and even the finance pieces of doing the register at night. All of those things, that's real-life learning that should count for something we feel, right? So we're going to be able to work with you on getting transcript credit on their actual transcript from us."

What most people get wrong about education:

MYTH: Learning only happens in a classroom  
TRUTH: Some of the most valuable learning happens in real life

MYTH: Transcripts can only reflect traditional courses  
TRUTH: Work experience, travel, and projects can demonstrate meaningful skills

MYTH: Online school means sitting at a computer all day  
TRUTH: The best virtual schools encourage real-world application

MYTH: Learning must follow a standard timeline  
TRUTH: Education should adapt to each child's unique development

This is why OpenEd Academy gives transcript credit for real-life learning. When your teen works as a shift leader, travels abroad, completes an internship, or starts a business - that's REAL education that deserves REAL credit.

We're launching nationwide this fall, bringing accredited, personalized education that recognizes ALL the ways your child learns.

Who else believes education should value real-world experience?
