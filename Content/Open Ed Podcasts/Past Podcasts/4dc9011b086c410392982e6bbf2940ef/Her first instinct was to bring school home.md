"Her first instinct was to bring school home..."

  

  

  

### Don't Start With The Chalkboard

  
The first instinct is to recreate what we know.  
"I was going to be the teacher and my kids were going to be the students. I was going to have a chalkboard and the whole nine yards," shares Laura Feller in this week's OpenEd podcast.

But that's not what happened.

Instead, Laura discovered that learning doesn't need a classroom setup. It happens in the driveway with hopscotch math. In the car with audiobooks. At museums, parks, and everywhere in between.

"Learning became second nature in everything that we did," she explains.

After 8 years of doing open education, Laura says that if you're recreating school at home, you might be missing the forest for the trees.

Hear how Laura went from 'overwhelmed and scared' to confidently guiding three boys through personalized learning (including one who went from struggling with dysgraphia to thriving in college courses).

And check out the full episode to discover the simple observation technique Laura used in her first month that completely changed how she approached her children's education – and how you can use it too.

# Homeschooling Myth Busted: The Key to Success

Laura Feller: ~the plan 100 percent is do not recreate public school at home. That is not the way. And because I was such a public school kid myself and I loved public school and that's what worked for me. I 100 percent was ready to do that at home. I was going to be the teacher and my kids were going to be the students.

I was going to have a chalkboard and the whole nine yards. And that Um, that isn't what ended up happening at all because Terry, uh, Torianne was so wonderful in laying out, um, the idea of de schooling, which was completely pulling out of school completely, observing your children, finding out how they learn, what time of day they're most awake and alert, what, you know, What turns on their, their spark, what sparks them, what their passions are, what they enjoy, um, really just [00:01:00] kind of rebuilding that family connection, exploring the community, going to museums, going to, um, playdates and parks and, and, uh, field trips and all of those things to kind of get out into the world and explore.

And. What I ended up doing was slowly adding in home education into our fun daily activities. So we would read or do audiobooks in the car on the way to our activities or draw a hopscotch board on the driveway and work on addition and subtraction facts as we hop on the on the board and it just learning became. second nature in, in everything that we did.
