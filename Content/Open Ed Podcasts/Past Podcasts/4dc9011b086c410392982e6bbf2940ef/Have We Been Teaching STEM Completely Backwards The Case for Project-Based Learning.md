### an interview with Jack Casdorph and Rachel Davie on why theory-first education fails and how projects spark real curiosity

In the last few decades, we've seen declining interest in STEM subjects despite increased emphasis on their importance. While schools race to improve test scores, many children's natural scientific curiosity is being systematically extinguished in classrooms.

Jack Casdorph, a mechanical engineer developing hands-on physics kits, and Rachel Davie, a former math teacher now homeschooling her three children, join us to explore what's broken in traditional science education. Through personal stories and professional insights, they reveal how project-based learning can transform how children engage with STEM subjects, keeping curiosity at the heart of education.

**Andrea Fife: Tell us a little bit about how you feel science education is going in the world today.**

**Jack Casdorph:** I think that science and the way it is taught should be fun, and it often isn't. It should be the subject where you get to do stuff, touch things, play with things, see what they do. That's true of art and definitely PE, but other than that, most things are kind of on book, on paper. Science should be the break that kids get from that, but often it's not. It's just as much paper stuff as all the other subjects.

I love science. That's probably going to become apparent throughout this interview. I love making and building and math and engineering, all things related to that. But when I was in third grade, I was convinced that I didn't like science.

The reason was that I don't think I had a very good third grade science teacher. When she would have us do an experiment, I swear it was more about the writeup than the experiment. I actually remember we did one where we magnetized a needle and put it on a foam packing peanut in a bowl of water so that it could align with magnetic north – basically a homemade compass. The experiment itself was fine as a way to learn about magnetism, but it took like 25 seconds to do. Then we spent half an hour doing a writeup where she dictated in front of the entire class, verbatim, what we were supposed to write.

It was the most boring thing ever. She went through things like "Matter was not created or destroyed. Energy is not created or destroyed." Things that are true but not really even relevant. The whole time, even as a third grader, I couldn't tell that it was a bad way to teach science – I just thought science sucked. But I could tell something was wrong. I was thinking, "Of course matter wasn't created or destroyed. We put a piece of foam and a little metal stick in water. What did you think was going to happen?" The whole thing just felt ridiculous. Even though matter and energy were not created or destroyed, my interest in science at the time was totally destroyed. I thought it was just some bureaucratic rule-following thing where you had to write a bunch of stuff down because the man said you had to.

It wasn't until a few years later that I came to realize, "Oh, science is amazing." My third grade teacher just wasn't the best.

**Rachel Davie:** I agree with all of that. Learning math and science should be fun, and so often it's just not. Sometimes it's even the way that you're taught to teach that is not fun.

When I was teaching high school, I was on the other side of that issue. My first few years of teaching, all my training focused on ensuring students were proficient – teaching them exactly how to approach a problem, follow the steps, check every box, make sure you get the right answer. But over time, I realized this approach was limiting for students. Some remedial students struggled, but actually more often it was my advanced students, my honors level students. This approach took their thinking and really limited them. Their thinking became almost robotic. If they were given a question that didn't look exactly like the examples they'd seen before, they would freeze up with no idea how to even get started.

Since then, I've come a long way in understanding that true understanding doesn't come from drilling textbook procedures. It takes creativity and flexibility, and sometimes even pushing students to think for themselves, because that can actually be a challenge.

**Jack:** I found it interesting that you mentioned drilling or memorizing textbook procedures. I swear every single year, every science class I had, we would spend a week or two going over the steps of the scientific method, memorizing each one. It felt really redundant, and those steps didn't actually match up well with what I consider real investigating or learning. The process doesn't always follow rigid steps or order. Sometimes you go a little bit and then have to go back because you discovered something or messed something up. So why write a conclusion when your results were bad? Just go back, change something, and get better results.

My favorite version of the scientific method actually comes from watching Sesame Street with my kids. Their version is: "I wonder, what if, let's try." Obviously there are sub-steps you could break down, but I really like that simpler version of just "let's try it."

**Andrea:** That sounds great, and if you approached it that way, students would probably have more fun. Aside from just injecting fun into science or math – we're talking about some really related fields, this more comprehensive idea of STEM – what should we be doing to improve how STEM is approached?

**Jack:** I consider all the STEM things – science, technology, engineering, math – to be kind of the same basic thing, just on different portions of a spectrum. If we're including STEAM, art has its own spectrum from technical to free-flowing and artistic.

On one end of the STEM spectrum, you have the completely theoretical or abstract – just math. It talks about numbers and shapes and how they relate to each other. Next you have science, which does its best to describe and understand how the world around us works. Math is often a big part of that because it's the language of science. Things have mathematical relationships – objects fall at a certain rate, different things on different sides of a lever have mathematical relationships.

Next we have engineering, which is kind of the "so what" side of science. It's like, "Okay, we've learned these things about how the world works, now how can we manipulate the world to make it more what we want it to be? How can we optimize this thing? How can we tweak parameters to get the output we want?" Finally, we have technology, which is the application of engineering and science. I'm also going to include making and building as a subset of technology – things that I feel are lacking in most traditional education. Most kids don't know how to make or fix anything unless they've specifically sought out some shop class.

Traditional education spends too much time on the left end of this spectrum. It tends to start with theory and then kind of move toward application and problem-solving. The stuff on the right often isn't even touched. This leads to a couple problems. One is that you get kids who are a little bit robotic. They know how to answer textbook questions – you give them a question, boom, they've got it – but they don't know how to apply that knowledge or write their own questions based on what's happening around them. They lack problem-solving and reasoning skills, even though they might be great at computation and facts.

Another problem is that if you're only dealing with the theoretical side, you get that constant question kids ask: "When are we gonna use this in real life?" I'm actually curious – with both of you having teaching experience, have you ever gotten that question and struggled to come up with an answer?

**Rachel:** A hundred times, yes. On one level, you build trust with your students that, "Yes, we're building this skill and then we're going to use it in this application." Building that trust is necessary, but you want them to know this really is something useful.

What if people didn't start on the left hand side of the spectrum? What if they start on the far right and begin with a problem when they don't have any of the skills needed to solve it? I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on whether people can start on the right and work back to the left.

**Jack:** Yes, the simple answer is yes, you totally can – and you often should. To illustrate this, I want to share how my dad taught me. He's not what you'd typically think of as an educator or an academic, but when it comes to actually solving problems, whether it involves theoretical or practical skills, I feel like most of my knowledge about problem-solving came from my dad, not from my PhD professors.

When I was about eight or nine, I asked my dad if he could build me a treehouse. His response was, "Nope. But I can help you build a treehouse." I was a bit confused but thought, "Whatever, I'm getting a treehouse. That's all I care about."

He told me that before we could start building in a tree, he wanted me to get better at climbing trees. We went out, he showed off his own climbing skills, and gave me some benchmarks to meet before I'd be "monkey enough" to build a treehouse. I spent the next couple days climbing all over the trees in our yard, swinging from branches, and practicing fancy dismounts to prove I was ready.

After I'd been officially pronounced "monkey enough," he gave me a cordless drill for my birthday, along with Phillips bits and screws. He knew I'd be bad at using it at first and would trash some bits, so he got me extras. Then he said, "I need to replace some deck boards on the back deck, and I need someone with a brand new drill who needs to learn how to use it. Do you know anybody like that?" That's very much my dad's teaching approach.

After I'd put down a bunch of screws in the deck and made him frustrated by stripping many of them, I got to where I was at least okay with the drill. I asked, "Can we build the treehouse now?" He said, "Mostly, but before we get materials, we need a design." So he gave me paper, pencil, and ruler to draw different designs. I learned quickly how to draw so my dad could understand my scribbles, and he gave me tips on different views.

It happened that at the same time, we had a school project competition where we were supposed to make something representing a dream. My parents suggested making a miniature treehouse from popsicle sticks, which became another step in designing the real thing. My model actually won at the school level, went to regionals, and then to state.

Through this whole process, I learned how to use power tools, climb trees, make technical sketches, and communicate ideas. My dad saw I was excited about something and used that to teach me many skills. I probably spent about 120 hours of self-motivated learning, while he put in maybe 5-10 hours of giving feedback and presenting new challenges. For the time and money he invested, he got quite a bit of excited learning out of me.

**Rachel:** That sounds like a fascinating project. It reminds me of when my husband was replacing our wooden deck a few years ago. The wooden steps needed a new stringer, and he asked me to calculate how long it needed to be and what the angles should be. I remember thinking this would be a great project for my students, who were learning about solving right triangles. I took pictures and made a fun handout with questions.

Interestingly, my students responded completely differently than you did as a child. They complained and said it was too hard, asking, "Why can't we just do the worksheet on these? Why do we have to do such a hard problem?" They were stuck on the left side of your spectrum with the math problems. That whole practical side was a skill they hadn't developed because it takes more creativity and mental strength to wrestle with a problem and figure it out.

If you start at the end with the "why" and then go backwards to figure out the "how," you can get a totally different result.

**Andrea:** There's also something to be said for it being your own problem that you're invested in. I wonder if those same students would've been more motivated if their parents said, "We can install a swimming pool if you can figure out how to replace the deck." Students really see through fake problems we put in their path. Even if it is real-world learning, if it isn't in their real world, it can still feel like a well-written textbook problem when delivered in the classroom instead of on location, screwdriver in hand, in your own backyard.

I think this is a great thing to discuss. There's a word in academia for what we're talking about – project-based learning – and the challenges to it, why people shy away from it. But what Jack is describing as the way his dad teaches, many teachers would call project-based learning.

**Jack:** We didn't know that term at the time, and I'm sure my dad still doesn't, since he doesn't have any formal background in teaching. But yes, he could have totally just built the treehouse himself – he's a skilled builder and it wouldn't have been a big deal. Instead, he saw I was excited about something.

That can be the difference between the "real world" problem that's still a textbook problem because it's based on someone else's reality. A kid might think, "I'm not a framer, so what do I care about stair stringers? I'm never going to do that." But if it's something the kid is already excited about and willing to work for, that's where project-based learning can excel.

I was really excited about the treehouse, and my dad saw that. So he thought, "I can use this to teach my kid a bunch of stuff." In the process, I learned to use power tools, climb trees, get exercise, make technical sketches, and communicate ideas. I learned many things, all driven by my own motivation.

Also, as a side note, many employers are starting to hire based more on skills than academic credentials. A good thing about project-based learning is that if you've done projects and documented them, you can create a portfolio to demonstrate the skills you've learned.

**Andrea:** That's excellent. Rachel, I'm really interested in your perspective as both a classroom educator and someone who teaches your own kids at home.

**Rachel:** I think there's tremendous value in this approach. With my own kids at home, I've noticed how much more engaged they are when learning grows organically from their interests rather than from a predetermined curriculum. They retain so much more when the learning connects to something they care about.

**Andrea:** It sounds like we're making a case for completely flipping the traditional education model. Instead of starting with theory and then maybe getting to practical application if there's time, we should start with exciting projects and then introduce theory as it becomes necessary to solve real problems.

**Jack:** Exactly. I think the natural way humans learn is by doing something, running into a problem, and then seeking the knowledge needed to overcome that obstacle. Traditional education often does the opposite – it frontloads all this information without context and hopes students will remember it for when they eventually need it.

Going back to the Sesame Street scientific method I mentioned – "I wonder, what if, let's try" – it's brilliant in its simplicity. Kids naturally follow this process. They see something interesting, they form a question, they make a hypothesis about what might happen, and then they test it out. The learning comes from the results of that experiment, not from memorizing the steps beforehand.

**Rachel:** I've found this approach works especially well with math. When my students see a practical problem first – like calculating angles for building something they care about – they have a genuine reason to learn trigonometry. The formulas become tools rather than abstract concepts to memorize.

**Jack:** I think that's why my engineering education finally clicked for me. We had these design projects where we had to build something that worked. The physics and math became relevant because they helped us solve real problems. I just wish more of that approach was incorporated earlier in education.

**Andrea:** So what advice would you give to parents and teachers who want to incorporate more project-based learning?

**Jack:** Start with what excites the child. Like my treehouse example – my dad didn't force a project on me; he took something I was already passionate about and turned it into a learning opportunity. Then, be willing to let the process be messy. Real learning isn't linear or neat.

**Rachel:** And remember that the goal isn't necessarily a perfect final product. The learning happens in the struggle, the mistakes, and the problem-solving. Sometimes the best projects are the ones where everything goes wrong, and you have to figure out why.

**Jack:** Absolutely. In fact, my dad intentionally let me make mistakes with that drill because he knew I'd learn more from fixing them than from never experiencing them. Traditional education is often so focused on getting the right answer that we forget the value of productive failure.

**Andrea:** It seems like the real shift needs to happen in how we measure success in education. If it's all about test scores and perfect answers, we'll keep getting the kind of education that kills curiosity.

**Jack:** Right. We need to value the skills that matter in the real world – creativity, problem-solving, adaptability, and the ability to learn new things. Those rarely show up on standardized tests, but they're what make the difference between someone who can repeat facts and someone who can actually create and innovate.
