Greetings Open Eddies!

Everyone obsesses about the first three years of childhood. Sleep schedules, developmental milestones, organic purees. But another equally-critical period often gets neglected: Middle school.

In middle school, you've got kids who are 6'4" standing next to kids who are 4'6". Some are still playing with Hot Wheels, while others starting to drive. Some are reading Percy Jackson, others reading Dostoyevsky.

Turns out that chaos isn't a bug—it's a feature. The brain science on ages 11-14 is wild, and most parents have no idea what's happening.

Check out Ela’s recent [conversation with Jean Eddy](https://www.notion.so/open-ed/podcast-link) for the details, or read on for the highlights!

Why Middle School Matters More Than College Prep: The Science Parents Are Missing

## Preview Text

New research shows middle schoolers' brains absorb information like toddlers—and parents are missing the most critical window for career exploration. Jean Eddy, CEO of American Student Assistance, explains why waiting until high school is too late.

  

# The Middle School Window Parents Are Missing

"Middle school kids have brains that are as thirsty, as willing to take in information as toddlers."

Jean Eddy, CEO of American Student Assistance, isn't making this up. She's talked to faculty at UVA and NYU, read [the research on adolescent brain development](https://news.virginia.edu/content/what-if-we-could-remake-middle-school), and the science backs her up.

After the initial explosion of brain development in early childhood, there's a [second major window of neuroplasticity](https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/adolescent_brain_a_second_window_of_opportunity_a_compendium.pdf) during ages 11-14—when the brain reorganizes itself almost as dramatically as it did in toddlerhood.

The catch? "A young person who was like 13 years old is not totally wedded to what his friends say. But wait until he's 15 and the story changes."

Peer pressure calcifies. Social hierarchies solidify. The willingness to try new things—especially things that might make you look foolish—disappears.

Most schools introduce career exploration in high school. By then, Eddy says, it's too late. The window has already started to close.

## School Kills What Middle School Brains Need Most

During this narrow window when middle schoolers are still open to exploration, one element determines whether they'll engage: fun.

"What school is supposed to be and should be is fun. And from fun, it's going to take on learning."

But most middle schools do the opposite—piling on pressure and grades just as students enter their most receptive learning phase.

Young women in STEM are the clearest example. "Young women really if they have any kind of difficulty at all in math or science, they kind of immediately pull back and say, well, okay, I'm not good for this anyway, girls don't do this."

Give those same girls a chance to explore STEM in a low-pressure environment during middle school, and girls who thought they hated science end up mentoring other students, connecting with NASA scientists, building mock space stations. The difference is they were allowed to explore without pressure during the window when their brains could absorb it.

## The College Obsession Wastes the Window

Part of what makes ages 11-14 so valuable is that students haven't yet internalized the pressure that shuts down exploration later.

"Parents feel as though if they don't get their kids to college that they've failed. Kids feel as though if they don't go to college that they failed their parents."

This cycle destroys the exact kind of open-ended exploration that middle school brains are primed for.

Eddy talks about plumbers with genuine reverence. These professionals need to understand fluid dynamics, business management, customer service, and smart home technology. They often out-earn college graduates and have job security that would make a middle manager weep. Yet we treat these paths as consolation prizes.

"So many young people can do this exploration and decide even to do some kind of career focused educational path, whether it's a certificate or some training program. That doesn't stop them from thinking about college later on."

Later. Not never. After they've explored during the window when exploration actually works.

## How to Use the Window Before It Closes

If you're homeschooling and your kid shows interest in something, lean in. Field trips, hands-on projects, conversations with people doing that work. Not back-to-back programming, but unstructured time to explore alongside intentional exposure.

If your kids are in traditional school, supplement. ASA offers [free digital tools like Futurescape](https://futurescape.asa.org/) where kids explore careers through games and assessments. Seventy-four percent of users learned about personal strengths and career matches. Seventy-eight percent discovered jobs they didn't know existed.

The simplest tool costs nothing: genuine curiosity about what makes your child come alive.

Start by changing one question. Instead of "How was school?" try asking: "What excited you today?"

Your kid will probably look at you weird at first. "Initially your son or daughter might look at you and think, what is this?" Eddy acknowledges. "But once they get into the rhythm, you'd be surprised."

It shifts the conversation from obligation to discovery. During middle school, that shift matters.

"Trust me when I say that level of interest pays out, it always pays out."

Between ages 11-14, students have a unique combination: high neuroplasticity and low peer pressure. That combination doesn't last. By high school, the pressure to conform overwhelms the curiosity to explore.

We can keep treating middle school as preparation for high school, or we can recognize it for what it is—a rare developmental moment when exploration is both biologically optimal and socially possible.

"We work a very long time in this life, a very long time. You better figure out what it is you love to do because you're going to be doing it for a very long time."

The window is open. Don’t waste it!

<needs some kind of transition - without a header.. ‘so what cna you actually do?>

Instead of "How was school?" try this: "What excited you today?"

Not "How was school?" Not "Did you finish your homework?" But "What excited you?"

She acknowledged the awkwardness. "Initially your son or daughter might look at you and think, what is this? But once they get into the rhythm, you'd be surprised."

<probably move this down below to where we talk about what you can do…>

~~I've seen this play out. My brother's fascination with coffee didn't come from someone assigning it to him. It came from having time and space to explore, mess around, and get genuinely interested in something. And now that passion is shaping how he sees the world—even at his first job.~~

## The Fun Factor Everyone Forgets

When I asked Jean about the difference between career exploration and career readiness (which often just feels like more stress piled onto kids), she said something that stopped me <it’s still here…this is cringe>: "What school is supposed to be and should be is fun. And from fun, it's going to take on learning."

Jean gave me an example. She worked with young women in Brockton, Massachusetts who were interested in the space program. Their teacher connected them with a NASA scientist. These girls started building a mock space station. They began mentoring other students. They were beaming about it.

Why? "Because this was the coolest thing and the most fun thing they've done."

Same with the girls who thought they hated STEM. "Young women really if they have any kind of difficulty at all in math or science, they kind of immediately pull back and say, well, okay, I'm not good for this anyway, girls don't do this."

Give those same girls a chance to explore STEM in a low-pressure, fun environment during middle school, and everything changes.

## The College-or-Failure Trap

"Parents feel as though if they don't get their kids to college that they've failed. Kids feel as though if they don't go to college that they failed their parents."

This cycle is destroying families. And it's built on a false premise.

Jean talks about plumbers with genuine reverence. These professionals need to understand fluid dynamics, business management, customer service, and smart home technology. They often out-earn college graduates. They have job security that would make a middle manager weep. Yet we treat these paths as consolation prizes.

"So many young people can do this exploration and decide even to do some kind of career focused educational path, whether it's a certificate or some training program or whatever it may happen to be. That doesn't stop them from thinking about college later on."

Later. Not never. After they've explored, after they've discovered what interests them, after they've developed some sense of who they are beyond their parents' expectations.

## What You Can Actually Do

If you're homeschooling and your kid shows interest in science, lean in. Field trips to ponds and streams. Wildlife conversations. Science museums. Not back-to-back programming, but unstructured time to explore alongside intentional exposure to what fascinates them.

If your kids are in traditional school, you can supplement. ASA offers [free digital tools like Futurescape](https://futurescape.asa.org/) where kids can explore careers through games and assessments. Seventy-four percent of users learned about personal strengths and career matches. Seventy-eight percent discovered jobs they didn't know existed.

But the real tool is simpler: genuine curiosity about what makes your child come alive.

"Trust me when I say that level of interest pays out, it always pays out."

## The Window Is Brief

Middle school isn't a warm-up for high school. It's a critical moment.

The brain science is clear. The window for open, curious exploration before peer pressure calcifies is narrow. And most parents don't even know it's open.

We can keep pushing SAT prep and AP classes. Or we can ask different questions. Start different conversations. Give our kids space to discover what excites them—while their brains are still wired to absorb everything.

"We work a very long time in this life, a very long time. You better figure out what it is you love to do because you're going to be doing it for a very long time."

## Blog Post

There's a moment in my conversation with Jean Eddy when she says something crazy: "Middle school kids have brains that are as thirsty and as willing to take in information as toddlers."

She's citing research from UVA and NYU that challenges how we think about adolescent development.

Eddy, who runs American Student Assistance and has spent three decades in education, has become obsessed with this finding. And for good reason. While most parents are focused on SAT prep and college applications, they're missing what might be the most important window in their child's development—ages 11 to 14.

### The Middle School Brain Discovery

During middle school, the brain undergoes a transformation that rivals early childhood development. Neural pathways are forming at extraordinary rates. The capacity for absorbing new information peaks. And critically—this is the part that made Eddy pivot her entire organization—this is when career interests and self-concept begin to crystallize.

"We did a lot of research and I was really surprised to find out that middle school kids have brains that are as thirsty as, as willing to take in information as toddlers, that their brains are just so absorbing at that point in time that this is the time to start introducing all kinds of things," Eddy explains. She's talked to faculty at UVA and NYU, read the research, and become fascinated by it.

But here's what's maddening: We're doing everything backwards.

Most schools wait until high school to introduce career exploration. By then, Eddy argues, it's often too late. "A young person who was like 13 years old, he is not totally wedded to what his friends say. But wait until he's 15 and the story changes." The peer pressure intensifies. The social hierarchies solidify. The willingness to try new things—especially things that might make you look foolish—evaporates.

### Why School Should Be Fun (And Usually Isn't)

There's another revelation in our conversation that sounds almost radical in today's achievement-obsessed culture: School should be fun.

"What school is supposed to be and should be is fun. And from fun, it's going to take on learning," Eddy insists. This isn't some progressive education fantasy. It's neuroscience. When kids enjoy what they're learning, retention increases, engagement deepens, and most importantly, they develop a love of learning that sustains them through life.

But walk into most middle schools and you'll find the opposite. Eddy points to a particularly painful example: young women in math and science. "Young women really if they have any kind of difficulty at all in math or science, they kind of immediately pull back and say, well, okay, I'm not good for this anyway, girls don't do this."

The tragedy isn't just that they're wrong—it's that we're catching them at precisely the wrong moment. Give those same girls a chance to explore STEM in a low-pressure, fun environment during middle school, and everything changes. Eddy has seen it happen countless times. Girls who thought they hated science end up mentoring other students, connecting with NASA scientists, building mock space stations.

The difference? They were given permission to explore without the pressure of grades, college applications, or peer judgment. They were allowed to have fun.

### Breaking Free from the College Trap

Perhaps the most controversial thing Eddy says is about college itself. She describes a vicious cycle that's destroying families: "Parents feel as though if they don't get their kids to college that they've failed. Kids feel as though if they don't go to college that they failed their parents."

This isn't anti-college rhetoric. It's pro-reality. Eddy tells me about plumbers—yes, plumbers—with a reverence usually reserved for doctors and lawyers. "Plumbers have real insights into so many things. All of us think about, well, this is the person I'm calling because I have a problem in my bathroom. No, not necessarily."

She's right. These professionals need to understand fluid dynamics, business management, customer service, and increasingly, smart home technology. They often out-earn college graduates. They have job security that would make a middle manager weep. Yet we treat these paths as consolation prizes rather than legitimate first choices.

"So many young people can do this exploration and decide even to do some kind of career, career focused educational path, whether it's a certificate or some training program or whatever it may happen to be. That doesn't stop them from thinking about college later on."

The key word there is "later." Not never. Later. After they've explored, after they've discovered what actually interests them, after they've developed some sense of who they are beyond their parents' expectations.

### The Conversation That Changes Everything

Near the end of our discussion, Eddy offers perhaps the most practical advice of all. It's devastatingly simple: Change the dinner table conversation.

"Wouldn't it just be great if the parent just said something like every day, what excited you today?" she asks. Not "How was school?" Not "Did you finish your homework?" But "What excited you?"

She acknowledges the awkwardness. "Initially your son or daughter might look at you and think, what is this? But once they get into the rhythm, you'd be surprised."

This isn't just about better communication. It's about fundamentally reframing education from obligation to exploration, from performance to discovery. It's about catching kids at that magical middle school moment when their brains are primed for learning, before the world tells them who they're supposed to be.

Eddy's organization offers free digital tools for career exploration. But the real tool, she insists, is simpler: genuine curiosity about what makes your child come alive. "Trust me when I say that level of interest pays out, it always pays out."

The window is brief. The stakes are high. And most parents don't even know it's open.

Parents, here’s the mistake almost everyone makes

We pour time, money, and energy into SAT prep, college tours, and applications…

but neuroscience shows the

_real_

critical window is

**middle school**

.

Ages 11–14 are when kids’ brains are most open—just like toddlers.

That’s when curiosity is alive, career interests start forming, and the willingness to try new things hasn’t been crushed by peer pressure yet.

Wait until high school, and the window may already be closing.

So don’t just prep for college. Help your middle schooler explore

_who they are_

—now.
