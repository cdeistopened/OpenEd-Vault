[CLIP #1 - COMBINED]
[21:51.139-22:49.302] Isaac: "Chapter three opens with this: 'LeBron James is a failure.' Now it says after that, 'at least he would be if he were graded like we grade our kids.' But I love that chapter opening because it really gets at what we were just talking about. LeBron James is a failure if we apply this rubric to him, to any basketball player, to any athlete. You mean you make 50% of the shots that you take? That's it? On a grading scale? We're talking F, right?"

[24:08.462-25:08.462] Matt: "I love the quote that we questionably attribute to Albert Einstein: 'If you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it'll live its whole life feeling stupid.' We put a graphic in the book that I hope readers digest as they read it. Can fish climb trees? No, they can't. So why are we judging a fish on its ability to climb a tree when that just doesn't make sense? In the picture, the monkey is excited. The squirrel is optimistic they'll perform well on the 'climb the tree exam,' but the fish is terrified. It's just funny how we try to paint every child as the same by birth year and cohort. That's the most illogical way to organize kids."
