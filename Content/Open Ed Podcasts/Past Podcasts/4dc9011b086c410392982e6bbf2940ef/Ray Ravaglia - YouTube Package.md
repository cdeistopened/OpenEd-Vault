Basic Summary: Ray Ravaglia discusses the failures of online education, emphasizing that the lack of personal relationships leads to high attrition rates. He advocates for synchronous learning, which he claims reduces attrition from 30% to 3%. With over 30 years of experience, he asserts that parents should view themselves as employers of their child's education, not servants, and highlights his pioneering work in online education.

# YouTube Description

The man who created Stanford's first online high school in 2005 explains why most online education fails—and it's not about the technology. Ray Ravaglia built two successful online schools by breaking every rule Silicon Valley taught him.

Ray pioneered online education before anyone knew what to call it—developing the first online AP Calculus course in 1989 when CD-ROMs cost $4,000 to produce and blanks were $45 each. As founder of Stanford Online High School and Vice Chairman of Dwight Global School, he's learned that technology was supposed to democratize education but instead isolated learners. His breakthrough: synchronous learning with real relationships dropped attrition from 30% to 3%. After 30+ years in the field, his message is clear: you're the employer of your child's school, not their servant.
