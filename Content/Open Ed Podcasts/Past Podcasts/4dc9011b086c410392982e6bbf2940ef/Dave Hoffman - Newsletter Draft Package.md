# A public school administrator shares the truth about homeschooling

They all turned out just fine. Better than fine, actually. PLUS: The Southwest napkin philosophy that changes everything.

---

Greetings!

In this week's podcast, Ela talks with Dave Hoffman, who spent decades as a public school teacher and administrator before joining BYU, where he now recommends programs like BYU Independent Study to families.

Meanwhile, all six of his own kids were mainly unschooled. They turned out just fine—better than fine, actually. None went to college, and he’s proud to admit that every single one makes more money than he does.

Let's dive in.

## THE GAP SCHOOLS FORGOT

Everyone worries about homeschool "gaps"—missing algebra, skipped geometry, incomplete transcripts. But **Dave Hoffman**, a former public school administrator who unschooled all six of his kids, noticed a different gap: schools teach kids to follow instructions, not solve problems.

His son wasn't great at textbook math. Today he calculates laser-level excavation for a living—slopes, grades, elevation to the inch. Real-world problem-solving that actually matters.

Meanwhile, Dave manages adults at BYU who freeze when asked to strategize. "I can't get some of them to think past, 'What do you want me to do on this?'" They were trained to check boxes, not create solutions.

None of Dave's kids went to college. All six out-earn him. All are confident, independent problem-solvers. Turns out the gap that matters isn't algebra—it's initiative.

---

## BE A PLANE FULL OF YES

Dave fights rigid policies constantly at BYU. Yesterday, he broke the rules to give a **14-year-old foster child** a scholarship for a university course they weren't technically eligible for. The kid was aging out of the system, convinced they weren't smart enough for college.

**"If this kid can take one class, just one, and feel confident, maybe they'll change their life."**

So he ignored the policy.

He learned this from a **Southwest Airlines napkin**: _"In a world full of no, we're a plane full of yes."_

That's his motto now. There's always a fence, Dave says—and you have to ask, "Why is it here?" If the reasoning is weak, build a gate. Decades inside Big Education taught him which fences to ignore.

What if every parent approached learning this way? Default to yes. Question the arbitrary nos. Trust your instinct.

## TOOL SPOTLIGHT: BYU INDEPENDENT STUDY

Dave works at BYU and regularly recommends their Independent Study program to families—it's one of the most flexible tools in open education.

**What makes it work:** You get university-backed curriculum without rigid schedules. Families can pick and choose courses that fit their needs, moving at their own pace. It's the best of both worlds—institutional credibility meets family autonomy.

Dave's family tried multiple approaches before finding what clicked. When his son discovered Teaching Textbooks through their exploration, he passed college algebra at 17—something Dave couldn't do at 23.

**The takeaway:** Programs like BYU Independent Study give you options, not mandates. You're building the mix that works.

---

---

## BONUS: THE MATH PROGRAM THAT FINALLY CLICKED

If your kid says "I'm bad at math," try **Teaching Textbooks** before you believe them. Dave's son went from hating math to passing college algebra at 17—just by finding the right fit. You don't need to be a math expert. You need the right tool.

That's all for today!

## Transcript

Ela Richmond (00:00.866)  
Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm your sometimes host, Ella, and today I'm joined by Dave Hoffman. Dave, can you give us a little bit of a background? How did you get started in education?

Dave Hoffman (00:12.938)  
I got started in education when I studied Spanish and I wanted to be an FBI agent. That was my grand goal. As I took all the tests and I got to the final interview with nine agents, I didn't pass. It was a crazy time and I thought, what am going to do? Because I couldn't reapply for a year. I I have a Spanish degree and communications degree.

And that's what I was going to the FBI for. And I thought, well, I'll try to teach. I'll teach while I'm waiting. And I never reapplied to the FBI. And I continued to teach and become an administrator. I started just subbing in Salt Lake City a little bit. And then we moved to Southern California to start my teaching career.

Ela Richmond (01:03.468)  
And why'd you stay in teaching?

Dave Hoffman (01:03.754)  
Thank you.

I love teaching. I feel like that's one of my passions. I love teaching. I love the interaction with the students.

Dave Hoffman (01:20.074)  
They get my humor and I can joke with them a lot. Teaching was like I couldn't believe I got paid to teach because it was fun every day. Granted, it was emotionally exhausting sometimes and I would come home dead. But I got off at 3.30, 4, right? So I'd go home in Southern California and just jump in the pool. So I de-stressed quickly.

So it was a great time. I coached a little bit while I taught. And so that was fun for me. I got to coach high school basketball and water polo. It was just, I participated in almost everything you could think of from home and hospital teaching to water polo coach to the senior class advisor to peer tutoring mentor to, I mean, I pretty much did it all.

Ela Richmond (02:15.79)  
And then you've also had experience in like charter and private schools as well. So what brought you to like the different sides of education, right? So you've, were a teacher, then an admin, and then all of a sudden you start foraying into these, these different models of education.

Dave Hoffman (02:16.202)  
you

Dave Hoffman (02:33.64)  
Yeah, that's because I wasn't really a I guess I was raised through public education as was my whole family and we knew nothing different at the time and there was nothing different at the time. But these days and in the days that my children were young, there started to be all of these choices in education and all these things that we could participate in that we could kind of customize the education according to our kids needs and.

I really jumped on board, my wife and I jumped on board with that. And that took my mind into different areas. And I thought, wow, these charter schools are serving a cool purpose. And I'd like to try to teach and maybe be a principal in one of those and take a leadership charter or a charter that kind of aligns with our values or our focus and see if, you know, my kids attended some of those schools as we homeschooled, they would come with partial schedule or they even attended full year.

at a couple of them. So it was just kind of in thinking about alternative ways to educate that got me interested in working at charters and then private schools. I worked at a charter that was where I taught seventh through 12th grade boys all in one class and they were all at risk kids. Some were homeless in Southern California. And that was quite an experience. That matter of fact that

those kids really left impression on me. Just the fact that they could get to school, that they could get a uniform that complied with the school policies and things. It was awesome. We did a lot of work with those kids and a lot of hands-on, a lot of exploratory, experiential stuff. a lot of just been around the block, I guess a lot with different kinds of education. And of course,

At the same time, I homeschooled my kids, which was never really popular with anybody in my realm.

Ela Richmond (04:35.572)  
Interesting. So I will ask about why you decided to homeschool initially, it sounds like you were interested in choices. Like that was your initial step into this alternative education, like kind of customizing your own education space. it sounds like from my experience, the majority of families that I talked to, right, they didn't intend to get into this.

Dave Hoffman (04:43.21)  
Thank

Ela Richmond (05:01.814)  
It was just kind of like, I need other options. I need to find something else because something's really not working for my kid. Why were you so intrigued by just like the idea of options? Like, why was that something that was so interesting to you that you were like, we don't necessarily need it. Like nobody's struggling too bad, like, but why not step into this?

Dave Hoffman (05:27.274)  
Yeah, it's a good question. think there's many reasons for that. First of all, my first daughter, we sent to kindergarten and it was at a charter school, local charter school of people that we knew that ran it. We thought this would be great. And she went to charter school and in kindergarten and a couple of weeks into it, had kind of she kind of her personality changed quite a bit. She was she was a more aloof.

Ela Richmond (05:51.874)  
Mmm.

Dave Hoffman (05:54.154)  
She became kind of sassy and we were like, what's going on with our five-year-old? And we just visited the school and we were just, you know, maybe kind of shadowed a few days and thought, you know what, there's nothing about kindergarten that we couldn't do at home. And her two sisters miss her horribly. And so it was kind of a combination of, hey, I think we can provide a customized plan, know, educational plan for our daughter and.

she can still remain best friends with her siblings who worked in school yet. And so it kind of started there. And then we first grade and we put her in first grade and same thing happened. And we're like, okay, we can do this first grade stuff too. This is easy. And so we, and then it just kept going and going and we figured out a lot of things. We were actually participating in co-ops and things that helped support us in the homeschool world. But that just really got my mind going is that the education really isn't.

going to a school and listening to bells ringing, going class to class, having homework that doesn't maybe not very meaningful. And I thought about my education. I could not remember hardly anything. There was nothing significant about my childhood education that really changed me. So relationships did. And sometimes my efforts in athletics did because those were very, you

memorable poignant times that that etched a little bit of a little bit of history into my heart But you know for the most part I couldn't remember anything from middle school and high school let alone elementary On a level on an education level unless I had done something or gone somewhere or built something or you know did something meaningful that that kind of Formed an impression on me. So we thought we could

There's so many ways to educate. And we started reading books and attending conferences. And we thought, wow, we supplemented with so many different things. Our kids did so many different things. We were non-diploma seekers. We became the biggest unschoolers that ever existed. And I went to a school every day with bells and policies and rules and just conveyor belt learning forever.

Ela Richmond (08:15.104)  
Why? Like why did you decide, like it almost seems confusing. And I would be, if I was a teacher next to you and asking you questions about the way that you're educating, I'd be kind of like, wait, what? Like you're doing something that is so different for work than you are at home. Why did you do that differently?

Dave Hoffman (08:37.962)  
I think, well, a few reasons also. First of all, I feel like I could still have an impact on kids in the classroom because my classroom was way different than the average classroom. Kids loved coming to my class. would like to say I sponsored everything. I could have an additional effect on those kids. So my work became very impactful, I think, on other kids. Matter of fact, I know it did. I mean, from letters and parents and things, even in the future that I would get.

that you had such an impact and this little thing you did was so, I'm so grateful that my child was able, just, I was able to have an impact on kids and I felt like that altruistically was some type of mission for me. teaching, I was great at communicating, I was great at persuading kids to learn my subject. I took nothing too personally, everything I kind of like.

made it like it was just, you we're going to learn Spanish because I taught Spanish in high school. And it was it was going to be the most fun class that I could make it and still learn a time. And we were going to do things kind of out of the ordinary. I was always behind the other teachers and they were they would say, hey, you're you're behind them. You're not on this chapter. And I'm like, I know, because we did this and this and this was more meaningful and they know how to speak better because I did this and this. And so I was

little bit of a rebel in the old public school system, even though I taught in it. But, you know, at home, I really didn't get a lot of flack for keeping my kids at home. just, nobody really, they didn't care. It was kind of becoming in vogue a little bit. Some, you know, and matter of fact, I learned as I was studying homeschooling that public school teachers and administrators homeschool their kids at a higher percent ratio than just the average person. So I thought, well, there you go.

they kind of know why they want to and they have specific reasons they want to. They see the other side and they think, hey, I can provide options for my kids and I'm going to. And so, yeah, it worked out great.

Ela Richmond (10:44.546)  
That's awesome. And then you ended up moving to Utah at some point. Where does that fit into the story?

Dave Hoffman (10:50.952)  
Yeah, we actually moved around quite a bit because we homeschooled and we could and I could get a job anywhere. I seriously if we said decided we wanted to move somewhere, I would go there in the summer and I would interview and I'd have three or four. I mean, first instance, we went to Colorado Springs from California and I interviewed at three different four different districts. I got offered jobs at all four districts. I could take my choice. And so we just were on an adventure. It was like, let's go see the country a little bit and

In some places we had five acres and a farmhouse and other places we were in neighborhoods and sometimes we were in cities and downtown. We just got to see a lot of the world and I think that was part of our kids education. Coming back to Utah, we'd done enough of that. thought, let's just go back and it's funny because we ended up settling in my wife's hometown and we'd always been looking for a quaint little town to settle in and lo and behold, was where my wife came from.

That's how we get in the back yard.

Ela Richmond (11:50.658)  
That's So you've done a lot of work inside of public schools, inside of charter schools, and then at a certain point you started doing administrative work, right? Was there like a, I don't know, what were the different things you were trying to change and impact? Were you trying to help teachers see the classroom more like you did, where you would go a little bit slower sometimes, but it would be fun?

What were you actively pursuing as an administrator in all of these roles?

Dave Hoffman (12:23.754)  
Yeah, I think as an administrator, well, first of all, was pursuing pursuing more money because I had to support six kids and a wife at home. And I was a single we were a single family in single income family. And that was the way to do it is an administration. But also, I felt like I could have a larger effect on the whole student body instead of just one hundred and fifty kids that they would shovel through my class, you know, my classroom every year. And that that that really did happen. I could do that. I was I was.

I hosted assemblies and I spoke and I was able to just kind of be more, maybe more of an influence as an administrator, even though my administrative time I disliked because it was, I'll say this, it was the majority of the work that I did was a negative type of work. It was dealing with.

Ela Richmond (13:17.912)  
What do mean?

Dave Hoffman (13:18.954)  
You have so many constituencies that you're to, you need to please or that your stakeholders that you need to, you you need to be responsible to. And it seemed like parents were always just a little bit miffed and there was always somebody that wasn't getting treated right. And the parents were, so I had all kinds of, I would just, it would be hard, emotional, negative meetings with parents. Teachers were,

always going AWOL on me and they would come in and gripe and cry and everything else about things in their life or the situation there and the kid and whatever. Then I was doing discipline at school. lot of times, the discipline in school takes a ton of time. Matter of fact, at one charter school, was at K-8. I told the board, said, look, I'm doing 50 percent of my time or more is with student interaction, but most of it's negative because it has to do with

accountability and discipline. It's heavy, it's hard, I need help. It became that. You would not believe at any local high school here in Utah, I dealt with the police on a monthly basis. We didn't have a student resource officer, I had the police on speed dial. Everything from theft to drugs to you wouldn't.

Ela Richmond (14:31.405)  
What?

Dave Hoffman (14:44.746)  
could not believe what goes on in a typical high school. And that's a great high school. Those are leadership high schools or charter high schools that were built to serve a community that is a little closer and where the kids maybe are a little more motivated. Holy cow. know, kids will be kids and they'll make dumb decisions and even adults. I ended up firing adults because of stealing computers and pawning them off at local pawn shops and

changing their students' on the state website for their whole career. I had to fire a lady for that. She busted into the accounting, the state reporting system. I mean, it's just crazy. It goes on and on and on and on. You wouldn't believe it. mean, affairs at the schools and the two teachers have to be fired. I mean, just crazy, crazy. It was like a soap opera. And dealing with that on an administrative level was heavy. It was heavy, not enjoyable.

I like time with the kids and activities or hosting things or dances or things where we could interact and assemblies and things or being in a classroom and learning with them as an instructional leader. That was great. But to tell you the truth, lot of administrative stuff was heavy and negative.

Ela Richmond (16:02.836)  
It sounds like it. What is the future that you'd love to see inside of public schools? Because I know that you're very future thinking, future forward. And I also know that, or at least what it sounds like from the conversations that we've had in the past, that you also are very optimistic about where education is headed. And you've seen the trends, you've seen how it's evolved. Where would you like to see public schools and traditional charter schools going?

Dave Hoffman (16:33.716)  
Well, that's a great question. I would just like to, you know, the fact that there's choice in where you can send your student now and there's all of these ESAs where the money's just like a voucher system. I think that's going to force and is forcing schools, both public charter and private, to be the best they can be and be a product that the students want to come to and parents want to send their kids to.

I think the more that public schools participate in the capitalist society that we live in and aren't monopolies, then we'll get a better product. We'll get more innovative thinking. We'll get better educational opportunities for the kids. And ultimately, because of that, because of the creativity and the innovation, teachers and administrators will be happier. It will be more fulfilling.

as a group. I just feel like that's the way things need to go. And I feel like they're going that way. And I think that's good. I think that's great. mean, if you have a hamburger business right next to McDonald's and you sell crappy hamburgers, you're going to have a business and that's all there is to it. And to close a school down here or there, a public school is not a bad thing. That's a great thing actually, because the other schools are going to become stronger.

no matter what kind of schools they are, because they see that, hey, kids are making the decision now that they don't have to come here. We can't force them to come here. So I think that the choice has become kind of embedded into our school society, our school systems, and it's really causing improvement, innovative thinking, just new forms and new styles and new opportunities for kids.

Ela Richmond (18:32.418)  
That's super fascinating. I've had a conversation with people that are quite opposed to choice, actually. And something that they say, which I'd love your take on because you've been in the administrative role, you're not opposed to public schools, you've been inside of them for so long, is that once you take out the ability, or once you give people the ability to choose, you take out the, I guess, the structure that exists, right? The people that are the most,

the most privileged will be the ones that can leave and everybody else stays and misses out and loses out. So whenever you were talking about like, okay, it's not bad for a public school to close. I've had this conversation before and people will like throw at me this, okay, but what about all these families that are going to lose out and whose parents don't care as much? What have you seen in this choice movement that makes you have other opinions?

Dave Hoffman (19:36.522)  
Excuse me, I think that first of all,

Dave Hoffman (19:43.914)  
some of the... excuse me.

Dave Hoffman (19:50.09)  
Some of the people that, I mean, that's real limited thinking. Good night. If you were to say like, if you were to say.

Ela Richmond (19:56.78)  
If you need to pause to get some water, can totally do that. Okay, no worries, no worries. We do post-production on everything, so.

Dave Hoffman (20:01.106)  
I have some water right here, let take it.

Dave Hoffman (20:07.45)  
I'm sure you do because I sound like a cigar smoker. Okay, I just choked a little bit. Anyway, I think it's real limited thinking on on people's parts to think that, hey, look at all the people that are that are missing out or you're you guys are I got accused of that all the time at charter schools of of skimming the cream off the top of the of the student body and taking the elite. Because they because they wanted to come to my school.

Ela Richmond (20:10.634)  
Ha!

Dave Hoffman (20:36.362)  
and they wanted a different experience. you know what, I'll tell you what, I had 20 % of the population of every school I ever administered at that was special education. They had had an IEP or 504 just like my public school did. I mean, we really, we pulled in anybody, you can't refuse anybody in a public school. You can't say, no, you can't come. You can say, hey, this is what we do. And we think the school might be too hard for you or might not fit your values.

But you can't say you can't come. So if mom and dad says, I don't care. I want the small classroom size. I want the leadership program. I want the service element. I want all of this stuff for my child. You take that child and you try to help them kind of rise to that level. So I don't buy into the fact that choice skims the cream off the top. Obviously, those with more means could afford private school.

But charter schools are free to everyone. So, and there's a lot of unique charters for everything from teen pregnant schools to special education schools to autistic schools to deaf schools to leadership schools to STEM schools. I mean, you could pick something that fits your fancy. And that's what they're all made for. That's what they're all built for. This is to have a special magnet that pulls you to them, attracts you to them. So I really think that

Even with the like Utah fits all program, they're taking government funds now and they're actually helping the average homeschool kid or private school kid to pay for private school or to pay for some type of education that's alternate alternative to what they would get if they went to their local school. Since I homeschooled, I've homeschooled for 27 years and I never got a dime of public money for my publics for my homeschooling.

except when I was up in the last couple of years when I worked with MyTech, I open ed. I did through that system. But other than that, I pay taxes just like everybody else and I never benefited one ounce from the local schools. I think that the ESAs are leveling the playing field. Some of them are more lucrative and most of them offer the standard child a chance to do anything.

Dave Hoffman (23:01.578)  
If you want to home school or you want to private school, want to, know, a country day school and you can't afford it, you can take these monies and try to go do it. I think it's great. I think that's awesome. I think that's the way it should be.

Ela Richmond (23:18.944)  
Yeah, it's interesting. I've seen this move toward a consumer type of view toward education, right? So like initially it's this it's a siloed box of we can choose either or, right? And like it is how it comes and that's it. That's what we're paying for, right? But there's this move toward, OK, we can choose a mix of a lot of things. And also, if, for example, I put my kid in a public school and I don't like something, I also have the opportunity to

get a little bit more creative with how I'm going to solve that issue. How can parents start thinking about themselves as like quote unquote education designers, right? Like instead of just being a drop off point for their kids, like a checkbox, like really thinking about the education system as something that they can take and like...

and custom build, you were talking about all these choices, right? All these different things that families can now do. I think one of the harder parts is figuring out what your options are, right? So you mentioned a ton of different types of charters for special needs students, for like tons of different people with different ailments, different issues, different challenges. How do people even find all of the things that could be available to them?

Dave Hoffman (24:39.668)  
think the first thing is that parents have to be proactive in their kids' education. They can't just default to what's always been done, because when we do what's always been done, we get the same result. if public ed has not had great results for a long time, and they've been on the chopping block or on funding chopping blocks, we've thrown more money at it. It hasn't gotten better. And so now it's like, what do we do?

Parents have to, they have to be proactive and think, hey, this does exist. They're telling me that I have money to spend on alternatives or I can actually go to a charter school that's free. All they gotta do is Google. I mean, it's not hard to find things. They just, I would say that as a parent personally, I had to be engaged in my kid's education. If I didn't care, if I didn't care what they learned, how they learned, where they learned or.

you know, the social influences that they had, didn't care about anything, then I would just send them default to what everybody else would or what was easiest, right? The bus comes by, let's just put them on that bus. I don't care what happens after that. I've got to have them at school because I'm working. Parents have to think beyond that. They have to hey,

If I'm going to invest in my kids and I want them to have the best education possible for their future, then I've got to do some research about what options I do have. And there are a ton of options. Even with my kids, we did partial high school programs sometimes. kids were like, my daughter was, oldest daughter was the queen of homecoming. And she didn't go to the school except for like two hours a day.

She was just cool and she was likeable and she was smart and she was pretty and she put herself out there. She also sang in a traveling choir. She also participated in local pageants and my sons both played sports on the local sports team. We picked and choose exactly what we wanted to do. We were in debate leagues that were sponsored that we got help paid for by Open Ed.

Dave Hoffman (27:06.406)  
We were in, we did mock trials and local like kids court stuff for kids to participate in the legal process. We did all kinds of stuff. Matter of fact, I think my one son got into BYU just because of the activities he did that were so nonstandard and unorthodox that from the normal applications they received. He wrote four essays that were completely different than what you'd hear, maybe the run of the mill.

BYU freshman applicant talk about and it was because we provided those for him, but we researched it and We sent kids to it and tried it out. Some things didn't work and we just pulled the kids out. They didn't work, you know But some things did some things were great and then they had my other kids would say I want to do that too Or I want to be a part of that So it's it's really just you can it's almost like you can go to different restaurant every night here in the valley It's same with same with education

I mean, did some, we did some, some of my kids did welding classes at an ALC from Nebo School District, you know. I mean, you can do whatever you, whatever they were interested in. We encouraged them to follow their passions. And you know what? My kids love to read. They love to learn. They've all done their own thing. And guess what? None of them have gone to college because none of them have seen the need to attend college.

to earn money for their future or to follow their passions. And they all make more money than I do. So there you go. And I've been in school for undergraduate, teaching credential, master's degree, and now I work at BYU, and all my kids make more than I do. And so there you go. They're doing just great with their, they follow their passions and they went an alternative route. They saw that book learning and attending institutions wasn't the only way to learn.

And if they did what they really love to do, they could do well at it and they could be very successful. And they have everything from construction to modeling. I'm telling you, I have it all in my family and they all do really well.

Ela Richmond (29:15.896)  
from a practical standpoint, like you and your wife, how did you tackle this problem, quote unquote, of how do we introduce our kids to enough in order to expand their palette of like, are all the things that I could possibly do, and then dive into the things that they're super interested in. Was it like a conscious thing? Was it kind of like you're sitting at the dinner table, you're talking to your kids about all their options and everything local and everything available?

And because you're a homeschool family and you've been a homeschool family for so long, it's just kind of like this cumulative process of over time, you just try a lot of things and you get exposed to a lot of things or was there any master planning behind it? Was it just kind of like on a whim? How did y'all do it?

Dave Hoffman (30:00.094)  
I told you we were the most unschooling homeschoolers that ever existed. If you did it in school, we did not do it at home. it looked anything like school, we threw it out the window. schooling is different than education in our book. We define those very differently. And anything that looked like school or schooling went out the window. Anything that looked like real education and real learning and passion, we fostered.

And I think it was just being around like-minded people that would do their own research and then share with us. And then we were like, really? You can do that? Really? Your son's going there? Really? Your daughter joined that team? Or you could actually be in this, you know, it was paid for by this or what? I mean, it was once you get involved in that realm, there are so many opportunities and so many people that kind of share. we had no master plan. Our plan was to try to encourage

the kids to like to learn new things and not be fixed mindset, but be growth mindset that if I suck at this, it's because I haven't done it long enough or because I haven't tried hard enough. But if I try harder or if I practice, I could be semi good or maybe excellent at this. I remember my son, he thought, know, math wasn't great for him, but he found a curriculum that really helped him a ton. It was called teaching textbooks.

And it really spurred his, thought, wow, I'm successful at this math. And he did algebra, he did geometry. And then he took this map, this college math and got a B plus in college algebra. I myself never passed college algebra. I took dummy college algebra, one and two, and I got like Cs. And then when I would take the real thing, I'm like, I found out I could substitute that for some foreign language. And I ended up taking a ton of foreign language. So I substituted it.

So I tell him, man, son, you passed it at like 17, what I couldn't pass when I was 23 years old. And that's just because he experienced it and he tried it he found something that worked for him. It wasn't sitting in a classroom with some squawking and then doing homework and coming back. That didn't work for him. Because we tried different levels of that at co-ops and things. So I think it's just trial and error. You just try things and if they work, they work. Matter of fact, not one of our students did the same math program.

Dave Hoffman (32:25.866)  
in high school or junior high. It was all different. We started this kind of the same as they were little, but as they got older, different things worked, different math methods worked, different courses, different co-ops, different teachers worked. And so we just let them do what they wanted to do. My kids consumed library books at an insane level, insane level. And that's because we never pushed them to do anything. All my kids read at seven. All their Sunday school teachers were saying, you know, your kid can't read and they're in this level.

And here's some phonics stuff you should practice at home. We're like, no, we're good. We're good. Our kids are good. We're to let them read when they're naturally read. And they all read at about seven, eight years old. They started reading, but then they never stopped reading. And I never read a book when I was a teenager, not one, except unless you forced me to read it for a class. My kids read and they still read. It's amazing. They still read tons and they still learn on their own. And so I don't know.

Some things pay off, right? If you do them a different way.

Ela Richmond (33:23.63)  
Yeah.

It's interesting though, like a lot of families are really afraid of the unpredictability of like, and I guess a different approach, right? Like homeschool is scary a little bit for parents especially to take on because you bear the full burden of responsibility. Like if your kid does not turn out correctly or if you feel like they are not as successful as they possibly could have been, like there's nobody else you can blame. You can't look at a school, you can't look at a teacher.

Right? You have to look at yourself and like your family and the way that you made choices and things like that. Why were you and your wife so comfortable with that? And especially with like all of these decisions as they came along, like y'all were way ahead of most people whenever it came to, our kid is seven years old and like, they'll read. Like we just, we just know it. Like they will, they will read. and like, you know, just the, whole unschooling approach as well. that's not necessary for my kid to

be educated, right? Like, were these very uncommon, almost like quote unquote risky by other people approaches so comfortable for you and your wife to make?

Dave Hoffman (34:37.47)  
Yeah, think maybe first of all, it would probably be my wife's personality. She's kind of a pippy long stocking at heart. And, you know, if we had her way, we'd probably, you know, we'd live in a tent somewhere, you know, we'd be gypsies and travel around. So she was really fun, loving and carefree. I was I was more regimented and left brained and hey, we got to have structure. Hey, we got to do this. And then I learned that, hey,

Ela Richmond (34:54.094)  
Thank

Dave Hoffman (35:05.427)  
You know, kids kind of hate that. They kind of hate to be forced to do anything or, know, anytime you, anytime before, I hate that, you hate that. Anytime anybody, you know, kind of forces you to do something or, or makes you make a decision a certain way, you're like, kind of naturally human nature is you rebel. So we just thought we're going to let kids try to like, you know, set it out there for them, let them make their decisions and do the best we can.

I don't know. We just weren't scared about how it would turn out. We saw we had a lot of support through our community, this homeschool community we were in. We saw other kids. My kids interacted with everybody at church in the neighborhood and everything just fine. There was no social issues. You know, that was the least of our worries. Our kids were too social. So I don't know. There was just there was just no fear there. was no fear that it wouldn't turn out right. Like people always worry.

Especially teachers. this homeschool kid came into my geometry class and they have so many gaps in their algebra learning and I'm like, yeah, but who says algebra comes before geometry? Maybe they learn and who says you say those are gaps. But my son, like I said, my son wasn't great at math and now he he does land. He does like he does construction and he is specifically does laser leveled like

Excavation where he's like Calculating things that mean something and he's done. He does really well at solving problems I think that's the thing you teach kids to solve problems and you've covered half that you've covered You don't have to worry about the textbook learning they can solve an issue. It's I mean I work with grown adults I manage grown adults right now and I can't get some adults to think past

me to do on this? Well, I don't want you do it. I want you to figure it out and create a strategy. Well, what does that mean? How do I do that? I don't know. That's up to you. You need to do this. They can't because they've learned a different way. They've learned how to learn differently. And the learning that they've had is tell me what to do and I'll do it. And they're really good at that, but they're not good at solving problems, taking all this information, synthesizing it and going, wow, we could come up with a better solution or this is what Dave is looking for.

Dave Hoffman (37:28.714)  
That's difficult for them a lot of times and I pound my head against the wall going, my gosh, if I had a boss that would have told me to solve my own problems or solve this problem by, and I had to wide open, I could do it myself. I would love that. I would thrive on that just because my mindset now is really innovative and creative and growth minded and I can do this if I put my head to it. Yeah, even adults, just solving issues is...

Solving problems with a set of data is very difficult.

Ela Richmond (38:05.484)  
It's interesting. I forget what book I was reading about this, but it was basically about like the value of predictability. we, at some point we restructured the way that companies were run. I think this was like a German thing. I can't remember what exactly it came from, but at a certain point we restructured how companies were run because we realized that there was an opportunity for us to like basically forecast that if we did it this way,

then we could hit these revenue goals, et cetera, et cetera. But what we did in that is we created boxes for workers. It was like, you do this. This is your job. Don't think outside of it. And kind of what you were saying, I know a lot of people who's, one aspiration, especially young people, give me room to run. Give me room to think through things. Give me room to strategize and try and problem solve this myself. And it's very fascinating because you're right.

the requirements that we had for work have changed the way that we approach school and vice versa, right? And so now it's like, okay, hold on a second, but we're missing out on certain parts of development that would be really, really, really incredible. Like for example, confidence inside of young individuals, like confidence to say, hey, I'm gonna take this bet. Hey, I'm willing to bear the burden of the responsibility of this decision. Nobody wants to do that anymore. like,

I don't have an issue with like, what's it called, like research firms or anything, but like it's very interesting to me because research firms were created so that people could have reasons for making the decisions that they were. So it's like, here's all this data that backs up the decision that I'm making because like, I don't wanna be the only one that's on the hook for it, right? And so it's like really interesting because that's really what we've created a society around is like, instead of people that are,

confident and willing to bear the brunt of the responsibility of choices of you know of these things like like you're saying We have kids that that can check boxes and that can like do what they're told It sounds like your kids are very very very strong individuals. Would you say that?

Dave Hoffman (40:20.266)  
Oh yeah, yeah, they're super strong. They're super confident in whatever they do. I mean, it could be wrong, but they're confident they're going to succeed. And they may be going down a hill, but you have to let them spiral sometimes, you know, and then find out, hey, that didn't work so good. I'll share this. I've attended some seminars, and I've learned at Google, Google offers 20 % of an employee's time as innovative time, where they get to work on anything.

Ela Richmond (40:48.046)  
That's cool.

Dave Hoffman (40:48.842)  
They can work on anything they want. They can solve any problem they want. And that's where an institute called Search Inside Yourself, Emotional Intelligence came out of, was an engineer of all things, wanted to solve the issue of emotional intelligence and people's ability to be emotionally intelligent in the workplace.

He broke off and wrote his own book. And he doesn't work for Google anymore. He makes millions of dollars writing his own book, doing seminars. And I've attended their trainings, the Search Inside Yourself trainings. They're fantastic. It's awesome. It's awesome for workplace. It's awesome for personal, for relationships, for family. But that came out of an innovative approach from Google to say, hey, you don't have to work in the box. You work outside of the box for 20 % of the time and see what you can come up with that innovative.

that may take you down a different road. We don't care. We want to help you get to where you're going in life. We don't need you to be on a conveyor belt stamping things or just putting screws in things in our big development here. We need you to grow. And I think when we have that mentality, it's the options or the results are gonna be totally different than if we put them in boxes and say, this is what you do. Don't do anything else. This is our policy.

And I fight that at my work all the time. I work for a big institution, BYU, right? We're huge. And we're very, because we're big, we're not agile. And we're not real creative and innovative sometimes. We have policies that are set. And I buck the policies all the time on behalf of the customer. I'm like, the customer doesn't, they need an exception here. I mean, I just did one just yesterday where I give a 14 year old a scholarship for a university course. Well, that's against the policy. I'm like,

I don't care. Here's the situation. The foster child of a parent that approached me at a conference that is trying, they're gonna age out before they can go to college and they don't think they're gonna go to college and they're in a crappy situation. If they can take some college classes before they get out of high school, they think they might be able to show them that they're intelligent, they can do it and they might be able to go to school and get an education and do something else with their training. And so instead of aging out,

Dave Hoffman (43:11.466)  
just having a high school diploma and not having much confidence or much future. And so, you know, I, I bucked all the policies here, got the kids the scholarship and they're going to start on a, you know, they're going to start on a psychology course this year as a 14 year old. I mean, I'm all about that. I love that. I love when parents come to me and ask me for exceptions because I make them happen here. And I think I did, I did the exact same thing in public school where there was a lot of boundaries and a lot of fences.

I just busted through the fences and said, I think we can do this. And they were like, wow, well, I think we do this, this, and this, this. Okay, go for it. know, every now and if you can talk people into it, a lot of times your superiors will say, let's, if it's better for our clientele or for our kids, let's try it. And a lot of it worked. A lot of it was fun.

Ela Richmond (43:59.596)  
Yeah, I love like that is one of my favorite things in the world. I also love not bucking the system, but kind of like really asking the question like, okay, what is this rule? And like, why is it here to begin with? And the more that you ask the why question, then you realize, okay, so this rule was built because of this exact situation. Like, does this still apply? Or like, how can I think about this differently so that it is

different problem, right? like, mean, for example, like we have a ton of laws in the United States and like most laws in the United States are quote unquote set, but like they've been set by somebody at some point because of something that happened. So the more that you understand the history of why you have rules and what rules there are and what policies there are, the more that you understand, okay, well, like, obviously we don't want there's that whole like belief that, okay, well,

if there's a fence, you don't want to move it until you know why it's there, right? And that is a very, very important point. But like, once you start unraveling and understanding, okay, here's the law that somebody made or here's the policy somebody made, they were doing that the best that they possibly could in the moment. They didn't know that this situation was going to come up. They didn't know that, you know, this person needed this in this way. They were trying to solve for something else. And here's why I can, you know, change this in this moment because of

you know, whatever it is.

Dave Hoffman (45:27.784)  
Right, but you had to approach that fence. You had to take that fence apart a little bit to look at it and say, hey, that reasoning's kind of weak. Can I present some other data and reasoning that would tell us why we should break this fence down right here and make a gate? So you have to go there, and you have to think through it. I flew on Southwest Airlines the other day, and this is my new motto. Actually, it was not the other day. It was a couple years ago. But my new motto, on their little napkin,

They said, in a world full of no, we're a plane full of yes. And I told my guys and my sales team, that's exactly our motto. I don't care if it's our institution full of no, the world full of no, where everyone else might say no, we're going to say yes and then we're going to figure out a way to do that. If you work for In-N-Out Burger, when they train you, they have two customer service rules, only two. That makes it super easy for the employees. And the first one is, the customer's always right.

Period. The second one is, if you think you're right, refer to rule number one. And so basically, if you have that attitude, the customer is always right. So if they're asking for something that's out of the ordinary or that's weird or that you don't normally do or that's bound by a policy, we couldn't ever do that. Think how you can solve that. Think how you can work through that. love that. I love that. I want to say yes to everyone. Obviously, there's some.

I'll say yes to everyone in some form. I'll modify that yes, but I'll say yes to almost everyone that approaches me if I can do anything for them at all, whether it be personal or whether it be in work. But a lot of times in education, we should be the same way. Could we teach a kid this way? Could they learn anything this way? I say yes, and then let's figure out how. Let's don't. You know what mean? It's just open-mindedness.

Ela Richmond (47:20.533)  
I love that.

Dave Hoffman (47:24.458)  
to learning a different way or to doing things a different way.

Ela Richmond (47:28.236)  
Yeah, I always share this example because I love it. Our VP of learning, her name is Andrea. She's amazing and she has a son that goes to a public school. But she's chosen that, which is kind of funny. Like she is championing open education and like she chooses a public school because they're innovative enough to work with her on these things. So like if she doesn't like a rule, right, she understands why the rule was set and then she goes to them and asks them a question. So she didn't like a class that her son was taking.

He needed an extra credit and an elective. So she asked if she could build her own course for him. And they were like, I don't know. so she always has reasons and explanations and understands exactly what needs to work because she's been an administrator before. And so she can come in here and say, I know that you need these things. Here's how I'm going to get them done. And is this OK? And they're all so open to it once you understand how the system works.

Dave Hoffman (48:21.812)  
Yeah.

Ela Richmond (48:26.55)  
I guess not in every district is, are they that open to it? But I think that approach of yes, and let's figure it out is awesome. So it's like, okay, your kid really likes this subject. They like it in this way. How can we bring X into this? Even if it is just, they could do this at home, like for educators to approach education and a child's individual education with that thinking cap of how do we solve for the unique problems as they come up?

It's just really fascinating. I kind of want to steer us into BYU. So you are an OpenEd partner. Can you share a little bit about what you do for people listening and for people that might be interested in using your program through OpenEd?

Dave Hoffman (49:12.65)  
Sure. So BYU independent study is what we offer. We actually just signed a contract with Open Ed to just offer curriculum and Open Ed's teachers will be administering that. So that's brand new this year. So you can be looking forward to that. That should be an option in the curriculum options that parents have for kids. typically we provide courses in online courses that are

Wow, every core course that we cover every core and then probably over 100 electives. So we have over 215 some odd middle school to high school courses. A ton of stuff to choose from. But I think the unique thing that we do at BYU and it's just in the last few years, we've rewritten our courses with a new design model. And the design model is called KSA.

K for knowledge, S for skills, and A for attributes. So if a homeschool family decides to take a BYU class, they're going to find that the students are not only going to get the knowledge that they would need in a biology class, and it's going to be aligned to standards and state standards. And they can get their graduation diploma with the Carnegie unit that they earned from our course, which is all very typical. But we've also woven in a skill, a 21st century skill. And in biology, it happens to be

critical thinking and it's broken down to interpretation and analysis, which fits biology really well as you're going to, you know, hypothesize about how some things are going to turn out as you do labs and you do experiments and you work with living organisms. And in that section of skill, the student can choose to do a little bit more. So we're offering even choice within our courses for the student to say, hey, I like this skill and I think I'm pretty good at it.

or I'd like to get better at it. So I'm going to do some extra activities. And we offer them a micro credential for doing a little extra. So they get a little badge. It's a micro credential electronic badge. It's a Canvas badge. They can use in the future for applications, resumes, scholarships, whatever they want. It's just something that's a distinguisher that stands them out from everyone else. And sometimes kids love the little extra motivation in the class. So it provides extra motivation. It offers them a

Dave Hoffman (51:34.75)  
the ability to earn something that could be beneficial in the future. Besides just getting a grade in that class, they get a little micro-credential. In that biology class, we also teach an attribute. So this is all woven into a biology class. This isn't a separate curriculum for skills or study skills or life skills and a separate curriculum for emotional competency, right? We teach the attribute that we teach as one of nine and it happens to be resilience in biology.

So we teach resilience as an attribute. We talk about biologists and in the biology field, who's been resilient and what's that produced and what does that mean and what does mean for them in their lives and are you resilient and why aren't you resilient or why are you resilient? Are your parents resilient? Who do you know that's resilient? How can you be more resilient? They do some self analysis and they get a little bit more of a holistic approach to education than just the book learning. They're gonna learn a skill. They may hate biology when they're done.

But that skill might be something they'll take and use somewhere else in another class. Sometimes it's like doing PowerPoint presentations, doing presentations, creating digital presentations. And maybe they're really good at that, and they take that and use that all over the place. So hopefully they take something away from our course, whether it be the love of biology, the love of that skill they learn, or just enhancing or increasing a skill that they already have, or

just analyzing themselves as to their emotional intelligence and where they stand with resilience and trying to improve that aspect of their lives. So that's really unique in how we offer our courses. think it's most mom, the feedback we've had from moms and dads and kids, hey, they've loved those courses. They've been much more dynamic. They're much more interactive than our prior legacy courses. We've had a lot of success.

in the last year as we've launched these, about a year and a half. And I think, I mean, that's pretty much what we offer. So everything that, every course you can think of from sports and entertainment marketing to, you know, we do a lot of CTE courses, so career and technical education courses where kids can explore careers. We teach nine languages. We're a big language, as you can imagine with BYU. You can learn Russian, Japanese, Korean.

Dave Hoffman (53:54.442)  
Spanish, ASL, German, French, and Latin with us. So we don't just teach Spanish and German, right? And they're awesome courses. They're super interactive. We teach, we have AP courses if kids want to challenge themselves and get some college credit. We have nine AP courses. We're adding, we're adding the other ones as we speak, some English course, English AP. We teach, we have like 10, 10 or 12.

10 to 12 like PE courses. So homeschoolers have to have PE credit. So we give them credit for cycling, for weightlifting, for aerobics, for swimming, for anything they want to do, almost a ton of sports that they can, that they do, that they keep logs and they get credit for. I don't think people understand kind of maybe the breadth of what we offer, but those are just a few of the libraries that are really strong for us. some, for instance, the state of Washington,

we sell more PE classes than anything else because kids in the public school, even the public school charter schools, they don't want to dress out. They don't want to take PE at school. They'd rather do something on their own like walking or jogging and they can all do that. so, yeah, think we kind of have, we kind of fit the needs for in a lot of different areas for kids.

Ela Richmond (55:06.304)  
Interesting.

Ela Richmond (55:12.45)  
Side question, you mentioned Washington. Are there a lot of homeschoolers in Washington? Interesting. I've read something previously that said that there are a lot of really strict guidelines for being able to be a homeschooler though. Like you have to have formal training of some sort. Is that true? Or what is the homeschool world like in Washington?

Dave Hoffman (55:17.982)  
Yes.

Dave Hoffman (55:35.018)  
Well, I couldn't speak specific to law in Washington. I do know that it's open because we have a, but we do have a large segment of public schoolers and charter schoolers and private schoolers that use us from Washington also. So I can't say that homeschooling, you know, is our only, that's only means to take an online course or just, you know, it's not super strong. Some states are very restrictive. Some states are super homeschool friendly. It just kind of depends.

Ela Richmond (56:00.791)  
huh.

Dave Hoffman (56:02.6)  
And it could depend legislature to legislator session to legislative session each year. Sometimes crazy laws are passed. We're always fighting California. Well, California is always fighting like, it seems like homeschool options and just school choice. I think that's because, and I say this because I've worked in it, the teachers unions are so strong. The CTA, the California Teachers Association is so strong, has so much political clout and so much money from dues that every educator pays, mandatorily, that I paid when I...

was worked in California, that they affect the agenda, the educational agenda in states. So it just depends state to state how homeschool friendly things are. Now there's a ton of homeschoolers in California, I'm telling you that. mean, it doesn't thwart them. But yeah, there'll be certain regulations in each state that say, you may have to have some formal preparation. Usually that's not the case. You may have to register, which usually is the case, register with the state and say, I'm homeschooling.

And you may have to cover certain topics, like the core subjects or something. it just depends, state to state. We work in all 50 states, so we find it different in every state.

Ela Richmond (57:15.87)  
Yeah, it's interesting. We've been going into more states recently and it seems like there's two different things that make something homeschool friendly or not. It's the number of requirements and or the complexity of requirements and the number of resources and how difficult they are to get. like resources can be anything from options like, for example, an open ed or it can be something like, do you actually have really strong communities of homeschoolers around you and

There's varying levels of both in basically every state, which is really fascinating. As you all have moved around, how have you tapped into homeschool groups as you settled down somewhere? How do you start that whole process over again?

Dave Hoffman (58:01.768)  
As a family, mean? Yeah, as a family, gosh, that was just doing some little personal research. The best thing to do is go to a homeschool resource for curriculum. If there's a homeschool store of any type or a curriculum resource, if you go there, they'll have names and numbers and Facebook pages of local co-ops. And now the micro schools has become a fad, whatever it may be.

Ela Richmond (58:02.893)  
Yeah.

Dave Hoffman (58:30.986)  
that you can connect with. And you connect with one person and you've connected with 100 instantly. And, we have Park Day tomorrow. You should come. OK, we went to Park Day. We met 17 other families. Oh, my goodness. And they belong to other organizations and do other co-ops and do other things. So it's super easy if you can find a homeschool resource in your area. That's usually one of the best ways. But Googling homeschool co-ops in your area

I mean, that's how we market at BYU sometimes to homeschool places. And I'm sure OpenEd, when they expanded to different states, they had to do research about homeschooling in the state. where there was a state organization, sometimes there's Christian homeschool conferences. We attended those often. And then we just found out a ton there and met a ton of like-minded people. So I would say attending conferences or a local resource, curriculum resource is a great way to do it.

Ela Richmond (59:26.274)  
That's a great piece of advice. My last question for you. So you've done open ed with your family. For families that are looking at BYU as a potential resource that they're gonna purchase this next year, why would they choose it over other resources? Like what are these families looking for that makes BYU the perfect choice for them?

Dave Hoffman (59:28.212)  
Thank you.

Dave Hoffman (59:46.378)  
I would say, well, if you're looking for a diploma, obviously BYU is accredited. And so you're going to get an accredited transcript. You get a transcript from us, you can take anywhere. Also, BYU has a lot of clout in the education world. We go around the country and as soon as we say BYU, they either know our sports teams or they know our institution for something or they recognize us from somewhere, from BYU TV oftentimes. And so we have clout throughout the country.

And I think that that lends to just to the, I don't know, maybe the trust that people have in taking a BYU class. We have some states around the country where kids will only, they'll take BYU because they know, no, I'm taking BYU because I know BYU. I mean, in Alaska, of all places, they love BYU because they know the name and they know the university. I also say what we talked about before, the experience in the class is good. It's kid-friendly.

It's fun. It's engaging and it's holistic. So they're not going to just get information crammed down the throat. It's actually going to expound hopefully their personal emotional well-being and their personal developed skills that they may not know they had. There's a lot of reasons. Also, we're very flexible. You get a year to finish a course.

And lot of homeschoolers take a lot of time to do things and we're always late to everything. I know that from being a homeschooler. So the time element is very, very attractive for homeschoolers.

Mm-hmm.

That's a great pitch. Anybody, if you want to check out BYU and the courses that they offer through OpenEd, we'll leave all of those linked in the description of this podcast episode. This has been a really awesome podcast, Dave. It has been so cool to hear your experience and really fascinating because usually I hear it the opposite way where like somebody is a public school teacher and then they go full on onto the other.

other side of the world where they go all in on homeschool and alt ed. And it's really interesting to hear how you have championed like actual education inside of schools where there were a lot of barriers for yourself and for your students and how you saw kind of a light through that as you you saw that you had an opportunity to create something that nobody else was going to. So super fascinating. And I think it's also just so great to hear

from families who have succeeded through homeschooling because that's always some parents biggest fear is like, do I know my kids are gonna be okay? And like you said, from your experience, looking at other families whose parents or whose kids turned out very, very well gave you a lot of reassurance in your own journey.

Dave Hoffman (01:02:38.538)  
That's totally true. And you kind of have to have, I've once heard that the art of parenting is the, is the ability to know when to release your kids and when to let them go. And that's really the truth. And when they, when they go, they just go the direction they're going to go. Like every kid has their own passion, their own journey. And even if they make wrong steps along the way, you can't blame yourself. It's like you asked before about parents, you know, how, how would you so confident? Well, it's like anybody who's a parent.

I mean, kids turn out to be goofballs sometimes in their adolescence or in their young adult lives, and they don't make very good decisions for a long time. But we just hope they turn around at some point. yeah, same thing. Yep.

Ela Richmond (01:03:10.626)  
Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (01:03:18.648)  
Dang. Well, this has been awesome. I think this is a perfect note to end it on. Thanks so much, Dave, for coming on.

Dave Hoffman (01:03:25.482)  
Sure, thank you all.
