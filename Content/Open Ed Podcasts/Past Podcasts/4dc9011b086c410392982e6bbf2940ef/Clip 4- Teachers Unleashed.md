**Amir (44:40):** "We aim to treat all of our teachers as creative entrepreneurial professionals, which is what teaching is. Unfortunately there's so many roadblocks within the traditional system to teachers acting like that."

**Amir (45:16):** "It's truly exciting to think about what could happen if a generation of kids are educated by a generation of creative entrepreneurial teachers who are genuinely passionate about their subjects."

**Amir (45:27):** "They're given the freedom to teach the way they always wanted to teach. That sounds like the future to me."
