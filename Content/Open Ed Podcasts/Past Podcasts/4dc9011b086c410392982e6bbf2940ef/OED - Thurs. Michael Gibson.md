# OpenEd Weekly: The Genius of Being Late

## **A Note from Charlie**

Today we share a conversation with Michael Gibson, co-founder of the 1517 Fund. You might know them as the intellectual heirs to the Thiel Fellowship, which famously paid teens to drop out of college and build things.

The results? Several multi-billion dollar companies, and a new member of the billionaire dropout club: Figma founder Dylan Field. Gibson's work is a masterclass in finding genius outside the classroom.

Let's get into it.

## **The Genius of Being Late to Class**

There's a story about a grad student at UC Berkeley that perfectly encapsulates how schools can intimidate otherwise bright learners.

George Dantzig showed up late to his statistics class one day and saw two problems on the blackboard. Assuming it was homework, he copied them down. He worked on them for days, finally solving one, and turned it in.

He didn't know—because he was late—that the professor had put up two of the most famous _unsolved_ problems in the field of statistics.

As Michael Gibson relayed on the OpenEd podcast, "If he'd known the problems were supposed to be impossible, he probably never would have attempted them." It’s a powerful reminder that the biggest barrier to solving a hard problem is often just knowing that it’s supposed to be hard.

    ## Post 1: Based on "The Unsolvable Problem"
    
    **Video Clip:** Clip 1**Core Concept:** The power of not knowing something is "impossible."
    
    **Post Copy:**
    
    Your child's greatest strength is that they don't know what's "impossible" yet.
    
    Agree or disagree?
    
    I was so struck by a story <tag>Michael Gibson shared on our podcast this week.
    
    A Berkeley grad student was late to class and saw some problems on the blackboard. He thought it was homework.
    
    He went home and solved one.
    
    It turned out to be one of the most famous unsolved problems in statistics.
    
    He only succeeded because no one had told him he was supposed to fail.
    
    It makes me wonder: how often do we, as parents and educators, accidentally place limits on our kids by telling them what can't be done?
    
    What could they achieve if we just got out of their way?

## **Trend: Parents Are "Rewilding" Their Kids**

There's a trend emerging among parents who are rejecting the hyper-scheduled, resume-building childhood. They're starting to "rewild" their kids. And it has nothing to do with nature.

This is about cultivating an _intellectual_ wilderness. As Michael Gibson puts it, it’s about creating an environment where children can develop real capability, not just credentials. It's a deliberate move away from the structured paths that produce what he calls a "brittle dependence" on institutions.

In practice, this means giving kids unsolved problems, letting them get bored, encouraging them to build things without instructions, and celebrating the brilliant question over the correct answer. It's about trusting that the project, the experiment, the thing they build for themselves, is where the deepest learning happens.

## **Tool: The Contrarian Fund That Bets on Cool Ideas**

Gibson argues that for young builders, the startup is the "real school." So his fund, 1517, acts accordingly. With a better track record of picking unicorn founders than Y-Combinator, they operate on a radical principle of permissionless innovation.

While most VCs want a 20-page deck and a warm intro, 1517 offers grants of $1,000 to anyone, anywhere, with a cool idea. You don't need to be in Silicon Valley. You don't need a college degree. You just need to be working on something interesting.

It's a tool designed to find the next George Dantzig or Dylan Field, and you can apply today.
