[CLIP #1 - 24:35 to 25:30]
"What we're trying to build and what we've put into place is a buffet. In so many settings, virtually or traditionally, you sit down and you're handed a menu and you literally have like three choices to pick from. What we want for the OpenEd Academy is for it to be a buffet where you leave what you don't want and you take what you do. We'll offer live time together, synchronous. We'll offer that daily, weekly. It's always going to be optional though. We're never going to say to a family, 'Well, you signed up for the school so every day at two o'clock you better be online.' That doesn't meet the needs of every single family."
```

  

Who says school has to be the same for everyone?!

It's time we stop forcing children to adapt to a rigid system and instead build education around THEM.

At OpenEd Academy, we've created an educational buffet where families take what works and leave what doesn't.

Some powerful principles behind our approach:

- You pick your curriculum from our marketplace
- You set your own course start and end dates
- You choose your pace and breaks for each course
- You decide how much teacher support you want
- Your real-world learning counts for credit

Education shouldn't be "take it or leave it" - it should adapt to YOUR child.
