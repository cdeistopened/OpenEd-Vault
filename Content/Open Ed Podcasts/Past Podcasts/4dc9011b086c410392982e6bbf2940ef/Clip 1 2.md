### **OPTION 2: "The Expensive Apartment Mystery"**

**Format**: Single Moment (30 seconds)

**Hook Type**: Curiosity + Status Challenge

**Target**: Parents worried about career paths

```Plain
[COLD OPEN - 09:45 to 10:15]

Michelle: "We moved into this fancy apartment building in downtown Los Angeles, super pricey place. And we realized very quickly that we were the oldest people in the building. Times two, easily. And I kept saying to my husband, like, what do all these kids do for a living? Like, we can barely afford to live in this place. They're in cannabis, they're in crypto, they're gamers, they are content creators. All these things that they can go to college for these things, right? Their parents are probably freaking out right now 'cause they don't know what their kid is doing."
```

**Why This Works**:

- **Status Anxiety**: Creates immediate relatability for struggling parents
- **Mystery Hook**: "How are these kids affording this?"
- **Career Disruption**: Challenges traditional success metrics
- **Parent Fear**: "Are my kids prepared for this new economy?"
