Basic Summary: Parents often blame their children for issues related to technology while being glued to their own devices during events like sporting games. The younger generation may be adapting to technology in healthier ways. Access to technology should be part of education to prepare children for the future, rather than restricting it. The focus should be on teaching kids to use technology wisely.

**Amir (15:53):** "We blame our kids for our issues. That's what's happening."

**Isaac (15:14):** "I've been to lots of my kids sporting games with their parents who are in their 30s and 40s and they're on their phone the whole time, barely watching the game."

**Isaac (15:25):** "I wonder if the generation that's so worried about technology is the generation who don't realize the younger kids, they've already started to figure out the difference, figure out how to adapt."

**Amir (17:36):** "Technology and the tools we build are immensely powerful tools of our civilization. And you're doing kids a disservice if you do not give them access to it at appropriate ages."

**Amir (17:51):** "Access to technology should be a key part of education because if you go too far in restricting it, then how are you going to prepare your kids for the future?"

Who’s the real screen addicts? 👀📱

The irony? We're the ones worried about our kids and technology.

Maybe the younger generation is already figuring out how to adapt in ways we haven't. Instead of blaming them, perhaps we should reconsider our approach.

As @AmirEducator puts it: 'Technology and the tools we build are immensely powerful tools of our civilization. You're doing kids a disservice if you do not give them access at appropriate ages.'

The real question isn't if we should allow technology in education—it's how we prepare our children for a future where these tools are essential.

🔍 THE SCREEN TIME HYPOCRISY 🔍

'I've been to lots of my kids sporting games with parents in their 30s and 40s on their phone the whole time, barely watching the game.' - Isaac

The uncomfortable truth: 'We blame our kids for our issues.'

But here's something to consider—what if the younger generation is actually developing a healthier relationship with technology than we have? What if they're figuring out the balance that we struggle with?

As Amir points out: 'Technology and the tools we build are immensely powerful tools of our civilization. And you're doing kids a disservice if you do not give them access to it at appropriate ages.'

The real challenge isn't keeping technology away from our children—it's teaching them to use it wisely in a world where these skills are essential.

'Access to technology should be a key part of education because if you go too far in restricting it, then how are you going to prepare your kids for the future?'

What's your approach to technology in your family? Has your thinking evolved over time?
