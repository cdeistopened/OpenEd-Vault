## CLIP 1: "The Overwhelming Sea of Options"

**Edited Version with Timestamps:**  
Jonathan (01:26-01:39): "I kind of describe it as an AI advisor to help navigate through homeschooling. So initially it's matching with curriculum."

Jonathan (01:39-02:10): "You mentioned in the intro about this ever-growing pool of stuff that homeschool families have access to, and that's absolutely correct. It's not even just the curriculum, but the teaching styles and microschools versus co-ops versus learning at home. These new options that are popping up every year."

Jonathan (02:10-02:40): "If you're new to this and you're thinking, what we're doing today with public school is not working, I want something different... and you start looking and researching what options are available, it's crazy how many options are available. That's tough for a parent to navigate for a decision that's so important. It's your kid's education."
