Basic Summary: Encouraging children to embrace their uniqueness is vital, as societal norms can be restrictive. Parents should consider how to cultivate their child's individuality, recognizing that being "weird" may actually be a superpower that allows them to create value and succeed in life. The focus should shift from fearing social conformity to fostering uniqueness.

TK: "Yes, your children will be weird. And that's a very good thing when the concept of normalcy has been defined by a whole set of indoctrinated values that aren't even yours in the first place. The goal of life isn't to conform to whatever society defines in your generation as normal. There are lots of ways to define normal that are actually very dangerous and very unhealthy. And so I think every parent ought to be asking themselves the following question. In what ways do I want to help cultivate my child's weirdness? In what ways do I want my child to be weird? In fact, if you're a parent and you're thinking about these questions, look at your life right now and ask yourself, in what ways am I weird to my own benefit? In what ways am I different from everyone else that actually allows me to create value for everyone else? And how do I want to pass that on to my children? So it's an important concern. I don't want to disparage it. It's a fair question. But I think sometimes we approach that question in a very one sided way. So I'll lead with that."

_Instagram/TikTok:_  
"'But will my kid be weird?' is the #1 question about homeschooling.

The answer? Yes - and that might be their greatest advantage 🔥

What if the 'weird' kids are actually just discovering themselves before everyone else?

_YouTube Shorts:_  
"The 'socialization' concern is really asking: Will my child be normal?

But what if normal isn't actually the goal?

TK Coleman flips the script on the #1 fear about alternative education, suggesting that what makes your child different might actually be their greatest advantage in life.

What if your child's uniqueness is exactly what they need to succeed?"

_LinkedIn:_  
"The most common concern about homeschooling isn't academic - it's social.

'Will my child be weird?'

But as TK Coleman points out, perhaps the better question is: 'How can I help my child develop the uniqueness that will allow them to create value for others?'

What if conformity is actually limiting your child's future potential?"
