Basic Summary: Teaching STEM should be engaging and hands-on rather than theory-heavy. A project-based learning approach fosters curiosity, motivation, and real-world application, while balancing structure and creativity. Encouraging students to start making with available materials can lead to innovation and learning through experimentation.

## Slide 1: The Problem

"Science and the way it is taught should be fun, and it often isn't... It should be the subject where you get to do stuff, touch things, play with things. But often it's not, it's just as much paper stuff as all the other subjects."  
—Jack Casdorph, Mechanical Engineer

## Slide 2: The Theory-First Approach

Traditional education often starts with theory (left side of the spectrum) and moves toward application. This creates students who can answer textbook questions but struggle with real-world application.

Result: The constant student question, "When will we ever use this in real life?"

## Slide 3: The STEM Spectrum

Math → Science → Engineering → Technology/Making

Most traditional education spends too much time on theory (left side) and not enough on application and making (right side).

## Slide 4: Project-Based Learning

Starting with "I wonder what if, let's try..." approach engages natural curiosity.

When students start with a meaningful project they want to complete, they're motivated to learn the necessary skills and knowledge.

## Slide 5: Why Project-Based Learning Works

- Creates natural motivation to learn
- Builds problem-solving skills
- Demonstrates real-world relevance
- Allows creativity and innovation
- Develops confidence through accomplishment

## Slide 6: Finding Balance

Project-based learning can have gaps, while traditional education lacks application.

The ideal approach: A hybrid that provides structure while allowing for creativity—projects within a framework ensure comprehensive learning.

## Slide 7: Start Making Today

"You're probably going to be bad at it at first... but in order to be good at something, it's a required unskipable step to start by being bad at it."

Just start with what you have available—even recycled materials can fuel creativity!

## Slide 8: Challenge Your Kids (And Yourself!)

Try building something new this week using only what you have at home. Document your process and what you learned.

Remember: The starting steps are messy. That's how real innovation works!
