[20:22-20:30] ISAAC: "My mom would always say, You boys should take a small engine repair class. You should just know how to repair small engines."

[20:30-20:36] KEN: "Yeah, sure." [laughing]

[20:36-20:50] ISAAC: "I don't know where she got this idea, but this was like... We never did. I never learned how to repair small engines. Here I am today. I do work that I love and I can afford to pay people to mow my lawn or fix my lawnmower..."
