Ela Richmond: "That's interesting."

Brenna Clarke Gray: "Everybody who is really good at a craft and then they open an Etsy store and then they hate that craft. As soon as you impose external standards and expectations on that thing that you just loved for the love of it. ~~not for everybody, but I think for a lot of us that kind of kills what makes us want to keep learning about it."~~

## YouTube Description

Teaching is relational work. When we turn what a child naturally loves into a graded assignment, we destroy the very motivation that made it beautiful in the first place.

Join Brenna Clarke Gray, an educator and researcher who studies how technology and systems shape learning, as she explains why grading something your child loves might be the quickest way to kill their intrinsic motivation.

Brenna hosts the podcast **Community of Praxis**, which explores big ideas in education through a care-centered, student-focused lens while acknowledging real structural limitations like time, funding, and precarity. As a mother of two, she advocates for protecting childhood, limiting data harvesting, and teaching kids to think critically about technology rather than simply using it.
