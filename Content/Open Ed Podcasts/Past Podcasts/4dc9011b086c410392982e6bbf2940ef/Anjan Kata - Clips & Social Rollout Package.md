# Anjan Kata - Clips & Social Rollout Package

## CLIP 1: "What Screens Do to Your Nervous System"

[https://share.descript.com/view/Xu9109hmcjG](https://share.descript.com/view/Xu9109hmcjG)

### Clip Details

- **Primary On-Screen Text**: "Your Computer Is A Vegas Casino"
- **Duration**: 90-105 seconds
- **Story Arc**: Problem identification → Scientific mechanisms → Big reveal → Solution exists
- **Best Platforms**: Instagram Reels, TikTok, YouTube Shorts (education-focused)

### Editing Instructions

**Segments to Combine**:

- [06:33-06:45] Charlie's setup question
- [06:50-08:20] Anjan's explanation of the 5 mechanisms + Vegas casino reveal
- [09:40-09:42] Brief turn to hope

**Transcript** (with ... showing where to cut):

Charlie asks about dysregulation → Anjan explains blue light, flicker, brightness mismatch, oversaturated colors, keeps us indoors → "Your body gets put on high alert, high arousal, high stimulation when you're on a computer" → "Your computer is trying its best to simulate a Vegas casino" → Details about casino design → "They have figured out to a science—this is how you put a nervous system most susceptible to dopamine loops" → Charlie shows Daylight → "It's like a Kindle, but it's a replacement for your laptop or your desktop"

### Verbatim

“The blue light. This thing called flicker. It’s brightness mismatch. The rest of the environment. That’s number third. And number four is the oversaturated colors in high contrast. All go together. Your computer is trying its best job to simulate a Vegas casino. They have figured out to a science, this is how you put the human, and their nervous system and physiological state, to be most susceptible to getting stuck into these dopamine loops.”

“Basically your body gets put on high alert, high arousal, high stimulation when you're on a computer.”

“You know, the Vegas casino blocks out all the natural light. They have incredibly bright lights. It's a ton of blue light. Um, it's all flashing and flickering, and it's all extremely oversaturated. They do that 'cause they have figured out to a science, this is how you put the human and their nervous system and physiological state to be most susceptible to getting stuck into these dopamine loops.”

“Well, I'm just gonna briefly just show this is my daylight... It's like a Kindle, it's just like a Kindle, but it's perfectly responsive... It's a replacement for your laptop or your desktop.”

### Platform-Specific Captions

### Instagram/Facebook (Parent Empathy Focus)

**Option 1** (Polarizing):

```Plain
Your kid's Chromebook was literally designed using Vegas casino psychology.

Blue light ✓
Flicker ✓
Brightness mismatch ✓
Oversaturated colors ✓
Keeps them indoors ✓

All five create the same physiological state that makes gambling addictive.

No wonder they melt down after screen time.

It's not behavior. It's biology.

**Option 2** (Curiosity Gap):

```Plain
There are 5 ways your kid's screen hijacks their nervous system.

(And no, it's not just "blue light")

Anjan Kata spent 6 years solving what experts said was impossible—making a screen that doesn't dysregulate kids.

This clip explains exactly how modern screens work like slot machines 🎰

```

**Option 3** (Direct Challenge):

```Plain
Stop blaming your kid for their screen addiction.

Their device was engineered to create the same physiological response as a Vegas casino.

This isn't about willpower.
It's about biology.

```

### LinkedIn (Professional/Solution Focus):

**Option 1** - Using "People don't fail..." template:

```Plain
People don't struggle with screen time because they lack discipline.

They struggle because modern devices use five physiological mechanisms to dysregulate the nervous system:

• Blue light disrupts circadian rhythms
• Flicker creates subtle stress responses
• Brightness mismatch forces constant adaptation
• Oversaturated colors overstimulate dopamine
• Indoor-only design disconnects us from natural regulation

The solution isn't willpower. It's better technology.

Anjan Kata (Daylight Computer founder) spent 6 years solving what field experts said was impossible: E-Ink screens fast enough to replace traditional displays.

For families homeschooling or choosing alternative education paths, this matters. Educational technology should enhance learning, not dysregulate the learner.

**Option 2** - Using "Most people don't want..." template:

```Plain
Most people don't want to eliminate screens from their kids' education.

They want screens that don't destroy their kids' nervous systems.

True educational technology means:
→ Learning without dysregulation
→ Engagement without addiction
→ Progress without the crash

If you can handle the truth about how current devices work (hint: Vegas casino psychology), you'll love what's now possible.

Anjan Kata's story: ADHD kid who dropped out → built the screen everyone said was impossible.

**Option 3** - Using "The real flex..." template:

```Plain
The real flex isn't giving your homeschooler the latest iPad.

It's giving them technology that enhances their learning without hijacking their nervous system.

Anjan Kata (Daylight Computer) breaks down the 5 mechanisms modern screens use to dysregulate kids—and why the solution isn't going full Luddite.

For parents designing personalized education: this changes what's possible.

- [Charlie's anecdote about his kids - find in transcript]
- [09:42-10:15] Screen apnea explanation
- [04:49-05:30] Anjan's personal story of dysregulation

**Transcript** (condensed):

Charlie admits mistake with his kids on iPad → They're "keyed up, not good" → Anjan: "They're a monster" → Explanation of screen apnea → "You breathe less—literally take less breaths per minute" → "Your tidal volume is less, meaning you breathe shallower" → "You're dysregulated. You're anxious" → Anjan's confession: "I was so dysregulated. My circadian rhythms are toast. I am so disembodied."

### Verbatim

Charlie Deist:  
“And, and you hear all this talk about the zombify kid after being on an iPad for an hour in some cases. They might not even become zombie is the wrong analogy because they're, they're overstimulated, and when you take the object away from them, maybe they kinda look like a zombie when they're glued into it, but then they're dysregulated, right.”

Anjan:  
“They're a monster.”

Charlie Deist:  
“Exactly, they're keyed up and, and, and it's not good. And I, and they, they, handful of times I've sort of made the mistake of, uh, of, of letting my, my kids who are, you know, three and, and six, the ones that we've let use the, the iPad on occasion, uh, and, and you know, just watching Daniel Tiger or whatever, it's like, it, it, I definitely don't want that to be the default of how they interact with with devices.”

Anjan:  
“When we feel more tense, when we use a computer, one of the reasons why is there's a phenomena called screen apnea... Because you have sympathetic overregulation and not enough parasympathetic... you actually, when you're on a computer, the screen apnea phenomenon is one. You breathe less. You literally take less breaths per minute. And number two, your tidal volume is less, meaning you actually breathe shallower. And the combination of these two is you're dysregulated. Um, you're a bit more anxious.”

“I'm so dysregulated. My circadian rhythms are so toast. I'm so disembodied.”

### Platform-Specific Captions

### Instagram/Facebook (Maximum Empathy):

**Option 1** (Personal Story):

```Plain
I used to blame myself when my kids turned into monsters after iPad time.

Turns out, I was blaming the wrong thing.

There's something called "screen apnea"—just like sleep apnea, but for screens.

When kids are on devices, they:
• Breathe less frequently
• Take shallower breaths
• Enter low-level fight-or-flight

They're not being difficult.
Their nervous system is literally dysregulated.

This changes everything about how I think about educational technology.

Full convo with the guy who solved this → [LINK]

\#consciousparenting \#screentime \#homeschool \#parenting
```

**Option 2** (Scientific Angle):

```Plain
"Screen apnea" is stealing your child's breath.

And you probably have it too.

Here's what's happening:
→ Less breaths per minute
→ Shallower breathing (lower tidal volume)
→ Chronic low-level anxiety
→ Nervous system dysregulation

That post-screen meltdown? It's not behavioral. It's physiological.

Former ADHD kid who struggled with this explains the science (and the solution) → [LINK]
```

**Option 3** (Reframe):

```Plain
What if your kid isn't "addicted" to screens?

What if their device is just really good at hijacking their breathing?

Screen apnea is real.
The meltdowns make sense.
And there's finally a better option.

Watch this 👇
```

### LinkedIn:

**Using "Every big change..." template**:

```Plain
Every big parenting shift in my approach started the same way—

I was blaming my kids for something that wasn't their fault.

Screen tantrums? I thought it was about limits and discipline.

Screen apnea? I'd never heard of it.

But here's what I learned from Anjan Kata (Daylight Computer founder):

When kids are on screens, their nervous system gets dysregulated through measurable physiological mechanisms:
• Reduced breathing frequency
• Decreased tidal volume (shallower breaths)
• Chronic sympathetic nervous system activation

They're not being difficult. They're literally in a subtle fight-or-flight state.

For parents choosing alternative education paths—especially those integrating technology—this science matters.

The question isn't "screen time yes or no."
It's "which screens, and how do they affect the whole child?"

### Twitter/X:

```Plain
"Screen apnea" is the parenting concept you've never heard of but desperately need to understand.

Your kid isn't "addicted" to their iPad.

Their device is literally dysregulating their breathing.

Less breaths per minute + shallower breathing = fight-or-flight mode

## CLIP 3: "The Least Computer Possible"

[https://share.descript.com/view/x6KZW1qTR0G](https://share.descript.com/view/x6KZW1qTR0G)

### Clip Details

- **Primary On-Screen Text**: "Unlimited Screen Time (Because It's Actually Healthy)"
- **Duration**: 100-120 seconds
- **Story Arc**: False binary → Philosophy → Real parent testimony → The paradox resolved
- **Best Platforms**: LinkedIn, YouTube Shorts, Email (solution-focused)

### Editing Instructions

**Segments to Combine**:

- [24:56-27:30] Daylight Kids philosophy
- [32:40-33:15] Customer testimonial about unlimited screen time
- [Brief clip of Charlie's enthusiasm for the product]

**Transcript** (condensed):

Anjan: "It's unrealistic to be a Luddite, to completely get away from technology" → "The point of Daylight is the least computer possible" → "You do what you need to and you put it away and you go outside" → Explanation of adaptive learning apps being valuable → "Instead of four hours and tantrums, it gets done in an hour or 45 minutes and they're engaged" → "It's like sugary candy vs. hummus and carrots" → Customer quote: "I give them unlimited screen time with the Daylight" → "More interesting than picking on your sister, but less interesting than your backyard" → "Daylight is a guilt-free or healthier iPad"

### Verbatim

Anjan:  
“The reason we exist is because it's unrealistic and probably not in the best interest of your child's development to be a Luddite to completely get away with technology. So the point of daylight is almost like the least computer possible, and you do what you need to and you put it away and you go out to, you go outside and you put your hands in the dirt and you play with other people.”

“Basically, instead of now four hours and more tantrums and more, you know, like difficulty. To have the kid be engaged or do it, it gets done in an hour or 45 minutes and they're engaged and now there's more time. And now you don't have all these negative associations and emotions around learning or reading or this.”

“It's like sugary candy, if that's all that's there, they're gonna pick it every time over hummus and carrots. But if hummus and carrots are there, they objectively taste good. If your senses haven't been ruined by the other things.”

“My kid loves the daylight because when they previously had an iPad, they were only allowed 45 minutes of screen time a week. And I give them unlimited screen time with the daylight and it, it turns out, like, you know, being able to... It turns out that's more interesting than picking on your sister, but less interesting than your backyard. And like that is, that is what daylight is for.”

“Daylight is sort of a guilt-free or healthier iPad.”

### Platform-Specific Captions

### Instagram/Facebook:

**Option 1** (Paradox Hook):

```Plain
"I give my kids UNLIMITED screen time."

Before you judge—hear me out.

One mom went from 45 minutes/week on an iPad to unlimited time on a Daylight computer.

Why?

Because not all screens are created equal.

The "Vegas casino" screens → Limited, dysregulating
The paper-like E-Ink screens → Unlimited, actually healthy

Her kids' reality:
"More interesting than picking on your sister, but less interesting than your backyard."

That's the sweet spot.

**Option 2** (False Binary):

```Plain
You're trapped in a false choice:

Option A: Be a Luddite (no technology)
Option B: Accept dysregulation (standard devices)

There's a third way.

Anjan Kata calls it "the least computer possible."

Technology that:
✓ Replaces 4 hours of tantrums with 45 minutes of focus
✓ Gets the learning done without the crash
✓ Creates no negative associations with reading

One parent's testimony: "I give them unlimited screen time now. Because it's actually healthy."

The future of homeschool tech → [LINK]
```

**Option 3** (Lifestyle Framing):

```Plain
The real goal isn't more screen time.

It's:
→ Hands in dirt
→ Playing with other kids
→ Being outside

But kids need SOME technology for school.

So what if there was a device that:
• Gets the academic work done faster (45 min vs. 4 hours)
• Doesn't dysregulate them
• Doesn't create negative emotions around learning

"The least computer possible."

That's the philosophy.

Full convo with the founder → [LINK]
```

### LinkedIn:

**Option 1** - Using "What if..." template:

```Plain
What if the good screen was simpler than you thought?

E-Ink display (paper-like, no blue light)
Fast enough to replace Chromebooks
Kids request what they want to learn
Parents approve or deny
No tantrums, more outdoor time

That's it.

We make educational technology complicated, but the best version is surprisingly simple.

Anjan Kata (Daylight Computer) is proving that you don't have to choose between being a Luddite and accepting dysregulation.

For families designing personalized education: this changes what's possible.

One parent's testimony: "I went from 45 minutes per week (iPad) to unlimited screen time (Daylight). My kids love it, and I don't feel guilty."

The paradigm shift → OpenEd Podcast with @anjankataday

\#EdTech \#Homeschool \#OpenEducation \#PersonalizedLearning
```

**Option 2** - Using "Stop trying to be extraordinary..." template:

```Plain
Stop trying to find the perfect educational technology.

Use ordinary apps.
On an extraordinary screen.
With consistent boundaries.

This is how families actually create healthy tech habits.

Anjan Kata's philosophy: "The least computer possible."

Not Luddism.
Not unlimited iPads.
Something better: Technology that gets the learning done, then gets out of the way.

Real parent result:
"Instead of 4 hours and tantrums, it gets done in 45 minutes and they're engaged. Now there's more time for everything else."

For parents pioneering alternative education paths—this matters.

```

**Option 3** - Using "I've noticed a pattern..." template:

```Plain
I've noticed a pattern:

The happiest homeschool families aren't trying to eliminate technology entirely.

They're obsessively focused on finding technology that enhances learning without hijacking the nervous system.

Anjan Kata (Daylight Computer founder) breaks it down:

"The least computer possible" means:
→ Adaptive learning apps (valuable)
→ E-Ink display (no dysregulation)
→ 45 focused minutes instead of 4 distracted hours
→ More time outside, hands in dirt, playing with others

One mom's testimony: "I give them unlimited screen time now—because with this screen, it's actually healthy."

That's the paradigm shift.

## BONUS: EMAIL SEQUENCE (If Applicable)

### Email 1: Episode Announcement

**Subject**: "Your kid's screen was built like a slot machine 🎰"

**Body**:

```Plain
I just had one of those conversations that changes how you think about educational technology forever.

Anjan Kata dropped out of high school, struggled with ADHD, and spent 6 years solving what experts said was impossible.

He built a computer screen that doesn't destroy your nervous system.

In our conversation, he breaks down:

• The 5 ways screens dysregulate kids (it's not just "blue light")
• Why "screen apnea" explains the post-iPad meltdowns
• How being a naive outsider is sometimes your biggest advantage
• The "least computer possible" philosophy for families

If you're trying to figure out how to integrate technology into your homeschool without the guilt—this one's essential.

```

### Email 2: Deep Dive (2-3 days later)

**Subject**: "The screen apnea phenomenon (you probably have it too)"

**Body**:

```Plain
Quick follow-up to our Anjan Kata episode—

One concept keeps coming up in the replies: "screen apnea."

Here's what's happening:

When you're on a screen, you literally breathe less.
→ Fewer breaths per minute
→ Shallower breathing (reduced tidal volume)
→ Chronic low-level fight-or-flight

Your kid's post-screen meltdown? Not behavioral. Physiological.

That changes everything about limits, discipline, and what "healthy screen time" even means.

I break down the full science with Anjan in this clip → [LINK TO CLIP 2]

Or watch the full episode → [LINK]

P.S. One mom in our community switched her kids to a Daylight computer and went from "45 minutes per week" to "unlimited screen time" because the dysregulation disappeared. More on that in the episode.
