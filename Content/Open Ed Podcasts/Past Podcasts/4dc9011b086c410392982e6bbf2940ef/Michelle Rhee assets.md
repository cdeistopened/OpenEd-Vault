    ```JavaScript
    Here's what's happening in hiring that most people don't realize:
    
    AI writes the applications.
    AI filters the applications.
    Hiring managers call someone they trust.
    
    The résumé isn't dead—but trust is becoming your competitive advantage.
    
    If you're job hunting (or helping someone who is), focus on:
    • Building relationships in your target field
    • Creating proof of work that others can vouch for
    • Getting warm introductions over cold applications
    
    The future of hiring is human connections + evidence, not just polished bullet points.
    
    Thanks to @OpenEdHQ for the great conversation about this.

    # College Is Broken. So What Replaces It?
    
    I recently joined [the OpenEd Podcast for a panel with Michelle Rhee and Isaac Morehouse](https://opened.co/blog/college-for-all-is-breaking-what-replaces-it) on what replaces the "learn for years, then do" model. The conversation spanned apprenticeships, AI, and how teens actually find their way in a labor market that looks less like a ladder and more like a loop. You can listen to the episode here, or here’s a summary of what I talked about.
    
    ## Higher ed sits upstream from K–12
    
    When Clay Christensen and I began applying disruption theory to education, a key realization was that K–12 doesn't operate in isolation. It's a dependent system. We often define "good" high schools as those that place students into "good" colleges. If colleges are misfiring—on cost, readiness, pathways, or job-market fit—then the system behind them misfires as well. That's one reason I've spent increasing time on higher ed and workforce: fixing K–12 without addressing the next link is insufficient.
    
    ## Work is non-linear now
    
    The old pathway—degree, entry-level job, linear promotion—describes a shrinking percentage of careers. People switch roles every few years, stack gigs, and change directions. Some find purpose in work. Others work to enable purpose outside of work. Both are valid.
    
    Three things matter as we re-architect the transition from "school" to "career": exposure, doing, and networks. Exposure broadens the option set beyond the three jobs a child can name. Doing builds real skills and confidence. Networks de-risk the next step—most jobs continue to flow through people, not portals.
    
    ## What employers are actually saying
    
    For years employers have said, "We can't find skilled workers for mission-critical roles." They don’t want more diplomas. They want evidence—references, shipped projects, and the ability to contribute on Day 1.
    
    Entry-level has always meant "learning on the job." That's another word for apprenticeship. The challenge is designing it well.
    
    To make apprenticeships scale, we need to de-risk the model for both sides. For employers: clearer supervision patterns and modular work that can absorb a learner. For learners: smaller, safer bets that pay while you learn and generate portable proofs.
    
    ## AI as a practical tool
    
    AI raises understandable anxieties about entry-level jobs. It can also help. We're reaching a point where AI can power realistic simulations to build "reps" in low-stakes settings, then feed those experiences into portfolios. Pair this with authentic artifacts—recorded pitches, code commits, real customer feedback—and you have signals hiring managers can trust.
    
    The question isn't whether AI will change work—it will. The question is whether we'll use it to create better pathways for people to contribute meaningfully.

    _Thanks for reading. If this resonated, I'd love to hear how you're thinking about these transitions in your own context._

    ```Plain
    Story time: When I moved into my fancy LA building, I was the oldest person by decades.
    
    My husband spent two weeks asking every young person what they did for work.
    
    The answers: crypto, cannabis, gaming, content creation.
    
    Jobs that didn't exist when I was their age.
    
    This isn't about being anti-college—it's about recognizing that the career landscape has fundamentally shifted.

    ```Plain
    My expensive LA building was full of 20-somethings making bank in crypto, cannabis, gaming, and content creation.
    
    None of them "majored" in it.
    
    Are we preparing kids for the jobs that pay—or the ones that used to?
