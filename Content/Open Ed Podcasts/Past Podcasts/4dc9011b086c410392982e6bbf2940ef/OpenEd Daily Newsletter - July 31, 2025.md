# The Law of Exposure

Darryll Stinson has always been a disruptor. He's spent his career helping people break free from systems that don't serve them. But when it came to his children's education, he was mostly just following rules, accepting traditional school as the only option. When Matt Bowman suggested he could pull his kids out for a couple weeks, he was skeptical.

"Is that even allowed?" he thought.

"This dude is trying to get my kids expelled."

But that conversation planted a question: What if there was a different way?

Darryll describes what happened next through the lens of the Law of Exposure: **the mind when stretched never returns to its original form.**

They took a summer to test it. The kids initially went wild—they wanted to be in school, craved the social interaction and friends. But they stuck with it. They saw the Grand Canyon. They listened to Darryll do sales calls in the car and were ready to run businesses by summer's end. When August rolled around, they went back to school. But now they noticed the rigidity. They missed the adventure. They'd see him heading to Colorado for work and want to come along. "Well, you can just come," he'd say. "Really?" "Yeah. My friend Matt said we can do whatever we want as long as we send the school a note."

His kids ended up missing more time than the attendance secretary wanted. They still maintained good grades. They were still student council leaders. [Read the full story here.](https://opened.co/blog/kids-skipped-school)

# 65% of schools suffer from chronic absenteeism

Nearly two-thirds of American schools have over 30% of students missing more than 18 days per year. It's no coincidence that the sharpest uptick occurred during COVID, when kids and parents alike reacted against so many wasted hours in front of a screen. But even when things went back to 'normal', rates of absenteeism did not. Sadly, most of the teens skipping school aren't starting businesses or self-directing their education, like Darryll's kids. But we can't help but wonder how many students would go back to "school" if they had a bigger say in what that looked like.

# Darryll's #1 tip to instantly become a better speaker

"You gotta be a thermostat, and not a thermometer," Darryl [tells his coaching clients](https://youtu.be/loBKDkDxOSc).  
Imagine you show up to a mostly empty conference room to give your talk. You could make your disappointment visible, and reflect low enthusiasm back to the remaining audience. Or, you could raise their temperature to match your high energy.  
"People don't move, take action unless they're moved emotionally," he says. "It don't matter what you say. 'Open education, better pathway.' Who cares until they're moved emotionally?"

This works whether you're speaking to a crowd or defending your educational choices to skeptical family members. If you find yourself with an opportunity to share your passion for open education, be like Darryll. Be a thermostat. Set the temperature.
