Basic Summary: Parents often fear that their choices may lead to their children's failure in life, questioning whether they provide too much or too little freedom. Embracing alternative education options, like part-time homeschooling, can alleviate this pressure and open up new opportunities for families, allowing them to prioritize what is best for their children.

📍 📍 📍 So, the 2nd part of your question around what do we see parents hesitate around that is really this cultural pressure.

Of 📍 are my kids going to be failures for life? That is every parent's fear. Are my choices, my decisions, my parenting style going to wreck my kids for life. I know that feeling very well of. Are we giving them too much choice? Are we giving them too little choice? Are they going to turn out crazy or weird or dependent or, just not successful?

And it's easier just to do the status quo, because no grandma at Thanksgiving dinner is going to judge you for making that decision.

If you just send them to the local public school, if you can get over the critique of 📍 others and just let go of that fear of only doing what everyone else is doing it can unlock opportunities that you never knew were there. 10 years ago, it was, "why are you doing that?" People are now saying, " I wish I could do that." and " well, how can you do that?"

Maybe just do part time homeschooling. Monday, Wednesday, Friday, but you do what's right , for your kid, for your family, and let them realize that they have flexibility.

And that can decrease that feeling of being overwhelmed. 📍
