Dyslexia: When to DIY vs. When to Call the Experts  
Traditional schools have special education departments, reading specialists, and teams of professionals to help struggling readers. So when you're homeschooling and notice your child reversing letters or struggling with basic words, the question hits hard: Are you in over your head?

We have good news: You don't have to become a reading specialist to guide a struggling reader to confidence. The uncomfortable truth is that many schools still fail to produce confident readers – dyslexic or otherwise – even with all of the resources available.

Whether you're homeschooling, considering it, or just exploring a more open approach, you are starting from a position of strength for at least 3 reasons:

Self-paced learning. Classrooms move at the speed of the average student, leaving struggling readers perpetually behind. At home, you can provide extra time without the social stigma.  
Customized instruction. A parent-led approach allows you to tailor your approach to your child's specific needs. You can combine elements from different methods, adjust pacing, and incorporate your child's interests—all while still using structured literacy techniques proven effective by neuroscience research.  
Emotional safety. Large classrooms can be brutal for dyslexic children—daily humiliation from reading aloud, falling behind in every subject, watching classmates master skills effortlessly. At home, you can control the environment and build confidence and skills simultaneously.  
However, none of these advantages matter if you aren't equipped with the right tools and knowledge.

"Reading is very complex, and teaching reading really is rocket science," explains Kris Vassel, a seasoned reading interventionist and founder of Vasselight Tutoring. "It's not something you can just do naturally. You have to be trained on how to do it."

You don't need to become a certified reading specialist yourself, but you do need to recognize the boundaries of your expertise and know when to call in reinforcements.

What You Can Do Yourself  
Let's start with the obvious: You know your child better than any teacher or specialist. If something feels off about their reading development, trust your instincts. The key is to distinguish between normal developmental variation and genuine red flags.

And the most reliable early indicator isn't what you might expect:

"The inability to rhyme is one of the most reliable indicators of dyslexia," Vassel explains. "It shows a deficit in phonological awareness—a core skill that all dyslexic individuals struggle with."

Other red flags include persistent difficulty learning letter names and sounds, trouble with multi-syllable words ("pasghetti" instead of "spaghetti"), and a family history of reading struggles (dyslexia is highly hereditary)

Basic screening tools from Savvy Learning, the International Dyslexia Association and Reading Rockets can’t give you a formal diagnosis, but they're a good first step to decide whether professional evaluation is warranted.

Once you've made this assessment, you can start to change your approach.

Perhaps the biggest advantage you have as a homeschool parent is that you control the emotional atmosphere around reading.

Forget everything you think you know about how reading instruction should look. Forget grade levels, peer comparisons, and anxiety-inducing reading logs that turn every book into homework. Your job is to make reading feel safe and achievable.

Start with the 20-minute rule. "Reading daily at home—at least 20 minutes—is crucial," Vassel emphasizes. And it doesn't have to be your child doing all the reading. Read aloud to them. Listen to audiobooks together. Let them follow along in a physical book while hearing the story.

Choose books at your child's instructional level—where they can read with 90-95% accuracy. If they're missing more than one or two words per page, the book is too hard. Use AR BookFinder to check reading levels, and don't be afraid to start easier than necessary.

Leverage technology strategically. Text-to-speech software like Voice Dream Reader helps children access grade-level content while building underlying skills. Learning Ally provides audio textbooks for students with documented learning disabilities, while Bookshare offers accessible digital books.

Even with this approach, your dyslexic child will make errors. As Kris Vassel advises, "When your child is reading aloud and makes an error, encourage them to self-correct. If they finish the sentence and go back to fix it, praise them for self-correcting. Train yourself to wait before jumping in. Good readers self-correct."

Wait three to five seconds before offering help. If they self-correct, celebrate it: "I love how you went back to make that make sense!" If they don't self-correct, Vassel recommends helping them figure out the word rather than telling them what it is.

"Depending on the error, help them sound out or chunk the word, but don't turn it into a phonics lesson—keep the focus on reading."

What You Should Outsource  
Even with the most supportive home environment in the world, some children will need systematic phonics instruction delivered through multi-sensory methods with precise progress monitoring.

Seeking professional help doesn't make you a failure—it makes you smart. Jamie Lesko, OpenEd's Associate Director of Student Success, offers another perspective on why outside support can be invaluable: "Sometimes you need a second person in your child's life who can say the same things you've been saying, and suddenly it clicks. I call it the 'second person theory.' Sometimes, just having a tutor or another adult say it makes all the difference. It's okay to swallow your pride and let someone else help your child."

This isn't about your inadequacy as a parent—it's about the unique dynamic that a fresh voice can bring to the learning process. Children often respond differently to instruction from someone outside the family, free from the emotional complexities of the parent-child relationship.

Formal Assessment  
While you can spot warning signs and use basic screening tools by yourself, a comprehensive evaluation provides crucial insights into your child's specific challenges and strengths. According to the Dyslexia Center of Utah, "There is no single test for dyslexia. A 'diagnosis' is simply the professional opinion of a qualified expert, and this opinion can vary depending on the individual conducting the evaluation."

Most homeschool families have more flexibility in choosing providers but fewer built-in supports for navigating the process. OpenEd families get the best of both worlds: flexibility and support.

But before investing in a costly formal evaluation, consider what you hope to gain. For example, documentation necessary for college accommodations and workplace protections under ADA; detailed insights about your child's specific profile; or targeted recommendations offering practical guidance for effective teaching approaches.

Some tutoring services provide free assessments as part of their intake process. Services like Savvy Learning offer complimentary reading and math assessments to determine your child's current level and identify specific areas of need—often providing valuable insights without the cost of formal testing.

If you're an OpenEd family, our special education team can guide you through both private and school-based evaluation processes, help you understand what different assessments measure, and assist with documentation for future accommodations. Email sped@opened.co‍ for more information, or check the Special Education page within your state's Parent Link guide.

Specialized Reading Intervention  
Don't assume that buying a research-based reading program and following the manual will deliver the same results as working with a trained specialist. Kris learned this lesson while consulting with a classroom that had invested thousands in Wilson Reading System materials.

"They purchased all the materials, they had the students, they had the time blocked out," she recalls. "But after months of implementation, their students weren't making the progress they thought they would, and they were about to throw it in the trash and say it wasn't effective."

The teachers had followed the manual, completed the activities, and checked all the boxes—but they lacked the nuanced understanding of how to adjust pacing, recognize error patterns, and modify instruction based on individual student responses.

The program wasn't the problem; the implementation was. "That's when they realized they needed actual training," Vassel explains. "The materials are just tools. Without proper training, even the best program becomes ineffective."

Wilson and Barton Reading & Spelling System are evidence-based curricula that can be implemented by either trained tutors or parents who complete intensive certification.

Wilson tutors typically require 60+ hours of professional training and work in clinical or school settings, though some offer private tutoring. Barton was specifically designed for parent implementation but still requires 20+ hours of initial training plus ongoing support to ensure proper delivery.

All About Reading offers a more accessible parent-friendly approach but may lack sufficient intensity for severe dyslexia.

Last but not least, beyond their free assessment, Savvy Learning provides high-dosage tutoring designed specifically for families who want expertise without sacrificing homeschool flexibility.

"High dosage tutoring is up to 20 times more effective than standard tutoring," explains Savvy's CMO Tony Mickelsen. "What child is going to have fun while learning to read or do math for 60 minutes? It's really tough. That's tough for me as an adult, let alone for the little kids."

Their approach breaks traditional hour-long sessions into 25-minute sessions, four days per week. "The kids at the end of a session with Savvy, they are hyped. They are having so much fun that they want to come back for the next session," Mickelsen notes.

Certified instructors create individualized learning plans, provide regular progress monitoring, and coordinate with existing school programs when beneficial. For OpenEd families, this eliminates the need for parent training while ensuring coordination with your overall educational approach.

Monitoring Progress  
After 3-4 months of consistent intervention, you should see measurable improvements in fluency, accuracy, or confidence. Professional providers use standardized measures to track progress and make data-driven adjustments. Parents doing intervention themselves often struggle to distinguish between genuine progress and wishful thinking. Parents note that it can feel slow, but over time, these methods work.

Bottom line: Professional instruction typically produces faster results with less family stress. When you're already managing a full homeschool curriculum, outsourcing the most technical subject to qualified specialists isn't a compromise—it's strategic thinking.

We're witnessing a shift where more parents are combining a homeschool-first approach with professional resources when needed. Parents can take comfort knowing that they don't need to have all the answers—or the expertise—to get started.

SIDEBAR: Sometimes the Problem Might Actually Be Vision:

Consider that what looks like dyslexia might actually be a treatable vision issue called convergence insufficiency. Vision Reading Academy founder Krystle Cordingley shares some of the signs:

Can read small words but struggles with longer ones  
Recognizes a word on one line but can't recognize the same word a few lines later  
Guesses at word endings  
Works hard to read but can't remember what they just read  
Shows physical signs of frustration when reading  
Cordingley discovered this with her own daughter: "She was 10 years old, almost 11, and reading at a beginning first-grade level. I tried everything - all the Orton-Gillingham programs for dyslexia. Nothing was working."

After addressing the vision issue? "She's 13 years old now, reading at college level at over 800 words per minute."

The assessment is simple: Often takes just 5 minutes over Zoom, watching how eye muscles control movement and convergence. Learn more here.
