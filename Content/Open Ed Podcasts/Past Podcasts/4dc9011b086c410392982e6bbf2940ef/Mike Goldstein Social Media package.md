```Plain
Thanks OpenEd for sharing this story!

A few things I'd add for folks thinking about unconventional solutions:

1) This only worked because we had a building with an extra floor. Real estate matters.

2) We weren't trying to replace teachers - these tutors worked alongside our amazing principal Charlie (33-year veteran, Massachusetts Teacher of the Year).

3) The "Princeton grad" was Laura. 20+ years later, we're still friends. We recently had her over for dinner.

The deeper lesson: When you measure what matters (did kids learn fractions?), you get creative about how to deliver it.

Most education "innovations" skip the measurement part. That's the actual problem.

    ### 1. OpenEd Brand: Framework 18 - The "What Most People Get Wrong About" Post
    
    > What most people get wrong about helping "average" students:
    > 
    > MYTH: The traditional classroom model serves all kids equally well.  
    > TRUTH: Many "average" kids are quietly bored and underserved by one-size-fits-all approaches.
    > 
    > MYTH: Solving learning gaps requires massive, top-down reforms.  
    > TRUTH: Sometimes, the most effective solutions are creative, intensive, and hyper-focused.
    > 
    > Our recent podcast with Mike Goldstein reveals how his charter school built a dorm with 42 full-time tutors to address this exact challenge, doubling student learning in a year. When we optimize for the extremes, we often fail the middle.

    ### 2. OpenEd Brand: Framework 44 - The "PRO TIP" Post
    
    > PRO TIP: If you want to dramatically accelerate student learning, don't just add more classes. Think "high-dosage tutoring."
    > 
    > Mike Goldstein, founder of a groundbreaking charter school, literally built a dorm on top of his school for 42 full-time tutors. Why? Because research by economists like Roland Fryer confirms that intensive, one-on-one support can double or even triple what students learn in a year.

    ### 3. OpenEd Brand: Framework 95 - The Sports Analogy
    
    > In basketball, you don't just run general drills to improve a player's free throws. You isolate the shot, repeat it hundreds of times, and provide immediate, specific feedback.
    > 
    > Same idea in education, especially for kids in the middle.
    > 
    > Mike Goldstein realized this when his school's project-based learning wasn't closing skill gaps for their students. His solution? He brought 42 full-time tutors into a dorm built right above the school. This "dorm solution" provided targeted, high-dosage, one-on-one instruction.

    ### 4. OpenEd Brand: Framework 31 - The "10 Ideas" Post (modified to focus on one big idea)
    
    > Do you struggle with finding truly innovative solutions in education? This one's for you.
    > 
    > Here's ONE big idea for helping students, especially those stuck in the "average" lane:
    > 
    > **The Dorm Solution**: Imagine building a live-in tutor program _inside_ your school. That's what Mike Goldstein did. He converted a floor of his school into a dorm for 42 recent college grads who spent all day delivering one-on-one tutoring. It created a massive capacity for individualized attention.
    > 
    > If you're looking to move beyond the status quo and deliver real impact, sometimes you have to invent the solution yourself.

    ### 5. OpenEd Brand: Framework 24 - The "Study Summary" Post
    
    > According to Harvard economist Roland Fryer's research, high-dosage tutoring can literally double or triple what students learn in a year.
    > 
    > This isn't just theory. Mike Goldstein put this into practice by creating a "dorm solution"—housing 42 tutors directly within his school to provide consistent, personalized support. The University of Chicago's Education Lab has also shown similar models can close achievement gaps in math.
    > 
    > The data is clear: individualized attention, delivered consistently, is a game-changer.

    ## Ela's Personal Account Captions
    
    ### 1. Ela's Personal: Framework 19 - The "Behind the Scenes" Post
    
    > Behind the scenes of my interview with Mike Goldstein, I learned something truly wild about education innovation.
    > 
    > We often talk about "scaling" solutions, but Mike's story is a masterclass in how sometimes you need to go _deep_ before you go wide. His school literally built a dorm on site for 42 tutors!
    > 
    > It made me reflect on how much unseen effort and radical thinking goes into truly effective education. What "behind-the-scenes" effort has surprised you in your field?

    ### 2. Ela's Personal: Framework 13 - The "Movie Script" Post (modified to podcast dialogue)
    
    > ME: "...So you found that every student has very different gaps, and one-on-one support allows for more comprehensive education."
    > 
    > **MIKE:** "Even where kids have the same gap—let’s say fractions—some don’t even know what a fraction is... it’s easier for our tutor to help us one at a time instead of concurrently. That’s the advantage of one-on-one instruction versus even a small group of five kids who roughly have the same academic shortcoming."
    > 
    > This snippet from my conversation with Mike Goldstein perfectly captures _why_ his "dorm solution" (42 live-in tutors!) was so revolutionary. It's about meeting each kid exactly where they are.
    > 
    > What are your thoughts on personalized learning vs. group instruction?

    ### 3. Ela's Personal: Framework 46 - "I thought I'd be ________ Post"
    
    > I used to think the biggest challenges in education required grand, sweeping policy changes to help all kids.
    > 
    > Then I interviewed Mike Goldstein, and he told me about building a dorm _inside_ his charter school for 42 full-time tutors.
    > 
    > What I've learned is that sometimes, the most profound impact comes from intensely focused, even "boutique," solutions that truly meet individual student needs. It's about solving _the_ problem, not just _a_ problem.

    ### 4. Ela's Personal: Framework 60 - The "Values" Post
    
    > One of my core values, especially through my work with OpenEd, is a deep belief in individual potential. But how do we truly unlock it for every child, not just the extremes?
    > 
    > My recent conversation with Mike Goldstein reinforced this. His commitment to ensuring _every single kid_ at his school received the personalized support they needed led to an incredibly innovative (and somewhat wild!) solution: building a literal dorm for 42 full-time tutors.
    > 
    > It's a testament to how far genuine care and a focus on individual flourishing can take you. What values drive your work?

    ### 5. Ela's Personal: Framework 27 - The "Doing The Unexpected" Post
    
    > Recently, I was reminded that truly transformative solutions often come from doing the completely unexpected.
    > 
    > During my interview with Mike Goldstein, he shared how his charter school needed massive tutoring capacity. Instead of lamenting teacher shortages or pushing for another generalized program, he decided to build a _dorm_ above the school and house 42 full-time tutors!

    ## **IMPROVED CLIP \#1 - FULL STORY ARC**
    
    **Name**: "We built dorms above the school for tutors"
    
    **Segments to Combine**:
    
    - **[Setup - 4:30-5:30]**: The one-on-one tutoring discovery
    - **[Problem - 8:00-8:30]**: "When we realized we needed tons and tons of tutors"
    - **[Solution - 8:30-10:00]**: The crazy dorm plan
    - **[Result - 10:30-12:00]**: How it worked with real people like Laura from Princeton
    
    **Complete Story Arc**:
    
    _"What did start to go well was giving kids a lot of one-on-one tutoring. We started dialing up on a lot of math and English, sort of one-on-one tutoring to help these ninth graders and 10th graders catch up on stuff that they've nominally been taught in grades 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Like what's a fraction? How do you add them?_
    
    _When we realized we needed tons and tons of tutors, we came up with this crazy plan. We had a school building with two floors that was the school, but when we bought the building, it was a three story building. We came up with this crazy plan that we would build it out as a dorm. Imagine like a college dorm. We'd build 14 triples, like those bedrooms for like three kids with the bunk bed. We'd recruit 42 full-time tutors to say sort of like Teach for America style. They're gonna come to us for one year. They won't have to pay for housing. They're gonna live in a triple, they're gonna live on the top floor of the school. And every day at 8:00 AM these 40 people, these 40 22-year-olds will come downstairs and then all they'll do all day is tutor our students._
    
    _The first year we got like maybe 250 people to apply for these 40 or so full-time tutoring slots. Laura, she was one of these first 40 tutors. She had just graduated from Princeton. She didn't know if she wanted to be a teacher. She liked the idea of a year of public service. Princeton grad, like super capable and she was phenomenal with the kids and she's gone on to have a great career in education."_

    ### **Option 2: "Failure/Challenge" Framework (#6)**
    
    **Caption: LINK IN COMMENT TO BLOG POST “Hear the full story: <link>**
    
    ```Plain
    "When we realized we needed tons and tons of tutors, we came up with this crazy plan..."
    
    @Mike Goldstein didn't accept the "there aren't enough teachers" excuse.
    
    Instead of competing for scarce talent, he created a completely new model:
    • Built dorms above the school
    • Recruited 42 recent college grads
    • Provided free housing in exchange for full-time tutoring
    • Got 250 applications for 40 spots
    
    One Princeton grad became part of this experiment. She went on to have a stellar career in education.
    
    The lesson? When you can't find the solution, sometimes you have to build it.
