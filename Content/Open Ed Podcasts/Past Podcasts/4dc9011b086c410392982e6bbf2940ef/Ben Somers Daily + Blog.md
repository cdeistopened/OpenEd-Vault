# You're Not a Teacher. You're an Education Designer.

When a quarter of boys are medicated to fit the system, something's broken. PLUS: Why homeschooling is now high-status in San Francisco.

---

Greetings!

Ben Somers was 11 when a teacher—frustrated that he was a foot tapper and wiggler, sent him to a psychiatrist. He was put on 70mg of Concerta (that's a pretty hefty dose of amphetamines for a kid who weighed about 100 pounds).

The medication wasn't prescribed to help Ben learn better. It was prescribed to make him easier to manage.

And he wasn’t alone. In Ben’s town that year, 25% of all the boys were on some kind of ADHD medication. How many of these prescriptions were written to make the classroom run more smoothly?

**Fast forward:** Ben dropped out of high school, worked his way into education technology, and now runs a platform called Recess that's trying to solve the problems he experienced firsthand.

On the latest podcast, we talked about what he's learned—including a surprising data point that should make every parent who's agonizing over curriculum choices relax a little.

Let's dive in.

## THE EDUCATION DESIGNER

Did you hear about the guy who tried to make a chicken sandwich completely from scratch?

This isn’t the setup for a corny joke. Andy George spent six months and $1,500 dollars growing the wheat for the bun, raising the chickens, harvesting salt from the ocean—all of it. I[n](http://it.In) the end, he had... a mediocre sandwich.

Most parents think homeschooling means becoming that guy—digging your own soil, growing everything yourself, and hopefully not producing a terrible sandwich after six months of exhaustion.

My guest Ben Somers has a different take: **you're not supposed to be the teacher of everything. You're the education designer.**

You don't need to personally deliver every lesson. You need to curate the right mix of resources, experiences, and relationships that work for your child. Some families cook every meal from scratch. Most people want to pick their meals and occasionally cook. When you make it easier to be involved, parents actually want to design the experience—they just don't want to grow the wheat.

The tools exist now. Are you designing, or are you trying to be a one-person school system?

## HIGH-STATUS HOMESCHOOLING

In San Francisco, homeschooling is now high-status.

Why? Ben gives two reasons.

First, it signals you're dissatisfied with the quality of conventional education—which means you have high standards. Second, it means you've organized your life in such a way that you can solve childcare and instruction yourself. You've carved out enough time and figured out how to make it work in an expensive city. High standards plus life control equals status.

Of course, this feels a bit elitist—and it is. But the reason homeschooling is easier now isn't just resources. It's realizing you don't have to do everything yourself.

OpenEd families are proving that you don't need to be wealthy to be an education designer. You just need to care enough to start curating.

## WHERE KIDS DESIGN THEIR LEARNING

[Recess](https://www.notion.so/The-Post-Pandemic-Promise-of-High-Impact-Tutoring-216650e1b5ce4c37a6f0324e436c52ad?pvs=21) is what happens when you build a platform around kid choice and friend-making.

Here's the insight that shaped it: when Ben worked at Synthesis School (the SpaceX school), they spent **$10 million a year on developing the best educational games possible.** You know what beat all of it? Whether the kid had a friend in their class. Not teacher credentials. Not curriculum quality. If a kid had one friend in class, they stuck around forever and performed better. Without a friend, they churned in 3-6 months.

So Recess built around that.

**Kids browse a marketplace of classes** (taught by YouTubers and professionals) and **request the ones that excite them**. Parents approve or deny. When kids join a class, they meet others who like the same stuff. After class, Recess suggests those kids as friends and gives them Discord-style chat to stay connected.

Things trend on the platform—one kid gets into engineering, their friend joins, another friend joins, and suddenly you've got a wave of motivation spreading through actual friendships. Not coercion. Not medication. Just genuine interest spreading through social connection.

Your kid picks the classes. You approve them. Friends form naturally. That's Recess.

## **📚 Word of the Day: Verschlimmbessern**

**verschlimmbessern** | /fɛɐ̯ˈʃlɪmbɛsɐn/ | _verb_

To make something worse by trying to improve it; to "improve" something into a worse state. German _verschlimmern_ (to worsen) + _verbessern_ (to improve).

**Example:** "When Ben's fifth-grade teacher decided the best way to help an energetic 11-year-old focus was to prescribe him 70mg of methamphetamines—not to help him learn, but to make the classroom easier to manage—that was peak verschlimmbessern. They took a kid who just needed to move around and turned him into someone dealing with anger issues, constipation, and long-term side effects."

# The School-to-Prescription Pipeline: Ben Somers on How We Medicate Kids Who Don't Fit the Mold

_By Ela Richmond_

---

Ben Somers was 11 when they put him on methamphetamines. Not street meth, obviously—the prescription kind. Concerta. Seventy milligrams of it, to be exact, for a kid who weighed about 100 pounds.

His crime? He was a foot tapper. A wiggler. The kind of kid who moved around in his seat and probably talked too much and generally made it harder for his fifth-grade teacher to manage the other 25 kids in the room.

So they sent him to a psychiatrist, who prescribed the drugs. And when I asked Ben, years later, whether he knew at the time that something was wrong, he didn't hesitate.

"For sure," he told me. "When I was 11, I was aware that when I took this pill in the morning, my day looked way different."

Different how? Anger issues. Constipation. A host of side effects that would eventually include, as they discovered years later with an endocrinologist, some impact on his puberty.

But here's the part that stayed with me long after our conversation ended: "It was really about the other kids," Ben said. "It wasn't about me."

The medication wasn't prescribed to help Ben learn better. It was prescribed to make him easier to manage. To make the classroom run more smoothly. To fit an 11-year-old boy into a system that wasn't designed for 11-year-old boys who move around.

Today, Ben is building the alternative. His platform, [Recess](http://recess.gg/), lets kids choose their own classes, meet friends who share their interests, and learn in an environment that adapts to them—not the other way around. It's what he wishes had existed when he was that 11-year-old who just needed to move.

## A Quarter of Boys on Stimulants: When Medication Becomes the Default

And he wasn't alone. In his town that year, almost a quarter of all the boys were on stimulants.

I've been thinking about that number since Ben and I spoke. Not because I think all medication is bad or wrong—I'm not a doctor, and this isn't a screed against parents who make different choices than I might make. But because of what that number says about what we've decided is normal.

We've built a system that demands children sit still for six hours a day. When they can't—when they're 11 and full of energy and their bodies are literally telling them to move—we have two choices: change the system or change the child.

We've chosen to change the child.

Ben dropped out of high school, eventually worked his way into education technology, and spent several years at Synthesis School—the school originally built for SpaceX employees' kids. These days, he runs a platform called Recess that's trying to solve the problems he experienced firsthand.

And what he learned along the way should make every parent who's agonizing over curriculum choices take a breath.

## The $10 Million Lesson: What Actually Makes Kids Want to Learn

At Synthesis School, they spent roughly $10 million a year on educational content. They hired the best game designers. They built complex team simulation games. They iterated constantly based on data.

And you know what turned out to be the number one predictor of whether a kid stuck around and actually learned anything?

Whether they had a friend in their class.

Not the teacher's credentials. Not the quality of the games. Not the curriculum at all.

If a kid had a friend in class, they stayed forever. They performed better. They talked about what they learned outside of class. They made projects in their free time to share with their friend.

If they didn't have a friend? They were gone in three to six months, regardless of how "good" everything else was.

"Everyone was sleeping on friends," Ben told me. "Both to make their products sticky and to make the learning experience better."

Connection unlocked everything. Which, when you think about it, is obvious. But we've built an entire industry around curriculum optimization while mostly ignoring the free thing that actually works.

## You're Not the Teacher—You're the Education Designer

I bring this up because it connects to something Ben said that completely reframed how I think about homeschooling.

I'd always been intimidated by the idea because I pictured myself standing at a whiteboard, personally teaching every subject, forever. The idea of being solely responsible for another human's entire education felt crushing.

"You're not supposed to be the teacher of everything," Ben said. "You're the education designer."

It's such a simple reframe, but it changes everything.

You don't have to grow the wheat, raise the chickens, and harvest the salt from the ocean to make your kid a good sandwich. You just have to know where to find good ingredients and how to put them together in a way that works for your family.

The tools exist now. There are online classes taught by actual experts. There are communities of other families doing the same thing. There are platforms—like Ben's—that are specifically designed to help kids find friends who share their interests and choose what they want to learn.

The barrier isn't capability anymore. It's mindset.

## Why Homeschooling Is Now High-Status in San Francisco

Which brings me to something Ben said that made me uncomfortable in the best way.

"In San Francisco," he told me, "homeschooling is now high-status."

I laughed when he said it, because of course it is. Of course the city known for tech wealth and optimization culture has turned alternative education into a status symbol. But Ben wasn't being glib about it.

"It means two things," he explained. "One, you're dissatisfied with the quality of conventional education, which means you have high standards. And two, it means you've organized your life in such a way that you can solve childcare and good instruction. You've carved out enough time to be able to do a good job with that and figured out childcare in an expensive city."

In other words: high standards plus life control equals status.

I'm self-aware enough to recognize that this can sound—and in some cases, is—deeply elitist. Not every family has the flexibility to reorganize their lives around their children's education. Not every family has access to charter school funds or the social capital to plug into networks of other homeschooling families. Not every parent works in tech and can afford to live in San Francisco in the first place.

But here's what I keep coming back to: the reason homeschooling is becoming more accessible isn't primarily about money. It's about infrastructure. It's about platforms like Recess, or the growing number of microschools, or online tutoring services, or co-ops where parents share the load.

The real privilege isn't being able to do it all yourself. The real privilege is recognizing that you don't have to.

## How Recess Works: Choice, Friends, and Trending Topics

Ben's platform, Recess, is built around the two insights that shaped his journey: kids need friends, and kids need choice.

Kids browse a marketplace of classes taught by YouTubers and professionals. When they find something that excites them—how to build a trapdoor in Minecraft, how to write a short film—they request it from their parent. The parent can approve or deny. If approved, the kid joins the class with other kids who chose to be there.

After class, Recess suggests those kids as friends. They get a Discord-style chat to stay connected, see what classes their friends are taking, and organize to learn together.

Things trend on the platform the way they trend in real life—one kid gets into engineering, their friend joins, another friend joins, and suddenly you've got a wave of motivation spreading through actual friendships. Not because anyone was forced or medicated into compliance. Because they genuinely wanted to.

It's the opposite of the system that medicated Ben at age 11.

## The Choice We Shouldn't Have to Make

I don't know if Ben would have been a different person if he'd been allowed to wiggle and tap his feet and move around the classroom when he was 11. I don't know if avoiding those 70 milligrams of Concerta would have changed his path or just made his fifth-grade teacher's job harder.

What I do know is that we shouldn't have to make that choice.

We shouldn't have to choose between medicating a quarter of our boys or accepting that the system is broken. We shouldn't have to choose between doing everything ourselves or accepting standardized education that doesn't serve our kids.

The tools exist now to build something better. The infrastructure is being built by people like Ben who lived through the system's failures and decided to create alternatives.

Ben was medicated at 11 to fit the system. Now he's building platforms where the system fits the child.

That's not a revolution. It's just common sense.

And maybe it's time the system caught up.
