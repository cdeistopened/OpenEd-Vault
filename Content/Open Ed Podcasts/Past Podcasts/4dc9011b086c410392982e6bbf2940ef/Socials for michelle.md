```Plain
"We know what we need to do in public education in this country and we're just refusing to do it."

Told @OpenEdHQ why I went from education reformer to venture capitalist—and why I'm betting on founders who will replace the system, not fix it.

```Plain
Those kids "freaking ate me for lunch" my first year teaching.

By year 3? Same kids went from 13th percentile to grade level.

What changed wasn't their poverty or their neighborhood.

Great convo with @OpenEdHQ about what actually works: [link]

### Option 1: The "Behind the Scenes" Framework (#19)

```Plain
Behind the scenes of my conversation with OpenEd:

I almost didn't do this interview. By 2018, I was done with education. Completely out. People would evoke my name as a scare tactic—"people like Michelle Rhee want to evaluate teachers solely on test scores"—which wasn't even true.

But here's what pulled me back in:

Every day I meet with founders who feel like they're going to change the world. Sometimes I'm like, "I love the founder, don't love the idea." But every now and again, I'll meet someone who I'm like, "Holy crap, you're going to be able to change the game."

Yesterday I met with two founders who looked like they were 12 years old. I was ready to dismiss them. But after 20 minutes, I was blown away. They had thought through everything.

This is what's different now:
• 30% of kids have VR headsets
• 50% have tried them
• ESAs are spreading state by state
• Parents have seen behind the curtain

We're at the perfect storm moment. And I'm not trying to fix the system anymore—I'm funding the people who will replace it.

### Option 2: The "Hard Truth + Transformation" Combination

```Plain
An eight-year-old once looked at me and said, "If you want to leave, what are you talking about lady?"

I was 23, teaching 36 of Baltimore's lowest-performing second graders. They were right to question me—I was failing them spectacularly.

That summer, I made a decision: "I am not gonna let eight-year-olds run me out of town."

What happened next proved something that "bugged the crap out of me" for the rest of my career:

We took those same kids from the 13th percentile to grade level in two years. Not by changing their circumstances. Not with more money. But by changing "the adults who were in front of them every single day."

The playbook works. We've proven it. DC proved it again at scale—we went from worst in the nation to leading in improvement.

So why doesn't everyone do it?

Because "my boss didn't get reelected and neither did George Parker."

Because both parties benefit from failure—one gets privatization, one gets funding demands.

Because the system protects itself, not kids.

But something's shifting. Parents are done. Technology is ready. And the founders I'm meeting aren't asking permission anymore.

If you're building in this space, hit me up.
