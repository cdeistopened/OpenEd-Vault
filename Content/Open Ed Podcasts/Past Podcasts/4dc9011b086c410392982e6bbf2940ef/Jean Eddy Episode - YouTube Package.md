**Title:** Middle School is the Most Important Time You're Ignoring

**Thumbnail Text:** Their Brains Are Like Toddlers Again

Middle school isn't just awkward years to survive—it's when your child's brain is most ready to discover their future. Jean Eddy, CEO of American Student Assistance (ASA), reveals why ages 11-14 are critical for career exploration and how parents are missing this golden window.

Jean has spent over 30 years in education, transforming ASA from a college financing organization into a pioneering force for early career exploration. She believes that when kids explore their interests early—without pressure, with genuine fun—they develop the confidence and direction that leads to fulfilling careers. In this conversation, she shares why middle school brains are uniquely primed for learning, how to break free from the "college for all" trap, and what conversations actually matter at the dinner table.

Every child needs time to explore what fascinates them—without judgment, without pressure, just genuine curiosity. Sometimes the best education happens when we stop forcing and start following.
