## Cold Open: The Genius Study That Failed

### Final Cold Open

**Michael Gibson:** There's a famous study of genius... they selected about 1,500 who had an IQ of 140 or higher... But what's so interesting is who they excluded. There were two boys who took the test and didn't make the cut. One was William Shockley, who won the Nobel Prize for inventing the transistor. The other was Luis Alvarez, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics... It's a great anecdote about how the IQ test did not predict someone's ability to create novel new things.

**(PAUSE & MUSIC STING)**

**Michael Gibson:** ...And the irony is that William Shockley became obsessed with IQ.

**Why 99% of "Geniuses" Are Overlooked By The System**

Blog Title: Michael Gibson on Why 99% of "Geniuses" Are Overlooked By The System

## Description/blog

Is the modern education system designed to miss true genius? According to Michael Gibson, co-founder of the 1517 Fund, the answer is a resounding yes. In this provocative episode, Michael dismantles the myth of standardized intelligence by revealing the story of a famous 20th-century "genius study" that famously excluded two future Nobel Prize winners because their IQ scores weren't high enough.

**Michael Gibson** is the co-founder and General Partner at [1517 Fund](https://www.1517fund.com/), a venture capital firm that invests in teams led by young founders who have dropped out of college or are just starting their careers. He is the co-author of _Paper Belt on Fire_ and a leading voice in the movement for educational freedom and alternative paths to success.

He argues that our schools, obsessed with test scores and compliance, have become elaborate filtering mechanisms for good employees, not for the creative and rebellious minds who build the future. We explore why the "safe" path of an elite degree might be the riskiest choice for your child, how building things in the real world is the ultimate education, and why we must "rewild the American child" by giving them the freedom to fail, explore, and discover their own capabilities outside the classroom walls.

## Key Takeaways

- **The System Filters for the Wrong People:** Our modern "genius" filters (IQ, SATs, admissions) are designed to find good employees, not creators. They systematically reject the very people who build the future.
- **Creativity is Perishable:** Like an athletic prime, our most creative years are finite. The current system of delaying real-world experience until after college may be extinguishing our most innovative sparks before they can catch fire.
- **Playing it Safe is the Most Dangerous Path:** The "safe" path of elite institutions creates brittle, dependent adults. The truly safe path is learning to handle risk and ambiguity, which can only be done outside the classroom.
- **Building is the Ultimate Education:** A startup isn't a career path; it's a compressed, high-stakes education in reality. It teaches more about yourself and the world in one year than a decade of schooling.
- **We Must Rewild the American Child:** The modern obsession with safety and supervision is crippling our children. The solution is to let them go, let them fail, and let them discover their own capabilities without constant adult intervention.
