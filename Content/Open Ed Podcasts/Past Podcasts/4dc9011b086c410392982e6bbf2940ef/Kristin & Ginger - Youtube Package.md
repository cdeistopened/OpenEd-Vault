📍 📍 📍 am someone who actually does not love change. I really feel comfortable in the known, comfortable in what to expect. And after COVID, when I went back into a classroom setting for a few years, there was definitely a shift in me and I think that I was really exhausted.

I hit this point of like, okay, something's gotta change.
