### 💡 THOUGHT

## **NOT ALL SCREEN TIME IS CREATED EQUAL**

"We blame our kids for our issues. I've been to my kids' sporting games with parents who are in their 30s and 40s, and they're on their phone the whole time, barely watching the game."

This observation from Outschool CEO Amir Nathoo exposes a contradiction in our entire moral panic around kids and screens. While we're busy fretting about Johnny’s iPad usage, we're the ones mindlessly scrolling through Instagram during his soccer game.

"Not all screen time is created equal," Nathoo explained in our [recent conversation](https://claude.ai/chat/link-to-podcast), articulating what should be obvious but somehow isn't. "Just watching stuff on YouTube is completely different from building a virtual world or learning a tool."

When a child spends an hour passively consuming content, they emerge glassy-eyed and irritable. But after an hour building in Minecraft or taking a live online class? They're electric with ideas and possibilities.

Maybe we should worry about screen time per se, and more about wasted time and energy.

## **THE BOX IS NOW OPEN**

Education is being unbundled. Neat categories of "homeschooling" versus "traditional schooling" are being replaced by something messier, more personalized, and vastly more interesting.

"Now alternative education has blossomed to being far more than homeschooling," Nathoo explains. "You've got part-time enrollment, dual enrollment, microschools... it's harder now to identify when a family is doing it."

Nathoo calls it "networked schooling" – families assembling personalized education from multiple sources rather than outsourcing it entirely to a single institution.

"Anyone who's doing two or more education approaches simultaneously has basically opened the box," notes Morehouse. "They may just have it open a crack, but the box is closed if you're all in one school all day, every day."

Boxes, once opened, generally don’t close themselves. Once families discover they can customize their children's education – adding specialized online courses, joining co-ops, or exploring interest-based learning – there's no compelling reason to return to the standard box.

## **OUTSCHOOL: WHERE PASSION MEETS PEDAGOGY**

When Isaac's son wanted to learn Minecraft modding, neither parent knew where to start.

This is the modern parenting dilemma. Your child develops passion for something you know nothing about. You want to say yes but have no idea how.

"So I'm like, all right, we're going to sign you up for this for the next six weeks, every Friday for one hour," Morehouse recounted. After completing the course, his son could create custom Minecraft elements.

This is where Outschool shines. It's not just another edtech platform – it's a marketplace connecting kids directly with experts who are genuinely obsessed with what they teach. No curriculum committees, no standardized tests, no bureaucracy – just passionate people teaching exactly what they love.

**OpenEd families can access thousands of these live, interactive classes taught by experts who live and breathe their subjects.**

What makes the Outschool-OpenEd partnership particularly powerful:

- **Expertise on demand** — Need a fluent Spanish speaker? A Python programmer? An advanced math instructor? Access exactly the knowledge your family needs.
- **Learning that fits reality** — Schedule classes around your life, not the other way around.
- **Zero additional cost** — Classes are fully reimbursable through your OpenEd funds.

As Nathoo puts it: "It's truly exciting to think about what could happen if a generation of kids are educated by a generation of creative entrepreneurial teachers genuinely passionate about their subjects."

It's not just supplemental education – it's a glimpse of what all learning could be if we focused less on standardization and more on connecting curious minds with genuine expertise.
