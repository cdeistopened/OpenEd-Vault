Basic Summary: Parents often face the challenge of children not listening to their advice, which can be addressed through the "second person theory." This theory suggests that kids may respond better to guidance from someone other than their parents, even if the message is the same. Understanding this dynamic can help parents support their children more effectively.

**Full Transcript:**  
"it's really easy for us as parents to be like, I'm going to educate my kid and I know all the answers. And I just have experienced so many times, there are moments in my education opportunities for my kids when I've had to swallow my pride and recognize that there might be a different person that needs to be that second person in their life who's going to literally say the same things that I've said to them for the past year at school. But having a second person come in and say, here, do this, do that, it all of a sudden rings through in their ears. I call it the second person theory. It happens all the time in the world. And I feel like sometimes just as a parent, when you just are like, I'm just going to swallow my pride and see if there's somebody else who can meet my kid, needs right now."
