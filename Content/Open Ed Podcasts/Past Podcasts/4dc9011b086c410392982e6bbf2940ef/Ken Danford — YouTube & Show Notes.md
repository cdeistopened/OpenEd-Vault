**Ex-Teacher Reveals: You Don't Actually Have to Go to School**

School is OPTIONAL

  

  

### Cold Open (Final Cut)

**Ken Danford:** Kids show up thinking their parents dragged them to another principal. I sit down and say, "I’m sorry you’re miserable. Have you ever considered not going to school?" ~~They do a funny look.~~ I tell them, "We’re not a school. I’m not in charge of you. Come when you want, leave when you want. Keep your phone, keep your snacks." Nobody has ever said that to them. They look at their parents like, "This existed while I was stuck in algebra?"

**Ela Richmond:** And what about “falling behind”?

**Ken Danford:** There’s no such thing. You can learn something today or tomorrow. Missing the moment everyone else learned it doesn’t doom you. That idea is nonsense.

## Description & Show Notes

Former public school teacher Ken Danford made a radical decision 30 years ago: quit the classroom and help teenagers leave school entirely—proving that unschooling and self-directed learning produce thriving, successful adults. Through North Star, his pioneering model for teen liberation from traditional education, Danford has guided hundreds of young people toward lives of autonomy, purpose, and genuine learning freedom.
