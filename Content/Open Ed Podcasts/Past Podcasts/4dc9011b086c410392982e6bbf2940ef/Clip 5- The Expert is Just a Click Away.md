**Isaac (24:25):** "What I love about it is rather than think of it as like a Lyft or Uber or Marketplace, it's almost like YouTube, if instead of just having a passive consumption of a video, it was like, can I find a person who will walk me through live and I can ask them questions while they're going? That's Outschool."

**Isaac (24:42):** "It's just so cool that there's all these niches. Then my other daughter who wanted to learn hair braiding found someone to do a hair braiding course with her and she went through and got a mannequin head and now she's doing all kinds of different hair braids."

These clips highlight Outschool's value proposition in authentic ways that would resonate with parents looking for educational solutions, while avoiding overly promotional language that might turn viewers off.
