Katie Kimball—founder of Kids Cook Real Food and a pioneer in practical life skills education—reveals why America has fallen off the list of the world's 20 happiest countries (hint: it's our anxious teenagers).

We dive deep into the unintended consequences of helicopter parenting, why participation trophies backfired, and how teaching kids to cook, clean, and take care of themselves builds the confidence they need to thrive. Katie shares practical strategies for creating family culture, allowing low-stakes failure, and raising kids who see themselves as capable problem-solvers rather than helpless dependents.

Whether you're homeschooling, traditionally schooling, or somewhere in between, this episode will change how you think about chores, independence, and what it really means to prepare kids for adulthood.
