## Exact Transcript with Edits for Cliffhanger Clip

**Isaac:** Can you tell me what that was like? You come out, you join Teach For America, you went to the Baltimore schools. I'm guessing that this was not an easy thing to step into. When you first hit the ground running there, was it overwhelming? Give me your take, because I have to imagine there were moments where you were like, "What am I doing? Can I make it through?"

**Michelle:** I had one of the toughest first year teaching experiences probably in my core year. I was assigned to a third grade classroom at one of the worst performing elementary schools in Baltimore, Harlem Park Elementary School. ~~Actually, I started in second grade and then went to third.~~

There were four sections of second graders and they were tracked by both academics and behavior. I was assigned to track four. So I had 36 kids in my classroom and they were the lowest performing kids academically and the worst behaviorally. They freaking ate me for lunch. Some of the lowest moments of my life were in that classroom.

I remember one time I got so frustrated with the kids, I was like, "Do you want me to just leave and go teach some rich kids somewhere?" And this kid looked at me and said, "If you want to, what are you talking about lady?"

There were a couple of parents who were so savvy they pulled their kids out of my classroom. It was that bad. It was just utter chaos. Every day was just a struggle.

Even education reformers had to start somewhere. Michelle Rhee's journey from chaos to classroom control teaches us:  
  
1️⃣ Resilience matters more than perfection - sometimes you have to hit rock bottom before bouncing back  
  
2️⃣ Team teaching creates accountability and structure when you're struggling alone  
  
3️⃣ High expectations paired with consistent follow-through transform behavior over time  
  
4️⃣ Building multi-year relationships with students allows deeper impact than quick fixes
