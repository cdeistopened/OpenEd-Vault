📍 📍 📍 📍 If your kids are interested in Minecraft,  build a whole curriculum around Minecraft.

It's easier than you think, and  it will be far more successful than you can imagine.  Why?  Because you're helping your kids lean into what they're already interested in. You're speaking to them in a language that not only do they understand, but they passionately speak themselves

And so when we take the content, but we package it with context,  man, comprehension goes through the roof, retention goes through the roof,  you have those light bulb moments  where suddenly they're understanding the world around them  because the information stuck with them in a way that was more resonant

### Clip Composition

From 35:30-36:10, focusing on:  
"If your kids are interested in Minecraft, build a whole educational curriculum around Minecraft. It's easier than you think and it will be far more successful than you can imagine. Why? Because you're helping your kids lean into what they're already interested in. You're speaking to them in a language that not only do they understand, but they passionately speak themselves that they're very fluent in.

When we take the content but we package it with context, comprehension goes through the roof, retention goes through the roof, and then you have those light bulb moments where suddenly they're understanding the world around them because the information stuck with them in a way that was more resonant."

### Instagram Caption

"If your kid loves Minecraft, build an entire curriculum around it."

Not because it's a trick to get them to learn - because it actually works better.

@connorboyack explains why context (what interests them) must come before content (what you want them to learn).

This isn't a compromise. It's more effective.

### Twitter/X Caption

"If your kid is obsessed with Minecraft, that's not a distraction from education. It's the foundation for better learning."

@cboyack explains why leaning into your child's interests creates more powerful education than fighting against them.

### Facebook Caption

"If your kid is into Minecraft, build your curriculum around Minecraft."

Not as a trick to make learning palatable. Not as a compromise. But because learning built on genuine interest is exponentially more effective.

Connor Boyack explains why context must come before content, and how many educational struggles come from getting this backward.

Hot take: Your kid's Minecraft obsession is more educational than most math curricula.

Here's why traditional "math education" often fails:

- Abstract problems with no real-world context
- Memorization without understanding application
- One-size-fits-all approach ignoring individual interests
- Force-feeding concepts kids aren't ready to receive

But Minecraft? That's applied mathematics in a world they actually care about:

- Spatial reasoning and geometry
- Resource optimization and economics
- Engineering and problem-solving
- Pattern recognition and logical thinking

Connor Boyack (Tuttle Twins creator) puts it perfectly: "When you speak to kids in a language they passionately understand, comprehension and retention go through the roof."

Context before content. Interest before instruction.
