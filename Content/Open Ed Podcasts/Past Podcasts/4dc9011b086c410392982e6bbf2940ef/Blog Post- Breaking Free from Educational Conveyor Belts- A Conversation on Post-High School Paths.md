# 5 Counterintuitive Truths About Post-High School Planning That Most Parents Miss

With graduation season in full swing, many families are wrestling with the eternal question: "What's next?"

For decades, the default answer was college. But in today's economy, where four-year degrees can lead to crushing debt and uncertain job prospects, education experts are challenging this one-size-fits-all approach.

In this episode of the podcast, advisors Rose Ybaben and Danielle Randall drew from their combined 27 years of experience to share five game-changing insights that could transform your approach to post-high school planning—and potentially save your family from unnecessary stress and debt.

## 1. Discovering What You Don't Want Is Just As Valuable As Finding Your Passion

The conventional wisdom says teenagers should find their passion and pursue it relentlessly. But Rose Ybaben, an education advisor with 15 years of experience, offers a refreshing alternative: celebrate when teens discover what they _don't_ enjoy.

"A great example, my son's first job ever, he was in a mail room of this huge company. He was excited because it was a rock climbing company, right? So it was rock climbing and outdoors and he was in that mail room and was miserable," she shares. "And so I said to him, 'Great! Now you know what you don't want to do.' And that's just as important as knowing what you want to do or what you want to try."

This perspective reframes "failures" as valuable data points rather than setbacks. By encouraging teens to try different environments and being equally supportive when they discover dislikes, parents can help build a more accurate map of potential paths forward.

"The more experiences we can expose our youth to, the better," Ybaben continues. "When parent, child, and advisor come together as a team, we can always ask: 'What's the next step?'"

## 2. The Ivy League Price Tag Isn't Worth It For Most Students

Both experts challenge the assumption that prestigious colleges are necessary for success, especially given their astronomical costs.

"I want students to know you don't have to go to an Ivy League school," Ybaben states firmly. "You don't have to go somewhere where you're coming out with $100,000, $200,000 of debt because of a college degree."

She balances this perspective by acknowledging the value of higher education while expanding the definition: "Do I believe in college degrees? Yes, but I also believe in education in all sorts of forms. There's not just college—life offers an education too."

This insight is particularly relevant given that 55% of 2023 high school graduates chose alternatives to four-year degrees, while only 44% of school districts provide equal support for non-college pathways.

## 3. Adulthood Is a Series of Do-Overs, Not a Single High-Stakes Decision

Perhaps the most liberating perspective is that career paths aren't fixed or irreversible. Danielle Randall, who has 12 years of teaching experience across various school settings, shares her own nonlinear journey as proof.

"I got my undergrad in engineering and worked in industry, then went back to school because I changed my mind. I don't regret any of it," she explains. "I loved the time I spent in college doing engineering, loved the time I spent in industry, and now I love being a teacher. All those experiences were important."

The key insight? "Even if you commit to college, which seems like the ultimate decision, that isn't the end of the decisions you get to make."

This perspective takes enormous pressure off the post-high school decision by framing it as just one step in a lifelong journey rather than a permanent commitment.

## 4. Effective Planning Balances Parent Wisdom with Student Autonomy

Both experts emphasize finding the sweet spot between parental guidance and student ownership of the process.

"I've seen helicopter parents who want A, B, and C for their child, and then the resistant child says 'absolutely not,'" observes Ybaben.

Her solution is a collaborative approach: "My motto is 'together we can do it.' I always do an intake meeting with the entire family, but I refer to the student first: 'This is about you. What would you like? How do you see yourself getting there?' Then I ask the parents for their thoughts."

Randall highlights how this collaboration works in practice: "That's one of the great things about open education—there's so much room to take your kids out for different experiences and participate with them. When you as a parent see their eyes light up during an experience, that's different from pushing your own agenda. It becomes collective: 'We're figuring out what you like to do and where you want to go.'"

The most successful planning happens when parents see themselves as co-explorers rather than directors of their teen's journey.

## 5. The Most Important Question Isn't About Careers—It's About Impact

Randall suggests looking beyond just job titles to the deeper question of purpose.

"What do you want to do to make a difference? Where do you want to put your effort and your time to have an impact?" she asks. "For some people, the best approach might be to work a job that gives them the money and free time to make the difference they want."

She challenges the expectation that people should love every aspect of their work: "We put so much pressure on loving every minute of your job, but where are you making a difference? That can affect your choices."

This reframing helps teens think beyond credentials to their potential contribution—a much more meaningful foundation for decision-making.

## When to Start the Conversation

While both experts recommend beginning these discussions by ninth grade, they emphasize that it's never too late to start.

"That line of communication needs to be opened sooner than later with all families," says Ybaben. "The dialogue needs to start by ninth grade at the latest in the sense of what is it that I want my high school years to look like? What do I want to accomplish?"

Randall agrees that earlier is better but offers reassurance: "I don't think there's a time that's too late to make those goals and to reach them. Sometimes you might set a goal that's harder to reach because you're starting late, but there's many different pathways to reach those goals."

## The Bottom Line

When asked for parting advice, Randall offers a perfect summary of the entire conversation: "Recognize that when you've reached the end of one goal, there's something else to do after that. Don't look at the goal as the end—look at the goal as the next step."

Ybaben adds a final reminder about authenticity: "Be true to yourself. Find your voice, use all the support around you, and use that voice to say, 'This is who I am, and this is what I'd like to see for myself in becoming the best version of myself.'"

# TRANSCRIPT VERSION: A Conversation on Post-High School Paths

### Education advisors Rose Ybaben and Danielle Randall on why college isn't the only option, finding your unique path, and the value of discovering what you _don't_ want to do

With high school graduations on the horizon, many families are wrestling with the eternal question: "What's next?"

For decades, the answer seemed obvious—college. But in our current economy, where four-year degrees often lead to crushing debt and uncertain job prospects, many families are challenging this one-size-fits-all approach.

Recent data suggests this shift is well underway, with 55% of 2023 high school graduates choosing alternatives to four-year degrees. Meanwhile, only 44% of school districts provide equal support for non-college pathways compared to traditional tracks.

In this episode of the Open Ed podcast, host Andrea Fife speaks with Rose Ybaben, an Independent Education Advisor with 15 years of experience, and Danielle Randall, a veteran educator now supporting students at Open Ed, about how teens can forge their own paths beyond high school.

Their conversation reveals a powerful truth: the most successful post-high school journeys often diverge from society's prescribed timeline, and discovering what you don't want can be just as valuable as finding what you do.

**Andrea Fife:** Rose, you're an Independent Education Advisor and founder of Soaring to College, with a Master's in counseling from St. Mary's University and 15 years working with students of all ages. What areas do you specialize in?

**Rose Ybaben:** I specialize in advising plans for high school students and their families. We look at courses they can take during high school, extracurriculars, and create a timeline. Different things should happen during freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior years, so we develop that plan together.

We explore different educational, career, and volunteer opportunities to make the high school experience as personal as possible for every student. Then we look at whether they're considering college, employment, military, or something else. My goal is to help them find every option available.

**Andrea:** Danielle, you've been teaching secondary mathematics for almost 12 years in public, charter, and private school settings, and now support students at Open Ed pursuing state-certified diplomas. Can you share examples of students doing something particularly innovative?

**Danielle Randall:** All my students' first goal is getting that state-certified diploma, but many have really interesting things happening alongside that. I've seen great certifications in the medical field—EMTs and other areas—either as their end goal or as preparation for something bigger.

I've discovered certifications I didn't even know existed, like wildlands firefighter. That's something really cool about talking to kids about their goals—they have ideas you've never heard of. They can pursue these specialized fields and get all the experience they need while still earning their state diploma through Open Ed.

**Andrea:** This is all very timely for me personally. My own high school senior just left—even though graduation is still two weeks away—because he opened so many non-traditional doors for himself. I wrote to his administration explaining he'd be absent for the last nine days because they prepared him so well that he's already onto the next chapter.

I just put my 18-year-old on a plane to accept a paid position across the country in a field he worked hard to enter. When he returns, he has a paid surveyor position at an engineering firm lined up for his gap year before starting at a local university to study engineering. Watching my son forge his own path has been so inspiring.

When do you typically start working with students and families on their post-high school goals? Is there an ideal timeline?

**Rose:** That line of communication needs to be opened sooner rather than later—by ninth grade at the latest. The dialogue should explore what they want their high school years to look like and what they want to accomplish. Do they want to be a traditional student? Pursue dual enrollment? Graduate with an associate's degree? The opportunities are limitless.

I break it into four years and look at what we can accomplish each year. Including both parents and students in this conversation from the beginning is crucial.

**Danielle:** I agree that earlier is better when planning for a state-certified diploma. It gives us time to spread out workloads, ensure we're getting all the necessary experiences, and avoid cramming things at the end.

But I don't think it's ever too late to set goals and work toward them. Sometimes you might set a goal that's harder to reach because you're starting late, but there are many different pathways available.

**Andrea:** How do you help a student who feels uncertain when people start asking what they're going to do next? Especially considering we're talking about 14 or 15-year-olds when starting in ninth grade.

**Danielle:** I love getting to know the student first. What do they like doing? If they had a spare hour or two, what would they do with it? If that's what they enjoy, let's head in that direction. There are so many options in any field.

Some kids come in with very specific ideas, but when you introduce them to other possibilities in the same pathway, they discover exciting alternatives. Someone might say "I want to be a doctor," but that opens conversations about what that means and what other opportunities exist in healthcare.

**Rose:** I completely agree. We need to meet students exactly where they are and help them understand that what they decide now isn't permanent. This is about self-discovery—learning what they enjoy and what they don't.

There are excellent self-assessments available that examine strengths, challenges, and how these relate to career goals. For example, if someone has business strengths, we can explore whether that means accounting, finance, marketing, or supply chain management. Then we look at the educational pathways and work experience needed for each direction.

We need to be gentle with 14 and 15-year-olds and sometimes with first-time parents going through this process. There is no one path—flexibility is key.

**Andrea:** What gets you most excited when talking to students about options they might not have considered on their own?

**Rose:** The variety of options excites me most. Society places these norms on adolescents that it's high school, college, work—but that's not the case. There are military options, technical schools, internships, shadowing opportunities.

Let's expose them to these possibilities while they're young and excited, when they can say, "That was fantastic! I loved it!" or alternatively, "That wasn't for me." Both reactions provide valuable information.

A great example: my son's first job was in the mailroom of a huge rock climbing company. He was excited about the outdoor industry, but he was miserable in the mailroom. I said, "Great! Now you know what you don't want to do." That's just as important as knowing what you want to do.

The more experiences we can expose our youth to, the better. When parent, child, and advisor come together as a team, we can always ask: "What's the next step?"

**Danielle:** I have similar conversations. It's rewarding when a student is struggling and I can say, "This isn't the only way." When families realize there's something else that might fit better, those are fantastic moments—even if it means they leave my homeroom and I don't get to follow their journey.

**Andrea:** I love the reframing of "now you know what you don't want to do." I just read an article about how society has created this expectation that if you don't stick with something forever, you've failed. The article gave examples of things we accidentally label as failures—like choosing to pivot in a different direction.

We sometimes do this to high school students. We say they're on a path, and then if they change direction, we may accidentally imply they've failed. Reframing it as valuable learning that nobody can take away from them is powerful. I'm going to incorporate that into my parenting and conversations with students.

**Rose:** Absolutely. When one door closes, another window opens. Every dead end is a chance to look right or left and ask: "Now what?" That opens a whole new set of opportunities.

**Andrea:** We often set goals that are difficult to achieve. How do you tell the difference between hard work that's worth pushing through versus perhaps being on the wrong path?

**Rose:** That's a great question. I think we all have to face ourselves in the mirror sometimes. Open communication between student, parent, and support system is key.

Sometimes hard work leads to success, which motivates you to work harder. Other times, hard work leads to a dead end, which might make you give up—or reevaluate and ask "what next?" These adolescent years are challenging, but with guidance and support, we can help them take that next step.

**Danielle:** There's a difference in how hard work feels when it's fulfilling versus when you're doing it just because you have to. If you feel the work has lost its spark and you're doing it out of duty or just because you set the goal, maybe it's not the right path anymore.

One advantage of internships, job shadowing, and certifications is that they let you keep one foot in your big goal while working toward it. If you're doing an internship and still find it exciting to participate in that field, then the steps to get there will feel more worthwhile because you know what awaits you is still what you want.

**Andrea:** As a parent, I want to support my student while ensuring they remain in the driver's seat of their goals. What's the right balance?

**Danielle:** That's one of the great things about open education—there's so much room to take your kids out for different experiences and participate with them. When you as a parent see their eyes light up during an experience, that's different from pushing your own agenda. It becomes collective: "We're figuring out what you like to do and where you want to go." That's possible when education is more self-paced and less rigid.

**Rose:** Collectiveness is key. My motto is "together we can do it." I've seen helicopter parents who want A, B, and C for their child, and then the resistant child says "absolutely not."

I always do an intake meeting with the entire family, but I refer to the student first: "This is about you. What would you like? How do you see yourself getting there?" Then I ask the parents for their thoughts. I try to find common ground between the two parties and set up a plan, knowing we'll meet again and it will probably change—and that's okay.

**Andrea:** Tell me about students who feel like they're following society's timeline because it's what they're "supposed to do." How would you encourage them to consider other options?

**Rose:** Those uncomfortable conversations need to happen. We need to help them question what society says they must do next. Look at college costs today—it's heartbreaking. Students don't have to go to an Ivy League school or graduate with $100,000-$200,000 of debt.

Do I believe in college degrees? Yes, but I also believe in education in all sorts of forms. Maybe I should change my company name to "Soaring to College and Beyond," because it's not just college. Life offers an education—what piece of that do we want to take and run with?

**Danielle:** When I sense that students are pursuing a diploma just because they think they have to, I ask, "Why? Why are you on this path? Where do you think it's going to get you?" If I get that deer-in-headlights look—"Isn't this what I'm supposed to be doing?"—then we can have a great conversation about all the options.

So many people believe it's high school diploma, college, then job. But how many people change majors in college? I got my undergrad in engineering and worked in industry, then went back to school because I changed my mind. I don't regret any of it. I loved my time in engineering, loved my time in industry, and now I love being a teacher. All those experiences were important.

Even if you commit to college, which seems like the ultimate decision, that isn't the end of the decisions you get to make.

**Andrea:** That's what I've been telling my recent graduate—how exciting it is to enter adulthood because it's filled with do-over after do-over. You can try anything you want. There are limitations, mostly financial, but if you can figure out the money piece, adulthood is one adventure after another, pursuing whatever learning you want for the rest of your life.

I keep telling him not to box himself in. He has this great opportunity at an engineering firm before starting his university program, and I've said, "Wouldn't it be amazing if you opened so many doors in that first year that the university program actually looks like a terrible option because you've had so many great opportunities come your way?"

That door will always be open—universities are always happy to accept learners at any point in life. It's so exciting to see college as an opportunity, not an obligation.

**Danielle:** Another great question to ask is: "What do you want to do to make a difference? Where do you want to put your effort and time to have an impact?" For some people, the best approach might be to work a job that gives them the money and free time to make the difference they want.

We put so much pressure on loving every minute of your job that it can be shocking to realize there are parts of your chosen career that are still challenging or feel like hoop-jumping. But where are you making a difference? That can affect your choices.

**Rose:** I completely agree. We're physical, social, emotional, and spiritual beings. Finding what fills each part of us is important. Work can fill a piece, volunteering can fill another, education another. It's about understanding where we become the best version of ourselves.

**Andrea:** If someone wants to work with professionals like you, Rose, what does that process look like?

**Rose:** I primarily use my website as a marketing tool, and I get referrals from the high school where I used to work. People typically reach out during sophomore or junior year saying, "We're not sure what to do about college, or if we even want to go to college."

We schedule a free 20-minute consultation with both parent and student to determine what they're looking for and what they find stressful or helpful. Then we develop a personalized plan. I offer hourly consultations or comprehensive packages where we examine strengths and challenges, create college/school/internship lists, and work through the process until they reach their goal. Everything is individualized to what works best for the family.

**Andrea:** For families excited about doing something different even in high school, OpenEd will have a virtual K-12 option available. I'm most excited about the high school component because we're putting students at the center of their own accredited diploma experience. They'll work directly with our counselors to design what their high school experience looks like while opening doors to their future.

If you could share one last piece of advice to students facing big life decisions, what would it be?

**Danielle:** Recognize that when you've reached the end of one goal, there's something else to do after that. Don't look at the goal as the end—look at it as the next step.

**Rose:** Be true to yourself. Find your voice, use all the support around you, and use that voice to say, "This is who I am, and this is what I'd like to see for myself in becoming the best version of myself."
