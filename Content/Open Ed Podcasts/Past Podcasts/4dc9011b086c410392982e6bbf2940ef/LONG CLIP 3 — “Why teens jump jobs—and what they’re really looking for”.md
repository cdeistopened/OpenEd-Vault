**Michelle Rhee:**

I keep hearing this from young people: “My job is just how I make money. My purpose is elsewhere.”

That’s so different from how our generation was raised—to find a career that gives you meaning.

**Michael Horn:**

There’s actually data behind this. People switch jobs not for passion—but for progress.

But they don’t define what progress means, so they often end up just as unfulfilled.

In the Great Resignation, 100 million people quit their jobs. Within 6 months, 75% regretted the move.

**Isaac Morehouse:**

We’ve lost our cultural muscle for sticking with something.

I’ve seen this with job seekers—once they get offers, they don’t want to say yes. They want to keep all the options open.

Sometimes doing one thing—just sticking with it—is better than jumping again.

**Michael Horn:**

There’s no perfect job. Every role has trade-offs.

We need to teach young people how to weigh trade-offs intentionally.

Don’t quit just because it’s hard. Learn what you’re solving for.

**Isaac Morehouse:**

I say this to my son all the time. He’s had jobs he wanted to quit.

A few questions later, he decides to stick it out.

A month later—he loves it. He gets through the hard part and realizes it was worth it.

**Michael Horn:**

Exactly. We need to talk less about ideal paths and more about durable decisions.

Knowing when to stay, when to move, and why—that’s the real skill.
