**[TITLE CARD: "3 REASONS WHY ENTERTAINERS MAKE THE BEST MARKETERS"]**

It's really not that hard to train a marketer, but it's really hard to train an entertainer. And so we actually found we would go out and we would hire comedians, improv comedians or standup comedians.

**[DING - SHOW "1" + CAPTION: "Marketing is mechanical, entertainment is nuanced"]**

Marketing's actually not that hard. You provide value, you present the problem, you show a solution, you build some credibility, you overcome some concerns. You have a call to action. It's almost mechanical. It's almost, you're following a recipe, but the entertainment side of it. That is much more nuanced.

**[DING - SHOW "2" + CAPTION: "Audiences aren't captive anymore"]**

Whether it's a skip button on YouTube or just a scroll right past on Facebook or Instagram or whatever else, you have to earn people's attention. 'Cause you know. They're not captive. They can go right by. And so when you think through that, I actually have to earn people's attention. And the way that I do that is I have to entertain them. I have to make them smile. I have to make them laugh. I have to provide value.

**[DING - SHOW "3" + CAPTION: "Entertainment earns attention before sales"]**

When you look back over our history at Harmon Brothers and kind of the campaigns that we became famous for, right? You've got Poopourri and Squatty Potty and Purple mattresses. Kind of the common thread is that they were fun. They put a smile on your face. Yes, they were effective as an ad. They sold a product, they earned money. But that was all after we earned attention and put a smile on people's faces.

- Position captions so they don't block Benton's face
- Quick, energetic cuts between sections
- Consider slight zoom or motion on each ding for emphasis
