- Hands-on learning: "I want our kids to touch it, taste it, feel it, and do it."
- Gender disparity in aviation: "If you look at the pilots in America, 6.8 percent are women. 1.6 percent are black. Hispanics don't even register."
- Goal for diversity: "I would love to double those percentages before I kick the bucket."
- Rapid program growth: From 14 students in the first class to impacting over 1,300-1,400 students in three states.
- Job opportunities in aerospace: "There's so many job opportunities, and these are incredibly well paying jobs."
- Success story: Ella, a homeschooled student who "soloed at 14 in gliders" and by 18 had "a commercial Pilots license, her instructor license and her instrument license."
- Career potential: Ella was offered a job "starting her at a hundred thousand a year, no college. Just come teach these kids how to fly."
- Accessibility: "When you live out in the country, that's what people do. They drive to the population centers."

These key points and quotes capture the trend of increasing interest and opportunities in aerospace education, as well as the push for greater diversity in the field.

  

  

  

**Mark Hyatt:** [00:00:00] I want our kids to touch it, taste it, feel it, and do it. what I've seen in K 12 education is they get to learn about it because the school district lawyers are much more comfortable with them sitting in a classroom. but the kids.

especially boys need action. We want to get out and do things. lots of girls do too. we have 75 percent boys right now. I'm trying to get more and more girls. We have about 25%. if you look at the pilots in America, 6.

8 percent are women. 1. 6 percent are black. Hispanics don't even register. I would love. To double those percentages before I kick the bucket. That's one of my little agendas here because The airplane doesn't care the spaceship doesn't care as long as you can do the job

and so I try to find the role models for these, underrepresented groups and really get them in front of kids. And there are really good role models. the sky's the limit. I just think the reason AeroLab has grown from seven [00:01:00] summers ago, to now, from, 14 students in our first class, and we now are going to be impacting over 13 to 1, 400 students in three states.

We'll add Arizona this fall. But I would love to, to take this nationwide

**Isaac:** Absolutely, our mission is to help parents Open up their kids education to all the options on the table and to be able to pick choose and combine take things Like falcon arrow labs and say hey, This is a great building block in my kids education things like this you may never have thought were possible.

so much of what a child or a parent does is shaped by what they believe is possible. most people haven't been exposed to aviation, most people don't have a friend who flies a plane. so they haven't had that exposure. They don't even know it's among the option sets.

And what you said when we opened up, This is a industry that there's so many job opportunities, and these are incredibly well paying jobs. I lived in Charleston, South Carolina for a while, and there was a Boeing facility there building the [00:02:00] Dreamliners, they couldn't find enough people.

They couldn't hire enough. And these are amazing jobs. a lot of people don't know that or don't know where to start. So, I think it's just incredibly exciting. what is something that maybe you have like a specific story or something of, of a student or a couple of different stories, maybe like unlikely, unlikely successes or, unexpected outcomes for getting kids exposed to aeronautics.

**Mark Hyatt:** Okay. My number two is an amazing woman who homeschooled her four kids she's married to a farmer and they live about two and a half hours Southeast of Colorado Springs, towards the Kansas Oklahoma border. Somehow Sarah, the mom found out about us and her 12 year old daughter, the oldest of the four kids, I had the privilege of giving her one of her first airplane rides.

I think it was her second ride because I arranged for the first and then I took her in my airplane. she then got in our program. She was in our first class. of kids. she was 12 turned 13. we started expanding aero labs. we started a glider [00:03:00] program, IFT, introductory flight training gliders.

And now we have IFT drones where they get their FA part 107 drone and we get them jobs and drones. We have pilot IFT powered where we get them airline jobs, commercial jobs. So Ella. the young lady, her mom drove her two and a half hours to Colorado Springs from the farm down towards Lamar, Colorado.

she soloed at 14 in gliders and she was like the most excited 14 year old that exists on the planet. So then she said, this is what I want to do. So we got her in as a 15 year old and 16 year old. She soloed in powered airplanes at 16 and we kept her going and she got a commercial Pilots license, her instructor license and her instrument license at 18.

She was immediately offered. they asked her to come down to Pueblo, Colorado, where they train the air force cadets after they graduate from the air force academy, starting her at a hundred thousand a year, no college. Just come teach these kids how to fly. they're all college grads.

We [00:04:00] don't care that you're not, but you're a really good pilot. And I've flown with her a lot. She's an amazing pilot, an amazing instructor. And that's just one example not every mom is willing to drive their kids two and a half hours. But when you live out in the country, that's what people do.

They drive to the population centers. Colorado Springs is the number two city in Colorado. This is where I live. So this is where we started and now we're expanding it and doing this for lots more young people. So that's a pretty good story.
