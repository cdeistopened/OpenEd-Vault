### Full Script:

**[THE SETUP]**  
"George Washington, before he became president, before he became general, before he became a legend. As a young man, 22 years old, he was sent out to the Ohio territory to tell the French to leave.

'Cause at that point it hadn't been fully claimed yet by the French nor the British. But the French were kind of setting up camp and whatnot. And so the British were like, well, we need them to leave. And so they sent young George Washington as a young military officer out to tell the French to leave and the interaction goes horribly wrong.

**[THE DISASTER]**  
I'm not gonna, you know, spoil the story here and share all the details, but basically George screws up in the worst possible ways and accidentally sets off a global war. It accidentally kicks off the French and Indian War, which globally was known as the seven year war. Massive blunder, you know, career destroying type mistakes here.

**[THE REDEMPTION]**  
And this is a story about how George goes from hitting rock bottom and making the worst possible mistakes to turning that around in this character defining moment where he ends up in a battle where he's serving under General Braddock and General Braddock is killed and things are going terribly wrong, and George needs to lead an evacuation.

He basically needs to get his troops out of there and so he mounts a horse and charges the enemy lines. He ends up with three bullet holes in his coat and a couple more in his hat. Has two horses shot out from underneath him. He goes unscathed, and he gets the troops together, executes a successful retreat, saves hundreds of lives, and basically in this moment, proves his bravery, his valor, and he becomes, this is the beginning of the legendary George Washington.

**[WHY THIS MATTERS NOW]**  
I feel like both extremes are dangerous. Right? You know, on the one extreme where if you just focus on, oh man, George Washington was so amazing, he was a legend, blah, blah, blah. People aren't gonna be inspired by that. They're gonna feel like, oh, I'll never live up to that, you know, and that's not me.

Whereas on the flip side, like, you know, you go back to 2020 when all the monuments were being torn down and stuff and you know, like, this idea of like, hey, these guys were imperfect, they owned slaves, therefore they were dirt bags. Therefore we should tear down their monument and we should erase them from history.

That's dangerous too, right? It's really important in my opinion, to acknowledge that they were flawed human beings. They were imperfect. They made major mistakes. But despite all that, they also made massive contributions to set up what we now benefit from. And I think that's so much more inspiring, you know, for my 14-year-old son to hear a story where he is like, man, that guy really screwed up. But then he turned it around and he was still brave and he was heroic. And I want my son to know that, like, despite being a human, despite being weak, despite having flaws, I can still be brave. I can still swing for the stars and try to do something big, try to do something heroic. I think that's a really important message."
