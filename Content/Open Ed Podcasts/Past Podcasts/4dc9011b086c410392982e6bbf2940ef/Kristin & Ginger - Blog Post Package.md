### Final Cold Open: The Undoing Process

**Kristin:** It's going to take for however many years you're in a system, it's going to take that many months to actually shed everything off before you can rebuild it back up, right? So I was coming out with 18 years of teaching. I needed to give myself 18 months.

(Swoosh)

**Kristin:** As a conventional teacher, you are taught to be so like, efficiency drives the system. And play just doesn't—it's not efficient. If I took my kids outside for an extra recess, gosh, I just felt like I'd be judged. Like, my kids are not working enough.

(Swoosh)

**Kristin:** There's such a currency that's required in play. And that's just not honoring that play is actually the heavy hitter when it comes to skills. Play is the job of kids.

The Hardest Part of Leaving Traditional School

After years in conventional classrooms, teachers Kristin and Ginger felt the burnout creeping in. The system's relentless focus on grades, efficiency, and "measuring sticks" was crushing their love for teaching. So they took a leap and built their dream school from scratch.

In this conversation, they share the vulnerable story of starting Scola Microschool—a place built on three pillars: being outside, meeting kids where they are, and fostering deep community. They also reveal their groundbreaking "Four Categories of Play," a framework that turns unstructured time into a powerful tool for understanding child development.

This episode is a must-listen for parents and educators who feel like there has to be a better way. It’s a story about the courage to let go of old systems and the magic that happens when you do.

## Full Transcript

**Ela Richmond (00:00)**  
Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. I'm your sometimes host, Ela, and today I'm joined by Kristin and Ginger of the Scola Microschool. I'm so excited to have this conversation and shed light on the microschool side of open education—what is happening in this world, how Scola was started, and what it has done for your community. Welcome to the podcast.

**Kristin & Ginger (00:22)**  
Thanks, Ela, for having us. We appreciate it.

**Ela Richmond (00:26)**  
Okay, so just dive straight in. What is your story? How did you even get started with microschools? Were you an educator ahead of time? Were you a mom? Where did you start?

**Kristin (00:36)**  
Yeah, good question. Both Ginger and I are moms. We also were educators, mostly in a private school conventional classroom. We worked together really closely, and I think that matters as part of our story. We knew each other's giftings. We're pretty opposite people who are just really appreciative of the other person's skill set and learned how to work together that way.

When we started Scola in 2022, if I'm being really honest, it's probably a seed that started in my master's program, possibly even a little bit longer than that. I tend to be a creative thinker, engineer, inventor, big-picture type of personality—like, let's blow it up and just see what happens. And Ginger is practical, like, "What's the next step?" and, "Okay, let's just try to get one thing done today." Together, our skill set was really powerful and important in getting Scola started.

I got my master's degree in educational leadership before I had my two kids. I was a middle school teacher. I loved middle school. I loved the creativity I got to have in my classroom. And then I think there were two motivations for me. One was my own children, just seeing how my daughter and my son were different and probably needed different things from schooling. But second was obviously teaching through COVID and just knowing that there were some constraints in the conventional classroom that I had always felt, but those were put under fire. It was a ridiculously hard but also very fruitful time to teach. I was the optimist that was like, "Something good can come out of this." And it was just the right time to let the seed of Scola actually start to take root. So we put legs on it and a framework around it in the fall of 2021 and opened our doors in September of 2022.

**Ela Richmond (03:08)**  
How many students did you start with?

**Kristin (03:10)**  
Yeah, that's a good question. When we originally started to shape our school, we wanted 24. We both really wanted to stay teaching, and effective teaching was a common big theme for us. With effective teaching, you always have to talk about student-to-teacher ratios, right? So we thought 24 was the right number. We didn't start with that. We started with 16. It grew to 18, then it grew to 23, and now we have between 30 and 35 students, but with three teachers involved. I think we found a good sweet spot.

**Ela Richmond (04:00)**  
Wow. Paint the picture of how it started. I mean, it seems easy to teach a lot of kids, especially if you're a teacher, but then you get into the weeds and I bet there were a lot of challenges you didn't expect.

**Ginger (04:18)**  
Ella, that's a great question. I'm just going to go back a little bit. Kristin and I were teaching together for years, and there was a moment before Scola was a dream that I put on a post-it—I don't even know if Kristin remembers this—I put, "Kristin, you need to start a school and I'll come work for you."

Fast forward years later, post-COVID, and COVID was a catalyst for something different. I am someone who actually does not love change. I really feel comfortable in the knowing, in what to expect. And after COVID, when I went back into a classroom for a few years, there was definitely a shift in me. I was really exhausted. COVID, with the technology and all the things involved, just took a lot out of me. Going back into the classroom, I recognized our students have shifted. They are not the same.

I think there was just some exhaustion and I was close to burnout. I'm like, "Okay, something needs to change," because I still loved teaching. I got my master's in educational leadership and I hit this point of, "Okay, something's gotta change. I wanna stay in education." Kristin and I would meet and go on walks, and that's when she started sharing the idea of Scola with me. And I'm like, "That's a great idea for you. Yes, you could totally do this." And slowly but surely, it just came to be that I would come alongside and help start Scola. It was that exhaustion that led me to the "yes." Like, "Okay, something's gotta change. I think this is it." So I just embraced it.

We were both working full time, so to get Scola off the ground, we would meet on Saturdays and make a checklist. The first question was, "What type of a school are we going to be? Private? Charter? Homeschool?"

**Kristin (06:50)**  
On our Saturday morning meetings, we had to come up with those big questions. Who do we want to be? What's going to rise to the top? You realize quickly you can't be all the things. In fact, that was part of why we were leaving. The demands of our current situation were just piling up and there wasn't any meaningful subtraction. So we were like, "Okay, let's start with a clean slate."

That was way more vulnerable than it sounds. You're giving up pieces of your identity, pieces of what you prided yourself in. I even tear up just thinking about how much courage it took to be like, "Okay, all the measuring sticks I had about being a good teacher? I'm actually going to lay these down." Now, they might be good, we might pick them back up again, but let's just at least try to start with a clean slate. What's actually important to us?

It was so nice to have space to let the important things rise to the top.

1. We knew that we wanted to be **outside more often**. We wanted movement. And outside is more than just outside; it's kids connected to their space, it's part of teacher health, it's natural, good things happening.
2. We really wanted to **meet students where they were at**. We wanted to take the pace pressure off. We had to take words like "gifted," "talented," "accelerated," "behind," "ahead"... and I still catch myself sometimes, those things are really embedded. But meeting students where they're at, giving them an authentic learning sweet spot.
3. Third, we really wanted a **social-emotional component**. To us, that means community. Friendship, relationship skills. How do we interact with our neighbor? We want to be part of a neighborhood. We want that veil between school and community to mesh a little bit more.

Those were the three things that floated to the top. And then every choice after that... this sounds super clear in retrospect, but in the middle of it, we just had a commitment to let these things be our North Star. That led to how many students we want, what type of organizational structure we'd be. Technically, we are a nonprofit that serves homeschool families. That is satisfying the law in Minnesota right now. It may change, and we'll learn to pivot. So we sound like a school, we breathe like a school, but technically we are a nonprofit that serves homeschool families. All those basic decisions—budget, materials, calendar—we made on these Saturday mornings, but these three things were always leading the way.

**Ela Richmond (11:51)**  
That makes sense. It's fascinating that it started with the sentiment question: How do we increase and better the sentiment of teachers and students? Were you all ever afraid? You said that you let go of all these measuring sticks you had used for so long. Was it hard in the beginning to be like, "Okay, but what if we let them go outside more often? Are we still serving the purpose that we are hoping to serve?"

**Ginger (12:38)**  
Absolutely. I think there was some apprehension on my end. Part of it was having each other. I trust that between the two of us, what's going to happen is actually best for students. And research backs that up. Research backs up that play is so important, that kids need to feel safe, seen, and connected in order to learn. So I think there was some fear, but all of those other things outweighed the fear. Also, the first time we got paid, our first paycheck was reassuring to myself and my husband. It's like, "Okay, yes, we are getting paid for this."

This is my 26th year of teaching, so I've had touchpoints with pretty much K through 8th grade. I know where kids need to be when they leave first grade, when they leave eighth grade. I feel confident in knowing where kids need to be and supporting them to get there. So there was a level of confidence and excitement that outweighed the fear.

That first day... part of me wishes we would have recorded it for our sake. We really did start with bare bones. What does it look like to really see kids and build a program around what they need? We started without a lot of the structure we typically have in the classroom. And slowly but surely, we started adding components back. So if you come in on a typical morning, you'll see three different small groups, and you'll see components of a typical classroom, except kids are working independently and you have multi-age students working on different things. You still see that structure.

**Ela Richmond (15:32)**  
That's so fascinating. Have you seen a sentiment change in your students? What has the reaction been to this more flexible type of learning?

**Kristin (15:49)**  
Well, we have two types of students. You have students that have been in different institutions that come to Scola, and you have students that have been here since kindergarten, for whom Scola is their only framework for education. For our kids who have been in other institutions, just like there had to be some undoing for us, there is this undoing process for them.

Our admissions process tries to honor that it's going to take some time to shed the old in order to try on the new thing. Early on, we listened to a lot of podcasts, trying to fill our backpack with inspiration. We heard this quote: "For however many years you're in a system, it's going to take that many months to actually shed everything off before you can rebuild." I was coming out with 18 years of teaching, so I needed to give myself 18 months. That's like two years of undoing these things.

Again, the unique group here is the kids who start in Scola and that's all they know. They're going to walk into a traditional school building for a sports practice and _that's_ going to feel weird. Then we have students coming from a homeschool situation, and this is actually _more_ structured than what they're used to, so they have a different learning curve. The hard part is usually the shift in where the pressure points are, or where all the measuring sticks went.

**Ela Richmond (18:51)**  
Is there a sentiment difference between the students you used to teach and the students at Scola? I'm curious, because all the research says play and flexibility are so important. When you do that, what does it look like in the classroom?

**Ginger (19:18)**  
Absolutely. As educators, we've always had the philosophy of seeing the whole child. But in typical classical education, academics gets the majority of the focus. In this space, academics is important, but kids are confident because we've shed the old ways. We understand, "Okay, this is important, but who you are as an image-bearer of God is _most_ important." This is how we're going to see each other. When kids learn that, and they start to see each other in their unique giftings, there's a confidence that allows them to be vulnerable and make mistakes in ways that I couldn't tap into when I had 26 students and was being evaluated on getting them from point A to point B.

The pressure for our students is off, and the pressure for us is off to fully see them. We have progress reports, but we don't do letter grades, even in middle school. We look at where students should be for their grade level, and then we have a narrative side that gets into social skills and play. The narrative is most important because we're small. We get to really know students and come alongside them in a way I've never had the ability to do before.

And that correlates with getting to know the families. Families are our number one. Mom and dad are in the driver's seat. It is a partnership. In real-time, if a question comes up, I can give mom and dad a call or a quick text. To have this real-time understanding of what's going on socially and emotionally with a child—I cannot overemphasize the value of that. When it comes to academics, our students will face challenging moments. There is a grit that's required. And I think our students are able to tap into that grit because these other things, which are actually more important, have been checked.

**Ela Richmond (23:38)**  
Has the way that Scola is structured, versus a traditional approach, changed the way that students and parents think about education? Has it changed their relationship with learning?

**Kristin (24:32)**  
Yeah, that's really interesting. For so many families, mine included at one point, the relationship with school was actually about the outcome and the grades. That's where everyone—teachers, learners, parents—was prioritizing. Everyone was _trying_ not to. There were huge efforts to say, "It's not about the grade," but the current was so strong that no matter how hard you tried, it still was so much time, so much money, so much emphasis put on the grade.

So I think we're still trying to find the right words for what shifts. Outcomes will happen, but when you put more time and investment in the process, there's just a different posture towards outcomes. And a different posture towards what learning can look like.

**Ela Richmond (25:56)**  
I find that fascinating because in every other aspect of our lives, we understand that's true. In something as simple as working out or our marital relationships, we understand that everything becomes true in the moment. The habit of choosing your husband, the habit of showing up to the gym—all of that matters so much more than a physique or a weight. It will come. But it's funny because from a school perspective, we all just focus on the outcome as opposed to nurturing the moment. It's unreasonable to assume that if we do that consistently for five-plus years, the outcome won't be good.

**Kristin (26:56)**  
I mean, Ella, now you're getting into a philosophy podcast here. The _telos_, the main component of why we educate, has shifted. And we all kind of see the historical benefit of that. I don't want to get too deep into that, because I want everyone to have access to this. And that might mean we have to shift some things or create schools that as many people as possible have access to. That's where our dream is. We love Scola, but we do get frustrated. How could every kid have this opportunity? We see the limitations in what we've built.

**Ginger (28:00)**  
Just tapping a little bit on access. Our heart's desire is that every kid has access to a meaningful education where they are taught by healthy educators, their needs are being met, and they're learning. Thankfully, in the Twin Cities, we have access to lots of different choices. There are thriving public schools, great charter schools, wonderful private schools, and microschools popping up. But again, being a tuition-driven school, not everybody has access. So access is really important. We don't have a solution to that, but we are thankful to live in a place where there are options.

And this ties back to your question of how this changes people's posture. When we speak about teacher health, our families have started really caring about it. We talk about it a lot. Our school is better when we stay healthy and effective. And we encourage people—some of our families have students in more than one school model—how can you help the health of teachers in other schools? Effective, healthy teachers make a significant impact on the education of your neighborhood, of your city. The reach of an effective teacher can go a long, long way. We are pro-education. We don't plan to be in competition with anyone. We want more healthy options, more sustainable schools, more healthy teachers. We're doing our little micro part here, but we want to be in a positive relationship with school districts, learn from them, and help this whole thing grow.

**Ela Richmond (31:22)**  
I fully agree. That's the whole concept of open education. Every student needs something a little bit different. How do you find exactly what a student needs? And how do we increase options for families? You mentioned some families do lots of different models of education at once. What does that look like? And how would you recommend people find the approach that works for their kids?

**Kristin & Ginger (32:09)**  
Good question. For parents doing different models, there is a cost. These parents are keeping track of different calendars, different start times, different end times. There is a frazzled approach. We try to support them, but they are leading in the posture of being less concerned with an outcome and more concerned about the wellbeing and growth of their kid. It really is the privilege of being able to see each child as an individual and recognize, "This kid is thriving in this institution, but this kid is not. What are some other options?"

As for how to pick the right model, convenience is a really strong factor. We had some good school years where our top value was just picking the convenient option. My kids were okay, and we supplemented. I do think it's about tapping into your kids' motivation. What gets them motivated? One thing that has been really cool, but has taken time, is that student motivation in my previous classrooms was really dependent on me. In the way we've structured Scola, it has shifted the motivation onto students a lot more. They still need us for an on-ramp, for direct instruction, for feedback. But there are many times, several times a week, where suddenly there are 32 different things going on in this room, and we just stare at each other and go fill up our coffee. We bask in it, because this is the teacher's dream. This is us doing our job in the way we love doing our job. It's this level of student independence, student motivation. They have the right resources and they get to drive it. Now, those moments don't last the whole day, but it's a lot more like gardening. It's a tending job, more than a "drive the train" type of job.

**Ginger (36:00)**  
Going back to what we'd say to parents trying to pick the right fit... when we meet with parents of kids going into kindergarten, we just try to put them at ease. There's this pressure: "I have to get it right." So, especially for kindergarten parents, just putting that pressure off. We say, "Here's what you can expect at Scola." When you're looking at institutions, try to get physically in the building during a typical school day. You can get a sense of the culture. Can you see your child in the hallways? In this classroom? I recommend parents get in for a tour and trust their gut. When it comes to standardized tests, I recommend looking at that, but it should not be the driving factor. There are so many things behind the scenes. I would put that lower on the list.

**Ela Richmond (38:02)**  
That makes sense. I wonder about student motivation. There's natural motivation, but then there's motivation by osmosis, where a student is around other students or a family member they look up to. How do you help a kid foster those motivations?

**Kristin (39:00)**  
I think Ginger's so good at this. I've learned a lot from her about how to ask kids what they're proud of. There is something about specific praise, really helping kids feel internally proud. A lot of this comes from teaching kids about emotions, about the way they feel, even frustration. Having them aware of those things is a huge part of motivation. Students have to recognize what "proud" even feels like—not because someone else told them it was good, but because _they_ feel proud.

**Ginger (40:35)**  
My mind goes to teaching kids that intrinsic motivation. It's not about them making me proud; it's about them feeling accomplished for the work they've done. In my small group, a kid might finish ten math problems in 20 minutes, and another kid might finish one. We've set up a culture where, whether it's one or ten, you get to feel proud. I'll notice that kiddo who finished one problem, but he focused and stuck with it. I'll say, "Hey, how does that make you feel? Look at what you did on your own."

Working in a multi-age group, they get to bring that out in each other. They're not in a hurry. There isn't one student getting the gold star. They learn to coach each other, not just give an answer. It's really special. I can just picture that kid who comes up to me, so excited because they did X, Y, Z, and just turning that around with a big smile on my face and saying, "How does that make you feel?"

"I feel so excited! Look what I did!"

"Why don't you go share that with your teammate at your table?"

It takes intentional reframing. The teacher is not the center. They're not doing this for me. It's about establishing the habit, the process, the learning, and feeling that feeling so that when they try something new tomorrow, they remember what it felt like.

**Ela Richmond (43:08)**  
That is huge. It is so easy as a parent or a teacher to be the person they turn to for validation. But it's so important for it not to be the end of it, for it to be, "I am so happy for you, you should also be happy for you." Creating that line between "this is not just about pleasing me" and "this is about doing something inherently good." I've never heard that before, but it's a subtle thing that's so important.

**Kristin (44:11)**  
Yeah, well, it's the adult paycheck world, too. We do this for the paycheck, but also because of the good work that's done in me and that I can do for other people. There's a lot of research on motivation. We're probably more the labs, hands-on, experiencing these things. We may not have all the scientific words, but you can see that kids go in and out of different types of motivations. When you know a student, when you are known and belong, there's a lot of space to take risks and grow. That's what's so nice about narrative reporting, not just grades. This is the character development people talk about. Motivation is a vulnerable place for students. Many have learned to hide or cope or only be motivated by the prize or the bribe. I have been the prize and bribing teacher, so I'm not exempt. But to start to see that shift is something we love writing about in reports to parents.

**Ela Richmond (47:02)**  
I absolutely love that. So, a question about play. As adults, we recognize that being in a hurry is not great. When kids play, it feels as an onlooker that they're not being productive. We ask ourselves, "What else could I be doing?" Why do you all say yes to play? What is in play that makes it so useful?

**Kristin (48:31)**  
Observing play... there's so much research here. Again, we want to honor that there are real scientists who have language around this. We just haven't found their book yet. This was a vulnerable shift for us. As a conventional teacher, you're taught that efficiency drives the system, and play isn't efficient.

**Ginger (49:15)**  
If I took my kids outside for an extra recess, I felt like I'd be judged. "My kids are not working enough." Just shedding that.

**Kristin (49:25)**  
Yeah, earning and deserving. There's such a currency required in play, and that's not honoring that play is actually the heavy hitter when it comes to skills. Peter Gray says it: play is the job of children.

On average, we do about three hours outside. We're Minnesotan, so sometimes that's difficult. At different ages, that time looks different. We'll hold classes out there, we'll hike, but we also want to honor that unstructured outside time is important. My job changed when we made this a priority. At recess duty, I know where my eyes are, but this felt different. I'm actually watching students and all these skills emerge. I'm not just managing conflict.

It was in one of my times outside as a researcher. I saw pockets of kids, all 100% engaged. I noticed the projects they were doing and came up with four categories:

1. **Imagination:** They were playing store, playing city, using walnuts as currency. A lot of times, the stories we're reading in books get played out here.
2. **Competitive Structured Games:** Games with rules, like hide-and-seek or football.
3. **Civil Engineering:** Digging holes, gathering branches, making a path for water in a dam. One time, they gathered every dead branch in the entire woods. I had to call the city office like, "I don't know if you wanted this project done, but we gathered all the dead sticks for you."
4. **Social:** Just the hangout. Talking, telling jokes, bantering.

We've used these four categories to help students see their time management, their skill set, their communication. What's interesting is, when we talk about kids... we don't really have staff meetings. Ginger and I are outside, getting fresh air, standing back-to-back, and we have the time and space to name every kid we see and make observations. This is what you dreamt about in teacher meetings. "Okay, I'm a little concerned, it feels like anxiety is present here," or, "They're in conflict a lot with this person." We can also observe what category of play they prefer and which ones are challenging. We have students begging for an organized game—they want the rules, the winner, the loser. Challenging them to join the imaginary group stretches them. This is what we'd write a book about.

**Ginger (57:05)**  
It also gives students an opportunity to think about what they want to engage in. We might notice a student off by themselves, and we'll go over and say, "Hey, I noticed you're spending time by yourself. Can you tell me about that? Is this a choice? Do you just need some quiet alone time? If so, that's okay. Or is there a game you'd like to join? Would you like some help?" It's about getting to know them as individuals and helping them understand their own wiring. If you want to be by yourself, that's okay. But if there's a conflict, let's talk about it and work through it in real-time. In other settings, after recess, I'd spend half an hour trying to get to the bottom of all the social things. Here, we can help students gain the skills to work through it themselves.

**Ela Richmond (01:03:29)**  
That's the perfect note to wrap up on. A practical question: most children tend to over-watch screens. It's high dopamine. It's hard to get that 45-plus minutes of, "I'm bored, what do I do?" You're saying you don't discover these things until after that time. How do you recommend a parent instill this as a habit?

**Ginger (01:05:11)**  
First, as a parent, if you're trying to grow a child's stamina, think about where you're at. You don't go from zero to 50. If you typically get outside 10 minutes a day, make a goal of 20 and build from there. I've gotten comfortable with my son saying, "I'm bored." Actually, that's okay. The best stuff comes from boredom. I'll give him a few ideas, but he has very limited screens during the day. It takes about five, ten minutes, and then he has his Legos out, or he's on his bike, or taking his fishing pole to the lake. I guarantee if screens were an option, he wouldn't be doing those things. So I'm okay with him being bored.

As educators, we didn't start with three hours a day outside. The kids had to grow their stamina. We had to grow our ability to trust the research. And as we walked through it, we're like, "My goodness, the research is right." We have validation that this is really important. We have tech in Scola, too. We'll have math games, even brainless games. We have carved-out times for it. They know when it's coming. Every Thursday, we end the day with laptop time. We put boundaries around it, but we honor that screens are here to stay.

**Kristin (01:08:15)**  
Also, we had some interesting supplies that are just helpful. But hold off on purchasing stuff right away. See what shapes up. Do you need to buy the nice shovel because digging holes is the thing? All of our jump ropes are rarely used for jump-roping. They're used for slingshots, for measuring. A lot of natural materials. Our kids know how to collect sticks and make things out of them. And some kids will increase their stamina faster if they have people to do it with. So for a family, pair up with another family. Bring them to a creek or a climbing place.

**Ela Richmond (01:09:54)**  
My last question: you're talking about going over to a student who is alone. It sounds like you've done a very good job of building trust. But a lot of parents wonder, how much should I be stepping in versus giving them space to figure it out? How do you determine when to step in?

**Kristin (01:13:51)**  
That's such a good question. It really comes from knowing the student and what skills they have. It can be the same age child, but one student understands how to confront another, express their feelings, and come to a compromise, and another needs help. It comes from knowing the student.

And that trust starts with the families. In this style of learning, there has to be a level of trust established with families. It's okay if families aren't feeling that from us or want something different. We're not offended by that. The trust starts with the parents, and then it takes time to build with students. But students can see right past it when you, as a teacher, just want to get onto the next thing and put a band-aid on it. That band-aid doesn't last. It's going to be torn off and show up as a disruptive behavior later.

Teaching is so formational. We use that word, and we are a faith-based school, but even a friend who isn't would probably agree. There's such forming and shaping in a school setting, no matter the model. Formation takes time, care, and seeing. We're going to be shaped whether we're intentional about it or not. That's how powerful classroom settings can be. We take that seriously. And this is why teacher health is so important. When we're healthy, we're going to approach the formation of students as whole people we care about. We have patience and trust for your family.

**Ela Richmond (01:17:58)**  
This was an incredible episode. I'm so happy for Minnesotan families that they get to go to your school. Is there anything else you want to leave our listeners off with?

**Kristin & Ginger (01:18:26)**  
I would just say if there are any other educators out there who are getting this idea of, "What if? Could I?" We would love to hear from you. We have a model school, so other educators reach out to us and are curious about how we did this. We would just encourage them to reach out. We'd love to chat with them.

**Ela Richmond (01:18:59)**  
I love it. Okay, we'll leave all of your links in the description. Thank you all so much for coming on the episode.

**Kristin & Ginger (01:19:15)**  
Thank you, Ela.

  

  

# Scola Microschool: Reimagining Education Through Play and Outdoor Learning

## Open Ed Podcast with Ela Richmond

_Featuring Kristin & Ginger, Co-founders of Scola Microschool_

---

## Introduction and Founding Story

**Ela Richmond:** Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm your sometimes host Ela and today I'm joined by Kristin and Ginger of the Scola Microschool. I'm so excited to have this conversation and kind of shed light on the micro school side of open education. So what is happening in this world, how Scola was started and founded and what it has done for your community. Welcome to the podcast.

**Kristin & Ginger:** Thanks Ela for having us. We appreciate it.

**Ela Richmond:** Okay, so just dive straight in. What is your story? How did you even get started with micro schools? Were you an educator ahead of time? Were you a mom? Where did you start?

**Kristin:** Good question. Both Ginger and I are moms. We also were educators mostly in a private school conventional classroom. We work together really closely and I think that matters as part of our story. We knew each other's giftings. We're pretty opposite people who are just really appreciative of the other person's skill set and learn how to work together that way.

When we started Scola in 2022, if I'm being really honest, it's probably been a seed that started in my master's program, possibly even a little bit longer than that. I tend to be a creative thinker, engineer, inventor, big picture type of person—let's blow it up and just see what happens type of personality. And Ginger is practical and focused on what's the next step and okay, let's just try to get one thing done today. Together our skill set was really powerful and important in getting school started.

I got my master's degree in educational leadership before I had my two kids. I was a middle school teacher. I loved middle school. I loved the creativity I got to have in my classroom at my school at the time. And then I think there were kind of two motivations for me. One was my own children—just seeing how my daughter and my son both were different and probably needed different things from schooling. But then second was teaching through COVID and just knowing that there were some constraints in the conventional classroom that I had always felt, but those were obviously put under fire in COVID.

It was a ridiculously hard, but also very fruitful time to teach. I was the optimist that was like something good can come out of this. And it was just the right time to let the seed of Scola actually start to take root. So we put legs on it and kind of a framework around it in the fall of 2021 and opened our doors September of 2022.

## The Starting Process and Early Challenges

**Ela Richmond:** How many students did you start with?

**Ginger:** When we originally started to shape our school, we wanted 24. And that was kind of a big picture question for the two of us. We both really wanted to stay teaching. And so effective teaching was kind of a common big theme for the two of us. And with effective teaching, you always have to talk about student to teacher ratios, right? That's a big part of the conversation.

So we thought 24 was the right number to have. We didn't start with that. We started with 16. It grew to 18, then it grew to 23, and now we have, I think we found a good sweet spot. We have between 30 and 35 students, but now there's three teachers involved.

**Ela Richmond:** Wow. And what was that like? Paint the picture of how it started and I don't know what challenges y'all had to go through. I mean, it seems easy to teach a lot of kids, especially if you're a teacher, but then you get into the weeds of it and I bet there were a lot of challenges that you didn't expect.

**Ginger:** That's a great question. I'm just going to go back a little bit. You know, Kristin and I teaching together for years, there was a moment before SCOLA was a dream and started in the institution we're at together that I put on a post-it. And I don't even know if Kristin remembers this, I put, Kristin, you need to start a school and I'll come work for you. And so fast forward years later, post COVID.

I am someone who actually does not love change. I really feel comfortable in the knowing, comfortable in what to expect. And after COVID, when I went back into a classroom setting for a few years, there was definitely a shift in me. I think I was really exhausted. I think COVID with the technology and all the things that were involved just took a lot out of me. Going back into the classroom and recognizing our students have shifted. Our students are not the same when we left to when we're coming back in the classroom.

I think there was just some exhaustion that I experienced and I'm like, okay, something needs to change because I still loved teaching. I still loved being in education. I got my master's in educational leadership and I think I hit this point of like, okay, something's gotta change. I wanna stay in education. And Kristin and I were working at different institutions, but we would meet and we'd go on walks. And that's when Kristin started sharing the idea of Scola with me. And I'm like, that's a great idea for you. Yes, you could totally do this. And slowly but surely it just came to be that I would come alongside and help start SCOLA.

It was that exhaustion that led me to the yes. Something's gotta change. I think this is it. So I just embraced it. We would meet, we were both working full time. So to get SCOLA off the ground, this was probably in February before SCOLA started, we would meet on Saturdays and we would make a checklist.

## Core Values and Philosophy Development

**Kristin:** At the beginning on our Saturday morning meetings, while working full-time as teachers, we just had to come up with those big questions, right? Like, who do we want to be? What's going to rise to the top? You realize quickly you can't be all the things. And in fact, that was actually part of why we were leaving, right? The demands of our current situation was just piling up and there wasn't any meaningful subtraction.

So we were like, okay, let's start really with a clean slate. That was way more vulnerable than what it sounds like. When you say out loud, let's start with a clean slate, you're giving up pieces of your identity. You're giving up pieces of what you prided yourself in. I even tear up just thinking about how much courage it took just to be like, okay, all the things, all the measuring sticks I had about being a good teacher. I'm actually going to lay these down. Now they might be good. We might be willing to pick them back up again, but let's just try to start with a clean slate, like what's actually important to us.

And so it was so nice to have space to let the important things rise to the top. And we knew that we wanted to be outside more often. We wanted movement and outside is more than just outside. There's actually a lot of sub points to that, right? It's kids really connected to their space. It's also part of teacher health, a lot of movement, just natural, really good things that happen and a human connection point that just felt like we were losing.

We really wanted to meet students where they were at. We wanted to take the pace pressure off of students. Some students could fly ahead. We knew that we had to be able, if we were really gonna make that the value, we had to take words like gifted, talented, accelerated, behind, ahead—and I still catch myself sometimes, those things are really embedded—but meeting students where they're at, giving them an authentic learning sweet spot.

Third, I think we really wanted a social emotional component. And to us, that means community. There is community, friendship, relationship skills. How do we interact with our neighbor? We actually wanna be part of a neighborhood. We want to be out in the community. We want that veil between school and community to mesh a little bit more. We want students to see themselves as part of a community, but that also meant how do we take care of ourselves when we're dysregulated or how do we act as part of a group? How do we take care of our relationships?

Outside, meeting students where they're at, relationships—those were the three things that floated to the top when we first started. And then every choice after that, we had a commitment to let these things be our North Star and make every decision based on that.

## Organizational Structure and Legal Framework

**Kristin:** So that led to how many students do we want? That led to what type of organizational structure are we gonna be? So technically we are a nonprofit that serves homeschool families. And right now that is satisfying the law in Minnesota and it may change and we'll learn how to pivot and adjust to that if needed.

So we sound like a school, we breathe like a school, have blood and veins like a school, we talk like a school, but technically we are a nonprofit that serves homeschool families. So those basic decisions—what will our budget look like? What materials will we buy? What will our calendar, daily calendar, daily schedule look like? A lot of those decisions we made on these Saturday mornings, but these three things were always leading the way.

## Fear and Trust in Educational Change

**Ela Richmond:** That makes sense and it's really fascinating that it started with this sentiment question, right? How do we increase and better the sentiment of teachers and students? Were you all ever afraid? You said that you let go of all these measuring sticks that you had learned and that you had used as a teacher for so long in traditional school. Was it really hard in the beginning to let go of those measuring sticks and be like, okay, but what if we let them go outside more often? What if we structure things differently? Are we still serving the purpose that we are hoping to serve?

**Ginger:** Absolutely, I think there was some apprehension on my end. I think part of it, when I think about my apprehension, was having each other. I actually trust between the two of us that what's going to end up happening is actually best for students. And because we've had a friendship, but also research, right? Research backs up that play is so important. Research backs up the social emotional regulation in kids that they need to feel safe. They need to be seen. They need to feel connection in order to learn, in order for their giftings and their strengths to actually come to the top, in order to have confidence to be willing to be vulnerable and make mistakes. So I think there was some fear, but all of those other things outweighed the fear.

And also, I think the first time we got paid, our first paycheck was just reassuring both to myself and my husband. It's like, okay, yes, we are getting paid for this also. So that helped. In the first day, I think there was just so much excitement and knowing that we were stepping into something new for this area that we were creating. And because I have, this is my 26th year of teaching.

So I think going into it, knowing that I've had touch points with pretty much K through eighth grade. I know where kids need to be. When they leave eighth grade, when they leave first grade, kind of the skill academic check, I feel confident in knowing where kids need to be and supporting them wherever they're at to get to where they need to be. So there was this level of confidence and excitement that outweighed the fear.

## Starting With Bare Bones and Building Up

**Ginger:** And that first day, part of me wishes we would have just recorded just for our sake because we really did start with just bare bones, bare bones. What does it look like to really see students and see kids and build a program around where students are at and what they need?

So we stripped a lot of the structure we typically have in the classroom. We're like, OK, let's start without it. And slowly but surely we started adding components of a typical classroom. So if you come in, you know, a typical day at school or morning, you'll have three different small groups. And within those small groups, you'll see components of a typical classroom, except kids are working independently and you have multi age working on all different things. But you still see that structure that typical classrooms have.

## Student Transformation and Sentiment Changes

**Ela Richmond:** That's so fascinating. Have you also seen a sentiment change in your students? What is the reaction been by students going through this new type of learning or this more flexible type of learning?

**Kristin:** Well, I think we have two types of students. You have students that have been in different institutions that come to Scola, and you have students that have been here since kindergarten that actually Scola is their only framework for education. So I think there's definitely our kids who have been in other institutions. Just like there had to be some undoing for us, there is this undoing process.

And it's interesting, I think our admissions process really just tries to honor that it's going to take some time. It's going to take some time to shed the old in order to try on and see the values of the new thing. I gave myself some time. I probably should have given myself some more time.

Both of us listened to a lot of podcasts. We were trying to fill our backpack with all this inspiration to get the courage to do this and just try. And like what Ginger said, the research and people cheering us on, just the personal investments we had from friends and colleagues. And anytime we would share what we were doing, I don't think there was a single person that was like, well that's weird. Everyone was like, yeah.

But I think what was interesting is when we were starting to get students, we were giving ourselves time. We heard this quote of, it's going to take for however many years you're in a system, it's going to take that many months to actually shed everything off before you can rebuild it back up, right? So I was coming out with 16 years or 18 years of teaching. So I needed to give myself 18 months. So that's like two years of school of really undoing these things.

And then just knowing when we go through admissions, the unique group here is people who start in Scola and that's all they know. This is what they know of school. So they're gonna walk into a school building, maybe to go visit a play or a band concert and that's going to feel weird. But then we have students coming from more of a homeschool situation and this is actually more structured than what they're used to, so they have a different learning curve than students coming from a conventional classroom.

## Whole Child Approach vs Academic Focus

**Ginger:** Absolutely. And I think when it comes to that measuring stick, I think as educators, we've always had the philosophy of seeing the whole child and valuing academics as part of that. But there's also athletic ability, social, emotional, being good at relationships, all of these things that make us humans. But in typical classical education institutions, it really is academics that gets the majority of focus and you know that's what you're seeing as a classroom teacher.

So I think in this space, yes obviously we are a school and academics is important, but kids are confident because when they come into this space, because we've shed, which has taken some time, we've understood okay this is important but actually who you are as an image bearer of God is actually most important. And this is how we're gonna see each other. And I think that when kids learn that and they start to see each other in their giftings and the way that they're wired and unique, there's just this confidence that they're able to come into a space and learn and be vulnerable and be able to make mistakes in ways that I don't feel like as an educator I could tap into to quite the same degree when I have 26 students in one classroom that I have these measuring sticks that I'm being evaluated on if I don't get them from point A to point B.

So the pressure for our students is off, hopefully, and it takes some time for them to get there. And also the pressure for us is off to fully see students. And I think something that looks a little different, we have progress reports, but we don't do letter grades. So even in middle school, there's not letter grades. Now there is, we are looking at grade level, where should students be at, where they fall for their grade level. And then we have a narrative side. And the narrative side gets into social, gets into play. And the narrative I would say is most important because we're small.

We get to really see students and really know students and come alongside students in a way that I just, I've never had the ability to do in a typical classroom setting. And that correlates then with getting to know the families. Families are our number one, especially as homeschool families, mom and dad, they're actually in the driver's seat. So we partner with families. It is a partnership.

And in real time, because we're small, in real time, if there's a question or if there's something that comes up, I can give mom and dad a call or a quick text, hey, this is happening. How was your morning? So in real time, to have this understanding of exactly what's going on socially, emotionally with a child, the value, I cannot overemphasize the value of that component.

When it comes to actually then going into academics, academics is not always easy. Our students will face some challenging moments when it comes to that threshold of learning something new, right? There is this grit that's required when learning something new. And I think our students are able to tap into that grit because these other things have been checked that are actually more important. And I think in a classroom, typical classroom, yes, those boxes are being checked for some students, but not all. And students, they have a good way of hiding that sometimes where they look like they have it all together. And then you are looking at work or you're doing some assessment and you recognize that the connections are not being made.

So being able to meet those needs in real time has just been amazing.

## Education Philosophy: Process Over Outcome

**Ela Richmond:** Before we get into play, I kind of want to dive into just the education piece. Has the way that Scola is structured—the structure versus non-structure comparatively to a traditional education approach—has that changed the way that students and parents think about education too in your school? Have you had those conversations with families that came from a traditional school—has it changed their relationship with education and learning?

**Kristin:** Yeah, that's really interesting. So many families, mine included at one point, the relationship with school was actually about the outcome and the grades. Right, that's actually where most everyone—teachers, learners, parents—everyone was prioritizing that. Everyone was trying not to. I think there were huge efforts to say it's not about the grade, but the constraints were so strong, the current was so strong that no matter how hard you tried, it still was so much time, so much money, so much emphasis put on the grade.

So I think we're still probably trying to find the right words of what shifts and how we can describe families' relationships to education when that's actually not the main point, right? So outcomes will happen, but when you put more time and more investment in the process and in the learning, there's just a different posture towards outcomes. And there's just a different posture towards what learning can look like, right?

**Ela Richmond:** I find that fascinating because in every aspect of our lives, we understand that that's true, right? In something as simple as working out, in something as simple as our marital relationships and our love relationships. We understand that everything hits the road and everything becomes true in a moment. Right? So the habit of choosing your husband, the habit of showing up to the gym—all of that matters so much more than let's say a physique or a weight or whatever it is. It will come. But it's funny because from a school perspective, we all just focus on the outcome as opposed to how can we nurture the moment? How can we put into the moment as much as possible? Because it is unreasonable to assume that if we put all of this into the moment and we do that consistently for say five plus years that the outcome won't be good.

**Kristin:** Now you're getting into a philosophy podcast here, right? The telos or the main component of why we educate has shifted. Right. And we all kind of see the historical benefit of that. And now I don't want to get too deep into that because I want everyone to have access to that, right? And that might mean that we have to shift some things or create schools so that as many people as possible can have access. And I think that's where our dream is too, right? We love Scola, we love what's being created. And we do get frustrated with, but how could every kid have opportunity to this, right? We also see some of the limitations in what we've built that we care about our kids in the Twin Cities. We care about our kids in our city. So we get frustrated sometimes even with the limitations of that.

## Access and Educational Equity

**Ginger:** Just tapping on access. I think our heart, our desire is that every kid has access to a meaningful education where they are taught by healthy educators and they themselves, their needs are being met and they're learning, right? And thankfully in the Twin Cities, we have access to lots of different choices. There are thriving public schools. There are great charter schools that have been well established. There are wonderful private schools. There are micro schools that are popping up. But again, it is limited as far as being a tuition driven school that not everybody has access to it.

So I think that access is really important. We do not have a solution to that at all, but we are thankful to live in the Twin Cities where there are options as far as open enrollment and even online options for families. And I think one thing that's so important to us, and even it ties back into your previous question of how does this change people's posture, how does this change actually parents' approach to education? I think when we speak about teacher health, our families have started really caring about teacher health. We talk about that a lot. So we talk about our school is better when we stay healthy and when we stay effective. And here's actually practically what we mean by that.

And then encouraging people, some of our families have students in more than one school. They actually have the opportunity to pick the school model that fits their kid and they might be at a couple different ones. And so helping them even—how can you help the health of teachers in other schools? It really comes down to that effective teaching. Effective, healthy teachers really do make a significant impact in the education of your neighborhood, of your city. Effective teachers are really amazing. And the reach of an effective teacher can go a long way, farther than just the classroom that they work in.

So even shifting some of the posture of we are pro education, so we are not—we actually do not plan to be in competition with anyone in our city. We want more healthy options. We want more sustainable schools. We want more healthy teachers and we're doing our little micro part here, but as much as we can be in relationship with school districts and keep that a positive relationship, learn from them, connect with them, how can we help with resources, how can we help actually this whole thing to grow, not just us be in this competitive market. That doesn't actually make any sense on our part.

## Finding the Right Educational Fit

**Ela Richmond:** I fully agree. How would you, as both parents and teachers, recommend that people find the thing or the school model or the approach that works for their kids specifically?

**Ginger:** There's so many things that add up to that. Convenience is a really strong factor. And we had even some really good school years, even though that was our top value for a year—we just needed to pick the convenient option. My kids were okay. And there were things that we supplemented or did different because of that.

I do think, and again, I think this ties into a previous question, your kids' motivation, your students really tapping into how are they motivated? What gets them motivated? And again, we have a variety of students here. One thing that has been really cool and very beneficial, but has taken time is student motivation. In my previous classrooms, student motivation was really dependent on me in the way that we have structured school.

And also letting some of these priorities rise to the top, it has shifted the motivation onto students a lot more. Students still need us, they need an on-ramp, they need us to do the direct instruction for new things, the check-ins, the feedback. But there are many times, Ginger and I, it happens several times a week where our students—all of sudden, there's 32 different things going on in this room. And we just kind of stare at each other. And we go fill up our coffee. And you can just feel—we bask in it actually is what happens. Cause this is the teacher's dream. This is where we're actually being needed at the right amount. This is us doing our job in the way we love doing our job.

And it's this level of student independence, student motivation, student—they have the right resources, the tools, and they get to drive it, right? Now those moments don't last the whole day. So please know that we can go fill up our cup of coffee before we have to attend to something. But it really is a lot more like gardening in a way. It's a lot more a tending job, more than kind of push through or drive the train type of job.

**Ginger:** And going back to what would we say to parents who are trying to pick the right fit space for their child and their learning? When you first start that process, when we meet kindergarten, going into kindergarten with parents, I think we like to please just put them at ease. I think sometimes there's this pressure like I have to get it right. If I don't get it right it's gonna throw the whole sequence. So especially for kindergarten parents just putting that pressure off and saying okay, here's what you can expect at Scola.

If you're looking when you're looking at institutions, trying to talk to administrators, trying to get physically in the building and I would suggest if you can make it happen during a typical school day, you really can get a sense of what's the culture, right? What are you seeing? What are you feeling as a parent? Can you see your child in the hallways? Can you see your child in this classroom? So I recommend parents if they can get in during the school day for a tour and really trusting their gut and what they're feeling and what they're seeing.

When it comes to standardized tests and you see these schools ranked by test, I recommend looking at that but that should not be the driving factor for deciding on a school. There's so many things behind the scene that goes on when these tests are given to measure a particular student at a particular time in the day at a particular time when they're going through their curriculum. So again, if you want to look at that, use that, you can, but I would put that lower on the list when it comes to looking at possible schools.

## Understanding Student Motivation

**Ela Richmond:** There's natural student motivation—some students are just naturally gifted and they naturally gravitate toward certain topics. But then there's motivation by osmosis almost where a student is around other students who care about X or a student is around a family member that they really look up to who cares about X or Y. How do you, especially early on from a teaching perspective and a parent perspective, help your kid to foster those motivations?

**Kristin:** I think Ginger's so good at this, so I've learned a lot from her, just even about how to ask kids questions of what they're proud of, right? And so, I love telling kids I'm proud of them. And so I still do, it's not like I cut that out of my life. But there is something about specific praise, really helping kids feel internally proud. A lot of this honestly comes underneath teaching kids about emotions, teaching kids about their own, the way that they feel, even feeling frustrated, going through some of the more difficult feelings and having them aware and acknowledging those things actually is all a part of this, right?

So that social emotional piece actually plays a huge part in motivation because students have to recognize what proud even feels like and not proud because someone else told me that this was good, but I feel proud. I feel really good about this, right? Even though there might not be a grade attached, there's not any type of recognition that I'm not relying on those types of things, right? And so I even think what types of questions to ask kids, guiding them in some of their freedom.

**Ginger:** My mind goes to teaching kids that intrinsic motivation, right? And I think it's not about them making me proud. It's actually about them feeling accomplished and proud for the work that they've done. So I think in thinking about my small group as kids are working, maybe they're working on math. And within 20 minutes, there might be a kid that finishes 10 problems, right? And there might be a kid that finishes one. And really setting up a culture where, whether it's one or 10, you get to feel proud of your accomplishments.

So recognizing in that moment that kiddo who might've just finished one problem, but he focused, he stuck with it. And just recognizing, noticing that, hey, such and such, how does that make you feel? Look at what you just did on your own. And I think there's also this piece of working in multi age, where they get to work with one another, they get to bring it out in each other and recognize, again, it takes some time, but recognize we're not in a hurry. There actually isn't one student that is getting the gold star today because we all are working at different levels.

And I think working in multi-age, they get to come alongside of each other, really learn how to coach, not just give an answer, but what does it look like to share how you got the answer? What are some strategies you used? It's really, really special. And I can just picture that kid that comes up to me. They're so excited because they did X, Y, Z and just turning that around with a big smile on my face. How does that make you feel? I feel so excited. Look what I did. Why don't you go share that with your teammate at your table.

And it does take some intentional reframing of it. The teacher is not the center. They're not doing this for me, but what does it look like to do it for establishing the habit, for the process, for the learning, for reaching that goal, feeling that feeling. So that once again, when they try something new tomorrow, they kind of remember what that felt like and they're able to gain the confidence and have that when they feel like quitting, okay, you got to that yesterday, let's keep on going.

**Ela Richmond:** That is huge. I just want to shed light on that for a second and highlight. It is so easy as both a parent and a homeschool parent and also a teacher and also anybody that is really excited and really cares about the success of a child to be the person that they turn to and show their success. And they're like, mom, be so happy. But it is really, really important for that not to be the end of it, for it to be, I am so happy for you, you should also be happy for you. And creating that line between this is not just about pleasing me, this is about doing something that is just inherently really good. You just did something that was awesome. And reminding them that it is not just about the pat on the back that you're getting, but it is also about the result that they are getting for themselves. I've never heard that one before, but I think it's a subtle thing, but it is so important.

**Kristin:** Yeah, well, it's the adult paycheck world too, right? We do this for the paycheck and we also do this because of the good work that's done in me and also that I can do for other people. There's actually a lot of research on motivation. There is a book out there, I think it's called The Disengaged Teen, and they actually have really good words on the different motivations that each person taps into.

And to be honest, I'm still so new. We're probably more the labs. We're actually hands-on, experiencing all these things. We may not have all the scientific words on what we're seeing, but you really can start to see that kids go in and out of different types of motivations too, right? And when you know a student, when you are known and when you belong and when you have a teacher or a guide or a person who's tending your environment to help you, there's just a lot of space. There's a lot of chances to take risks and grow.

And I think that's what's so nice about having some narrative reporting, not just grades or numbers attached to things is this is the character development that people talk about, right? Is how I use my motivation, how I use my passion to accomplish some things and not everything I like, right? There are just some things that these are really good skills to learn. This is also just good for my brain. I'm experiencing brain health and brain growth from doing some of these things.

I think motivation is one of those topics where it is a vulnerable place for students. Many of them have learned how to hide or to cope or to only be motivated by the thing, right? The prize or the bribe. And I have been the prize and bribing teacher, so I'm not exempt from that in any way. But to start to see that shift is something that I think we love writing about in these reports out to parents, because that's the type of character and really helpful knowledge that parents want as they try to help guide their kid in passions and in some places of growth.

## The Four Categories of Play

**Ela Richmond:** I wanted to ask you a question about play, right? As adults, we all recognize that being in a hurry is not great, right? And we've talked about the focus on outcome, especially in a normal school setting. When kids play and when they are outside and when they're doing all of these things, it feels as an onlooker, they're not being productive. How could they be filling their time differently, right? As adults, we even ask ourselves that question. Why do y'all say yes to play for kids? What is in play that actually makes it—well, it's not quote unquote productive—actually is very, very useful for children?

**Ginger:** I would love for you to start because observing play, again, both of us have our masters and maybe someday we'll go on because there's so much research here. And in the observation of play, there's actually some categories that come up.

**Kristin:** OK. So again, we just want to honor that there's real scientists and researchers who probably have language around this. And we just haven't found their book yet. So we don't claim to have all of this data and observations from students and don't quite know all of the language. But again, this was a vulnerable shift for both Ginger and I, because as a conventional teacher, you are taught to be so—efficiency drives the system and play just doesn't, it's not efficient.

**Ginger:** And you also in—again, the shedding off is like if I took my kids outside for an extra recess, I just felt like I'd be judged. Like my kids are not working enough. Even just the shedding of earning and deserving. There's such a currency that's required in play. And that's just not honoring that play's actually the heavy hitter when it comes to skills, right?

And I think Peter Gray says it—this is the job of children. Play is the job of kids. OK, so we are, on average, we do about three hours outside. Now we're also Minnesotan. And so there's, we have four distinct seasons. And so sometimes three hours is really difficult. The weather doesn't shape up to that. But and then probably at different ages, that three hours outside just looks different.

So we will hold classes. I take on our fifth through eighth grade-ish students, 10 through 12 year olds, 10 through 14 year olds. So we do classes out there. We will hike. So there will be different seasons where we will structure some of that outside time, but then also we wanna honor that unstructured outside is important. We also care about safety. We care about liability and these types of things. So we spend a lot of time at the beginning of school just addressing and giving kids freedom, but also them knowing their risks and that type of stuff.

Anyway, we were sitting outside and our job changed when we made this a priority because recess duty, I've done recess duty and I know where my eyes are, I know what my job is, but this just felt different. It probably was subtle enough where I actually am watching students and all of these skills emerge. I'm actually not checking out or thinking about my next lesson or just trying to manage conflict all the time. My job opens up a little bit more to really watching students, listening to them talk, not jumping into conflict right away, but seeing when to get involved in those types of things.

Anyway, it was in one of my times outside as a researcher. And I remember there were pockets of groups of kids around different things and they were all fully engaged, 100% engagement. And I just kind of noticed the projects they were doing. So I came up in four different categories.

So there definitely was the **imagination group** where they would use the—they would be playing store. They would be playing city. They would have these walnuts to use as their currency and their economy. There was a realtor and there was a—but this could also get into a lot of times the stories that we're reading, the books, it's the book report getting played out in these types of settings too. So there's the first category is just imagination.

And then the second category is just the **competitive structured games**. Usually the games that have rules attached to it. This would be the hide and seek, the football, the bat, and those types of things. And they just feel more organized, right? They feel not as loose ended.

The third one, which is so interesting is like **civil engineering**—digging the holes, gathering the branches. Making a path of water in a dam and using rocks and sticks and seeing which way the water is going to go. There was one time we have a couple of great wooded areas and before we knew it, every dead branch, and we're not even on our property, we're in a city park. And so every dead branch in the entire woods was collected and gathered in a place. And so I had to call the city office being like, okay, I don't even know if you wanted this project done, but we gathered all the dead sticks for you if you wanted to come pick—someone has to come pick these up because now they're in the way of the playground. So we called it civil work and engineering.

And then the fourth one is simply just **social**. There is just the hangout, the talking, the telling jokes, the bantering back and forth.

So we actually have really used these four categories to be helpful in helping students see where their time management is, where their skill set is, where their communication, some of those executive functioning. And then also what's interesting is when we talk about kids, and this is now part of our—we don't really have staff meetings. What happens is Ginger and I are outside, we're getting the fresh air that we need. We stand almost back to back. And so one teacher is facing one way and one is facing the other way. And we have the time, we have the space to actually name every kid we see and just make observations about them.

And again, just what you were saying about habits building over time, this has been, this is what you dreamt about in teacher meetings where you could actually talk about students. You could actually talk about how you see them growing, what you see them doing. Okay, I'm a little concerned. It feels like maybe anxiety is really present here or they're just in conflict a lot with this type of person. But also we could make observations of what category of play do they like to go in the most, which ones actually feel the most challenging.

We have some students, they are just begging that people play an organized game with them. And they beg us sometimes, could you just start a capture the flag or a kickball game? They want the rules, they want the teams, they want a winner, they want a loser. And that's actually where they feel comfortable. But challenging them to join the imaginary group and like, well, there's this really cool walnut currency game going on in the woods. And seeing how that stretches them and grows them a little bit.

So I think that's where these four categories have been really helpful to us because they really help us see where students prefer and also just some of the skills that are needed in a few of these categories to play. So we actually present this to our parents. We talk about it. We post this on Instagram, just this is what, if we were to write a book, this would probably be an easy topic for us to just get started of just the categories of play that we have seen shape up here. And then also the skills that come from it.

And I think it also gives an opportunity for students to think about, okay, what do I want to engage in? What do I want to do during this time? And as we're out there, as we're watching, we notice, we might notice a student off by themselves. We'll give it a little time to see if they join, but after a while, we might just go over there and say, hey, I noticed that you're spending time by yourself. Can you tell me about that? Is this a choice? Do you just need some quiet alone time? If that's the case, that is okay. Or is there something that you would like to join? Is there a game that you see going on that you would like to join? Would you like some help in joining that game?

So I think a piece that happens in small, again, is really getting to know students as individuals and getting to know them and how they're wired and helping them start to understand their natural tendencies and how they're wired. That is actually completely okay if you want to be by yourself right now and just spend some time alone. But if you'd like some help in joining a group or if there's some sort of personal or relationship conflict that is—you don't feel invited, let's go ahead and talk about that. And let's go ahead and work through that in real time.

Versus in other settings after recess, some days would probably take a half an hour as a classroom teacher trying to get to the bottom of all the social things that happened during that time. In real time we're able to help students gain the skills so that they're able to work through it and sometimes they need help from an adult and sometimes they don't. Sometimes they're like I think that I can—I would like to do this on my own. Great. I'm gonna walk with you but why don't you go ahead and talk with that other student. Again it's that real time as I'm going into year four that I really think has made so much difference.

And I know we talk about play, but that being outside, being outside the benefit to me personally, to get outside in nature, no matter the weather, even on a cloudy day, to be able to get outside, to breathe in some fresh air for our students and for us as educators, has just been amazing on my own mental, emotional health. I just feel just more at peace when I have touch points where I'm outside to be able to give our students that. And I think this setting, they probably won't recognize the benefits, whether they spend a year here, or all nine years, I don't think they'll recognize the benefits that they're receiving in this place until they're older.

## The Science Behind Extended Play Time

**Ela Richmond:** Those are y'all's categories of play, right? How do you actively use that to shape the way that you approach students? Now that you all have this framework and this ability to categorize the way that students naturally just lean towards certain roles and opportunities, what do you do with that?

**Kristin:** Yeah, I mean, I think we talk about it a lot. So just even in our outside staff meeting, right? Some I really like to take video and snapshots and part of it, obviously putting it as a marketing tool, just even getting other people to have an expanded view of what school could look like, a reimagined school day. We do post a lot of this stuff and actually we use these categories as kind of a teaching moment for parents and other people.

But I think internally it really has helped us know how can we help a student grow or know a student better. And going back to your original question, doesn't this sound really productive, right? Play and this amount of time outside. And again, we kind of have, I think we came down to most of our old recess times in our former workplaces were 15 to 20 minutes. Honestly, some of these categories don't even show up until you're outside for 40 minutes. And so there's even kind of a timing science behind this. If we want these four categories to show up, at minimum an hour. And then what's even better is if you can add another hour, then you get to help kids and watch kids through the transition out of one thing and into another thing. And so that's usually at an hour and a half or two hours.

And so part of this Ela maybe is our, we built this so that we could feel productive. We could check the productive question. I don't think that's all of it. I mean, this is fascinating and this is what we'd sit through professional developments about how important this is for the brain and just neurologically what's happening here. But I think we use those four categories to help us build our schedule, keep track of our community, really help know where kids can grow and also where they feel the most comfortable, where we can celebrate them.

At the end of each day we do an I appreciate session. And just giving kids enough time for some leaders to pop up and then another idea pop—idea generation and kids moving from one element of play into another. It gives them a chance to actually see the giftings in other people. And now it brings up plenty of conflict too, so please don't think that we're conflict free. But even that, that amount of time helps us in real time, just like what Ginger said, it hits part of our relationship goal because we can really teach kids what it is to manage conflict and go through those types of things.

## Practical Implementation for Parents

**Ela Richmond:** This is so fascinating. Most children have a slight tendency to over-watch screens, right? Because screens are high dopamine and because, as a kid, you don't necessarily have the ability to regulate yourself and it's fun. But because kids are trapped in their screens, it's really, really hard to get that 45 plus minutes of, okay, I'm bored. I'm bored. I'm bored. What do I do? That time is so good for a kid to really figure it out, but here y'all are saying that you don't really get to the point where you're discovering these things about your kid until it's quite a bit after that time. How do you practically, how would you recommend to a parent or a family to even instill this as a habit? How would you recommend 45 plus minutes, an hour and a half of just—we're going outside. Did you, whenever y'all started Scola, have any pushback from kids?

**Ginger:** Yeah, I think first I'll just take the question on as a parent. I think if you're trying to grow a child's stamina, think about where you're at. You don't go from zero to 50, right? So think about where you're at and just make a goal of all right, typically we get outside 10 minutes a day. Let's make a goal today of 20 and then build from there. So just building on where you're already at.

I also think both as parents and educators, I've gotten really comfortable even this summer with my son, I've gotten comfortable with I'm bored. Actually, that's okay. The best stuff comes from boredom. Here's a few ideas, coming up with a list of ideas, helping them out. But at the same time, it probably is—now my son's 15—very limited screens. He's not on screens during the day at all. Probably takes about five, 10 minutes. And then what does he have out? He has his Legos out and he's building something. He has this super creative car that he came up with on his own or he's out on his bike or he's taking his fishing pole to the lake, which I guarantee you if screens were an option for him, he probably wouldn't be doing those things.

So I've been okay. And I, as a parent, I do not have it all figured out, but I've been okay. He'll tell me he's bored. I'm like, okay. Yeah, I can be validating your feeling. That can be a real feeling. And then setting up, as an educator, we didn't start out with three hours a day outside. Kids came in, they had to grow their stamina. We had to grow our ability to feel comfortable and trust the research and that this actually is really good for kids. And then as we walked through it, as we observed. Now we're like, my goodness, the research is right. We have validation as educators that this is really important to our students and our students are growing and becoming more confident as a direct result of this play.

We have tech even in Scola too, right? We will have math games, we'll have some brainless games too. So it's not even that they all have to be academic. And we have some carved out times. I think that's what's helpful is actually having some time carved out. They know when it's coming, they know that even when they're in there, they're going to enjoy it. There's a start, there's a stop. So we even do stuff where every Thursday, this is how we end the day is laptop time, and we'll put some boundaries around what that happens. But I think honoring that screens are here probably to stay. And also there's some skills to get in that too.

Yeah, building up the stamina. And then also we had some interesting supplies that are just helpful. I think, getting some of those supplies, if you wanted to do some more outside time, you don't have to get stuff right away because I think if we were to purchase stuff right away before really experiencing this, we wouldn't have gotten the right stuff. So hold off just a little bit and just see when this play comes up. Do you need to buy the nice shovel? Cause maybe digging holes really is the thing. Or all of our jump ropes. We buy jump ropes and then they're rarely used for jump roping. They're used for slingshots. They're used for measuring.

And so just even interesting, a lot of natural materials. Man, do our kids know how to collect sticks and make things out of sticks. And so just even as an adult being aware if you want to increase the outside time, knowing that there are some materials that really do aid and help with play, but being willing to wait and see what shapes up. And then there are just some kids that will, they will increase their stamina faster if they just have people to do it with, right? There are some of our kids who could play alone outdoors just fine, but for a family who we want to encourage, pair up with another family and just bring them to a creek, bring them to a climbing place or something and get those kids some time outside.

## Student Development and Gifting Recognition

**Ela Richmond:** Do students shift between different types of play? And when it comes to aligning the types of play with also the next thing that they could be interested in, are you all putting things in front of them too or telling parents, hey, your kid has this natural tendency to do this really cool thing. You should introduce them to one, two, three, four, five, whatever. Do you all do that?

**Kristin:** Yeah, I think many times we do that. This is kind of the good starting point of talking about the whole child is we're really trying to tell parents and most of them already know this, but a lot of times I think they want to know what sticks in a group of people. What sticks without them? A lot of leadership conversations come out or there are just some students where they would rather have something planned for them and they just follow along and that's okay too, right? And so, talking to parents just about how we see the growth in that, right? A strong leader, maybe taking a side job and not sabotaging or taking over the project is real growth. That's actually a really important life skill that we wanted to communicate to the parents.

We also end the year and we call them huddle awards. So we've just created this list of different characteristics that we see in kiddos. So a huddle award might be project manager. So we think about the kiddo that this has come to the surface. So each year we end the year and play is a huge place where we get the data and obviously letting families and kids know. This is not all we see, but this year and here specifically how we've seen it throughout the school day.

**Ela Richmond:** That's so cool. Y'all are so fascinating, by the way, and I absolutely love your approach to educating. I think it is so rare to find teachers that are coming up with theories while they're on the job. You're here, you're watching students, you're learning from them, you're like, okay, hold on a second, that's really interesting that this is happening. And then you're extrapolating all of these ideas and thoughts. You're trying to become better teachers by it. And I absolutely love that approach. I also think it's so cool that through your micro school, because it is yours, you get to take this and create the structure around it. So you get to say, okay, here are the things that we're witnessing. Here's the pattern that we've seen. We're actually gonna take this and implement it and see if this actually sticks. I think that's so awesome.

## Knowing When to Intervene

**Ela Richmond:** The last question that I'll share with you is when it comes to gaps. Ginger, you're talking about the fact that when it comes to a student who is alone for a second, sometimes y'all will go over to them and say, hey, do you actually want to be alone? Do you want to play with anybody? What is actually happening here? It sounds like y'all have done a very good job of building trust. So your students seem to, because you come to them and you ask and you actually care, it seems like they're more likely to tell you things pretty quickly. But a lot of parents have wondered the question of, okay, well, how much should I be stepping in as opposed to just giving them the space to figure it out? How do y'all determine when to step in and when to give them the space to figure it out?

**Ginger:** That's such a good question, and it really comes from knowing the student and knowing what skills they have and what skills are growing, right? So it can be the same age child, but there's one student that just understands how to confront another, how to acknowledge and express their feelings, but also then give the other student a chance to say their feelings and come up with a compromise. And there are other students that just need some help. And it really, I don't know how else to explain it Ela, but it comes from knowing the student.

And then also that trust starts with the families, right? I think when we interview families about the possibility of enrollment in admissions, we understand there has to, in this style of learning, there has to be a level of trust that's established with families. And it's okay if families aren't feeling that from us or want something different. We actually aren't offended by that. We wanna honor that in that family.

So I think that trust that you're talking about is the foundation and it starts with our families being able to trust us, to trust our opinion. That doesn't mean that they're going to agree with everything we say or we see, but we have this relationship where we can report what we're seeing and they get to speak into it too. So the trust starts with the parents, with the families, and then it takes time to build it with students.

But students can see past when you want, as a teacher, when you want to just get onto the next thing that you're asking to put a bandaid on it, students see right past that. And guess what? That bandaid doesn't last. That bandaid is going to be torn off and show up as maybe a behavior that's disruptive when it comes time to more of an academic setting. So I think because we know that, because of our experience, and because we understand nothing happens that's going to be sustainable and lasting and worthwhile without that trust.

And I think we're coming, teaching is so formation. So I think we use that word and we are a faith-based school, but I think even a friend who might be not coming from the same posture would probably agree with us that there's such forming and shaping in a school setting, no matter what the model. And so formation takes time, formation takes a lot of care, formation takes seeing. We're going to be shaped and formed whether we're intentional about it or not. And that's just how powerful classroom settings can be. And so I think we take that seriously and we make sure we tell parents this is what parents are feeling too, right? Their kid will go through formation and shaping in this school experience. So just telling them what's important to us.

I think also just being veteran teachers, right? And that we are healthy. This is why I think teacher health is so important is because when we're healthy, we're actually gonna approach the formation of students and we're gonna see them as people. We're gonna see them as whole people, people we care about. We have patience and care and trust for your family and good communication around that.

I just, that formation word is important to us and is the foundation. We want to be really honest with parents and let them know that they can be honest with us too. And so that's why I think we put out there in front of everybody, these are the things that are gonna be really important to us. We're not gonna be good at all of the things, but these are the things that are gonna be really intentional.

## Closing and Contact Information

**Ela Richmond:** This was an incredible episode. I'm beyond fascinated by your approach to play. I'm so happy for Minnesotan families that they get to go to your school. And for those that have just found it to be amazing, so happy for them. If any of our listeners are from Minnesota, they can check you out. We'll leave all of your description links and everything below. Is there anything else that you want to leave our listeners off with?

**Kristin:** I would just say if there's any other educators out there that as we're talking or as you've listened to podcasts, you're starting to get just this idea of, well, what if, could I? We would love to hear from you. We actually have just a model school. So other educators reach out to us and just are curious about how we did this and what maybe they could do. So I would just encourage them to reach out to us. We'd love to chat with them.

**Ela Richmond:** I love it. Okay, we'll leave all of your links in the description. If anybody wants to reach out, they definitely can. If anybody wants to look into your school, they definitely can. This was, again, beyond fascinating. And yeah, I hope to hear from you all soon. Thank you all so much for coming on the episode.

**Kristin & Ginger:** Thank you, Ela.
