TK: "You never want your children to be the kind of people who only feel comfortable around their own age. And so when we place our children in these age segregated environments and we teach them how to move through life where you're in sixth grade and you're always and only and mostly around sixth graders and then seventh graders and then eighth graders, by the time they get out of college for most of these students. They have on average like a year or two of depression because they have to move somewhere where they don't know anybody and they no longer have the luxury of an artificial neighborhood, an artificial campus where everyone is your age and they've all taken on a vow of poverty and you're in an environment where you're going to a job and there are people that are five years older than you, 15 years older than you, you've got a few people your age and you're not depressed. You're comfortable. You know exactly what to do because you see the basis for friendship as being something deeper or other than age."

_Instagram/TikTok:_  
"When else in life are you ONLY with people your exact age? 🤔

Traditional schools create artificial social bubbles that don't exist anywhere else.

Real socialization happens across ages and backgrounds.

_YouTube Shorts:_  
"Think about it: When in adult life are you ever exclusively surrounded by people your exact age?

Traditional schools create artificial social environments that don't exist anywhere else in society.

TK Coleman explains why age-segregated education might actually be setting children up for social challenges later in life."

_Facebook:_  
"The 'socialization' argument for traditional schooling has a major flaw:

School creates the ONLY environment in your child's entire life where they'll be exclusively surrounded by people their exact same age.

Is that really preparing them for the diverse, multi-generational world they'll actually live in?"
