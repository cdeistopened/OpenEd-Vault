# Fund Families, Not Systems: How One Simple Change Could Fix American Education

*In a recent episode of the OpenEd podcast, education freedom advocate Corey DeAngelis explains how shifting education dollars from institutions to families could revolutionize learning in America.*

## The One Simple Step

When asked to identify the single most transformative change that could fix American education, Corey DeAngelis doesn't hesitate: "Fund families directly instead of systems."

It sounds deceptively simple, but this fundamental shift in how we allocate the $800 billion spent annually on K-12 education could create a cascade of positive changes throughout the educational landscape.

"When you fund families directly, you create a market that actually responds to their needs," DeAngelis explains. "Right now, the government has a monopoly on education funding, and that money is locked into institutions regardless of their performance."

## The Pandemic's Silver Lining

While COVID-19 brought unprecedented challenges to education, it also created what DeAngelis calls a "transparency event" that accelerated the school choice movement dramatically.

"The teachers unions really stepped on a rake when they fought to keep schools closed," he notes. "Zoom school showed parents what was happening in the classroom for the first time. They saw the curriculum, they saw the quality of instruction, and in many cases, they weren't happy."

This newfound awareness created a groundswell of parental activism that has transformed the educational landscape. "Parents became a new interest group," DeAngelis says. "They showed up at school board meetings, they voted differently, they started demanding options."

## A Movement Gaining Momentum

The results speak for themselves: 17 states now have universal school choice programs, up from just one state five years ago. DeAngelis calls it "the fastest civil rights movement in modern American history."

These programs typically work through education savings accounts, tax-credit scholarships, or vouchers that allow education dollars to follow the child to whatever learning environment best meets their needs—whether that's a private school, homeschool, microschool, or hybrid model.

"We're seeing innovation explode in states like Arizona and Florida," DeAngelis says. "When families have options, satisfaction increases and costs actually go down because providers have to compete for students."

## The Unbundling of Education

One of the most exciting developments DeAngelis highlights is the "unbundling" of education—the ability for families to mix and match different educational services rather than accepting the one-size-fits-all approach of traditional schooling.

"We're seeing families create customized learning experiences," he explains. "Maybe your child attends a microschool three days a week, takes online courses for certain subjects, and participates in a homeschool co-op for others."

This flexibility allows education to be tailored to each child's unique needs, interests, and learning style—something the traditional system has struggled to provide.

## Parents as Educational Leaders

DeAngelis emphasizes that parents don't need specialized credentials to make good educational choices for their children. "You are your child's best teacher," he insists. "Nobody knows your child better than you do, and nobody has a stronger incentive to see them succeed."

He points to research showing that parents across all demographic groups prioritize academic quality, safety, and values alignment when choosing schools—the same factors education experts would recommend considering.

## The Path Forward

While the school choice movement has made tremendous progress, DeAngelis acknowledges there's still work to be done, particularly in states like California and New York where teachers unions maintain significant political influence.

However, he remains optimistic: "The genie is out of the bottle. Parents have seen what's possible, and they're not going back to the old system."

The message is clear: when we fund families instead of systems, we empower parents to create educational environments where their children can truly thrive.
