Basic Summary: Learning should be fluid and not restricted by time slots; if a child is interested in a topic, they should be allowed to explore it deeply, even for hours. Essential subjects like math, reading, and writing should still be incorporated daily, but traditional school structures should be avoided at home. Instead, families can engage in learning through exploration and activities during the day, reducing homework-related tensions and fostering quality family time.

Notes/Contributors: In school, you stop when the bell rings or wait to move on, but that kills natural curiosity. At home, let them dive deep—10 hours even—if they’re excited. Learning doesn’t have to stop at a bell

you want to let learning be fluid. If they're interested in something for a few minutes, let them dive deep into that. If they want to dive deep into that for 10 hours, let them do it. And postpone what you had planned for something else. Uh, so that you have this idea that, that learning is natural, and it's not a time slotted experience.

It might contradict a little bit, at least do 20 minutes of math, reading English of writing every day. I think those three R's are essential. The other thing then we see with families is after you do reading, writing, arithmetic, and you have recess and break and chores, it's now lunchtime. So get some lunch together.

  

📍 📍 📍 📍 one of the things that traditional schooling does is a 40 minute or a 50 minute bell cycle. You either have to stop learning at the bell, or you have to wait until the bell to move on.

Don't recreate that at home. You want to let learning be fluid. If they want to dive deep into that for 10 hours, let them do it. And postpone what you had planned for something else. So that learning is not a time slotted experience.

After you do 20 minutes of math, reading writing every day. Get some lunch together.

And then explore the world. Whether it's neighbors or library or zoos or planetariums, or field trips or go out in nature, the afternoon is a great opportunity. And then you're back by two 30 or three when the other kids in the neighborhood are coming home from school, your schooling's done, their schooling's done.

That is unlike most traditional school settings where the kids after dinner.

Have two hours of homework. They got to go crank on and it creates this tension between the student, the parent. All that conflict is gone because you do your schooling during the productive hours of the day, and then you spend time together as a family.
