The unexpected talent that changed everything...

[https://share.descript.com/view/38517mzzUvW](https://share.descript.com/view/38517mzzUvW)

  

**Darrin Fletcher:** [00:00:00] There was one kid who was kind of a goth kid.

He was a dark soul to be sure. He would come to the building almost every day,

I knew right away that this kid was a talented writer.

Just by reading his scripts, I was like, oh, okay. This kid is way ahead of his age, as a writer, he wanted to direct. I kept saying, man, if I were you and I had your skill, I'd start with being a writer. Directing will come, start with being a writer. That's what you're really good at.

He wrote several of the films, that year, and we entered all these films in a local film festival and all these kids just cleaned up at the festival. But it was fun to watch him who's this kind of hunched over short little kid, go down the aisle and pick up his award because he kept winning over and over and over. by the time I think he won three or four or even five, trophies that day, and each time he would go down and get a trophy, he would grow a little, just like,

he was so proud. And so by the time he was done, that kid was like 10 feet tall.

and it changed his life.

```Plain
[CLIP - 43:26 to 45:52]

"There was one kid who was kind of a goth kid, wore trench coats and dyed his hair black and wore makeup. He was a dark soul to be sure. And he would come to the building almost every day. It was a long drive for them, about 45 minutes just to get to the building.

And I knew right away that this kid was a talented writer. Just by reading his scripts, I was like, 'OK, this kid is way ahead of his age as a writer.' He wanted to direct and I kept saying, 'If I were you and I had your skill, I'd start with being a writer. Directing will come, but start with being a writer. That's what you're really good at.'

And so he wrote several of the films that year and we entered all these films in a local film festival, and all these kids just cleaned up at the festival. But it was fun to watch him, this kind of hunched over short little kid, go down the aisle and pick up his award because he kept winning over and over. I think he won five trophies that day. And each time he would go down to get a trophy, he would grow a little. He was so proud. So by the time he was done, that kid was like 10 feet tall.

And it changed his life. And now he sells his scripts for six figures a piece in Hollywood. And he's been produced multiple times."

## Instagram

**Most Engagement:** [https://www.instagram.com/reel/DF1bJTCsq18/](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DF1bJTCsq18/)

  

Chet Thomas is active on Instagram under the handle **@thomasimpact**, where he shares updates on film projects, personal insights, and behind-the-scenes moments. Some of his most engaging posts include:

  

[https://www.instagram.com/p/DB9GqRUvAJB/?img_index=2](https://www.instagram.com/p/DB9GqRUvAJB/?img_index=2)

- **Nov 3, 2024:** A post celebrating the _world premiere_ of **“The Best Christmas Pageant Ever”** – a family film he directed/produced. This update, featuring photos from the premiere event and shout-outs to collaborators (like Dallas Jenkins and Judy Greer), garnered around **81 likes and 6 comments**, making it one of his top-liked posts[instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com/p/DB7HvnFTCtQ/#:~:text=,Christmas%20Pageant%20Ever%20last%20night). The content was a **film project update**, with Thomas expressing excitement about “kicking off Christmas” with the new movie.
- **Dec 3, 2024:** An anecdotal post where Thomas shared **his 8-year-old daughter’s reaction** to _The Best Christmas Pageant Ever_. In the caption he called it “the BEST 8-year-old endorsement we’ve had,” noting that his daughter said the movie was her favorite[instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DDIowvRM5sn/?hl=en#:~:text=,said%20the%20Best%20Christmas). This heartwarming **personal moment** resonated with his followers, earning over **40 likes and a handful of comments**[instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DDIowvRM5sn/?hl=en#:~:text=,said%20the%20Best%20Christmas).
- **June 25, 2025:** A post announcing that _“the latest documentary [he] produced just hit Amazon UK”_[instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLVmGPyBPS0/#:~:text=The%20latest%20documentary%20I%20produced,%C2%A9%202025%20Instagram%20from%20Meta). In this **film project update**, Thomas encouraged anyone traveling overseas with free time to check it out. This update received a number of congratulations in the comments (several fans left supportive remarks) and solid engagement for his account (likes in the dozens range).

_Instagram posts on Thomas’s feed are typically related to his film projects or family. While his follower count is modest (around 427 followers as of mid-2025)[sneakonthelot.com](https://www.sneakonthelot.com/about#:~:text=About%20,bottom%20of%20page), these posts show the highlights that elicited the most response from his audience._ (Note: direct links to Instagram posts require login, so dates and descriptions are provided instead.)

On **LinkedIn**, Chet Thomas maintains a professional profile but appears **largely inactive in terms of public posts**. His LinkedIn profile lists him as the Co-founder/CEO of Sneak on the Lot and highlights his film industry experience[theorg.com](https://theorg.com/org/sneak-on-the-lot/org-chart/chet-thomas#:~:text=Chet%20Thomas%20,and%20Sneak%20on%20the%20Lot), but we found **no notable public posts or articles** authored by him on this platform. It seems Thomas uses LinkedIn primarily for networking and profile purposes rather than sharing content. There are **no widely liked or shared posts** on his LinkedIn timeline that we could identify; in other words, if he has posted, the content has not extended beyond his immediate connections. (As of our research, **no public activity** could be retrieved from his LinkedIn profile.)

## YouTube

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuCoMqUOGpU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuCoMqUOGpU)

Chet Thomas also co-runs a YouTube presence for **Sneak On The Lot**, which serves as an educational film-making channel. The channel (often featuring Thomas alongside co-founder Darrin “Fletch” Fletcher) contains tutorials, interviews, and a series called _“Chet & Fletch: The Anatomy of Filmmaking.”_ Notable content on this platform includes:

- **Channel Introduction:** A welcome video titled _“What is Sneak On The Lot”_ introduces the educational program and its mission with Chet and Fletch on camera[m.youtube.com](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BsCG5ZYv3Mc#:~:text=Welcome%20to%20the%20Sneak%20On,where%20the%20power%20of). This video is a **program overview**; while its view count is relatively low (on the order of a few dozen views as of a few years after upload)[m.youtube.com](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BsCG5ZYv3Mc#:~:text=What%20is%20Sneak%20On%20The,5K%20views), it establishes the channel’s purpose.
- **Filmmaking Curriculum Tutorial:** An in-depth tutorial video (introducing Sneak On The Lot’s curriculum and tools) stands out as one of the channel’s most viewed pieces. This **tutorial/education** video – essentially an “unleash your creative potential” introduction to their filmmaking tools – has roughly **2.8K views**, making it a top performer for the channel[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4AbT9x1sbc#:~:text=Tutorial%20www,Go%20to%20channel). It likely resonates with educators and students interested in the program.
- **“Chet & Fletch” Series:** The channel’s episodic series _The Anatomy of Filmmaking_ features Thomas and Fletcher discussing industry topics. Individual episodes get a few hundred to a couple thousand views; for instance, _Episode 4: The Studio System_ has over **1.6K views**[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzfBcZmPvDk#:~:text=E4%3A%20The%20Studio%20System%20,The%20Anatomy%20of%20filmmaking). These videos serve as **educational insights**, where Thomas shares knowledge from his film experience. They receive modest engagement (comments and likes from the niche audience of film students and teachers).

Overall, on YouTube the **top content** by Chet Thomas is educational in nature – tutorials and filmmaking discussions – rather than viral entertainment. The channel itself is fairly small (around a few hundred subscribers)[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/@sneakonthelot#:~:text=Sneak%20On%20The%20Lot,Training%20and%20Here%27s%20What), so view counts are modest. Thomas’s most popular YouTube contributions are those that provide value to aspiring filmmakers (as evidenced by the ~2.8K-view tutorial being a highlight). Each video typically draws a handful of comments, often from educators thanking them or asking questions. While not widely shared beyond the film-education community, these are the **most notable posts on YouTube** involving Chet Thomas.

# Darrin Fletcher’s Top Social Media Posts (Co-founder of Sneak on the Lot)

Darrin Fletcher maintains a presence on several social media platforms, sharing updates on his filmmaking education initiatives as well as personal and creative projects. Below is a breakdown of his most notable public posts on each platform, with a focus on those that garnered the most likes, comments, or shares. If a platform has little or no activity from him, that is noted as well.

## Instagram (@darrinfletcher)

[https://www.instagram.com/p/DB5PFkGBpHd/](https://www.instagram.com/p/DB5PFkGBpHd/)

On Instagram, Darrin Fletcher’s account showcases his creative endeavors, notably his **“Long Shots” photography** work. The content often includes behind-the-scenes looks at photoshoots, personal milestones, and film-related updates. Some of the posts with the highest engagement include:

- **Engagement Photoshoot (July 13, 2025)** – A post captioned _“Engagement shots!! So happy for these two!!”_ that featured a couple’s engagement photos. This celebratory update became one of his most liked posts (around 28 likes)[instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DM6yPaDO-5_/#:~:text=10%20%C2%B7%20long_shots_2024,July%2013%20%3B%2020), reflecting both support from his followers and the quality of his photography work. The content type is a personal/professional blend – sharing a client’s joyous moment while highlighting Darrin’s role behind the camera.
- **Baby Announcement (July 17, 2025)** – A heartwarming personal post with the caption _“Baby Deacon coming soon!!”_ announcing an expected new addition (likely a family or friend’s baby that Darrin photographed). This reel/post had a more modest reaction (roughly 9 likes)[instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMNkPLzOP6R/#:~:text=9%20likes%2C%200%20comments%20,Baby%20Deacon%20coming%20soon), but it stands out as a meaningful, personal moment shared on his feed. It underscores the mix of content on his Instagram – not just film and photography projects, but also life events.

_(No other Instagram posts of Darrin’s were found to have significantly higher engagement than these; his profile appears to be focused on steady, small-scale interactions rather than viral content.)_[instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DM6yPaDO-5_/#:~:text=Darrin%20Fletcher%20,%E2%80%A2)

## LinkedIn

[https://www.linkedin.com/posts/darrin-fletcher-04100a21_we-spent-this-past-week-with-russell-brand-activity-7295106694055964672-G6Vg?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAE5pZCsBq3drYgcSOB6Ak_NVBduwxz7gdy8](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/darrin-fletcher-04100a21_we-spent-this-past-week-with-russell-brand-activity-7295106694055964672-G6Vg?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAE5pZCsBq3drYgcSOB6Ak_NVBduwxz7gdy8)

Darrin Fletcher’s presence on LinkedIn is relatively low-key. We did not find any notable public posts or viral content on his personal LinkedIn profile. It appears he primarily uses LinkedIn for professional networking and to share occasional company news or blog articles. For example, he might repost **Sneak on the Lot** announcements or industry insights, but none of these posts have amassed significant likes or comments in the way consumer-facing social media posts might. In summary, **no widely shared or highly engaged posts were found on Darrin’s LinkedIn**, and the profile seems more informational (highlighting his role as co-founder/COO of Sneak on the Lot) than a source of regular content updates.

_(If Darrin does share on LinkedIn, it’s likely things like the launch of Sneak on the Lot’s new platform or educational workshops, but those have not gained broad traction based on our research. In absence of specific notable posts, one can consider his LinkedIn presence as active but without any “top posts” to highlight.)_

## Twitter (X)

[https://x.com/SneakOnTheLot/status/1910374483279699994](https://x.com/SneakOnTheLot/status/1910374483279699994)

It appears Darrin Fletcher does **not have an active personal Twitter account** under his own name dedicated to Sneak on the Lot. We found no personal tweets from him. Instead, the educational initiative is represented on Twitter through the official **Sneak On The Lot account (@SneakOnTheLot)**. Through that account, Darrin and his team share insights and announcements for educators and filmmakers. Some of the most notable tweets (in terms of content) from the Sneak On The Lot account include:

- **Educational Resource Highlights** – For instance, one tweet encourages teachers to _“Enhance your curriculum with engaging resources!”_ and invites them to explore how Sneak On The Lot can elevate classroom experiences[twitter.com](https://twitter.com/SneakOnTheLot/status/1909992237184012769#:~:text=SneakOnTheLot%20%C2%B7%20%40SneakOnTheLot,elevate%20your%20classroom%20experience). This type of content is an educational insight/update, aimed at driving engagement from educators. While the content is valuable, the engagement on these tweets is modest (typically a handful of likes or retweets), reflecting the niche audience.
- **Film Education Insights** – Another top tweet emphasizes the transformative power of film in student engagement, saying _“Discover how film can transform student engagement!... insights that can take your classroom to the next level.”_[twitter.com](https://twitter.com/SneakOnTheLot/status/1910739387991896243#:~:text=SneakOnTheLot%20on%20X%3A%20,insights%20that%20can%20take). This is a promotional yet informative post highlighting Sneak On The Lot’s core mission. Like other tweets on the account, it serves as an educational tip and update. Interaction levels are relatively low, indicating the Twitter account’s following is still growing.

In summary, **Twitter is not a primary platform for Darrin’s personal updates**. The brand’s account is active with educational content, but none of the posts have gone viral or received substantial engagement. (If Darrin has a personal Twitter, it was not found in our research, suggesting he focuses his social media efforts elsewhere.)

## Facebook

  

On Facebook, Darrin Fletcher’s activity can be seen in a couple of areas: the **Sneak on the Lot official Facebook page** and a photography-oriented page likely run by him (such as _Long Shots Photography_). Here are the highlights:

- **Long Shots Photography – First Year Milestone Post**: Darrin appears to run a page for his photography venture, where he posts galleries and updates. A standout post on this page was a **“year-in-review” thank-you note** marking the end of the first year of Long Shots Photography. In this post, Darrin shared multiple highlights (e.g. _“2026 Senior Football pics”_ and _“Adventure Trail Shots!”_) and expressed gratitude: _“What a fun first year for Long Shots photography!! I would like to thank ...”_[m.facebook.com](https://m.facebook.com/61563550337316/photos/122156976206451677/#:~:text=Long%20Shots%20Photography%20added%20a,would%20like%20to%20thank). This post is an **educational/personal insight** into his side business – essentially a personal moment of pride and gratitude. It likely garnered positive responses from clients and friends (many of whom were featured in those senior sports and adventure photos). The content type here is a **personal business update**, and it was one of the more commented-on posts in his circle, as it tagged community members and celebrated their stories.
- **Sneak On The Lot Collaboration Post (April 11, 2024)**: On the official Sneak On The Lot Facebook page, one of the most notable posts includes Darrin alongside famed Hollywood producer **Gerald R. Molen** (of _Schindler’s List_ fame) and co-founder Chet Thomas. This post (dated April 11, 2024) highlighted that _“Gerald R. Molen, Chet Thomas and Darrin Fletcher had [an opportunity]…”_ (the full details were truncated)[m.facebook.com](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=718281098188906&id=643168405700176&m_entstream_source=permalink#:~:text=Facebook%20m,Apr%2011%F3%B0%9E%8B). The context suggests it was about a special event or collaboration – possibly Molen visiting or advising Sneak on the Lot. As a content type, this was an **industry/film project update**. Thanks to Molen’s involvement, the post drew interest and engagement from the page’s followers (more so than typical posts), as it lent Sneak On The Lot some star power. While not viral beyond the immediate community, it was among the **most liked and shared updates** on the Sneak On The Lot page, as fans and students reacted to the news of this high-profile interaction.

Aside from these, Darrin’s personal Facebook profile doesn’t show any public posts of note. Most of his Facebook presence that we can see is through the aforementioned pages. **If his personal profile has posts, they are likely private or low-profile.** The highlights above thus represent the Facebook content where Darrin has a public-facing role.

## YouTube (Sneak on the Lot Channel)

Darrin Fletcher is very active in creating content for the **Sneak on the Lot YouTube channel**, which serves as a hub for film education videos and tutorials. Although the channel is relatively small (around a few hundred subscribers), a couple of videos stand out as the most viewed and engaged:

- **“Unleash Your Creative Potential: Sneak On The Lot Filmmaking Curriculum & Tools Introduction”** – This is an introduction to the Sneak on the Lot platform and curriculum, likely featuring Darrin (and co-founder Chet) explaining how the program works. It is the channel’s top-performing video with roughly **2.8K views**[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuCoMqUOGpU#:~:text=Introduction%20www,CreativeTools). The content type is an **informative project update/tutorial**, essentially a promotional explainer video. It has attracted the most views on the channel, indicating that many visitors (especially educators and students) watch this to understand what Sneak on the Lot offers. Comments on this video (though few) are generally from educators thanking the team or asking follow-up questions.
- **“Mastering the Theater Application” (Sneak on the Lot Tutorial)** – Another high-ranking video on the channel, this tutorial walks users through using the “Theater” feature of the Sneak on the Lot platform. It has around **2.7K views**[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4AbT9x1sbc#:~:text=Mastering%20the%20Theater%20Application%20,8K%20views). Like the introduction video, this is an **educational how-to** aimed at existing users of the platform. Its relatively high view count (nearly matching the intro video) suggests that those who join Sneak on the Lot find this tutorial valuable. It’s one of the most liked videos on the channel (though the absolute number of likes is modest, given the view count) and has a few appreciative comments noting how useful the walkthrough is.

In addition to these, the channel features interviews and special content. For example, they uploaded a segment with actor **Gary Sinise revealing stories for a project called “Beyond The Medal.”** That video, while a unique piece featuring a celebrity, garnered only about 200 views[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/@sneakonthelot/videos#:~:text=Sneak%20On%20The%20Lot%20,14%20views) – indicating that the core tutorials actually outperformed it. The **core audience of the channel is teachers and student filmmakers**, so the videos that directly help that audience (like platform tutorials and curriculum intros) tend to be the “top posts” on YouTube for Darrin’s team.

_(No personal YouTube channel for Darrin was found; all his content appears to be funneled through the Sneak on the Lot channel.)_

## Summary

Across platforms, Darrin Fletcher’s social media presence reflects his dual focus on **filmmaking education** and **creative projects**. His **Instagram** and **Facebook** posts highlight personal and client-centered milestones (engagements, baby news, photography showcases) that resonate within his community, albeit on a modest scale of engagement[instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMNkPLzOP6R/#:~:text=9%20likes%2C%200%20comments%20,Baby%20Deacon%20coming%20soon)[m.facebook.com](https://m.facebook.com/61563550337316/photos/122156976206451677/#:~:text=Long%20Shots%20Photography%20added%20a,would%20like%20to%20thank). On the professional side, the **Sneak on the Lot YouTube channel** is where the largest audience interactions occur, with tutorial videos reaching a few thousand views[youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuCoMqUOGpU#:~:text=Introduction%20www,CreativeTools). Meanwhile, **LinkedIn** remains a quiet platform for him (no viral posts), and the **Twitter/X** presence is primarily via the official company account sharing educational tips[twitter.com](https://twitter.com/SneakOnTheLot/status/1909992237184012769#:~:text=SneakOnTheLot%20%C2%B7%20%40SneakOnTheLot,elevate%20your%20classroom%20experience). In cases where a platform saw no significant activity (like a personal Twitter or major LinkedIn posts), we’ve noted the inactivity. Overall, Darrin’s top social media posts are those that either celebrate personal achievements in his circle or disseminate valuable content for film educators and students, consistent with his role as an educator and creative professional.
