Basic Summary: Darrin "Fletch" Fletcher and Chet Thomas created Sneak on the Lot, an educational program that teaches filmmaking and provides a pathway into Hollywood for students, especially those who may feel marginalized. The program emphasizes that filmmaking is for everyone, not just film students, and encourages students to explore various roles in the industry. They have developed a virtual 3D backlot for students to learn and audition for real productions, aiming to foster creativity and positive expression while addressing dark themes in storytelling. Their approach focuses on reducing stress and promoting a supportive environment, offering a genuine alternative to traditional film industry entry points.

# The Hollywood Veterans Teaching Kids to Break Into Film

When the Columbine shooting unfolded on live radio in April 1999, Darrin "Fletch" Fletcher was driving to the set of _Touched by an Angel_. The veteran storyboard artist, whose portfolio included _[The Sandlot](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108037/)_, found himself gripped by a single question: "When was it okay to suddenly bring a gun to school?"

Three days later, he visited his brother's high school classroom and asked students to write essays about their feelings—or how close they might be to doing something similar. Of the 60-70 papers he collected, three or four students admitted they were "pretty close."

"If there are three students of my brother's that are close," Fletcher remembers thinking, "how many more are out there around the country, around the world?"

That realization led to [Sneak on the Lot](https://sneakonthelot.com/) in 2000. Today, Fletcher and his business partner Chet Thomas run an educational program that has evolved from teaching filmmaking basics into a genuine Hollywood pipeline—complete with a virtual 3D backlot where students audition for real productions.

  

Fletcher and Thomas bring serious Hollywood credentials. Fletcher started at 16 as a layout artist for Saturday morning cartoons before becoming a storyboard artist on major films. Thomas worked his way through the DreamWorks system on productions like _Saving Private Ryan_, _Meet the Parents_, and _Minority Report_, where he watched Steven Spielberg direct Tom Cruise.

Their recent _[The Best Christmas Pageant Ever](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15396896/)_ for Lionsgate earned a streaming release. Now they produce and direct for [Angel Studios](https://www.angel.com/).

But ask about their proudest achievement, and Fletcher tells you about a goth kid from those first years.

  

## The Kid Who Grew Ten Feet Tall

"He was a dark soul," Fletcher recalls of the student who drove 45 minutes each way to their building, arriving in a trench coat with black-dyed hair and makeup. "He would come almost every day."

Fletcher recognized the gift immediately. "I knew right away this kid was a talented writer—way ahead of his age." The teenager wanted to direct, but Fletcher kept pushing: "If I were you with your skill, I'd start as a writer. Directing will come, but start with writing. That's what you're really good at."

The student wrote several films that year. When they entered them in a local festival, something extraordinary happened.

"It was fun to watch him—this hunched-over, short kid—go down the aisle repeatedly to collect his awards," Fletcher remembers. "He won about five trophies that day, and each time he would go down and get a trophy, he would grow a little. By the time he was done, that kid was like ten feet tall."

Today, that former goth kid sells scripts for six figures in Hollywood. His companions from those days? One owns an LA equipment rental company. Another anchors Fox News. A former student has worked on ten Spielberg films.

"It changed his life," Fletcher says simply.

## Rethinking Film Education

"All we knew how to do was make movies," Fletcher admits about those post-Columbine days. "Which on the surface might seem pathetic—'You're just entertainers.' But when you realize what it takes to make a movie, you can employ every single classroom of a high school."

This became Sneak on the Lot's core philosophy: filmmaking isn't just for film students.

"It takes the creative kind who maybe aren't accepted by others as much in high school," Thomas explains. "It takes the analytical person who's great at math—we'll slide you right in as a line producer. There's a place for that super social person on the marketing team."

Athletes become stuntmen. History students research period pieces. Even culinary students matter. "One of the most important parts on set is eating and being fed," Thomas notes.

After making 40-50 short films that first year, patterns emerged. Students understood editing but "absolutely loathed writing"—even though, as Fletcher notes, it's "some of the most fun stuff there is in the business."

They also noticed students gravitating toward dark themes—suicide, violence, despair.

"We'd say, 'No, we're not going to let you make one of those. Make something nice, something funny,'" Fletcher recalls. "We wanted to guide students not just through making movies, but through life. It's easy to bring darkness; there aren't many people bringing light."

## Building the Virtual Backlot

Fletcher and Thomas always envisioned a digital space that would teach students how Hollywood works simply by navigating it. Twenty years after starting with basic web tools, they've built "Sneak On" using [Unity](https://unity.com/)—a 3D virtual backlot where students create avatars, walk around studio lots, and learn from virtual mentors.

"You can upload your movie, watch others' movies, and hear about opportunities," Fletcher describes. Students post marketing posters and—crucially—audition for real productions.

"For people in Hollywood, it's strange," Thomas admits. "'What? It's a game? I have to upload my audition in this environment with avatars?' We say, 'Trust us. We might be ahead of our time, but that's okay. We've always been ahead of our time.'"

  

  

  

  

## Real Jobs, Real Impact

While the virtual backlot remains in beta, the casting potential is real. They cast their production _Mystic Hollow_ through the platform and plan to source talent for their upcoming slate—six or seven television series at Angel Studios—the same way.

"We've got our eye on a couple of students who've proven themselves," Fletcher says. "That's what Sneak On is built to do—filter out and find the best of the best. If we can do that, we'll pluck them out and put them in our own projects."

One early student messaged Fletcher from Broadway, where he's performed for two decades: "You changed my life. That one year in that building made me realize I could do this for a living."

  

  

## The Bottom Line Beyond the Bottom Line

In an industry notorious for crushing pressure, Thomas and Fletcher cultivate a different approach—one they're embedding in the next generation.

"Life is just too short to create more stress than you need when the stress is already there," Thomas says. "It's great to have fun while getting it done and lifting others."

This philosophy permeates the curriculum. The question isn't just "Can you make this?" but "Should you? What are you adding to the world?"

"Part of it is because we're stupid!" Fletcher laughs when asked why they took on such an ambitious project. "We're always taking on probably more than we can do. A year later you're like, 'Hey, we did it. I can't believe we pulled that off.'"

But beneath the self-deprecation lies something profound. As Hollywood grapples with disruption, Sneak on the Lot offers a radical alternative: a path into the industry that doesn't require connections, film school debt, or living in Los Angeles.

Twenty-five years after starting their program, what began as two filmmakers' response to tragedy has evolved into something neither expected: a genuine alternative to Hollywood's traditional gatekeepers.

"We wanted to do something for students," Fletcher reflects. "What it did was give students an opportunity to express themselves in a nonviolent, productive, creative way. It was far more effective than I originally would have thought."

Now, with their virtual backlot in development and real productions planning to cast through it, Thomas and Fletcher are proving that sometimes the best way to break into Hollywood isn't through the front gate—it's by sneaking onto the lot.

## Building the Virtual Backlot

Twenty-five years ago, Chet and Fletch envisioned a digital space that would teach students how Hollywood works simply by navigating it. "I wanted to create an environment where the sheer navigation through the website would teach you how the film industry worked," Fletch explains.

The technology wasn't ready then. But two decades later, using a software platform called [Unity](https://unity.com/), they began building "[Sneak On](https://www.sneakon.com/)"—a 3D virtual backlot where students create avatars, walk around studio lots, and interact with non-player characters who explain their roles.

"You can upload your movie, watch others' movies, and hear about opportunities," Fletch describes. Students can post marketing posters and—crucially—audition for real productions.

"For people in Hollywood, it's strange," Chet admits. "'What? It's a game? I have to upload my audition in this environment with avatars?' We say, 'Trust us. We might be ahead of our time, but that's okay.'"

## Real Jobs, Real Impact

While the virtual backlot is still in beta, the casting potential is real. They cast their production _Mystic Hollow_ through the platform and plan to source all talent for their upcoming slate—six or seven television series at Angel Studios—the same way.

One early student messaged Fletcher from Broadway, where he's been performing for two decades: "You changed my life. That one year in that building made me realize I could do this for a living."

A former student has worked on about ten Steven Spielberg movies. "He's working on the biggest movies in Hollywood," Thomas notes.

## The Bottom Line (Beyond the Bottom Line)

In an industry notorious for crushing pressure, Chet & Fletch have cultivated a different approach—one they're embedding in the next generation.

"Life is just too short to create more stress than you need when the stress is already there," Chet says. "It's great to have fun while getting it done and lifting others."

This philosophy permeates the curriculum. While they don't prohibit dark content categorically, they encourage students to consider their impact. The question isn't just "Can you make this?" but "Should you? What are you adding to the world?"

"Part of it is because we're stupid!" Fletch laughs when asked why they took on such an ambitious project. "We're always taking on probably more than we can do. A year later you're like, 'Hey, we did it. I can't believe we pulled that off.'"

Now, with their virtual backlot in development and real productions already planning to cast through it, Thomas and Fletcher are proving that sometimes the best way to break into Hollywood isn't through the front gate—it's by sneaking onto the lot.
