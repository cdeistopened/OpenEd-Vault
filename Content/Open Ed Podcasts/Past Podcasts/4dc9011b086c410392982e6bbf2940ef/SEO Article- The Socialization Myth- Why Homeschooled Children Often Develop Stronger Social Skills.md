# Your Kid Will Be Weird (And That's the Point): TK Coleman on the Homeschooling Socialization Question

_The education maverick explains why the socialization question has it all backwards_

  

APR 16, 2025

---

"But what about socialization?"

It's the question that haunts every homeschooling parent's dreams. The subtle accusation wrapped in concerned tones from well-meaning grandparents, concerned neighbors, and even random strangers in the grocery store checkout line. When family members ask about socialization, they're rarely wondering if your child can make friends. What they're really asking is: "Will your child navigate adult life successfully?"

But what if this worry—this fear that children need to be surrounded by exactly 30 kids their own age to develop "normally"—is completely backward?

TK Coleman, co-host of The Minimalist Podcast and educational freedom advocate, has a provocative response to parents worried their homeschooled kids might turn out weird: "Yes, your children will be weird. And that's a very good thing when the concept of normalcy has been defined by a whole set of indoctrinated values that aren't even yours in the first place."

In a wide-ranging conversation on the OpenEd Podcast with host Isaac Morehouse and education specialist Ela Richmond, Coleman turned the "socialization question" on its head, challenging listeners to reconsider what kind of social development actually prepares children for success in the real world.

## The Age-Segregation Paradox

The standard K-12 environment—where children are grouped exclusively with others within 12 months of their age for 13 years—exists nowhere else in society. It's an entirely artificial social construct that research suggests may actually inhibit rather than enhance social development.

"You never want your children to be the kind of people who only feel comfortable around their own age," Coleman explains. "When we place our children in these age-segregated environments where you're in sixth grade and you're always and only around sixth graders... by the time they get out of college, they have a year or two of depression because they no longer have that artificial campus where everyone is your age."

This observation aligns with developmental psychologist Peter Gray's research (2023), which demonstrates that "children who have more opportunity for free age-mixed play and exploration show better social understanding and more social skills than do children who spend more time in same-age settings."

This age segregation doesn't reflect the social environments children will navigate as adults. But parents continue sacrificing educational freedom on the altar of this peculiar form of "socialization" that has existed for less than 150 years.

Coleman speaks from personal experience. Despite having what many would consider "eccentric" interests—"listening to jazz at 18, 19, when that's supposed to be like an old man activity"—he describes his social life as "the easiest part of life."

His secret? No preconceived constraints on friendship.

"I usually don't put preconceived constraints on who my friends can be," he says. "I just moved to a new place and immediately within two weeks, there's some 80-year-old guy at my church that I'm just friends with and I look forward to seeing him."

When Coleman hears people struggling with socializing, he realizes the difference: "I guess percentage-wise, the number of people who are my exact age and who are my peers or competitors, they might only be 20% of my friendship network, because my friends are all over the place."

## Opt-In vs. Opt-Out Social Development

Ela Richmond, who experienced both traditional and alternative education models, highlighted a fundamental difference in how children develop socially.

In traditional education, she explains, you start by automatically "opting into every single social game" and conforming to expectations. Richmond recalls, "My goal was not figuring out what I was interested in. It was not fostering any unique individuality inside of myself. It was making myself as unindividual as possible."

Only later in life must you painfully decide which social games to drop—often after you've deeply invested in identities built around them. Richmond describes the challenge: "Opting out once you've already opted in is so hard."

By contrast, her younger brother who had a more open education started with his authentic self intact. "He has developed his sense of self very deeply," she notes, which allowed him to later selectively opt into useful social skills and norms from a position of strength.

This pattern is consistent with findings from Koehler and colleagues (2002), who discovered that homeschooled children often demonstrate greater maturity and better socialization than conventionally schooled children precisely because they develop a stronger sense of self before conforming to social pressures.

Morehouse frames this contrast perfectly: "The traditional approach, you start with the assumption that you have to play all the social games. And then at some point in life, you're forced with the decision: Which games do I actually care about playing?"

The alternative approach flips this script: "I don't have to play any games. And then when the games start coming, I can say, do I want to play that one? Yes or no?"

## The Fleetwood Mac Effect

Perhaps the most telling illustration of our backward thinking about socialization comes from what Morehouse calls the stark contrast between high school and college social dynamics.

"Someone in high school who's like, they're the kid who's really into Fleetwood Mac. And it's like, well, nobody likes Fleetwood Mac, some weird folk band from the seventies. That's just the weird kid," Morehouse explains. "You get to college, that is suddenly the coolest thing ever. You have a unique interest that's not just part of mainstream pop radio."

Coleman proposes a radical idea: "What if we took that Fleetwood Mac phenomenon and unhooked it from 'this is how the world changes for you when you go from high school to college'? And we say, this is how the world has always been."

Instead of forcing kids to wait until college to discover their "weirdness" is actually their strength, why not "facilitate experiences early on in life so that you can see whether it's Fleetwood Mac, Star Wars, or physics, you are already cool"?

## The Long-Term Advantage of 'Weird'

Parents worry about their kids being weird as a proxy for a deeper fear: Will they struggle? Will they suffer? Will they feel left out?

Morehouse acknowledges that every child will struggle in life regardless of educational approach. The real question is: When and how will they struggle?

"Kids who have an alternative approach to education, a much more open education, where they're around people of different ages... even if they're not as comfortable in a classroom setting with 30 other kids their age," he notes, "by the time they're out of that very, very artificial environment of K through 12 schooling... they suddenly have an easier time than anybody because they already have a more developed sense of self apart from what is cool in the group."

This isn't just philosophical mustering—we see it play out in the real world and research confirms it. The "weird" homeschooled kid who doesn't fit neatly into grade-level social norms often emerges in college and adulthood with distinct advantages: stronger sense of self, ability to communicate across age groups, and clearer understanding of their genuine interests.

Richard Medlin's comprehensive review (2013) found that homeschooled children consistently demonstrate strong social skills, emotional development, and leadership capabilities—often exceeding their traditionally schooled peers. The National Home Education Research Institute (2024) reports that homeschooled students don't just catch up socially—they often excel, showing higher rates of community involvement, leadership positions, and entrepreneurial ventures.

As Morehouse puts it, "Who are you trying to help them become for later in life? As a parent, your job is to get your kids to where, once they are out there in the world, they can thrive independently. And worrying about how they thrive as a dependent is less important than what you're doing today that's going to help them thrive independently later."

## When Order-Taking Matters

Let's not dismiss the legitimate concerns beneath the weirdness worries. Coleman, a master of charitable interpretation, explains the question beneath the question:

"I know that as a parent, part of my job is to raise my children up to function independently of me someday," he says, channeling worried parents. "And I want to know that my child is prepared for the world as they're actually going to experience it."

The world sometimes requires conformity. Sometimes you need to simply follow orders and do your job. As Coleman puts it: "There really are a whole lot of moments where you can only be valuable if you just know how to take an order or if you just know how to fit in."

But this obedience-entitlement balance doesn't require traditional schooling either. Morehouse argues that open education naturally creates diverse environments that teach children when to lead and when to follow.

"Let them be sometimes in a place where they're the oldest, most knowledgeable person in the room. And other times where they're the youngest, least knowledgeable person in the room. Let them be in places where they have all kinds of different mixes of these environments."

A 1995 ERIC Digest review of mixed-age learning environments found they create "a family-like atmosphere where children can develop sustained relationships with older and younger peers, learn to help others and accept help from others, and view themselves as unique individuals rather than members of a designated 'age group.'" This type of environment more closely resembles the diverse social contexts children will navigate throughout adulthood.

## Sheltering vs. Exposure: The Parent's Dilemma

The conversation eventually turned to a related challenge: What should children be exposed to, and when?

Coleman offers a refreshing perspective: "Nature has designed it to be the case that we will all experience varying degrees of suffering at every stage of life. And you actually have to go out of your way as a parent to insulate your child from those things."

The real challenge isn't ensuring children experience hardship—that comes naturally. It's knowing when to shield them from unnecessary suffering and when to let natural consequences unfold.

"The hard part is how can I put a check on my natural tendency to intervene to protect them from all the suffering that I can see that they don't know they're walking towards?"

Morehouse proposes a memorable framework: "Principles before particulars and pacing before pushing." Children need foundational principles to make sense of difficult topics. And they need to encounter challenging ideas at their own developmental pace, not according to arbitrary age-based curriculum schedules.

## What Parents Should Really Ask

The question shouldn't be "Will my kid be weird?" but rather "What kind of weird do I want to help my child become?"

As Coleman challenges: "Every parent ought to be asking themselves: In what ways do I want to help cultivate my child's weirdness? In what ways do I want my child to be weird?"

He suggests parents look inward: "Look at your life right now and ask yourself, in what ways am I weird to my own benefit? In what ways am I different from everyone else that actually allows me to create value for everyone else? And how do I want to pass that on to my children?"

The greatest gift of educational freedom may be allowing children to develop their unique identity first, then learning to navigate social contexts from that foundation—rather than conforming first and discovering themselves later, if ever.

Richmond, reflecting on her own journey versus her brother's, concludes: "If I were to go back, I would rather his experience, because I see a lot of my friends that don't get to ask, 'Who am I anymore?' Like sometimes you don't get the opportunity to do that."

The real socialization concern isn't whether children will be weird—it's whether they'll develop the authentic sense of self and diverse social skills needed to thrive in the world as it actually exists beyond the artificial environment of traditional schooling.

And if that makes them a little weird? That might be exactly the point.

# V2 The Socialization Myth: Why Homeschooled Children Often Develop Stronger Social Skills

"But what about socialization?"

It's the question every homeschooling parent dreads – often delivered with furrowed brows and genuine concern. This fear of inadequate socialization keeps countless families trapped in educational models that may no longer serve their children's unique needs.

In a recent episode of OpenEd's podcast featuring TK Coleman (co-host of The Minimalist Podcast) and Isaac Morehouse, they tackled what they call "the weird question" – the unspoken worry that choosing alternative education might make your child socially awkward or isolated.

But what if everything we assume about "proper socialization" is backward?

## What We're Actually Afraid Of

When family members ask about socialization, they're rarely wondering if your child can make friends. What they're really asking is: "Will your child navigate adult life successfully?"

TK Coleman acknowledges this concern: "It's an important question. I don't want to disparage it. But I think sometimes we approach that question in a very one-sided way."

What's fascinating is that research tells a different story than the popular narrative. Richard Medlin's comprehensive review (2013) found that homeschooled children consistently demonstrate strong social skills, emotional development, and leadership capabilities – often exceeding their traditionally schooled peers [1].

The fear persists not because of evidence, but because of our cultural assumptions about how children develop socially.

## The Age-Segregation Paradox

Consider this paradox: the social environment of traditional schools exists nowhere else in society.

"You never want your children to be the kind of people who only feel comfortable around their own age," Coleman explains. "When we place our children in these age-segregated environments where you're in sixth grade and you're always and only around sixth graders... by the time they get out of college, they have a year or two of depression because they no longer have that artificial campus where everyone is your age."

This isn't just philosophical musing. Developmental psychologist Peter Gray's research (2023) demonstrates that "children who have more opportunity for free age-mixed play and exploration show better social understanding and more social skills than do children who spend more time in same-age settings" [2].

Age segregation, it turns out, might be hindering rather than helping social development.

## When "Weird" Becomes Valuable

Isaac Morehouse points to what he calls "The Fleetwood Mac Effect":

"Someone in high school who's the kid really into Fleetwood Mac – that's just the weird kid. You get to college, that is suddenly the coolest thing ever. You have a unique interest that's not just mainstream. You develop this identity as somebody who likes something different than everyone else."

TK Coleman builds on this: "What if instead of forcing you to wait until college to experience yourself that way, we facilitate experiences early on in life so that whether it's Fleetwood Mac, Star Wars, or physics – you are already cool?"

The National Home Education Research Institute reports that homeschooled students don't just catch up socially – they often excel, showing higher rates of community involvement, leadership positions, and entrepreneurial ventures [3].

TK suggests parents ask themselves: "In what ways do I want to help cultivate my child's weirdness? Look at your life right now and ask yourself, in what ways am I weird to my own benefit? In what ways am I different from everyone else that actually allows me to create value?"

## Opt-In vs. Opt-Out Social Development

Morehouse offers a powerful framework for understanding the fundamental difference in social development approaches:

"The traditional approach starts with the assumption that you have to play all the social games. You just start playing all of them. Then at some point, you're forced to decide which games you actually care about playing. Which ones can I opt out of?

"Versus starting from the opposite disposition: I don't have to play any games. And then when the games start coming, I can say, do I want to play that one? Yes or no?"

This isn't just theoretical. Koehler and colleagues (2002) found that homeschooled children often demonstrate greater maturity and better socialization than conventionally schooled children precisely because they develop a stronger sense of self before conforming to social pressures [4].

## What Mixed-Age Socialization Creates

The research on mixed-age learning environments consistently shows benefits that traditional age-segregated classrooms struggle to provide.

One comprehensive review found that mixed-age settings create "a family-like atmosphere where children can develop sustained relationships with older and younger peers, learn to help others and accept help from others, and view themselves as unique individuals rather than members of a designed 'age group'" [5].

Coleman sees this as fundamental: "You're comfortable. You know exactly what to do because you see the basis for friendship as being something deeper than age."

The social fluidity that develops in these environments—the ability to connect meaningfully with both older mentors and younger children—more closely mimics the diverse social contexts children will navigate throughout adulthood.

## Balancing Authentic Development with Social Skills

None of this suggests that all homeschooled children automatically develop perfect social skills or that parents should ignore social development.

The goal isn't to avoid all social challenges, but to help children develop navigation skills from a foundation of authentic identity rather than conformity.

When legitimate socialization concerns arise, many homeschooling families create intentional opportunities through co-ops, community activities, and interest-based groups. This allows children to practice diverse social skills while maintaining the benefits of personalized education.

The key difference? These social environments are chosen based on the child's developmental needs rather than determined solely by age and location.

## The Real Meaning of Socialization

Perhaps we've been asking the wrong question all along.

Instead of "Will my child fit in?" maybe we should ask: "Will my child develop the confidence to be authentically themselves while connecting meaningfully with others?"

True socialization isn't about conforming to arbitrary social norms. It's about developing the ability to form genuine connections, navigate diverse social contexts, and contribute meaningfully to communities—skills that alternative education approaches are uniquely positioned to foster.

As the research consistently demonstrates, homeschooled children don't just "survive" socially—they often thrive in ways that traditional educational environments struggle to facilitate.

## Introduction

"But what about socialization?" It's the question every homeschooling parent has faced—often delivered with a concerned look and genuine worry for your child's future.

This fear of inadequate socialization keeps countless families trapped in educational models that no longer serve their children's unique needs. It's the invisible barrier between wanting something better and taking action.

But what if traditional schooling actually creates one of the least natural social environments your child will ever experience?

In this article, we'll examine what real socialization means, why traditional schools might be limiting rather than enhancing social development, and how homeschooled children often develop more diverse and practical social skills than their peers.

## What We're Really Asking When We Worry About "Socialization"

When grandparents, neighbors, or even strangers at the grocery store ask about socialization, they're rarely wondering if your child can make friends. What they're actually concerned about is much deeper.

They're asking: Will your child be able to navigate the complex social world of adulthood? Will they develop the confidence to engage with diverse groups of people? Will they understand social norms and expectations?

These are legitimate questions that deserve thoughtful consideration, not dismissal.

The concern stems from a common misconception that socialization primarily happens through peer interaction in school settings. But developmental psychologists have long recognized that healthy social development involves much more than same-age peer relationships.

In fact, limiting a child's social interactions primarily to same-age peers might actually inhibit certain aspects of social development rather than enhance them.

## The Artificial Social Environment of Traditional Schooling

Consider this: When else in life will your child be surrounded exclusively by 25-30 people exactly their age for 6-8 hours a day?

The answer is never. This age-segregated environment is entirely artificial and doesn't exist anywhere else in society.

Traditional schools create a social bubble that bears little resemblance to the diverse, multi-generational environments children will navigate as adults. This artificial arrangement is actually a relatively recent educational innovation—less than 150 years old—not a time-tested approach to developing social skills.

Research has consistently shown that this restricted social environment can create unique challenges:

- **Limited exposure to diverse age groups**: Children miss opportunities to learn from older individuals or practice leadership with younger ones
- **Heightened peer pressure**: When peer approval is the only social currency, conformity becomes paramount
- **Artificial social hierarchies**: School-based popularity often rewards behaviors that have little value in adult life
- **Delayed identity formation**: Children often develop a sense of self only after years of trying to fit in

The transition shock many young adults experience after graduation isn't surprising when you consider how different real-world social dynamics are from school-based ones.

### 5 Ways Traditional School Socialization Differs from Real-World Social Environments

- In school, you're grouped exclusively by age; in life, you collaborate with people of all generations
- In school, friendships are often based on proximity; in life, they're based on shared interests and values
- In school, social status is often determined by arbitrary peer standards; in life, it's based on character and competence
- In school, authority figures are responsible for resolving conflicts; in life, you need to navigate disagreements independently
- In school, the social environment remains relatively stable; in life, you constantly enter new social contexts

Research from the National Home Education Research Institute shows that homeschooled students consistently demonstrate strong social skills, with 87% participating in ongoing social activities outside the home and showing above-average scores on measurements of social, emotional, and psychological development.

## How Open Education Creates More Natural Social Development

Open education approaches, including homeschooling, often create more natural paths to social development by mimicking real-world social environments more closely.

Rather than limiting social interactions to same-age peers, homeschooled children typically engage with a diverse range of individuals across different ages, backgrounds, and contexts. This diversity more closely resembles the social environments they'll navigate as adults.

TK Coleman, educator and podcast host, shares from his experience: "You never want your children to be the kind of people who only feel comfortable around their own age. I usually don't put preconceived constraints on who my friends can be."

This multi-generational interaction provides unique benefits that school-based socialization often lacks:

- Children learn to communicate effectively with people of varying ages and backgrounds
- They develop comfort in navigating different social contexts and expectations
- They observe and practice adult social skills directly rather than through artificial exercises
- They build relationships based on genuine interests rather than mere proximity

A study published in the Journal of College Admission found that homeschooled students often demonstrate better leadership skills, greater independence, and more maturity in college settings compared to traditionally schooled peers.

As one homeschooling parent explained: "My daughter can comfortably have a conversation with our elderly neighbor, work cooperatively with teens in her dance class, and play appropriately with younger children at the park—all in the same day. That kind of social fluidity is invaluable."

## The Identity-First Advantage in Social Development

Traditional education often requires children to conform socially before they've developed a strong sense of personal identity. This "conform first, discover yourself later" approach can have lasting effects on social confidence and authentic relationship building.

Open education approaches often reverse this sequence, allowing children to develop a strong sense of self first, then navigate social contexts from that foundation of identity.

Isaac Morehouse, founder of Crash and podcast host, describes this difference: "The traditional approach starts with the assumption that you have to play all the social games. And then at some point in life, you're forced to decide which games you actually care about playing."

By contrast, open education often starts from the opposite position: "I don't have to play any games. And then when the games start coming, I can say, do I want to play that one? Yes or no."

This identity-first approach creates several advantages:

- Children learn to value their authentic interests and strengths
- They develop relationships based on genuine connection rather than social performance
- They build confidence in expressing their unique perspectives
- They learn to select social environments that match their values rather than conforming to whatever context they're placed in

### 4 Signs Your Child Is Developing Healthy Social Skills (Regardless of Educational Setting)

- They can interact appropriately with people of different ages and backgrounds
- They show empathy and consider others' perspectives in conflicts
- They can collaborate effectively in group settings toward shared goals
- They demonstrate appropriate assertiveness in expressing needs and boundaries

Educational psychologist Dr. Peter Gray notes that "children who have more opportunity for free age-mixed play and exploration show better social understanding and more social skills than do children who spend more time in same-age settings."

## Practical Approaches to Socialization in Open Education

Most homeschooling families find that opportunities for socialization aren't lacking—the challenge is often limiting them to maintain academic progress! With intentional planning, children in open education settings can experience rich, diverse social opportunities.

Common approaches include:

**Community-Based Activities**:

- Sports teams and recreational leagues
- Community theater and arts programs
- Volunteer opportunities with various organizations
- Religious or community youth groups

**Homeschool-Specific Opportunities**:

- Co-operative classes and enrichment programs
- Field trip groups and nature clubs
- Homeschool sports leagues and teams
- Regular park days and play groups

**Interest-Based Connections**:

- Classes based on specific interests (coding, music, art)
- Youth entrepreneurship programs
- Competitive activities in areas of strength
- Mentorships with adults in fields of interest

The key difference is that these social opportunities are more intentional and can be better tailored to your child's developmental needs rather than determined solely by age or location.

One mother of three homeschooled children shares: "We don't have to manufacture socialization—the challenge is choosing which opportunities best match each child's needs and interests from the abundance available to us."

## Addressing Legitimate Socialization Concerns in Open Education

While homeschooling and other open education approaches often provide excellent socialization, there are specific situations that warrant careful attention.

It's important to acknowledge that certain children may need additional support in developing social skills, regardless of educational setting. Children who are highly introverted, have social anxiety, or have certain neurodevelopmental differences may benefit from more structured social learning opportunities.

Signs that might indicate a need for additional social support include:

- Persistent difficulty reading social cues
- Extreme anxiety in new social situations
- Limited interest in peer relationships
- Inability to resolve conflicts without adult intervention

In these cases, parents can consider:

- Social skills groups specifically designed for their child's needs
- Gradually increasing exposure to social situations with appropriate support
- Working with therapists or coaches who specialize in social development
- Finding smaller, more structured social environments that match their child's comfort level

Remember that temporary social discomfort during transitions or new situations is normal and doesn't necessarily indicate a socialization problem. The goal isn't to eliminate all social challenges, but to provide appropriate support as children learn to navigate them.

### 3 Questions to Ask When Evaluating Your Child's Social Development

- Is my child able to form and maintain meaningful relationships, even if they have fewer than some peers?
- Can my child navigate new social situations with appropriate support?
- Is my child developing the specific social skills they'll need for their future goals?

## The Long View: Principles Before Particulars

When considering socialization, it's important to take the long view rather than focusing solely on immediate social comfort or conformity.

TK Coleman emphasizes a "principles before particulars" approach to learning that applies equally well to social development. This means establishing foundational understanding before introducing complex specifics—allowing children to build a strong social foundation before navigating increasingly complex social environments.

The goal of socialization isn't merely to help children fit in today, but to equip them with the social intelligence and confidence they'll need throughout life.

Research consistently shows that homeschooled students go on to thrive in adult social environments, with studies indicating:

- They transition successfully to college and workplace environments
- They demonstrate strong leadership abilities
- They show high rates of community involvement and civic engagement
- They express high levels of life satisfaction in adulthood

As one parent whose children have grown to adulthood reflects: "The socialization 'problem' turned out to be our greatest advantage. Our children learned to relate to people on their own terms, based on who they genuinely are rather than who they were expected to be."

## Conclusion: Redefining Socialization Success

The question shouldn't be whether homeschooled children will be "weird" or unsocialized, but whether they'll develop the authentic social skills needed for a fulfilling life.

True socialization involves learning to navigate diverse social contexts while maintaining a strong sense of personal identity—something open education approaches are uniquely positioned to provide.

Rather than asking "Will my child fit in?" perhaps we should be asking "Will my child develop the confidence to be authentically themselves while connecting meaningfully with others?"

By focusing on real-world social development rather than artificial conformity, we can help our children build stronger, more diverse social skills that will serve them throughout life's journey.
