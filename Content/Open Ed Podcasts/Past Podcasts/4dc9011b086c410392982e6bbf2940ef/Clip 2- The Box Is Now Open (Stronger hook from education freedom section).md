~~**Isaac (37:43):** "Anyone who's doing two or more [education approaches] at the same time has basically said they may have it open to varying degrees. They may just have it open a crack, right? But like the box is closed. You're all in one school all day, every day that is closed."~~

~~**Isaac (38:28):** "You open up that box to varying degrees and then say, I'm gonna modularly add this one component. Now you're an open educator, you've opened it."~~

~~**Amir (38:54):** "It's an ecosystem. The other kind of verbiage I started to play with is networked schooling and that you're members of multiple networks."~~

~~**Amir (42:04):** "It's a better structural model for how humans actually are. You have these different parts to yourself, different interests, different identities and they're intersectional..."~~

  

### Revised Clip 2: "Beyond School vs. Homeschool"

**Isaac (37:43):** "Anyone who's doing two or more [education approaches] at the same time has basically said they may have it open to varying degrees. They may just have it open a crack, right? But like the box is closed. You're all in one school all day, every day that is closed."

**Amir (14:53):** "We blame our kids for our issues. That's what's happening."

**Amir (39:23):** "My son goes to an alternative micro school in San Francisco, and he spends also a lot of time on OutSchool. He has multiple other memberships."

**Isaac (40:22):** "We don't live in a world where our entire existence is contained in one box and one set of networks. We have our friends that we only do sports stuff with. We have our work friends and our life over there."

**Amir (42:04):** "It's a better structural model for how humans actually are. You have these different parts to yourself, different interests, different identities and they're intersectional."

**Amir (39:52):** "Network schooling is something I'm playing with, but we share this vision of openness and integration of multiple different approaches, which are incredible."

**Isaac (41:43):** "I think we've crossed the chasm, especially since COVID, to the pragmatists who are like, 'I don't have any strong feeling about one being better or worse. I'm not doing this for some really strong ideological reason. I just know that my kid is miserable in this class or in this school. I just need something that's better.'"

"🔓 BREAKING OPEN THE EDUCATION BOX 🔓

For generations, we've forced children into single-approach education systems, then blamed them when they didn't thrive. But the world is changing—especially since COVID.

Parents are now mixing and matching approaches:

- Micro-schools for community and structure
- Online platforms for specialized interests
- Memberships for continuous learning

As Amir says, 'It's a better structural model for how humans actually are. You have these different parts to yourself, different interests, different identities and they're intersectional.'

Has your family explored multiple education approaches? What combination works best for your children?
