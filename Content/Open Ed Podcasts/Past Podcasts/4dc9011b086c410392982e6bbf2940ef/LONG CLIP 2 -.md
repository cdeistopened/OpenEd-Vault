### YouTube Description:

"Former college football player turned speaking coach Darryll Stinson reveals the one principle that separates high performers from everyone else. From surviving suicide attempts to coaching executives, he learned that success isn't about having the right tactics - it's about becoming the right kind of person."

```Plain
[LONG CLIP #2 - PERFORMANCE]

[48:00-50:30] "-If you're gonna communicate, you better do it like you're called to. Principle number one, you gotta be a thermostat, and not a thermometer. You gotta stop coming in there saying 'Thank you for having me out here' and taking five minutes to warm up before you say something worth listening to.

People are giving you a portion of their lifespan. Say something worth listening to. Be a thermostat. Set the temperature. When there's a 500 person room and 300 people show up, or there's a 500 person room and 120 people show up and it's awkward and quiet—don't be like, 'Ah, man, well, you know...' No. Come in there and set it off. Come in there and set the tone.

People don't move, take action unless they're moved emotionally. It don't matter what you say. 'Open education, better pathway.' Who cares until they're moved emotionally? Until they feel like, 'Oh man, maybe I'm limiting the possibility by being stuck in a paradigm.' Until they feel that, they ain't changing their behavior.

Vulnerability is not a tactic or a tool. It is a way of life that says, if I'm gonna ask you to change, I must first go there within myself. We're coming into an age where if you're not communicating like that, you're not gonna get a spot because everything else you're gonna say, I can put it in ChatGPT and it can say it quicker, better, and more thoroughly."

[19:30-20:30] "What I learned is when you speak in congruence with who you are, while you are giving speeches, God is working on you. Everything you teach, you have to ingest first, so it becomes one of the greatest forms of personal development. Because if I'm gonna teach people to be creative, innovative, forward thinking, have better mental health, grow their business, whatever the thing is, then I gotta practice what I preach and it makes me accountable to my own transformation."

[8:00-9:15] "I say I had a system of success as a high level athlete. I didn't have a system of self-care. And I left there determined to follow my purpose, but not at the cost of my personal health. So just a new paradigm for me where self-care was first instead of left to the margins of my life."
