# THE SECRET TO MAKING LEARNING STICK

**Isaac Morehouse:** [00:00:00] the stories that our kids are surrounded by it's not the same kind of learning as like a textbook or a class. So for example, if my kids have read some Tuttle twins it's not like if I gave them a test on monetary policy, they would like suddenly pass it.

But here's what does happen. We go to the store and my wife says , oh my gosh, eggs have gotten so expensive. Instead of having an instinctive reaction, like, " well, businesses must be greedy ."

Because my kids had read and been exposed to the Tuttle twins, I heard them say, " oh, so government must be creating more money."

**Connor Boyack:** the problem with the textbook format of learning is that it's cramming content into the minds of children who typically just do a pump and dump, because it's not relevant to them. But if content has context, which storytelling gives, it sticks .

I think that's what parents want for their kids. They want them learning stuff that is going to empower them in our lives.
