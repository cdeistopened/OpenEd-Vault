**Ella Richmond:**

Most of our listeners are homeschoolers. They’re not waiting for a system—they’re trying to figure this out now.

So where do you even begin? How do you help a kid take the first step toward career discovery or experience?

**Isaac Morehouse:**

Don’t overthink it. Start small.

If there’s something a kid doesn’t hate and might be interested in—ask if they can shadow or help.

If your kid likes baking, ask a local bakery if they can watch, maybe wash dishes. That’s it.

Try something. If they hate it, cross it off the list and try again.

**Michael Horn:**

My wife always says—solve the current problem, not the 5-year problem.

If you’re homeschooling and academics take a few hours a day, you have time. Use it.

Tap your network. Ask other parents—“Can my kid come observe what you do?”

It’s not about finding “the thing.” It’s about eliminating what it’s not and building momentum.

**Michelle Rhee:**

You can’t underestimate soft skills.

My daughters had to sit through car rides where I was on speaker phone—firing people, doing contracts, leading meetings.

They heard how I handled tough conversations. Later they worked service jobs—scooping ice cream, flipping burgers.

That taught them how to handle unhappy customers, how to show up on time. It’s foundational.

**Isaac Morehouse:**

And we crush that, unintentionally.

With my oldest, I was impatient. I’d say, “Let me do it.” He learned: unless I’m already good at it, don’t try.

With my younger kids, I let them help. It’s slower, messier—but they build confidence.

If you don’t let them try, they won’t believe they’re capable later on.

**Michelle Rhee:**

That’s the same thing employers struggle with too.

They want kids with experience, but won’t give them space to get it.

We need low-stakes reps. Let kids try and build muscle. That’s how confidence grows.
