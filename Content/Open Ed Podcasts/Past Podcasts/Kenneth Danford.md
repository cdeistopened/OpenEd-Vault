## Clip 1: "You’re Free. And Yes, Teens Can Handle It."

- **Segments:** 05:22-06:14, 12:57-14:43 (polished transcript)
- **Hook:** Ken invites teens to walk away from school, then flips the classic “are they ready?” objection.
- **Edited Transcript:**
    
    In our first meeting I say to them, oh, I'm sorry you don't like school. Have you ever considered not going?
    
    We're not school.
    
    I don't wanna be in charge of you. You can come here whenever you want. You can leave whenever you want. You can have your phone. You can have your food. Leave me alone. And, uh, and, and you can, um, use us just as you please.
    
    Are born ready for that autonomy. What kind of question is that? I'm gonna yell at you now. Why are kids ready to be allowed to choose how to spend their time? Stop it. That's insulting.
    
    Culture where asking people if they want to do stuff is kind of normal.
    
    Schooling is the abnormal thing. I'm just turning your question around 180 degrees and being like, why would you consider the kookiness of school to be normal?
    
    And, and asking kids what they wanna learn to be abnormal. That's insane.

## Clip 2: "Two Options When School Is Breaking Your Kid"

- **Segments:** 39:37-41:37, 45:17-46:20 (polished transcript)
- **Hook:** Ken hands parents a pragmatic playbook—stay for friendships or leave entirely—and reframes defiance as healthy data.
- **Edited Transcript:**
    - **Ken Danford:** Option one: stay in school for the social piece. Let your kid get lousy grades if that keeps their friends. Assume they’ll leave eventually, grab a GED, and move on. Use the school like a community center and ignore the threats. Option two: pull them out, stack after-school arts, jobs, volunteering, online classes. Relatives will think you’re ruining your kid. They’re wrong. There’s no “falling behind” when the conventional path is hurting them.
    - **Ken Danford:** If you think something’s wrong, you’re probably right. Your kid’s refusal is likely a healthy response. Listen to them. Brainstorm alternatives, including leaving the place demanding senseless things. Celebrate the squeaky wheel—it’s your child standing up for themselves.
- **On-Screen Text Options:**
    - Stay for friends / leave for freedom
    - GED ≠ failure—sometimes it’s the plan
    - Build a patchwork that fits your kid
    - When “I won’t go” means “this is hurting me”
    - Parents: trust the alarm bell
    - The playbook for school-sick teens

**Building Trust for School Choice**  
**by [Ken Danford](https://kennethdanford.com/author/kendanford/) | Jun 25, 2025 | [self-directed learning](https://kennethdanford.com/category/self-directed-learning/) | [3 comments](https://kennethdanford.com/2025/06/25/building-trust-for-school-choice/#respond)**

**My colleague Tomis Parker recently shared with me the draft of an article he is writing that focuses on the question,** _**Why Does the Left Hate School Choice?**_ **Tomis contends that opposing school choice is a dead-end, voter-losing strategy for Democrats, and that they need to re-consider their objections. I basically agree with Tomis that the current momentum of the school choice movement may pull voters away from the Democrats, but his rhetoric and framing of the question make me a bit defensive of my own liberal politics. I propose that for my own goal of making school optional for every youth, we need to make the issue of school choice transcend politics, and that to do so we need to overcome the lack of trust currently fomented by partisans on both sides. I hold both a sense of optimism and enthusiasm that we are already on this path, and a bit of dread that our current political climate is too fraught for rational conversation. Those of us working in the field are doing what we can to address this situation.**  
**I know it’s fun to start this conversation by blaming the left for resisting school choice. There is some truth to the assertion, as teachers’ unions adamantly oppose any program that threatens the loss of students or money from the public school system. On the other hand, plenty of people on the left, both now and historically, are dedicated to providing options for students and families seeking an alternative to the standard classroom. I know many teachers (some of whom are members of the union) that choose private schools and homeschooling for their own families.**  
**Meanwhile, on the right, we do hear some attacks that describe public schooling as being so broken it needs to be destroyed completely, and that the goal of school choice is to support all families to migrate to private schools and homeschooling. This extreme view is not supported by plenty of conservatives in the movement, nor among those who send their kids to public school and work in public schools themselves as teachers and administrators.**  
**This rhetorical divide is unpleasant, and the ongoing framing of the situation as a zero-sum game (both in terms of the percentage of students in public or private schools and in terms of the public funding going to each system) is making things more tense.**  
**How can we transcend this conflict and make school choice a healthy and normal part of the culture?**  
**1. Reframe the question. Instead of talking about the left or the right, let’s start by asking the central question: How do we provide options to every child and family? No one ought to be trapped in one district-assigned classroom or school. What options do we want to offer parents when one of their children may need, want, or prefer something different than the standard classroom? Often, the school choice search begins for a family with just one child who is having a conflict or needs or a fresh start, while other children in the same family remain in the public school. School choice is not always a family philosophy; it is often a temporary strategy for aspecific child. In fact, over my nearly 30 years with North Star, I can’t recall a single inquiry conversation with a parent that ever began with the parent bringing up politics.**  
**In our current system, most ordinary families cannot afford to pay for private school and independent homeschooling seems unrealistic to them. How do we help those feeling stuck?**  
**2. Acknowledge the Money. If we want to offer alternatives to all families, there needs to be public funds in some fashion. The current leading format is Education Savings Accounts, and some states are experimenting with tax scholarship funds and refundable tax credits. Even low- cost private schools and homeschooling programs need to cost at least $6,000-$12,000 per year per student in order to provide the most basic staff salaries and a pleasant space, and most families cannot afford to pay that amount. There is not enough philanthropy and fundraising to go around at the scale we are discussing. At the same time, public schools have legal obligations to serve every child, often with costly services and personnel, and simply defunding the system creates strong resistance. How can we make school choice real for families while guaranteeing public schools a functional budget?**  
**The politics on this topic are ironic and inconsistent. Normally, conservatives and Libertarians do not want large public entitlement programs moving tax funds from one group of citizens to another. Normally, liberals are in favor of subsidizing social opportunities for medium and lower income families. The inconsistencies might be interesting to discuss and explore if the situation wasn’t framed as a high-stakes, win-lose conflict. Can we have both reasonably funded public schools and provide parents with resources and options for their children needing an alternative? I think so, and I look forward to challenging and serious conversations on this issue.**  
**3. Allow Public Schools to Change. One appealing aspect of starting North Star as neither a public nor private school was claiming our complete freedom to structure the program as we wished. Public schools where I live cannot currently offer part-time options, or classes for homeschoolers, or suggest students aim for a GED rather than a traditional diploma. I would like to see public school teachers and administrators allowed to be as creative as our microschool founders. This freedom needs to come from state legislatures and is an essential part of creating a so-called level playing field for school choice.**  
**4. Celebrate Choices, including using Public Schools. Widespread school choice will definitely lead to some decline in public school enrollment. Currently, approximately 70-75% of K-12 students are enrolled in conventional public schools, with the remainder in public charter schools, private schools, and homeschooling. A well-run school choice program will see that number decrease.**  
**However, I don’t believe it would go down to zero. One fear on the left is that highly functional families will leave public schooling, making the system “a dumping ground” with only the hardest cases. I don’t think this is likely to happen. Perhaps I’m naïve. I’m also aware that as of this decade, there is still a dominant portion of Americans who wish for their children to simply go to their neighborhood public school, make friends, have decent teachers and academics, play sports, find a mentor, and graduate with a sense of community. Public schools that offer this experience now are well-loved. The school choice movement needs to hold the local public school as one valid option, and protect the basic funding needed for this system to function.**  
**Also, if North Star is a fair sample, school choice programs often welcome some of the most difficult students, such as those who refuse to attend regularly, or have significant mental health-physical health-sleep struggles that make their attendance irregular. The colleagues and programs with which I’m familiar are not cherry-picking the simplest cases.**  
**My goal is for all students to have a school, program, or approach that works for them. Every year we see some North Star members make the choice to return to the public school system, and we see that personal agency and outcome as part of our success. I cringe when I hear school choice advocates rooting for students to leave public school, and taking it as a loss when a student chooses the familiar public school system.**  
**5. Acknowledge Religion. I come to this topic having overcome a lot of personal resistance. I have always understood that the separation of church and state meant no public money to religious schools. However, the United States Supreme Court ruled in 2002 that school choice money given to parents does not equal the establishment of a state religion, even if those parents use that money for religious school tuition. I’ve struggled on this point, but I also recognize that many people view my commitment to self-directed learning as an odd sort of faith, and are wary of seeing public funds go in my direction. Various non-religious private schools have philosophies such as Waldorf and Montessori. While I’m not for our government directly choosing and funding specific religious schools (and a recent Supreme Court decision halted an Oklahoma Catholic charter school at least for now with a 4-4 vote,) a healthy school choice system has to trust parents and students. To be overly simplistic, it’s either unschooling and religious schools, or it’s neither.**  
**6. Safety Net for Hardest Cases. While public schools are required to work with all students, many of those who are neurodiverse or dealing with mental health issues are the ones feeling most in need of alternatives. Much of the recent school choice movement has been centered on providing options for those with “special needs” as diagnosed by the system, and the past decade is filled with heart-warming outcomes for those unsatisfied with what had been provided by their public school system. I have no need to over-generalize here, but many founders in the school choice world have had precisely these students in mind. School choice has largely been about providing an option for hard cases that don’t fit in the standard classroom.**  
  
**7. Transportation. In Massachusetts, only standard public-school students are offered the free yellow school bus. People who choose charter schools, inter-district school choice, private schools, or homeschooling are on their own for transportation. Clearly, this practical problem is a severely limiting issue. School choice founders do their best to be centrally located and promote carpooling. I know that some states do provide transportation over a limited distance to private schools. Without a doubt, transportation is a top item in making school choice a full consideration for all families.**  
**8. Admissions and Seats. In the short-term, there are not enough private schools and homeschooling program slots to accommodate a significant increase in families with school choice funds. The worst short-term outcome for the movement would be a status quo with inflated private school tuitions. Ironically, perhaps, the people doing the most work to avoid this outcome in the short- and medium-term are the major school choice funders doing everything they can to support the creation of more schools and programs. (Disclosure: North Star has received funds from VELA Foundation; Liberated Learners has received funds from Stand Together Trust. As of this writing, I can share that in 2025 North Star will be receiving funds from the Novo Foundation.) These groups are holding conferences, offering trainings, and providing start-up grants and loans to potential Starters to help visionary people and teams to create their own schools and programs. My experience has been that there are no strings attached and that all experiments are welcome. Privately, I’m a bit discouraged that most of these experiments are school-oriented models rather than self-directed learning centers, but that is not because of any top-down direction.**  
**Offering support for potential Starters or Founders of new programs is the focus of our work at Liberated Learners, and we are a tiny piece of a much larger effort moving full steam ahead.**  
**9. Race. School choice is perceived by many people, especially those on the left, as a modern**  
**scheme for “White Flight” from multiracial public schools. In fact, there is some unpleasant history from the 1950s when southern states closed their public schools in response to the Brown vs. Board of Education decision and offered White families vouchers to private schools known as “Segregation Academies.”**  
**Currently, some of the most pro-school choice states are also the most limiting of progressive multicultural teaching and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) efforts, resisting support for LGBTQ students, and demanding of ‘patriotic’ curriculum and procedures. As a former 8th Grade U.S. History teacher, I would be fired in these states for the using the curriculum I developed.**  
**Even with all of these issues, I see BiPOC parents and educators participating fully and enthusiastically in the school choice movement. They are seizing the moment to create their own preferred settings and choose their own curriculum free of hostile administrative oversight. Take one look at the VELA Foundation recipients, make one visit to any microschool conference, have one perusal of the recent mainstream media and you will see that leaders in the African-American, Latinx, and other communities are embracing this moment. (In fact, there is enough movement that cynics might fear that red-state politicians are deliberately making public schools hostile on purpose to generate this reaction.)**  
**Also, the new schools and programs resulting from school choice are in many cases more racially diverse than our current public school system. We know that outside of major cities,our housing patterns result in most students going to school with peers from their own racial demographics. More time, patience, and intentional effort will provide better information in the coming years.**  
**I grew up with concerns for racial equality and participating in what has become the anti-racism and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) movement. I do not like the attacks I see on this work from the current Department of Education. Some public-school educators will choose to stay and fight; others will leave to start their own programs using school choice laws and funds. Just as I think school choice needs to transcend our left-right political divide, I think we need to do some hard work to help it transcend our current hostile conversation about race and education. This conversation requires trust, and I regret that important ingredient is in short supply right now.**  
**Reasons for Optimism**  
**I spent my childhood in the Shaker Heights, OH public schools, and my twenties as a public-school teacher and reformer. When I grew disillusioned with the system and started North Star in 1996, we had few role models and almost no community. We could look to the unschooling movement (John Holt, Grace Llewellyn, John Taylor Gatto,) and a few democratic free schools (Sudbury Valley School, Albany Free School) as models. There was one network for support (AERO). Now, there are thousands of people and programs across the United States creating interesting alternatives. The range of options for students and families is very different than when I was a child. In fact, I see a new reality that, in contrast to my K-12 experience in one public school system, many students will utilize a variety of options over the ages of 5-18 years old.**  
**Further, and please take this with whatever grain or mountain of salt you wish, the Founders I meet through my webinars, at conferences, and through a range of podcasts and webinars are politically diverse and include a preponderance of liberals. These teachers, parents, and entreprenuers are pursuing their dreams to put themselves in a new position and to do right by their students. They are sacrificing or risking income they could have maintained in previous teaching positions. They are supporting and valuing diversity, including LGBTQ and multiracial communities. Of course, some in the movement have different values and priorities. However, from the ground up, the day-to-day work of the school choice movement is being done by dedicated, welcoming, visionary people who want to provide a meaningful option to students and families in their communities. Their school choice efforts are not politically motivated, and generally, I suspect many of them vote as I do.**  
**Reasons for Pessimism**  
**Speaking of voting, I am unable to make school choice a voting issue for myself at this time. I value democracy and a long list of other items that make it impossible for me to consider voting for the current pro-school choice Republican party. Until more Republicans separate themselves from the current President and national leadership, I will not be able to align my professional interests with my larger civic interests. I expect I am not alone, and this is cause for delay and pessimism.**  
**Some of the national school choice leadership is publicly aligned with Project 2025, the current Secretary of Education, and the Presidential administration. I find it impossible to be on this team, even when I agree with certain specific content. I wish there were safety and flexibility to hear school choice leaders step out to create space for a dialogue. Can they publicly declare that while they are fighting for school choice, they also reject authoritarianism and some other behaviors that are dividing our country? If not, it will be hard to nurture the sort of trust I think is essential to the vision I have for this conversation.**  
**For the school choice movement to transcend our differences, we need to have a trusting, open dialogue starting with where we are already working together and the values we share in common. School choice leaders on the right need to declare they are not for the utter defunding and destruction of public schooling; school choice leaders on the left need to declare they can live with opening up the system and allowing those seeking options to have some freedom and resources to explore them. All of us can focus on the best way to offer multiple options to every child.**  
**Back to Tomis**  
**Thank you, Tomis Parker, for sparking this push. I agree with your frustration over “Why Does the Left Hate School Choice?” I also want us to discuss “How do we talk about school choice without vilifying the left or the right?” and start with “The immediate work of the people and programs in the school choice world is not politically-motivated or neatly aligned.” I look forward to a larger conversation.**

**I am thrilled to share that North Star is receiving a grant of $150,000 from [The Novo Foundation](https://novofoundation.org/) for the 2025-2026 academic year. Our connection to this foundation developed through the consulting we do with the Liberated Learners network, and the funds are intended to further North Star’s ability to share its model with other interested teams. This grant will allow North Star staff (especially Ken) to focus on these efforts while strengthening our internal organization.**  
**We are grateful to the Board and Staff at the Novo Foundation for this show of inspiration and faith in our track record and current situation. We look forward to honoring this generosity and vision in the coming year. For those of you curious, the website states:** _**Jennifer and Peter Buffett are the Co-Presidents of the foundation. They also co-chair the Board of Directors. Peter Buffett is**_ _**the youngest son of investor Warren Buffett.**_  
**We will share more specifics as the Fall season approaches!**

**This week we have learned that recent North Star alums have been accepted on at least 15 of 17 college applications! Congrats to Hazel Kleinman-Eddy, Enzo Belmonte, Volt Ouroborros, and Lucy Lackman. The accepting colleges involved include: Sarah Lawrence, Reed, Bennington, Emerson, University of Colorado-Boulder, Coastal Carolina, Slippery Rock, UMass-Amherst, Clark, Hofstra, Fitchburg State, and SUNY-Purchase.**  
**We celebrate the achievements of these youth. They are each mature, interesting, and thoughtful young adults well-prepared for the next step in their lives.**  
**We also celebrate the admissions officers, institutions, and counselors involved who carefully consider all of these applications. They are willing to read essays, portfolios, and recommendations for students who have chosen non-conventional paths through their teen years.**  
**On a broader note, North Star does not aim to have all of its alumni apply to college. Many pursue other interests or take on serious work or start their own projects. We know there are many ways to live a meaningful life, and that there are many paths to explore along the way.**  
**Given the unusual nature of North Star’s program (no diplomas, no credits, no grades) that often scares away potential students and families, it’s worth noting the most common path among our alumni:**  
**1. Leave School somewhere around the ages of 12-16.**  
**2. Live an interesting life both inside and outside of North Star.**  
**3. Get a part-time job.**  
**4. Take the Hi-Set or GED (or obtain a credential in other homeschool-y ways)**  
**5. Take one or more classes at a community college.**  
**6. Move on from North Star somewhere around the ages of 16-18.**  
**7. Decide whether to apply to a four-year college or pursue other interests.**  
**It turns out this path is simple and effective. We wish more students, parents, educators, extended family members, and allies of youth more fully appreciated this truth. This road is currently available everywhere in the United States without applications, lotteries, or waiting lists. North Star exists to make this choice more appealing, sustainable, and community-oriented, and we are working to inspire others to join us through the Liberated Learners network.**  
**Thank you to all of you already part of the team. We look forward to celebrating with other alums as we hear more news this spring. For now, we rejoice in this confirmation that School is Optional!**

### TedEx Talk Transcript

what do you say to a teen who tells you I really don't like going to school if there were any choice I wouldn't go if you're like most of us in this room the first thing that brings to mind is this don't you want to go to amorist college seriously most of us say something like I'm sorry you don't like school but you have to go we all went let's see if we can find a way to make the best of it you may feel a smidge of guilt or dissatisfaction telling a team to wait until graduation to have some

self-control over their primary daily activity but most of us don't know any better options as a junior high teacher that smidge of guilt at me as I saw many of my students really suffering in school with years to go before graduation that had not been my experience as a student and I had not become a teacher to give teenagers lessons in the hard boring realities of life no one does but for me the tension mounted and I learned that I could say if you don't like going to school then stop going and start getting

a life that was 18 years ago and now we have a whole network of people spreading that message stop going to school and start getting a life that's preposterous who says that to a teenager it turns out that helping a teenager stop going to school and start getting a life is far more simple than most of us realize it's an empowering and successful approach and best of all it's something each of us can learn to do with confidence and enthusiasm I know this from helping more than 500 teens stopped going to

school most of these teens would not have embarked on self-directed learning without our support and very few of them would have dropped out nearly all of them would have muddled along and graduated on time in the ordinary fashion but settling for normal and using all of one's energy to cope is no way to thrive during adolescence how about waking up excited taking risks declaring interests going places that matter and deciding for oneself when enough is enough how about looking forward to Mondays and rooting against

snow days telling teenagers they can stop going to school is powerful stuff I frequently meet teens in my office who arrive angry or resentful about having to go to another school like meeting with their parents when I say we can help you stop going to school I see immediate changes they sit up they look at me their ears open their parents sometimes start crying from hope I like to think but maybe from horror sometimes these parents report after the meeting we sat in the car and everything was different we felt

this tremendous sense of relief and for the first time in a long time we even felt a bit of Hope and that's just from our first conversation when all we've said so far is there is another way and we will help you use it that I would be the guy Co coing kids to stop going to school is unpredictable for sure if anybody had offered me this opportunity as a teen Not only would I have declined I would have got away from them fast but back in 1995 teaching 8th grade US History wasn't working out as I had

hoped most of the teenagers weren't on honor role internalizing negative messages about their abilities and their Futures even those making good grades did so with a good degree of stress or boredom I felt the pain of some of my students who came to me asking for help to make school better for them I found that I could not one of these students Willow summarized the situation for me later when she said school made me miserable but of all my teachers you made me the least miserable well being the least misery

inducing adult in a teen's life did not make me feel like I was maximizing my career and I began to doubt that even becoming a principal or superintendent would put me on a path to change how these students felt about attending school I spent a lot of time discussing these issues with my friend and colleague Joshua Hornick an eighth grade science teacher he was upset to see students learning to hate learning to settle for mediocrity during adolescence he knew a bit about homeschooling and he wanted to tell me

all about it but at first I would and listen Joshua stop it homeschooling it's ridiculous but one day in October 1995 I accepted his gift of the teenage Liberation handbook how to quit school and get a real life in education by Grace Lewellen I read the book that night and it was stunning it's about teenagers who had grown up without ever attending school legally homeschooling but doing something far different than replicating school at home and being taught by their parents they mostly pursued their interests in music

or art the outdoors animals moneymaking inventing many of them were academic and they read and they wrote they studied mathematics and history and science and foreign languages to their hearts content they were active in their communities they found the Adult World Wide Open to them when they were ready to move on to college work internships and travel and as I researched the movement I found that the words to describe these teens were not asocial bizarre eccentric the words to describe these teenagers were

mature self-aware interesting these kids were doers really who hadn't told me that growing up and trusting yourself and just following your interest is a functional way to grow up in this culture without me and teachers like me well I got over that disbelief immediately and Joshua and I began discussing what it would take to help our school-bound students consider this alternative there were problems to be sure started with the word for the process homeschooling it was too daunting too scary too misunderstood for

most people to take seriously but we figured that we could make the lifestyle appealing and that we would improve our own lives by trying so we resigned our jobs and we invited the students in our school and those nearby to resign with us we figured if we build it they will come and they did talented kids bored kids depressed kids inspired kids several of our own students two of whom I want to tell you about not because they are so outstanding which of course they are but because they are the real life people

for whom we started started Northstar first my forementioned Willow she was a serious student she always knew she wanted to grow up and become a children's librarian we liked each other but school was hard for Willow my assignments always took her longer than I intended she struggled to get the grades that she wanted and despite being one of the kindest people I'll ever know she did not connect with the social mainstream of junior high and she spent most of her days feeling rather alienated in

school Jacob was a brilliant funny boy who always had a trick up his sleeve literally he'd go on to become a magician but he was bored in school and his constant hand motions and card tricks under the desk did not amuse his teachers he was kicked out of advanced math and by 9th grade Jacob was on a pretty steep downward trajectory in school Willow and Jacob R now in their early 30s Willow spent four years in our program reading making art developing friendships volunteering at a crafty Library likee place called the Arts

Explorium she moved on to Holio Community College and the University Massachusetts ammer where she majored in library science Willow is now a children's librarian in preparing this talk I spoke with her and she said tell them I'm really content I really like my life now but school was really bad for me sometimes I wonder whether I would have survived four years of high school I think maybe you saved my life thank you Jacob spent some time in our program perfecting his juggling unicycling and

math skills he moved to Boston we took some classes at the Harvard University Community extension program became he got a job at a science Discovery Center where he performed physics tricks on unsuspecting Museum goers he became a performer at Fel Hall in Harvard Square he moved back out to the attend the University of Massachusetts and while there he won the funniest man on campus contest and he got to open for Sinbad and David Chappelle he transferred to MIT where he graduated he moved on to a master's

program in cognitive science housed at the University of Chicago and recently Jacob earned a PhD in artificial intelligence at the University of California Berkeley Jacob our ninth grade advanced math of reject is now a professor of computer studies at the University of Michigan the outcomes that Willow is a librarian and Jacob a professor may not be because they stopped attending school with us but the fact that they became immediately happier that their life Outlook and sense of self as teens

changed for the better dramatically is because they stopped going to school their ability to relate to adults as mentors their space to develop friendships and a less rigid environment and the time to play and practice their crafts as team saved them each years of their lives and what about us what have we learned these 18 years later the first thing we've learned is that there's nothing you can do with a traditional high school diploma that you can't do without one including attend amoris college where

two of our alumni have attended and graduated ated and where dozens of self-directed Learners have been admitted over the past decade our alumni have gone on to all five local colleges Smith M Holio Hampshire UMass including the Commonwealth College honors program Brown Columbia rizy Manhattan School of Music Warren Wilson colleges all over the country I've gone on to americore the Peace Corps the Marines the Coast Guard entrepreneurs have started restaurants and land SC caping businesses computer

animation business one's a fullt scholar in Jordan one became a Buddhist monk in Japan one's a doctor in Boston but for the fun of it I really want to tell you what I consider to be the two extremes one young woman who walked out on a stellar High School career at age 16 10 years later became the youngest principal of a Public School in Massachusetts and she's now a senior administrator of a large Urban school system while another of our alumna literally ran off and joined the circus

she's a contortionist on a cruise ship in the Mediterranean all of our stories do not have such tidy outcomes one size does not fit all Northstar and self-directed learning are not for everyone but I'll tell you this we've harmed no one we've made nobody's life worse and that's not how I felt when I was teaching Junior High School the second thing we've learned is that school is optional in a very positive sense teenagers who want to go to school for that experience should go many of the students we've

worked with at Northstar have chosen to return to high school for the high school experience most of them have had siblings who've gone to school for the duration my own children have always chosen to attend school we're not saying that nobody should go to school we're saying that nobody needs to go to school the third thing we've learned and the idea closest to my heart is this it's one thing to know that school is optional it's another thing entirely to make school optional for any particular

team a few people can read a book or hear about an idea and act on it but most people need some support this is where where you come in the next time you encounter a team who says to you I wish I didn't have to go to school isn't there some other way you can be a lifechanger you can say you know I heard that you actually don't have to go to school and I'd be interested in exploring that idea with you I wonder if we could make that work try it once see how it feels and let me know I'd like to

hear and this idea is bigger than just those of us in this room talking to one teenager at a time unlike private schools and Charter schools and school choice self-directed learning has no admissions no lotteries no waiting lists no maximum capacities if everybody decided to adopt this approach today nobody would need to go to school tomorrow for such a social Revolution to occur support would have to come from organizations such as libraries and museums and community centers and more programs like Northstar after school

programs could begin their offerings earlier in the day summer camps might extend their programs year round and believe it or not all of those things are already happening and those of us who know about them can imagine them happening on a massive scale imagine a world where no teen feels trapped in school where teens who want and need more Independence can decide for themselves what to learn and how to learn it where teens are living for today and not just for weekends and vacations that world is here now for

some teens we're working to make that world available for all teens thank you

## Rough Transcript

Ela Richmond (00:00.814)  
All right, so Ken, I'm just gonna dive right in. Was there a specific moment whenever you decided that, something's different, something shifted, I'm gonna do this very differently?

Ken (00:14.654)  
Sure, was the night that I read the Teenage Liberation Handbook back in the fall of 1995. I had been teaching for about six years. I was in my second year at the Amherst Junior High and I was friends with a fellow named Joshua Hornick who was an eighth grade science teacher. I was an eighth grade US history teacher. were coaching volleyball together. We were carpool mates. We were friends and he knew about homeschooling and I did not and he kept wanting me to read.

this book and I kept saying, I don't want to read a book about homeschooling. Finally, you know, on one lousy day when I was really mad about something at the school, I took this book and I started reading it and found out that I didn't know anything about homeschooling and that this was amazing that these kids were not going to school and getting away with it. And that not only were they not going to school, they were just learning whatever they wanted to learn and going as far as they wanted and having a much better life than all these school kids were having. And, and so

immediately it became obvious to me that what Joshua and I should do was to quit our jobs and help all the school kids we were tormenting in school leave school and use this this homeschooling approach is unschooling approach and and to do so We'd have to host a little center and make it more feasible for people to consider the idea so that was That was the thing and that was 1995 and I was 2025 and this is we're about to embark on year 30 of North Star next week

Ela Richmond (01:42.232)  
Dang, and what has been the result? also explain the North Star method. Like, what do you do? What does it look like in person?

Ken (01:51.24)  
So, Norstar is a physical building, we're an in-person community center. And so I routinely meet children ages, mostly 11 to 18, who are miserable in school, and I say, there's a different way to live and learn, you don't have to go to school at all. Don't find a different school, don't look for a charter school, don't go to a private school. Just, how about stop going to school? I'll help you if you're under 16 years old write a homeschooling plan.

and you'll be free and easy. And then most people don't want to do that alone. Most parents don't want to do that alone. Most of the people I'm dealing with are not the kind of lifelong homeschoolers you think of as homeschooling types. These are people with three or four kids and the other kids are fine in school and they're busy and some of them are single parents and none of these people perceive themselves to be homeschooling. And so I explained to them, hey, it's all very simple. We'll help you write a plan.

presto, majesto, you're free, and now you can come hang out with us at our center, which isn't that complicated, because it operates like any other adult community center might. Like a gym or a health club or a religious congregation is open during certain hours. And when you come in, there's a bunch of activities you could join in, but if you don't want to, you could just sit in a chair and mind your own business. And we assume you can figure that out for yourself. And it turns out that kids who

have a little headquarters and a weekly advisor at Northstar to chat about things and some classes to choose from and some tutorials and a social community of 50 to 60 other kids that come and go as they wish and use Northstar, know, each one uses it as they wish. It turns out that people grow up quite healthy, right?

Ela Richmond (03:46.444)  
Yeah, this is very fascinating. Did you figure all of this out over time or did you have a hypothesis and like walk into this and say, okay, this is how we're going to do it.

Ken (03:52.668)  
No, wasn't that hypothesis. Stop it. The idea was, so in 1995, I read this book and like, my God, these, you regrowing without schooling magazine. You, I met a bunch of existing unschooling kids. They were fine. They were quirky. They were odd, but they were healthy. People were doing this. I didn't make them up. They were existing human beings who had in the eighties and nineties homeschooled, unschooled, whatever, you know, homeschooled tilted towards the unschooling side of things. And I said, my God.

Why are we pushing all these kids through this horrible enterprise of schooling, whether it's private, public, charter schooling, when you could just not go to school and turn out like these kids? Oh my God, let's just stop it. So I mean, it wasn't like a theory. It was just like, you don't have to go to school. And it turns out if you don't go to school, you can start community college when you're 15, 16, 17. You can get jobs when you're 15, 16, 17. You get a driver's license. You can pick up a GED. And with the GED in Massachusetts, but...

across the country, you can do every single thing that any high school graduate is allowed to do. There's no walls, there's no limits. And so just don't go to school, pick up a GED and get on with your life and live in freedom from 12 to 18 and see what you want to do. Have a whole gap year, just go live. But most people won't do that alone, so they need a little community center. So we built a little community center. There was a little bit of if you build it, they will come.

Ela Richmond (05:19.511)  
All

Ken (05:22.162)  
You know, that's the Field of Dreams movie. You're young. Have you seen that movie? All right, because not everybody now, you're too young. Back in the day, that was our, anyway. So, you know, all these kids are walking out of the cornfields. They just come out of school and they, and mostly they come here and they think their parents are dragging them to another school. And then our first meeting, I say to them, I'm sorry, you don't like school. Have you ever considered not going? And they do a double take. They're like, wait, what? Because they thought they were being dragged to some other principal, to some other stupid school they didn't want to go to.

Ela Richmond (05:27.438)  
Mm-hmm.

Ken (05:51.778)  
And then I tell them, we're not at school. I don't want to be in charge of you. You can come here whenever you want. You can leave whenever you want. You can have your phone. You can have your food. Leave me alone. And you can use us just as you please. So that's really mind boggling for most kids.

Ela Richmond (06:08.684)  
And how do kids react to that? Like you've been in business for 30 years. What does that look like? What are the effects?

Ken (06:13.534)  
Well, some say, well, thank God, or that's obvious, or of course you do. And others, like, you know, stop, like, they do a funny look, and they, you know, sit up straighter, like, wait, maybe I want to hear what this guy has to say. So there's a definite immediate shift in the conversation, because kids often don't realize where they're coming. They think, you know, they've been to two or three different schools, they may have tried independent homeschooling before.

especially now in the last few years post COVID, more people have tried homeschooling, whether it works or not for them is separate thing. So telling kids, hey, I have this place, but I don't want to be in charge of you is rather unique. No one said this to them before.

Ela Richmond (07:04.14)  
Yeah, and what do they do with that?

Ken (07:07.218)  
They look at their parents like, really? You know, it's a little bit of, you know, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory or something like that. really? This is real? This is a place? It's been here while I was in school? Like, people do this instead of the other thing? It's like an alternate, it's like The Matrix or something, right? So, it's crazy. It's like really reorienting. People have to...

Ela Richmond (07:26.156)  
Hehe.

Ken (07:37.212)  
You know, in cognitive psychology, talk about assimilation and accommodation. Assimilation is when you fit things into the buckets you already have in your brain, and accommodation is when you have to make a new bucket for something you didn't really have a category for before. So I can see their wheels turning, and it's accommodation, like, wait, what? And homeschooling doesn't mean I have to be taught by my parents and become the subject of their arbitrary wills. And the parents are like, huh. So it could just be like,

The way we handle after school and the weekends and the summer, we try to find camps, we try to find tutors, try to find the sports teams or the music people or the theater options for these kids. Sometimes they're related to the schools they go to, but most of the time they're not. And so my job isn't so much to teach them algebra as it is to help them find the people and places and topics and resources they need. Wow. And then they could go just come here, you know, three, four or five days a week at Northstar. Whoa, wait a second.

And we turn nobody away from money or for being a hard case. We try to make school optional for any interested teen and family.

Ela Richmond (08:41.366)  
Walk me through the experience of like a kid starting at Northstar. So like they begin, they've had this conversation with you, then what happens? Like are they disenfranchised for a little bit? Kind of like, is this really real sitting around trying to like just temp check it and then over time they start getting interested in topics or like what happens over time?

Ken (09:02.992)  
All the things happen. Some of what you just said happens for kids that way, exactly as you said. But people are different. It's like joining a new community. So some kids can walk in here the first day and go to three or four different classes that we have here. Most of our classes meet once a week, whether it's theater or a book group or science experiments or a math thing, right? There's hiking, there's cooking, there's all kinds of groups that meet every day here. There's about 10 a day here, or 12.

And so some kids will just jump right in and start going to things and in between the things, they'll sit in the common room and say to some other strange kid, do you want to play chess? And, you know, or some kid will say, do you want to walk to the corner store? And they go out and leave the building and go walk to the corner store in the middle of the day, which is like the craziest thing they've ever done in their lives. And they just leave and they come back and, you know, they just like, they can't get over it. but they just jump right in other kids with some anxiety and, and, and concerns will just come in.

and sit in a chair and watch the world go by and like, is this really real, right? We also have a silent room, a library where no one will talk to you. So they can go hide in there if they want. They can sit out back and watch the world go by. They can stay for an hour. They can stay for six hours or seven hours, you know, that we're open. So people will use a new program with the full range of ways. Any rank group of adults would use a new program, any group of humans.

is based on their personalities and trust issues, they'll either jump right in or jump into parts or see if they can find someone who looks friendly and hang out with them or stay away from the scary ones. People just each use it their own way. And then some want to come back the next day and then some need to take a week and not come back for a week. It's up to each kid.

Ela Richmond (10:54.722)  
That's interesting. You mentioned that this is mostly high school. Do you think like a structured type of education is helpful for young kids?

Ken (11:06.846)  
Structure can't be good for everybody. We're perceived to be anti-structure here, and we're not anti-structure. We do have a calendar of classes. We do offer one-on-one tutorials. Everybody does meet with an advisor once a week. We do compare notes with kids about whether they're actually pursuing the homeschooling commitments and projects they've identified as being willing or interested in doing this year. And we kind of go through the weekly routine with each kid every week about how is this working out for them.

What we want is self-generated structure, not artificially imposed, arbitrarily imposed structure. Now, parents can impose a bit of structure on kids, and we don't object to that. If a parent says, you know, we have a normal bedtime and you don't take your phone in your room or whatever they want to say to the kid, or everybody, you know, reads a book a week in this family, or everybody's counting math or their money, or everybody has a job or community service or walks a dog or cooks dinner once a week. Like, you know, parents can have their own structures and requirements.

But institutionally, Northstar does not. It's kind of like the YMCA gym. Like if I don't go to the gym, they don't call me up and say, hey Ken, where are you? I mean, they only do that if I've contracted with a personal trainer type person, right? Otherwise, you can go for a couple of weeks and not go there. And when you do go there, they don't follow you around and see whether you're playing basketball or using the weights or walking on a treadmill and they don't count how many minutes you stay. you it's all on you.

Right? And that's how adults live their lives, generally speaking, across various options. And so it's just trusting kids to use North Star openly in conversation with their parents, openly in conversation with their advisor here in a way that makes the most sense for them.

Ela Richmond (12:57.186)  
Why do you think kids are ready for that autonomy? know that a lot of people would probably argue with you that they're not.

Ken (13:00.978)  
You are born ready for that autonomy. What kind of question is that? I'm going yell at you now. Why are kids ready to be allowed to choose how to spend their time? Stop it. That's insulting. That's like, you think kids, you think kids couldn't possibly know what they want to do with themselves?

Ela Richmond (13:13.506)  
Well, no, like explain this to me.

Ela Richmond (13:20.224)  
No, I mean, I do. mostly like, I always like to steal man arguments. Like think about what somebody else would say to you or like think about what people I already know would argue against. like having your perspective on it is really fascinating to me because you've seen it. Like it's not just like a, I have this theory, you've lived this.

Ken (13:46.558)  
Sure, and the basic simplest thing, the most basic side of this is normal humanity. These kids, after school in the summer, their parents ask them, do you want to go to this camp or not? Do you want to have piano lessons? Do you want to sign up for this sport or not? I suppose some parents make their kids do things they don't really, kids don't want to do, but for the most part, kids are engaged and asked, should we do another round of this thing? Do you want to do it again or not? Maybe the first time they're forced to try some things.

But we live in a culture where asking people if they want to do stuff is kind of normal. We certainly do that with our partners, our spouses, our parents, our siblings. don't boss them around and say, signed you up for something, whether you like it or not. I mean, I suppose with your spouse, you can buy tickets to some show that they don't want to go to, and too bad for them, they have to go do nothing. But by and large, we ask people if they want to do things. That's normal.

Ela Richmond (14:36.704)  
Mm-hmm

Ken (14:43.066)  
Schooling is the abnormal thing. I'm just turning your question around 180 degrees and be like why would you consider the kookiness of school to be normal and And and asking kids what they want to learn to be abnormal. That's insane

Ela Richmond (14:57.102)  
That's very, very interesting. love whenever somebody flips the question. It's like, are kids ready? Why are they not ready? Right?

Ken (15:07.74)  
Yes, absolutely.

Ela Richmond (15:09.9)  
Yeah, super fascinating. Can you continue walking me through like how the conversation works with kids where you're guiding them per week? Because I've had a conversation with another person on this podcast called, his name is Mike Goldstein, and he shared quite a bit about like this idea of teen flourishing, right? And we talked a lot about like, what does it actually take for teens to flourish? It sounds like this check-in is really, really important.

Is it the questions that you're asking, like you're helping kids to uncover their goals and then you're also kind of like keeping them like aware of them or what does a check-in do? How does it help?

Ken (15:51.09)  
think it's less specific questions and it's more just the place holding of the conversation. In other words, there's about nine staff at Northstar who do these advisories and each of us do them in our own way. And so they're not therapy, but you sit down and talk to somebody and you're gonna do it your way, Ella, and you're not gonna do it my way. And so you catch up with a friend who you haven't seen in a while or whatever.

And so, for me, it's kind of like, what's the news of the week? How are you doing? How is this North Star place treating you? Sometimes I'll start with North Star. What days are you coming in? How are the kids here for you? Any staff you particularly like? What classes have you tried? Did you want any tutors here? You know, where do you hang out when you're free time? How is the whole North Star project working out for you so far? Any particular favorite things you've done, right? And then I'll switch to...

You know, I'm looking at my notes that we had with the beginning of the year meeting with your parents and your homeschooling plan Are you reading any of those books yet? Have you open if you ever you know, do you have any of them? Have you opened any of them? Which one how far are you? What do you like it or not? Oh, I read that one, you know How about that math thing? you have you do you have the curriculum? Have you opened it yet? You know, is it easy? Is it hard? How is that working out for you? What about these other things that you you had committed to doing in front of me to your parents? How is the homeschooling?

Ela Richmond (17:03.234)  
Mm-hmm.

Ken (17:19.352)  
stuff such as it is or other hobbies at home that you were going to have chores or cooking or other things you were going to do. How's any of that playing out for you? then what about besides Northstar, where else in the world do you go every week? Do you have any classes? Do you have any jobs? Do you have any regular appointments, visits with grandparents or youth groups? do you have any, I don't know, it be anything else that you do regularly. Do you have any other?

places you go and things you do on a routine. And then after we talk about those things for a while, I'll ask, do you ever go outside? How's your dog? And anything special this week? Anything coming up this weekend? Any travels or events or parties or family affairs? What's going on? Do you have any friends outside of Northstar you see? Anybody you see from Northstar? Outside of Northstar? How I do that,

is not identical to any of the other nine people at Northstar, but the gist is the same, right? The concept is the same of we're just trying to help hold this thing together with you. We're gonna meet with you every week. We're gonna meet with your parents and you together three times a year. And we just don't want to assume everything's okay. We wanna sit down and have this conversation. Some kids love it and will talk to us for 40, 45 minutes a shot.

And some kids can hardly sit still for five minutes and say, I'm done, I have nothing else to tell you, I don't like this, I'm done. And we'll say, well, thank you for, you know, just, we wanted to go through the checklist and just at least be on the same page of what we think is happening for you. So that was awesome. Go, go play, go away. So, but how my colleagues do it is, you know, specifically different from how I would do it, but not in spirit, just in the process. You know what I mean?

Ela Richmond (19:18.806)  
Yeah, no, this makes sense. It's actually really fascinating. So back to the beginning of our conversation, you were saying that this is especially a place for people that have started to hate school, like people that have really, really started to check out. It started to be not just like not great for them. It's like actually like not good at all. Like it is harming them in some way, or form. So it sounds like what North Star is to and like correct me if I'm wrong, but it's almost like a.

Ken (19:27.88)  
this.

Ela Richmond (19:46.624)  
a community place for kids to deschool.

Ken (19:50.43)  
Sure. Okay, first of all, let's hold that about 70 % of the kids or more are coming out of school with us and they wouldn't be homeschooling or leaving school without us, right? Let's hold that for a moment. And in that group, some of them were going every day and getting straight A's and managing school just fine. And a bunch of them were crashing and burning by refusing to go or having anxiety or self-harm or the partial hospitalization programs. And some of them are crashing and burning.

Ela Richmond (19:59.137)  
Interesting.

Ela Richmond (20:07.597)  
Interesting.

Ken (20:20.67)  
Some of them are on the some of them are autistic some of them lots of bullied kids and LGBTQ and other kinds of you know people don't quite fit in at school they lie non-conformists a lot of outdoorsy types a lot of artists and musicians all the people who just go like this school thing really for how much longer do I have to do it right and It's not that they can't or won't though some of them it is but this the whole enterprise of school just seems like

really a misuse of their lives until age 18, and isn't there a better way to live, and couldn't they be allowed to do that, please? And so no one has really told them, and here, and we will help you, and it doesn't have to be conventional homeschooling like you think it might have to be, right? So that's who's coming. The 30 % of the group that's previously homeschooled, some of them have homeschooled and gone back to school because it wasn't so much fun. Some of them have homeschooled successfully, but they've hit the end of that.

stage because most of the kids in their homeschooling group are going to school for high school. Some of them are doing just fine and are just coming here to check out North Star a little bit to see if it's going to add in anything. But if it doesn't, they'll be happy homeschoolers without us. But that's a small group. By the way, I just want to remember, speaking of spinning the question around, how many people like going to school? Almost nobody likes going to school. Even the kids getting honor roll grades. mean, would a third of the kids get honor roll? You know, the rest of the kids are being told

whatever for you. And the kids in the honor roll grades, some of them have a lot of stress, so you take the kids with honor roll grades, a lot too much stress. And then you say, well, how many of you actually find this redeeming and interesting and you're glad you're getting to learn all this good stuff at the school place with these good teachers? And it's like, yeah, yeah, six kids maybe by then. And then you ask those kids, would you rather they cancel vacation and just had school open year round and they all look at you like you're from Mars? No, they can't wait for their own time.

to be in charge of themselves to learn what they want to learn their way. They all can't wait to be done with school too. I mean, who likes going to school? It's really kind of sad. That's why I quit. Because the same kids who hate going to school often love their summer camps. They often love their sports and their theater and their other activities. And they cry when those things are over and they're sad. Well, I want to be that person running those programs. Or they're sad when they're done with me. And that is how kids feel about Northstar, by the way, just for the record.

Ken (22:46.61)  
They object to snow days. Why are we closed? We could have gotten there. Get out of here. Why are we closed for the summer? know? So I've won. I've achieved that goal of mine to be on that side of things. But the way to do that is to get out of the whole heaviness of the schooling model.

Ela Richmond (23:08.13)  
That's fascinating. Yeah. I mean, if you break it down a little bit more, like the kids that enjoy school probably enjoy something inside of school. Like, for example, my friends are there or yeah, I have this one class that I actually like. Maybe it's like a hobby class or, you know, maybe there's this one teacher that was something really, really cool. but it's usually something not like this whole institution of school.

Ken (23:32.99)  
Sure, and that's fine. In real life, I have two adult children now, 29, 27. They both went to school. They didn't come to Noristar. They didn't home school. And plenty of the kids I work with at Noristar have brothers and sisters who, given a choice, stay in school, whether it's a public school, a private school, a charter school. We're not saying that nobody should go to school. Anybody could go to school, and they're on the football team, and they have all those good things that you just mentioned happen for people.

and they're in part of a good social group and things are exciting. Good for them. We're not saying that nobody should go to school. We're saying nobody needs to go to school and anybody could stop going to school. I'm here for the anybody could stop going to school thing, not everybody should stop going to school. I'm not that of much of a-

Ela Richmond (24:21.782)  
Yeah, and that distinction is quite important. I was talking to Isaac, our CEO, one day and he was saying that he was, I can't remember if it was him or somebody else, was on the phone with a parent who was just like, basically saying that all these things were happening in their kids' lives, that they were struggling, that all these things were happening, but they couldn't pull them out anymore. They had a couple of travel things that they wanted to do, but the school has rules and.

And they were like, why can't you take them out? Like, you can't, like you just do it. Like that's it. And so I think like the spirit of why not is just like so clear in this conversation. And like every single parent has experienced this moment where like the institution tells them one thing, right? The institution says like, this is what's best for your kid. However, as a parent, you have this like really strong conviction inside of you that you're like, I don't think so. Like I know my kid, like.

there's something else that's probably better. Like this is not the best. And so I think that's really, really cool that y'all have created something that allows families that are in that space especially, but like also other families, but especially the kids that are feeling that moment where they're like, alternative, this school, this opportunity that we have in front of ourselves, like it's not solving our problems right. And we need to figure out something else.

Ken (25:50.654)  
Thank you. Yes, I agree. I mean, it's very satisfying to me to be able to offer parents and kids an option that they felt like was inaccessible or they didn't know about. Either they didn't know they could do it before, or even if they did try it before, wasn't really, know, homeschooling independently wasn't particularly redeeming or helpful, right?

So to say to people, there is another way, and we'll help you do it, obviously I'm still pretty fresh about it, know, I'm pretty happy about it.

Ela Richmond (26:30.336)  
No, and I think that's really good. To be passionate about the thing that you're creating. Tell me if I'm wrong here, but I'm guessing the reason that you're so passionate is because you've seen these people. It's not just like we're talking about a theory. It's like you've seen these lives change by this mentality that you approach your program.

Ken (26:54.928)  
Well, that's the back side of it. The front side of it is I actually still have a lifetime of penance to do for all the harm I created to all the kids I was stressing out in school. Or, you know, not me personally, but the whole system, the whole culture. We are stressing out so many kids so unnecessarily that someone needs to tell people it doesn't have to be this way. And it is so urgent to me.

Ela Richmond (27:06.934)  
Interesting.

Ken (27:24.38)  
I can't stand it. There are so many kids right now sick to their stomachs that next week they have to start a whole new school year and start figuring out some of the energy to deal with these adults and these grades and this morning beyond time issues and all the stuff that, whether they have friends or not, all the stuff they don't really wanna do and some are so much better. Why can't life be like this? And some of them literally are like,

throwing up in the morning. Some of them are rolling over in the bed and pulling over the covers and don't wanna go and turning off the lights and hiding. like, know, it's, for some people it's pretty marginal. And for some people it's not at all. They go to school and it's fine. It's fun, it's good. They're happy to see their friends again. It's kind of exciting to start a fresh year. So good for them. But for the people who don't wanna go and are just stressed and sick, it's so unnecessary. Life doesn't have to be that way.

Someone, more people, should help more people not go to school. Like, this is outrageous. So, that's the urgency. I really feel that. And so that's really what keeps me going, is that there's so much misery.

Ela Richmond (28:37.56)  
Have you seen this get worse over time or is it the same?

Ken (28:45.342)  
It's certainly not getting better. I don't know if it's getting worse. I think elementary school probably has gotten worse in the last 20, 25 years with the emphasis on testing and less recess and, you know, pestering kids to learn more. And I think elementary school has probably become less fun than it was 20, 30 years ago. I don't know if high school is any worse now than it ever was before. I mean, there is more and more state testing and all this accountability nonsense.

The sense of scarcity, which I think is the whole false sense, is maybe worse than ever. That is, there's, there's very few good jobs in America, and if you don't go to school and get good grades, you'll never go to a good college, you'll never be able to get one of those few good jobs. And so, the only way to have a decent adulthood in America is to...

go to school and do well as a third grader. And if by fourth grade you're not doing well, you're probably going to be doomed as an adult. And certainly if you're in ninth or 10th grade and you're not playing the game well, you're going to be in big trouble. I think that's worse. I think it's false. And I think given the cost of four-year private colleges and liberal arts colleges, you know, it's criminal. And I went to Amherst College, so I benefited from the whole system in some way.

And I had a good experience there. I'm not criticizing my own experience, but the cost of a four-year Amherst College diploma now is outrageous. And to assert that that kind of experience should be the goal for everybody just creates a false sense of stress. Well, it becomes a real sense of stress, but a false sense of scarcity that isn't real.

Ken (30:42.078)  
and that we should be helping people learn skills and have experiences. And there's so many things you could do from 12 to 18 besides try to prepare to get accepted to Amherst College. Plus these unschoolers get into Amherst College anyway, so what difference? know, just go live your best life and it turns out you'll be appealing. But go learn a few languages, go travel the world, go work with sheep, go learn plumbing and electrical stuff, go be a solar panel expert. I don't know, like just...

Go do stuff. And also, we see so many kids use community college well in their ages 15 to 20 without going to four-year schools. And there's so many trades and certificates and internships and things to do and ways to explore the world that the assumption that there's a lot, just think it's more pressure than is appropriate on kids today.

Ela Richmond (31:32.82)  
When, when do you think that started? I mean, there used to be a time where, where it was, it was a lot easier for kids to feel like there were pathways and they could, you know, for example, like choose a trade and be successful. And like, there are a few

jobs that are just so admired today and like every single parent is pushing their kid to do that. Is that just like a culture thing? Like a comparison culture thing? Everybody wants their kid to be the genius. Everybody, you know, is comparing their toddler like, he walked at this point. you know, he talked at this point. And like everybody's just like so excited for their kid to be a genius as opposed to like the best that their kid could possibly be. like flourishing means different things for different people.

Ken (32:24.808)  
think it did get worse in the 1980s and 90s. I'm not sure about that, but I think that the culture shift. I'm sure we could blame Facebook and Zuckerberg. That'd be fun. Or blame the internet overall, know, social media in the last 20 years. You know, from 2010 or 15 years onwards. And prior to that, you know, there was this...

report that came out in 1980 or 82, the Nation at Risk about American schools are lousy and kids are falling behind, that created a lot of this pressure. And there was also a good-hearted, well-intentioned, equal, equality-oriented, justice-oriented thing to help more people have more access to four-year colleges, and that justice in America means helping low-income.

and low income urban people, first generation kids, people of color, underrepresented groups who haven't had the four year college experience have access to that college experience. That's essential, right? That's all well intentioned. And I kind of agree with most of it and was part of it too. But at this point, it's kind of overrun its mark. But I mean that for affluent white kids too. I mean, not all my siblings need to go to college. Not all my nieces and nephews need to go to four year college.

And so, I mean, everybody should reconsider that message at this point. But the pressure partly comes from a well-intentioned vision by adults or dream for adults that all kids have all access to everything.

Ela Richmond (34:07.53)  
interesting at your school, not school, I'm sorry, at your program, do y'all promote and like encourage kids to be different and unique and like how do y'all do do that differently?

Ken (34:10.631)  
Yeah.

Ken (34:24.046)  
We, I don't think we do that explicitly. I think, so sure, we say you can do whatever you want and we're non-digmental. And if you want to spend all your time studying the clouds and meteorology, you know, go for it, right? And if you want to raise sheep, go for it. And if you want to, you know, learn archery, go for it, right? Like, know, whatever the, the, the, the unusual interest is, we're all for that for any kid who wants to do it, but we don't like.

go around telling each kid you ought to find something unusual to want. Why don't you want anything unusual? don't push that, as long as we push it. And frankly, the most common outcome for North Star alumni is, know, 16, 17, 18, they're experimenting with community college. And if they like it, they're gonna go full-time and then do a four-year college. And that four-year college more...

Most often is the University of Massachusetts because that's the affordable one here, right? It's a state university. The most common outcome is don't go to junior higher high school, use some community college, go to UMass, and get on with your life in a happy, healthy, centered way without all the stress and bother that everybody else went through. And meanwhile, you lived a really fun, more interesting, clever, spacious life from 12 to 18 compared to all the people in school did, right?

And at the fringe of that, well, within that, there's other people who discover they don't like community college any better than school, and they don't want to go to college at all, and they're going to just go get a one-year certificate in some kind of trade or some kind of other work, or they're going to start their own business, or they're going to be computer programmers or artists or musicians, or they're going to learn three languages and go live in another country, and they're going to cook, and they're going to start a restaurant. I mean, people do get off track and become entrepreneurial, but it's not that we push that.

and we don't romanticize it and we don't value it more. It just so happens that there's people doing that for sure. But again, the most common outcome is rather mundane is we help some miserable kid who was refusing to go to eighth, ninth grade, bored, sad, depressed, couldn't get out the house. They come in to Oristar for two, three years. And by the time they're 17, 18, 19, they're doing, they're having a job at Walmart.

Ken (36:46.248)  
They're going to community college. They got their driver's license. They've had friends. They've had a couple of good years under their belts at North Star. And it's all extraordinarily different than anything that would have happened for them had they stayed in that school that was driving them nuts. None of this would have happened from 16 to 19. And they wouldn't be the 19-year-olds they are without the spacious time that they had with us, right? And the support for moving at their own pace they had from us. So it all matters. But I wouldn't say that we're creating

Well, on the one hand, we're not creating a bunch of, know, everybody's outside the box forever kind of life. It's not really what we're doing. On the other hand, I did do one of my favorite videos with a panel a couple of years ago called, What Still Matters, Alumni Over Age 30. And these were kids from the 90s we worked with who are now in their 30s and 40s.

You like, you went to Northstar when you were 15, man. You're 40 years old. Really? What's the big deal? So, you who cares? And there is obviously a sense of, yeah, I didn't put up with stupid high school. I bucked the system. I got out. And the idea of I could always do that again if I need to has stuck with them. The spirit of some, like, questioning the assumptions, questioning the cultural norms.

and valuing one's own creative independence. That does stick. But what surely sticks is the fact that they went from 15 to 18 not miserable. And there's like, even if nothing else, I was so, I didn't know if I would have made it to 18, I would have dropped out. I would have been so negative. The whole thing was so terrible that the fact that we cut it out and I had those two or three or five years, however many years they were at North Star to spin it around, how could that not matter? How could it not?

impact the rest of my life that I didn't like hit rock bottom and stay there and go worse and sink and sink and sink and then at 18 they finally let me out and then I began servicing at 18 going on 19 and by the time I was 23 I finally figured something out right like you helped me when I was 17 or 16 or 14 get out of all that mess and I've been I've been living well ever since so thank you right like what still matters of that I don't know

Ken (39:06.93)  
Maybe they would have found themselves out without us, sure. But I hope that's how it is, right?

Ela Richmond (39:15.382)  
Yeah, that's that's really fascinating. I'm curious to hear your perspective where there's not a North Star, where there's not an option for families that never expected to homeschool, that never expected to need an alternative. What would you recommend that they do? They have a kid that is really frustrated, not flourishing, not doing not doing great, and they know it, but they don't know what to do next.

Ken (39:32.065)  
Thank you.

Ken (39:37.118)  
Okay, I'll give you a few options. Option one is stay in school just for the social cultural value of it, the friendships of it. Let your kids get bad grades and don't fret about it and just assume they're never gonna graduate from that high school and then sometime eventually they'll drop out and get a GED and they'll be able to take it and pass it and they'll go to community college if they want to go to college. But you're not really depending on the credits or the transcript from this place. So just use it for what it's offering which is a community center function.

for your child and just milk it for what it's worth. Let your kid miss all the days they need to. Let them threaten you to the cows come home and just don't stress about it. Just ignore all of it. And as long as your kid enjoys going and has some friends and it serves a purpose in your family, use it as long as you can milk it. And then when you're done, get out and let it go. And it's not a stain. Don't internalize any of these negative messages. Option two is your home school. You get out. You create your best routine as you can.

As you know, this is what your work is over there at Open Ed. There is a whole national network of a zillion online things that people could be part of. Out school and the whole, some of it's expensive, some of it's inexpensive, some of it's free. And so you pick and choose a couple of things and you just try to live your best life outside of school. And that might be a lot of after school kinds of arts and clubs and sports and things that your kid does.

from either really busy from three to seven every day and they have scouts and they have church groups and they have every other youth thing under the sun. during the day they're kind of on their own and there's not a lot of homeschoolers for you. Well, sorry, do an out school class and do the best you can and go volunteer at the library, go volunteer at the senior center. You're not gonna have a peer oriented life. Let it go. Have.

interesting life go work with the animals of the vet once a week and go work at the senior center once a week and go volunteer the library once a week and leave me alone like go build the best life you can stop worrying about school and and and as your kid gets older you see what's what sticks and and then you know they can volunteer and get jobs in those areas and you know and maybe it's a museum maybe it's who knows what it is but they and then they start finding themselves but

Ken (42:02.79)  
It's hard, I don't mean to make that sound easy and it's anxiety inducing. If you're the only one pulling your kid from school and you're not really trying to get them to do a homeschool curriculum for credit and graduation purposes and you're just kind of like bypassing the whole schooling rubric to let your kids do interesting things all the time. People will think you're atrociously terrible. people, you're...

particularly your family members, your grandparents and aunts and uncles would think you're doing a terrible thing to this child because you're not making them do the conventional stuff. They're wrong, they don't know they're wrong, and it's really hard for people to grasp what we're talking about. But you just hold the line that say, you know, look, this kid's gonna be so on track at eight, they're gonna be so much more mature and healthy and wise at 18, self-aware than their peers, and then more importantly,

More importantly, it's not even all those things. It's tell me your second best alternative to what we're doing. We're trying the best we can. Because I'm the boarding school, but they don't really want to go and we don't really have the money and I don't want to miss them. I love my kid. I want to be with them and there isn't a local school to go to. We're not going to a boarding school. We're just going to do this mishmash homeschooling thing in a way that works for us. And thank you for your love and concern. It's going to be fine.

Go call this Ken dude, he'll yell at you some. Go learn about homeschooling and unschooling. And do the best you can. And just realize that most of the kids going to school most of their lives till age 18 are not getting that much out of it. And your kid is not, there's no such thing as falling behind. It's just crazy talk. So search a little harder to find some joy and confidence that you're a genius.

Ela Richmond (43:52.234)  
I love this. Okay, to wrap up the podcast, have three rapid fire questions for you. If you can answer them with the first thought top of mind. So you just mentioned falling behind. There's no such thing as it. Give me a short snippet. Why is there no such thing as falling behind?

Ken (43:56.628)  
boy.

Ken (44:07.582)  
You can always learn stuff tomorrow or today. could run right home and learn stuff. Leave me alone. I I didn't do it when everybody else did it, so now I lose? Shut up.

Ela Richmond (44:12.238)  
Question number two.

Ela Richmond (44:17.944)  
Question number two, what is your advice to parents about being judged? So many parents are afraid of the judgment that comes from family, friends, as you were saying. What's your best advice?

Ken (44:30.984)  
That's hard because I don't know these people and I don't know the uniqueness of their situations. The right answer is to trust yourself and value your own self judgment above other people's. It's hard for people to do and that's not a really helpful answer to people in a place where that isn't so easy for them to do and they wouldn't be so moved. I mean if they could just follow their own instincts they would have and they wouldn't have all this stress and bother. So when you can't...

is just again, consider what's the next best option. I think I'm doing the best thing about my kid. And as long as you feel like you're always looking at what else you might be doing and pretty sure you're still on the right track, stick with what you got.

Ela Richmond (45:17.494)  
of it. And my last and final rapid fire question.

What is some encouragement to parents who know that something is wrong?

Ken (45:31.432)  
You're right. Something's wrong. Your kid doesn't want to do the things they're being asked to do in the way they're being asked to do them. And the problem is most likely not your child. It's most likely your child is saying healthy, rational, and responding appropriately for them. And if you can listen to your child and brainstorm alternatives with them, including not going to a place that asks you to do things that you think are senseless, see what you can do, right?

A lot of these problems can't be fixed in the schooling model and switching to a different school isn't really much of a solution in most of the cases. So it's a big topic to take on, but encouragement is your kid is probably healthy and right and good for them for being a squeaky wheel. Like that's kind of what we want is for your kid to stand up for themselves. So let's see that as your kid standing up for themselves as a healthy first step.

Ela Richmond (46:28.268)  
I love it. This has been very, very interesting. It's very, very cool to talk to somebody who's so passionate about what you do. If people want to find out more about what you offer, where can they go?

Ken (46:38.44)  
They can go to [NorthStarTeens.org](http://northstarteens.org/). [N-O-R-T-H-S-T-A-R-T-E-E-N-S.org](http://n-o-r-t-h-s-t-a-r-t-e-e-n-s.org/). NorthStar is in Sunderland, Massachusetts. You can find us pretty easily just by Googling. You can Google my name. I have a website, [KennethDanFord.com](http://kennethdanford.com/). And if you're interested in starting a program like NorthStar, we have a whole networking consulting gig. That's a separate organization called [LiberatedLearners.net](http://liberatedlearners.net/). And while we're at it, I have a book called Learning is Natural, School is Optional.

The North Star Approach to Offering Teens a Head Start on Life. And I have a TED Talk that was given in 2013 at Amherst College. And so you can watch the TED Talk. You can get my book. Anyway, can reach out to liberated learners. You could visit North Star in person or by the website. All those things.

Ela Richmond (47:25.928)  
Nice. Lots of great options. Yeah. If anybody has more questions, feel free to reach out, drop a comment in any of the podcast places. And yeah, this was really awesome. Thank you so much, Ken, for doing this.

Ken (47:38.758)  
you're welcome. Looking forward to hopefully meeting you in person sometime.
