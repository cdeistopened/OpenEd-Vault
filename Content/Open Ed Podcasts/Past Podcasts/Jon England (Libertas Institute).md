### The disconnect: Real vs School

  

_This is pretty short. I like this as a graphic, like a “qoutes” post._

# The Disconnect: Education vs. Real World

isaac: ~~~But you have this idea that you have to like pick the one thing. And that's where I just, I love anything, even starting in high school that gets young people out and exposed to the world. ~~~[00:00:00] We've kind of developed this society where they're like, Kept away from the real world for almost 20 years in these like artificial environments that are totally disconnected.

And then they're just supposed to emerge and know exactly what they want to do and know how to do it. ~~The earlier you can get exposure to different types of careers and things out there in the world and start to figure out what you know, you don't want to do, and then what else is fair game, I think is, is really, really exciting to me, that was a long rambly rant, but this is an area you can tell I'm really passionate about.~~

~~Jon: Yeah, for sure. And, and I would say that, uh, one of the things that I love. So going back to, to what you were saying is college will always be there. If I decide to wait, I mean, I'm in Utah. We send our kids out on missions for two years and they don't start school until they're 20 or 21. Well, if you're not LDS and, and, and go do that, you could still take a couple of years and you'll turn out just fine.~~

~~But if you take a couple of years. And, and do that, you'll have a clearer idea of like, [00:01:00] Oh, I do need a degree to go and do this thing because I actually want to be a doctor. Right?~~ ~~~Um, interestingly, I, so I was actually thinking of Praxiswise tech thinking of the gap year programs. So that was a good job by you to pull that up.~~~

~~~But uh, there, there is another program like out there that, that does this as well. It's a little bit more self guided. And one of the things they say, and I love this is.~~~

### Lawyer: “I hate being a lawyer”

  

_I can see a graphic or text post that begins with “All Lawyers: ‘I hate being a lawyer’”. This can follow some text on why exploration is necessary in careers, (and in education, which OpenEd allows you to do)._

## Transcript

one of the biggest things I would have these conversations with young people and pretty much universally, they were dissatisfied with. College as it presented itself. It was like, okay, like maybe it's a fun social experience, but it's really expensive and I'm just not confident it's going to help me find a job.

And like, I have to pick a major. So I have to pick and people say like, follow your passion, follow your wife. So I have to pick my lifetime passion. And then just like study classes in that and spend tons of money on it. And then just hope that I can get a job in that. That's a lot of pressure. And if I had a dollar for every single lawyer in particular, I've met who's like.

I wish I had never gone to law school. I thought that's what I wanted to do. By the time I got through law school, I had so much debt. The only job that would pay me enough to pay it off was being a lawyer. And I hate being a lawyer, but now I'm stuck. And like that feeling. So I always tell young people, instead of trying to be like, I have to find my passion.

And does it require spend like a year or two and try to answer the question, what are the things that I know [00:43:00] I don't want to do? Like, it's easier to find what you hate. Then to find like the one thing you love because what you love and what you're going to be doing in 20 years It probably doesn't even exist yet So like if you go out and say okay, I have a hunch that i'm kind of interested in maybe being a lawyer Let me go shadow a law firm for three months Probably 80 of people who do that will say you know what?

I actually don't want to be a lawyer like this doesn't look that fun. It's not that enjoyable to me, right? Go figure out The things that, and start to, that list will narrow down like, okay, I've realized that I don't want this, get as much exposure to these different things. And you'll start to learn about yourself.

### Who owns the child’s education

_Text post:_

_The parents are the primary owner of their child’s education. Not their school, or teachers, or district. They may play a role, but they are not the main responsibility holders._

## Transcript

“the parents are the primary owner of their child's education and the one primarily responsible and the school is supposed to serve them and the paradigm that you ran against is actually the opposite. 100%. The school is in charge of the child, of their education, of what and how they learn and the parent is just supposed to adapt to that.

I think that's the thing that is fundamentally, um, you know, what, what you were feeling and what you were running up against.”

### Public Schools competing with alternatives and getting better

_Opus has a great long clip for YT that talks about how public schools get better due to competition, and Jon mentions my tech high specifically as an example of something that improved public schools in his district._

  

_Run the below transcript through AI for a pretty good angle on a newsletter piece too_

  

## Transcript

“**Isaac:** know it's very early in Utah but in Utah or other states have you seen public schools starting to innovate a little bit in response to some of these programs that have given parents more choices

  

**Jon:**

Yeah actually interestingly knowing that this is formerly my tech high and now open ed that I'm talking with I was principal during the 2020 school year And we tried to provide an online education system for students And they hated it The students hated it The parents hated it The teachers hated it It was terrible We lost seven hundred elementary students in our district during that time which is a And most of them went to at that point my tech high And we're using that to educate their children at home via online platforms or whatever it was And so within a quarter the district changed and all of a sudden had a dedicated online program as opposed to what they were doing which was asking the in-person classroom teacher to be both an online teacher and an in-person teacher That was the disaster They wanted them to do both and it felt like they were trying to teach 2 classes at the same time all day That's hard That's a really hard thing to do And so that competition from my tech high created change faster than I'd ever seen it in my 14 years in public education because students chose something different And that's going to continue to happen Schools are going to try and find things that parents want And start to do The local district here that I live in has an amazing in-person high school program that's very specialized I can't remember the name of it right now but they have it It exists And it's attracting actually homeschool students back into the public education system because of how cool it is it's not a traditional high school It's very different And it allows them a lot of the same freedoms that homeschool has which is they can kind of come and go as they need to But they're doing some things differently Now most of their schools are still kind of doing that traditional thing But yeah we need to see the public school system Start to take some of these I don't want to say chances but do things a little bit differently”

### Your kid needs something different, and he has options

_I think works well as a short punchy clip on socials to promote openEd services._

  

## Caption central idea

Your child doesn’t need to “fit in”. Let us help you build a program that adapts to _his_ needs

  

## Transcript:

“Jon: And so these programs like an ESA the Utah fits all Arizona has it Florida has it A whole bunch of states have it and probably more states will have it this upcoming year It's for these students that don't fit in that system They struggle for whatever reason Maybe it's sitting for 6 to 7 hours a day 5 days a week Maybe they need a half day program And so allowing them to have this option provides an opportunity for them to go and do and get the education they need”

  

### Flexible High Schools

  

_Another short social clip worth sharing_

## Transcript

Can we really lean into that and say to these homeschool families or families who are trying to just do something differently hey What if you only had to come 3 days a week What if you could I mean that's one of the hardest things with high school Kids want to earn money and save when they're in their teens You don't have any time to work if you're in school all day and then you have sports What if it's like hey 2 days a week you can go work a job which actually you're going to learn a ton anyway And then you can come in 3 days a week or 2 days a week or whatever and trying to create more flexibility I think that high school spot especially given how much people are recognizing that the cost of college is not matching up with the value they get afterwards And so things that help you transition better and better understand if you're working more or you're apprenticing or you're interning during that high school time that helps you think more clearly about what you want to do next Should you go to college Is it worth it Should you try to go right into your career So I think that's a place that's ripe for experimentation And like as a public school That is where you can reach a lot of these families where they want that social aspect that's much harder to piece together when you're at that age as a homeschooler

### Why must we revolutionize schools now

_Let’s use this as a Long Clip_

## Transcript

“The assumption of what a school should be definitely needs to change I mean really you can go back and you can look at pictures from the early nineteen hundreds and the classrooms don't look fundamentally different today than they did then Yeah maybe there's like a smart board or a touch screen TV up at the front of the room Maybe the kids have a laptop or a Chromebook in front of them for the most part they're still kind of sitting in rows and doing the same thing that they did back in the 19 twenties Have we not found better ways to do things like All other industries have progressed in some way shape or form Right You know we've we've learned like going back to your your medical example Right They learned early on Hey I need to wash my hands between every patient I see because that prevents the spread of disease Hey we learned about this thing called antibiotics that can help prevent death when somebody gets an infection those are amazing things How come we haven't had that in education It's because we're all asked to do the same thing And again the public schools are asked to be all things to all people And therefore they do a lot of things but they don't do a lot of things at a very high level Yeah it's funny I had a great conversation with Darrell Bradford who's kind of a school choice education freedom advocate And he made this great point that like it's easy to have these conversations and talk about hey to serve kids in this way and customize what they need It's all about sort of these alternative options Another part of that conversation is how can public schools also be free to adapt more And some public school leaders will say things like well it's not fair that kids who get a UFA scholarship can use it to buy a Lego set where I can't use my funds to buy that for my kids in the classroom And the answer is not to shut down UFA It's to open up what the public school teachers can do and give them more of that freedom and flexibility Let them take their kids outside more So I would love to see and I think that's the intent for a lot of these rather than the public school advocates trying to shut down these alternatives because they have unfair advantages Public school advocates saying we need those same advantages too so we can compete And let's focus on what we really do well And for some schools it might be we have an amazing science lab and we're amazing at science We have great science teachers We're really going to double down and do that And kids are going to choose to come here for that And for others it might be athletics or music or whatever I would love to see them starting to think more broadly business-like in terms of what value they can bring in and to start to ask hey can you loosen this requirement so that we can do this”

### Why kids need more outdoor time

  

_Long clip, and a newsletter segment on why children need to be outdoors more._

## Transcript

“Isaac: Go back 20 30 years ago most kids And even when I grew up well I guess that was 20 30 years ago now Yeah I'm older than I'd like to think You know when we grew up and certainly before that most kids when they were not in school were outside running around And so we spent a lot of time outside running around And then if you're in school and it's like hey come inside sit down do some more calm indoor activity you know that's not such a that's not such a stark thing like hey since we have so much time running around outside it's not the worst thing in the world to sit down and be in a classroom for for some time during the day now kids are not running around outside nearly as much as they did they are mostly sitting down inside uh on screens and doing passive activities way way way more than they ever did And so even if it even like I would argue that back then there was still too much trying to keep kids sitting down inside in schools But at least then when they weren't in school they were running around almost all the time now they're not And so when you think about that it's like if you say what do we need What do kids actually need Well when they're not in school they're mostly just sitting on the couch on screens Let's use that school time to say okay this is the time where you're not going to sit inside and be on a screen where you're going to be outside So at least we can make sure you're getting that you're outside you're running around and kind of like reversing the roles almost of school versus non-school time and realizing and if they're not sitting inside on screens I know that it's often you're just commuting from thing to thing Like I know with my youngest He's just in the car a lot because my wife were driving the other kids around and doing sports And I'm always like if there was somewhere I can drop him off where I know he's going to be outside running around a lot I would do it in a heartbeat And I think most parents now have that feeling Like my kids are inside sitting down on screens too much Any place I can take them that promises to get them out there Sounds like a win And I would love to see more of that schools and things focused on So that gets me really excited that you mentioned that Not to mention the increase in ADHD autism on various levels among the spectrum that there's just a different set of needs than kind of the old assumptions about what a school should be Yeah yeah”

  

  

_Cold intro: Use a combination-_

"If you look at pictures from the early 1900s, the classrooms don't look fundamentally different today than they did then. Have we not found better ways to do things?"  
[Timestamp: 00:30:00]

"Public schools are asked to be all things to all people. And therefore, they do a lot of things, but they don't do a lot of things at a very high level."  
[Timestamp: 00:31:00]

"The good teachers just decide to be civilly disobedient and do what they think is best."

## Quotes on Part-Time Schools & Microschools

### Flexible High Schools - Part-Time Attendance

> "Can we really lean into that and say to these homeschool families or families who are trying to just do something differently hey What if you only had to come 3 days a week What if you could I mean that's one of the hardest things with high school Kids want to earn money and save when they're in their teens You don't have any time to work if you're in school all day and then you have sports What if it's like hey 2 days a week you can go work a job which actually you're going to learn a ton anyway And then you can come in 3 days a week or 2 days a week or whatever and trying to create more flexibility"

### High School as Transition Period

> "I think that high school spot especially given how much people are recognizing that the cost of college is not matching up with the value they get afterwards And so things that help you transition better and better understand if you're working more or you're apprenticing or you're interning during that high school time that helps you think more clearly about what you want to do next Should you go to college Is it worth it Should you try to go right into your career So I think that's a place that's ripe for experimentation And like as a public school That is where you can reach a lot of these families where they want that social aspect that's much harder to piece together when you're at that age as a homeschooler"

### Parents Want Outdoor Time for Kids

> "if there was somewhere I can drop him off where I know he's going to be outside running around a lot I would do it in a heartbeat And I think most parents now have that feeling Like my kids are inside sitting down on screens too much Any place I can take them that promises to get them out there Sounds like a win And I would love to see more of that schools and things focused on"

  

# riverside_jon_& isaac _ dec 22, 2024 001_opened_podcast

[00:00:00] Hey, how's it going, man? Good. Great to see you. Let's see here. Let me make sure I have, why is this saying it's not? Okay, I'm just trying to close these other, uh, other tabs.

isaac: Uh, how is, uh, how's Utah right now? Freezing cold? You

Jon: know, it's actually been really warm, and it's weird. I, I want snow for Christmas, because that's what I'm used to.

Um, and you're, uh, are you a big

isaac: skier?

Jon: Uh, I do like to ski, yeah, so that, that helps. My kids actually all have, like, Uh, season passes to go up and ski. My wife and I didn't get one. We'll just go when we can with them. But that, that's, uh, how

isaac: many kids do you have? Five, five. Okay. I thought it was five or six.

Um, there's so many of those things. Like people ask me like, Oh, do you golf? I'm like, I mean, I enjoy golf. I probably golf once every two years now [00:01:00] because I have all these kids. Like there are certain things that at a phase of life activities that take a whole day, like, yeah. You don't just like run out and ski like you can run out and shoot hoops, you know, so I'm like, I haven't, I used to ski and snowboard growing up in Michigan.

So it was small hills, but like we had homeschool deals where the homeschoolers negotiated to get like 5 day passes. As long as we were out by 3 PM when school got out for everyone else. So Tuesdays and Thursdays. We went skiing all day long from like seven in 3 PM all through my, uh, like most of my homeschool life.

And it was just a blast. And, um, since my wife and I have had kids, I don't, I don't think I've skied in 20 years. I'd be a mess. Yeah. Um, all right. Uh, let's see here. And by the way, where are you in Salt Lake City or what part of Utah are you in?

Jon: Um, I'm like 30 minutes north by

isaac: Ogden. Got it. I don't know how familiar you are with Utah, but a little bit.

Every time I'm there, I'm always trying to like mentally map. [00:02:00] I actually, one thing I hate about smartphones and stuff is that when I go to a new city, I usually have a rental car. I'm driving around and my, if my only experience is following the directions, I never really have that bird's eye view. So I actually, like, I always give myself this challenge.

If I'm there for more than a day, can I figure out how to get places without the GPS as much as possible and like, nice. So I actually could mentally map, but, um, are you, is Libertas uh, remote or do you guys have an office that you go to daily or a mix?

Jon: Uh, we

isaac: do

Jon: a mix. So I do two days in office and three days at home.

isaac: Okay. Got it. That's honestly like the perfect mix right now. I'm just at home all the time. And I'm like, I need, I just have not found a good coworking space that isn't far enough where I'm just stuck in traffic the whole time. I'm like, I just want like two days a week where I'm out and a coffee shop is too noisy, you know?

So anyway, um, okay. I want to make sure I'm pronouncing it right. Libertas, right? [00:03:00] Libertas. Libertas. Libertas. Yeah. No matter what every attempt I make, I get it wrong. I swear.

Jon: Well, and you know, maybe it's our, our founder tried deliberately made it hard so that we knew who was insiders and who weren't.

isaac: Yeah.

I said Libertas for the longest time. And then finally I heard Connor say Liber and I was like, Oh Liber, but I, but I was, I was emphasizing the ah instead of the, the short vowel there. Uh, let me see here. Oh, come on. It's telling me my connection is frozen. Um, Did you lose me? All right. I'm going to see if I'm back.

All right. Can you hear me now? Okay. Let me see if I can change my video resolution to something lower. I've been having.

I've been

isaac: having internet issues that drive me crazy. I theoretically I have like the fastest internet money can buy. Um, theoretically is when it is, but then other times it's not. So, uh, let me [00:04:00] see.

I don't know if it'll, okay. Well, it doesn't, I don't know if it'll get any better, but the good thing about Riverside, if you've never used it before is it's, it's uploading locally each of our streams, right? So. If I freeze at any point, just continue going as if I didn't and it will get synced up later.

We can fix it later. Okay.

Jon: Yeah, I have Riverside before. So that is a really nice, uh, feature of that, that program.

isaac: I would love to kind of use your story as a jumping off point, uh, for some of the other things, um, and then like some of the research that you've been doing or some of the areas that you're particularly interested in now and kind of like lay the backdrop, what got you into this and your own approach to everything, and then maybe we can chat near the end at more like Recent current things that are happening in your view of, of those things for Utah and beyond, if you have, you know, thoughts on the national scene also.

Perfect. Okay. Um, so it looks like it actually has been [00:05:00] recording already. I didn't know that it started already. Uh, so we'll just Charlie, whoever will edit this out and we'll start in just a second. Welcome back to the open ed podcast. Uh, this is a conversation that is long overdue because we have talked many times and every conversation ends with, Oh, we've got to get you on the podcast.

Well, we're finally here. I've got John England from Libertas. Uh, he is a education policy analyst, but he is also deeply involved in. Open education himself throughout the public school system and now homeschooling his own kids and being an advocate and a policy analyst in the education space. So John, good to have you.

Glad to be here. So I want to start actually with your story. Cause I was browsing, you know, you and I have chatted a lot of times and it's always been in the context of things happening in the world of education, but I didn't actually know your own real background until just before the show. I was reading your bio.

I didn't know that you were [00:06:00] a 14 year veteran of public schools. So I would love to kind of hear your own story. Obviously you went into education through the public school system. You are homeschooling your children and a big advocate for alternative education, what we like to call open education, school choice, education, freedom.

Tell me about that journey. Like where did you get started and what did you learn in that process of an award winning teacher? It looks like fifth and sixth grades, uh, in the public school system.

Jon: Yeah, it's, uh, it is an interesting story. So, uh, yeah, after 14 years of in the public education system, my wife and I decided to homeschool our kids and I left the public education system.

Um, some of that was not necessarily by my own choice. Uh, but we had, so I taught for seven years in fifth and sixth grade. And I really loved working with low income students because. That's kind of who I am. I came from this very kind of low income [00:07:00] background in my life And that's who I cared about and I knew that education could change people's lives.

That's why I went into education That's why I became a teacher and as I was there I became frustrated as a teacher because I felt like there were all these rules on me as a teacher To be able to make the changes I wanted to, um, for the lives of the children that I was serving. And so I became a principal thinking I could remove some of those rules.

I could make things easier. Uh, what I found was that being a principal made me a middle manager, and I was just supposed to do whatever the district told me to do. Rather than what I knew was best for kids. Uh, there were many times where I had to jump through so many hoops, uh, sometimes bending them to get myself through them, but, uh, to, to help a student who needed something, uh, whether that was a student who was behind or a student who was ahead.

We, we were trying to think outside the box. And, uh, As, as we got going, I, you know, 2020 happened and I saw [00:08:00] these things happening that I just. Didn't agree with, right? I, I saw the public schools pushing parents out of the building, not allowing them to come in and volunteer with their own children, which all the research indicates that an involved parent.

Is a big deal for a child's success in education. And so, you know, that was happening and then, uh, come the, the September of 2021. Uh, the state board of education was considering a policy. on, and not to get into super political things, but considering a policy about transgender students. And basically the policy was saying that the district, that the schools had no requirement to let parents know if a child decided to transition at home.

I didn't think that was right. I'm not the child's parent, I shouldn't be making that decision as a school principal. The parents should. And so I made that statement. I got investigated by the district for making that statement to the public school board [00:09:00] or to the state school board Uh as a public comment, uh come just a few weeks later And I had a student show up this again.

This is october 2021 fall of 2021 after all the covid craziness and my uh I had a student show up whose parents said hey, he has tested positive for covid but he Is isn't showing any symptoms. He's been out for two weeks. Can he come to school because he's behind in, in, in learning? And I made a mistake here.

I said, I think it's up to you as the parent to decide that. And I let the kid come into the school to learn. And that COVID ended up blowing up in my, in my school. And I ended up not necessarily being fired completely, but they were going to reduce me from being a principal. Thing that I wasn't making very good decisions and make me a teacher and I just decided You know, I'll [00:10:00] probably be here again, so I'm just going to walk away.

And so that's how I walked away from the public school system. In the meantime, my own kids were struggling in school. Um, especially junior high. Junior high, for some reason, is just really hard for a lot of people.

isaac: That is that crunch point. Matt talks about this a lot too. Like that is one of the hardest times for kids in general.

And I think it gets exacerbated kind of, kind of like all the worst stereotypes about that you see on movies and stuff about like clicks and bullying and trying to be popular and whatever. Those are often portrayed as high school. I think middle school is really where, cause kids don't yet have the maturity and a strong enough sense of self to really like be okay.

Bucking the trends and they're just trying to figure out who they are, where they fit in to such an extreme. I, I, I totally agree with you. Middle school is really like a crucible.

Jon: Yeah. The, the joke that we had in, in public schools was that middle school was the worst [00:11:00] three years of anybody's life. And, uh, you know, and, and, and so my own kids were in middle school and they were struggling.

Um, they were struggling with a variety of things. And so my wife decided to pull them. We put my junior high students, We found a local micro school, um, that was very small, like 70 students. And so we enrolled them there and they thrived. They loved it. They loved the smaller classes. They loved it. It's only three days a week.

And so the other two days they could be at home doing stuff with me and my wife. And then my wife pulled my youngest two to homeschool at that same time. And so. It was just kind of this, all of this kind of came together in 2021. And, and now I'm here, I'm here with Libertas and advocating for parent rights and microschools.

isaac: So there, there's a lot of interesting threads in that story. I want to comment briefly on the three days a week thing. It is amazing how much of a difference that one change alone makes. [00:12:00] And I think it's funny cause we know this as adults. There's been many, many times where I've been trying to hire someone, uh, as a contractor or something.

And if they're, if they're, um, you know, let's say a mom, it's like a second income and they don't, they don't need necessarily full time. The common thing is like, Hey, I'd like to work maybe three days a week. Because that's an amount that I can do. It's enjoyable. If it's more than that, I'm going to be fried.

And this is as an adult, this is like, we understand this, right? If you have a commitment, that's three days a week, two days a week, you have that ability to go in and be refreshed. Sending kids every day, five days a week for a lot of ages. In high school, maybe that's what they want, right? But before that, when they're younger, it's just, it's a lot, it's really taxing.

And it's, it's amazing how just that alone, a lot of times I'm talking to people about homeschooling. They're like, Whoa, but your kid, they're isolated, whatever. But when I say actually they go to a co op, which is kind of just like a small school two days a week. And then it's like, Oh, that actually sounds great.

Cause like my kids, I [00:13:00] like it when they're home with me more and they like it. They can't be there all the time. And it's just amazing that the rigidity and that's kind of your whole story. The rigidity of this system, uh, was just something you kept running up against. And I think the fact that put aside whatever beliefs and opinions people have about the specifics of COVID or what was being taught, both of those instances where you defaulted to the assumption.

That the parents are the primary owner of their child's education and the one primarily responsible and the school is supposed to serve them and the paradigm that you ran against is actually the opposite. 100%. The school is in charge of the child, of their education, of what and how they learn and the parent is just supposed to adapt to that.

I think that's the thing that is fundamentally, um, you know, what, what you were feeling and what you were running up against.

Jon: Yeah, a hundred percent, a hundred percent. Um, and it was interesting. So I've always like with my oldest, my oldest is 18. Now she finished up the K 12 portion of that last [00:14:00] May. Um, and, uh, one of the things that I look back, even, even with her, so in kindergarten, we, we sent her to the local public school, kindergarten and first grade.

But come second grade, we're like, we need something different for her. So we went and found a charter school and centered there for a couple of years. And, and so we were always looking for something better, something that fit her more. And, and so that that's really what it comes down to. I've always been of the opinion, even, and this is a controversial opinion as a public school teacher, you know, that parents should be able to choose what schools they go to, even if it's a different public school and who their teacher is.

Like most public schools don't allow for those things. And you know, this is somebody who's spending a significant amount of time with your child. You should be able to have a voice in that decision.

isaac: It's so funny how We just take for granted that lack of choice when it comes to teachers, but in other [00:15:00] areas of life I mean if you are gonna have your kid take 30 minute piano lesson once a week One 30 minute slot a week and you get a piano teacher and you can just tell your kids personality and this teacher's personality Don't jive.

It's not working. Well, you're going to go find another one. You're gonna find Hey, I love this teacher because they really connect with my child But then in school, we're just sort of, we just sort of accept, well, I hope they get a good teacher this year and they're going to be with them all the time, way more than 30 minutes.

And if they really don't get along and their life is miserable, we kind of feel like, well, that's just what it is. And like taking that mindset that we apply in the other areas of our life as responsible consumers of other types of goods and services, like But I think there's just this kind of magic spell around public education as this thing that's just like this box that's set in stone and we don't think of it in the same way.

So I want to go back though real quick because you mentioned, um, coming from a lower income background and the impact [00:16:00] that some people had had on your lives, which is what got you into education. As a kid, what was your experience in school? Like,

Jon: you know, honestly, school was fairly easy for me. I did have a science teacher in high school that really opened my mind.

And I would, I would credit his ability to connect with me, um, as my desire for going into the education system. I've, I've always loved learning. I mean, I got really good grades. I mean, I didn't get straight A's, but I mean, I was A's and B's throughout my high school career and I didn't have to try super hard to get that right.

So school was always easy for me. Um, but, but yeah, this one teacher, he inspired me. In fact, when I very first went into education, I was thinking I'm going to become a biology teacher, just like my teacher. That I had in high school. Um, and then it wasn't until I was challenged to, um, try elementary school that I'm like, actually, I really like elementary kids.

And so I'm going to go teach there.

isaac: What, [00:17:00] um, so you mentioned when you moved to the role of principal, imagining that this would kind of give you more, more leverage to impact more, to, to help kids access the things that they needed access, et cetera, but you ended up feeling like you were just kind of this middle layer, this middle management and your hands were sort of tied in both directions.

I've heard that many, many times. And I also have seen these charts that show the growth of student population, the growth of teachers, and then the growth of non teaching staff at public schools. And if I'm remembering correctly, I think non teaching staff just exceeded the The number of teachers. Now, I don't know if this is average across all states or where, but I remember seeing if nothing else, the trend, the hiring trend is non teaching staff is growing much faster than teaching staff, and it feels like adding more layers in between.

It doesn't seem like it's going in the right [00:18:00] direction. So I'm curious if you have, as a, as a policy analyst and as somebody who's been in the system, what's driving this, like, is this a real trend or have I been seeing reports that are inaccurate of just this continual bloat higher education has had the same problem.

The number of staff that are not professors just like off the charts. It just keeps growing. And that doesn't seem to be making anybody happier. It's not making people's experience of school or of college. A better one, at least it would seem. What do you think is driving that? What are those dynamics and what are your thoughts?

Jon: Yeah. So if you think about a public school classroom, you have the federal government who's making laws. The federal department of education is making rules about those laws. Then the state government is making laws about what has to happen inside of a classroom. The state board of education then makes rules about those laws.

The local school district then makes rules and laws. Sometimes the superintendent just says, Hey, here's a procedure we're going to follow. And then you get to a principal, [00:19:00] who is then trying to make some procedures for the entire school because, hey, we're a community. And all that culminates in a classroom, right?

Some of those rules and laws require the district to hire administrators, and there is a lot of this bureaucratic bloat. And teachers are feeling like their hands are tied. I can only teach this. I can't go faster or slower than this because of all these rules and laws that are culminating in their classroom.

And the good teachers just decide to be civilly disobedient and do what they think is best. And the okay teachers will try their best to follow that. And the, you know, and that's really like where we end up is all these rules are focusing in on one classroom. And And it's really hard for a teacher to decide like, yes, I want to try this because I think this student needs it.

And they just run into barrier after barrier and rule after rule that they have to try and comply with, uh, in order to do whatever the thing is. [00:20:00] And, and that's really what's happening. I think, you know, and, and, you know, you'll get some of these national advocacy groups, you know, the NEA or whatever, they're advocating for some of these rules to exist, that's creating this administrative bloat.

That is happening at the district and state levels.

isaac: Yeah, and, and, you know, the again, I always love to look at incentives rather than try to, um. Judge people's motives or say, if only we had people that wanted better things, like let's just be charitable and say, everybody wants good things and children to learn and whatever.

But if you look at the incentive structures, oftentimes these groups, trade associations, et cetera, they are better off if they have more members, right? And so if there are more roles required, it's the same problem we have with, with unions in, in other areas of the world. work, like the more jobs that are required to do the same thing, whether or not that's actually adding value to the consumer at the end of the day, they have that incentive.

It's funny because I think we have all [00:21:00] experienced this in the healthcare realm in the U S which is different, um, than education in many ways, but there's a lot of similarities. Um, Where you go to a typical health practitioner and there's very little thought of like, okay, you the consumer, what do you want and how can we best get it to you?

It's kind of like, okay, which box do you fit in? Uh, take a few tests. Oh, you, I think you have this thing. Let's route you over here. And most of that is driven by how they can code things to insurance or to Medicare and Medicaid. And so they're trying to fit you into a box that has some pre described code, and then you have people trying to, you know, abuse the system or spend too much.

And so then they got to have another layer that like reviews it and you create more rules. And it's this constant process. It's people trying to. Not allow the system to be abused or to spend too much money on the wrong things. But what that results in is layers and layers and [00:22:00] layers of rule makers. And there's such little connection, direct connection between the practitioner, let's say the doctor and the patient.

Everybody's serving some other party. And there's no transparency around like the relative cost. And value of things. So if you go into a medical facility and say, Hey, uh, how much is an MRI? Like, that's a foreign question to most medical practitioners. How much is it to get an exam for this? They're like, what are you talking about?

They don't, they don't think in prices because all these things are paid for by other parties. And so I think that concept of like bringing the same market discipline into these arenas that we bring into other areas is this goal. It will always be challenging as long as money is coming from government in some fashion, but there are ways to move closer in that direction and, and to, to start to treat these like markets.

And I think like, how much is this individual class worth? Like, Hey, this teacher, you know, when people say teachers are not paid enough or they're paid too [00:23:00] https: otter. ai That's kind of a hard thing to say in the abstract. It's like, well, there's some teachers who probably could overfill their classes every single year and they could, they could charge people far more than other teachers, uh, in an open market.

And like, but we don't know, we have no, we have no visibility into that because there aren't these prices. So anyway, all that set up to say, I'm guessing this is kind of, Some of the impetus behind things like these ESAs, like Utah has the Utah fits all trying to bring more market thinking competition, some of the transparency into the system.

Uh, and like, what are your take on. If someone is a advocate of public schools and they say, Hey, we need to have public support to help people get education. How could you see something like this as not a threat to that mission, but as something that actually will help deliver that promise better?

Jon: So the one thing I'll say is as a school principal.

I spent the majority of my time working with the students [00:24:00] who don't fit in the public school system. You know, maybe it serves 70%, 80%, 90 percent of the local population to go to the public school. Great. If your child loves that type of education, they should go there. Um, but there is definitely a segment of our population of students who don't fit.

In that system. And so these programs like an ESA, um, the Utah, it's all Arizona has it, Florida has it, a whole bunch of States have it, and probably more States will have it this upcoming year. Um, it's for these students that. Don't fit in that system. They, they struggle for whatever reason. Maybe it's sitting for six to seven hours a day, five days a week.

Maybe they need a half day program. You can't really do that in the public education system because you're getting paid for the amount of time a student is in their seat. And so allowing them to have this option provides an opportunity for them to [00:25:00] go and do and get the education they need. Um, there's one program here in Utah.

It's called Breakout School. I'm, I'm fascinated by this program. It's five days a week, but they spend 80 to 90 percent of their time outside. And it's designed specifically for students with autism and ADHD. And so those kids are able to, when they need to, just run over to a playground or run around the park or wherever they're at and get their energy out and then come back and, and buckle down and do 15 more minutes of math and then go run around for another five minutes if they need to.

And the person running this, his name's Dr. Dow Richardson. He calls them the, these problems that they have, their superpower. He's like, Public schools don't look at it at those problems as a superpower, right? So these programs are popping up and they're popping up all over the country. Um, and they're very specific.

They're very, um, niched down, right? So when you get into a business, you know, you don't think about public schools [00:26:00] this way, but when you get into a business, finding your niche of who you're serving is a big deal. And so he has niched down to, I'm serving kids with autism and ADHD. And he's doing amazing things.

You know, he has kids who come and they hate school. He it's a fourth through eighth grade program. They hate school. They go back to high school in ninth grade. And he's mentioned multiple times. He has students who go back there hating school. They enter high school, they're getting A's and B's and they're loving it because now all of a sudden they found their love of learning by having this program.

That fit who they were.

isaac: That, that niche down concept, you know, I've been an entrepreneur for a number of years and that's always been such a powerful question. I think for all business owners, like, okay, what do I do really well? What does our business do better than most? And can we keep bringing our focus back there?

Cause that's where we're going to create the most value versus trying to, to be everything and do things that we're not great at. That concept is very foreign to most schools and, [00:27:00] and school leaders, educators, but I think it's so powerful if you can ask, what do we do really well? What do we do uniquely well?

And can we focus more on that and not try to be everything to everyone? Your typical local school is like, Yeah, we just serve all children with all grades and all subjects and all programs and we do them all just trust us to do them all and it's like, well, you're going to, you're going to have some things you do better than others.

And so trying to like, lean into that rather than rather than like level everything out. Um, it's funny that you just, I had this thought where you were talking about that program, which sounds amazing. About the way that, you know, things have shifted in terms of what kids need. Go back 20, 30 years ago, most kids.

And even when I grew up, well, I guess that was 20, 30 years ago. Now I'm older than I'd like to think, you know, when we grew up and, and certainly before that, most kids, when they were not in school, we're outside running around. And so we [00:28:00] spent a lot of time outside running around. And then if you're in school and it's like, Hey, come inside, sit down, do some more calm indoor activity.

You know, that's not such a, that's not such a stark thing. Like, Hey, since we have so much time running around outside, it's not the worst thing in the world to sit down and be in a classroom for some time during the day, now kids are not running around outside nearly as much as they did. They're mostly sitting down inside.

on screens and doing passive activities way, way, way more than they ever did. And so even if it, even if like, I would argue that back then there was still too much trying to keep kids sitting down inside in schools, but at least then when they weren't in school, they were running around almost all the time.

Right now they're not. And so when you think about that, it's like, if you say, what do we need, what do kids actually need? Well, when they're not in school, they're mostly just sitting on the couch on screens. Let's use that school time to say, okay, this is the time where you're not going to sit inside and be on a screen where you're going to be outside.

So at least we can make sure you're getting that you're [00:29:00] outside, you're running around and kind of like reversing the roles almost of school versus non school time and realizing, and if they're not sitting inside on screens, I know that it's often, you're just commuting from thing to thing. Like I know with my youngest, he's just in the car a lot because my wife were driving the other kids around and doing sports.

And I'm always like. If there was somewhere I can drop him off where I know he's going to be outside running around a lot, I would do it in a heartbeat. And I think most parents now have that feeling. Like my kids are inside sitting down on screens too much. Any place I can take them that promises to get them out there.

Sounds like a win, and I would love to see more of that, uh, schools and things focused on. So that gets me really excited that you mentioned that, not to mention the increase in ADHD, autism, uh, various levels along the spectrum, that there's just a different set of needs than kind of the old assumptions about what a school should be.

Jon: Yeah, yeah. The assumption of what a school should be definitely needs to change. I mean, really, you can go back and you can look at pictures [00:30:00] from the early 1900s, and the classrooms don't look fundamentally different. today than they did then. Yeah, maybe there's like a, a smart board or a touchscreen TV up at the front of the room.

Maybe the kids have a, a laptop or a Chromebook in front of them. But for the most part, they're still kind of sitting in rows and, and, and doing the same thing that they did back in 1920s. Have we not found better ways to do things? Like, All other industries have progressed in some way, shape or form, right?

You know, we've, we've learned like going back to your, your medical, uh, example. Right. They learned early on, hey, I need to wash my hands between every patient I see, because that prevents the spread of disease. Hey, we learned about this thing called antibiotics that can help prevent, uh, death when somebody gets an infection.

Like, those are amazing things. How come we haven't had that in education? It's because we're all asked to do the same thing. And again, the public schools are asked to be all things to all people. [00:31:00] And therefore, they do a lot of things, but they don't do a lot of things. At a very high level.

isaac: Yeah, it's funny.

Um, I had a great conversation with, uh, Darrell Bradford, who's kind of a, uh, school choice, education, freedom advocate. And he made this great point that like, it's easy to have these conversations and talk about, Hey, to, to serve kids in this way and customize what they need. It's all about sort of these alternative options.

Another part of that conversation is how, how can public schools also be free to adapt more and, uh, you know, I've, some public school leaders will say things like, well, it's not fair that kids who get a UFA scholarship can use it to buy a Lego set where I can't, I can't use my funds to buy that for my kids in the classroom.

And the answer is not to shut down UFA. It's to open up what the public school teachers can do and give them more of that freedom and flexibility. Let them take their kids [00:32:00] outside more. Let them do so. Like, I would love to see. And I think that's the intent for a lot of these rather than the public school advocates trying to shut down these alternatives because they have unfair advantages.

Public school advocates saying we need those same advantages too. So we can compete and let's focus on what we really do well. And for some schools, it might be, we have an amazing science lab and we're amazing at science. We have great science teachers. We're really going to double down and do that. And kids are going to choose to come here for that.

Um, and for others, it might be athletics or music or whatever. Like I would love to see them starting to think more business like in terms of what value they can bring in and to start to ask, Hey, can you loosen this requirement so that we can do this? Um, and I think that's one of the, at least theoretical benefits of any kind of school choice program is that if, if you're losing students to some program that has more flexibility, Then it, then it starts to make you say, Hey, wait a minute.

We need this flexibility too. So I'm curious if you have seen any of that yet. I know it's [00:33:00] very early in Utah, but in Utah or other States, have you seen public schools starting to innovate a little bit in response to some of these programs that have given parents more choices?

Jon: Yeah, actually, uh, interestingly knowing that, you know, this is formerly my tech high and now open ed that I'm talking with, um, during, I was principal during the 2020 school year.

And we tried to provide an online education system for students. And they hated it. The students hated it. The parents hated it. The teachers hated it. It was terrible. Uh, we lost 700 elementary students in our district during that time, which is a lot. And most of them went to at that point, my tech high, and we're using that to educate their children at home via online platforms or whatever it was.

And so within a quarter. The district changed and all of a sudden had a dedicated online program as opposed to what they were doing, which was [00:34:00] asking the in person classroom teacher to do, be both an online teacher and an in person teacher. That was the, that was the disaster. They wanted them to do both and it felt like they were trying to teach two classes at the same time all day.

That's hard. That's a really hard thing to do. And so, um, that competition from my tech high, uh, created a change. faster than I'd ever seen it in my 14 years in public education, because students chose something different. And that's going to continue to happen. Schools are going to try and find things that parents want.

And start to do, um, a local, the local district here that I live in has an amazing in person high school program that's very specialized. I, I can't remember the name of it right now, but they have it, it exists, and it, it's attracting actually homeschool students back into the public education system because of how cool it is.

Um, it's not a traditional high school, it's very different, [00:35:00] and it allows them a lot of the same freedoms that homeschool has, which is they can kind of come and go as they need to, but, but they're doing some things differently. Now, the most, most of their schools are still kind of doing that traditional thing, but yeah, we need, we need to see the public school system start to take some of these, uh, I don't, I don't want to say chances, but, but do things a little bit differently.

And they can do it the way that this district did let's try this little program Yeah, if it works with 30 kids, let's grow to 100 kids and and let it go They have the opportunity to do that and they have the funds to do it and they should

isaac: Yep. Yeah. I love the pilot programs like that. I think it's such a good idea to have a Hey, we'll run the core like we have been, but let's have somebody who we have the ability to say, go run a pilot.

See if you can serve 50 students with this new model. Let's see what we learn. Very low risk. I thought about that a lot, especially in terms of like, if I put myself in the shoes of, if I'm, if I'm, you know, running a public school and I'm going to try to think in this world, let's [00:36:00] assume that things like UFA and these other ESAs and programs continue to expand.

How am I going to think about What can I offer in this world to make sure that we don't just slowly bleed everybody out? Some of the big advantages, I think high school is one of the biggest advantages. That is an area where a homeschoolers they get to that age and they just want as much time as they can out of the house, hanging around their friends, the sports and all of the things that come with a high school experience.

Are one of the more attractive parts of that. And I think saying, well, let's lean into that and say, how can we create a high school experience? We have all the facilities, we have all the sports teams, all the extracurriculars, we have the things that are attractive. Can we really lean into that and say to these homeschool families or families who are trying to just do something differently?

Hey. What if you only had to come three days a week? What if you could, I mean, that's one of the hardest things with high school. Kids want to earn money and save when they're in their teens. You know, like you don't have any time to work if you're in school all [00:37:00] day and then you have sports. What if it's like, Hey, two days a week, you can go work a job, which actually you're going to learn a ton anyway.

And then you can come in three days a week or two days a week or whatever. And trying to create more flexibility. I think that high school spot, especially given. How much people are recognizing that the cost of college is not matching up with the value they get afterwards. And so things that help you transition better and better understand if you're working more or you're apprenticing or you're interning during that high school time, that helps you think more clearly about what you want to do next.

Should you go to college? Is it worth it? Should you try to go right into your career? So I think that's a place that's right for. Uh, experimentation and like as a public school, that is where you can reach a lot of these families where they, they want that social aspect. That's much harder to piece together when you're at that age as a homeschooler

Jon: and the other thing that high schools, the local high schools provide is.

For the most part, they have highly specialized advanced classes in the [00:38:00] topics that the kids are interested in. Right. I can probably teach my kids through eighth grade math. Yes. Parents, parents, and I'm a math guy. I like math, but you asked me to start teaching calculus. Like I took calculus and I did well in it, but I don't think I could teach calculus right now.

And so there's a specialized class at the high school. Let the kids go and do it. And they can, and currently under Utah law anyway. Okay. The public schools can become a provider and provide those one time classes and create a fee for that, that the Utah fits all would then turn around and pay for it.

And so that's exciting. They have the opportunity. I just don't know if they'll do it.

isaac: Yeah, that's 100 percent because you're right to, uh, you know, I've, I've been a part of homeschool co ops as, as growing up as a homeschooler and then with my own children, and it's not that hard in a community to find someone who can teach.

Pretty much any subject through about the eighth grade level. It gets really hard to find a homeschool parent. Who's like, yeah, I can teach trigonometry or, you know what I mean? Like [00:39:00] it gets, it gets really hard. So, um, that, and that's one of those areas where they do excel. So I'd love to talk a little bit about, um, You, you mentioned that you have started to dabble a little bit in researching, um, you know, post, post K through 12, looking at college, uh, kind of looking at that landscape.

I'm curious what you're looking at there, if you have specific research you're doing or something that you're curious about, different trends happening there or what, what's put your attention there.

Jon: Yeah, it, it's kind of this idea of, uh, and maybe it's because I'm, it's following the lives of my children.

Right. I now have somebody who is post high school. And so I'm looking at it. Trust me,

isaac: that, that is exactly my career and like what I have needed for my family. They tend to, you know, like, Oh, suddenly I'm interested in this area. Probably because my kids are customers in that area now.

Jon: Exactly. Exactly. And that's exactly what's going on is I'm looking at my, my 18 year old daughter.

Does a four year of really kind of continuing what happened in the K 12 public education system make sense for her? [00:40:00] She, she didn't love the public K 12 system. Like that's why she, we pulled her out when she was a junior and, and did something different. And so maybe it doesn't. And so I'm looking at all these different options.

Um, as far as policies go, I'm not really seeing a lot of different things that, that need to necessarily change, but there are other options out there. There's, there's things called gap years that not everybody knows about. Right. But if you, a lot of people will take a gap year where they just kind of go and play.

But there are organized gap years where you can go and actually explore careers and be like, do I like this? Is this something I want to do? There's other programs out there that will help you really hone in on maybe maybe it's not finding a career You're interested in maybe it's finding a career that meets your goals You know, some people would love to be a welder, but they also want to be able to go home at 3 p.

m. Every day and be done for the day so they can coach their kids, you know, high school football team or whatever it is They want to go coach and so you can [00:41:00] find a career that that builds upon that and and often you can find a Education path that will get you there in a year or less If you follow it, and, and so it ends up saving the kids time and money, they can get into their career, they can start making money and they don't end up with, you know, 40, 50, 000 worth of debt from college as they exit after, you know, most four year degrees are actually taking about eight years now and, and they exit the system.

Right. And so there's different ways that they can do that. And so that's really what I'm looking at. There's opportunities there for a kid to. Do something really cool, right?

isaac: Yeah, I, I think, uh, trying to reframe the discussion instead of like, okay, should I go to college or not? And if you say no, then the immediate question is like, well, what do I do?

Like, uh, this feels like this binary choice when I launched, uh, Praxis, uh, college alternative program, like 10 years ago, [00:42:00] one of the biggest things I would have these conversations with young people and pretty much universally, they were dissatisfied with. College as it presented itself. It was like, okay, like maybe it's a fun social experience, but it's really expensive and I'm just not confident it's going to help me find a job.

And like, I have to pick a major. So I have to pick and people say like, follow your passion, follow your wife. So I have to pick my lifetime passion. And then just like study classes in that and spend tons of money on it. And then just hope that I can get a job in that. That's a lot of pressure. And if I had a dollar for every single lawyer in particular, I've met who's like.

I wish I had never gone to law school. I thought that's what I wanted to do. By the time I got through law school, I had so much debt. The only job that would pay me enough to pay it off was being a lawyer. And I hate being a lawyer, but now I'm stuck. And like that feeling. So I always tell young people, instead of trying to be like, I have to find my passion.

And does it require spend like a year or two and try to answer the question, what are the things that I know [00:43:00] I don't want to do? Like, it's easier to find what you hate. Then to find like the one thing you love because what you love and what you're going to be doing in 20 years It probably doesn't even exist yet So like if you go out and say okay, I have a hunch that i'm kind of interested in maybe being a lawyer Let me go shadow a law firm for three months Probably 80 of people who do that will say you know what?

I actually don't want to be a lawyer like this doesn't look that fun. It's not that enjoyable to me, right? Go figure out The things that, and start to, that list will narrow down like, okay, I've realized that I don't want this, get as much exposure to these different things. And you'll start to learn about yourself.

Every time I'm doing this kind of thing, maybe it's really detail oriented or working with numbers. I always feel like really stressed and I'm not, I'm not liking it, but every time I'm doing like working with people and trying to convey ideas and little by little. You realize, Oh, if there's a, an accounting or operations job or major, that's not going to be for me.

Cause I've been exposed to that and I know it's not fun. If there's something in like sales or [00:44:00] marketing or something with people, I do, I think I might like that. Right. That's on the table and trying to just narrow that set by getting experiences. If you just sit around and imagine, I remember I had this when I was in college, like, should I major in it?

And I'm literally just looking at the titles of the majors and trying to guess I'm like public relations Well, I like people and I like relating I guess I could major in that like I didn't know what it meant You know what? I mean? It was like this crazy Notion that you're supposed to pick and of course 62 percent of people are working in a job that doesn't require a degree or that is not relevant to the degree that they have.

But you have this idea that you have to like pick the one thing. And that's where I just, I love anything, even starting in high school that gets young people out and exposed to the world. We've kind of developed this society where they're like, Kept away from the real world for almost 20 years in these like artificial environments that are totally disconnected.

And then they're just supposed to emerge and know exactly what they want to do and know how to do it. The earlier you can get [00:45:00] exposure to different types of careers and things out there in the world and start to figure out what you know, you don't want to do, and then what else is fair game, I think is, is really, really exciting to me, that was a long rambly rant, but this is an area you can tell I'm really passionate about.

Jon: Yeah, for sure. And, and I would say that, uh, one of the things that I love. So going back to, to what you were saying is college will always be there. If I decide to wait, I mean, I'm in Utah. We send our kids out on missions for two years and they don't start school until they're 20 or 21. Well, if you're not LDS and, and, and go do that, you could still take a couple of years and you'll turn out just fine.

But if you take a couple of years. And, and do that, you'll have a clearer idea of like, Oh, I do need a degree to go and do this thing because I actually want to be a doctor. Right? Um, interestingly, I, so I was actually thinking of Praxiswise tech thinking of the gap year programs. So that was a good job by you to pull that up.

But uh, there, there is [00:46:00] another program like out there that, that does this as well. It's a little bit more self guided. And one of the things they say, and I love this is. You can't hold a job that you don't know exists, right? So going out and just exploring, what is even available to me? You know, you get on something like Indeed or ZipRecruiter and they pull these reports and, you know, 75 percent of the jobs they have posted on Indeed and ZipRecruiter Don't even say that a college degree is preferred, let alone required.

And there are good jobs, especially for like an 18 year old, just coming out of college and you can go and explore. And, uh, one story I had is there was a young lady and, and this is a second hand story, so I haven't had this conversation, but she thought she wanted to be a veterinarian. So in her homeschool, luckily in her homeschool, uh, her mom got her an opportunity to shadow a veterinarian.

For two months. [00:47:00] And at the end of it, it's like, mom. I really like animals, but I do not want to be a veterinarian like I don't. And that saved her seven years at least. Right. Because to become a veterinarian, you're basically following a medical path. And so now all of a sudden she in, in two months, she learned that's not the right way for me to go.

I can go do something else. And, and that's a good thing. That's, that's a wise thing for kids to do rather than trying to figure that out at college where it's really expensive and time consuming.

isaac: Yeah, 100%. That's such a great point. Like as a parent, you have the opportunity to save your kids potentially years and tens of thousands if they have an interest, the sooner you can say, Hey, let's see if we can find somebody who will let you just come in and shadow or intern or whatever it is to get that exposure.

Man, that is the greatest gift you can give to your kids. Cause they might, they might just fall in love with it and latch onto it. Or they might say, yeah, this isn't for me. And it's easy to feel discouraged. Like, well, they went and did [00:48:00] that and that didn't work out. And then they went and did this thing and they said they didn't want to do that.

Don't be discouraged by that. That's a good thing. They're learning quicker what they do and don't want to do.

Jon: Yeah, absolutely. I think that's the, one of the best advice that people who have, uh, almost college age, uh, kids to, to go and do, have them go explore the things that they want out there, but also have them list down all the jobs they can think of, and then help them grow that list to 70, 80, a hundred jobs.

Most kids, when you do that really can only come up with about 10. 10 jobs. And if that's all, you know, that's all you'll look at doing when you leave home.

isaac: Yep. Yep. Yeah. That's, that's that old, you know, I always used to joke with people. It's like, when you're a kid, you're coming through the school system.

It's like, what do you want to be? And you grow up, the options are like astronaut, fireman, professional athlete, you know, and then like business. It's just like a guy with a briefcase. Like, what does that mean? It's like, okay, 90 percent of real world jobs fit into that bucket and there's infinite number of [00:49:00] variety, but most people don't have an idea.

John, this is an awesome combo. I would love if you have, um, any, anything in particular that you're reading or researching or curious about right now that, uh, you could get sort of leave us with.

Jon: Uh, so a book I just finished not too long ago was called the paper belt on fire. It's a by Michael Gibson.

This is kind of the beginning of my journey of like, Hey, college probably is just more of that conveyor belt model of the K 12 system. And it was really interesting book. So that book, uh, I would highly recommend it. Um, just know there's some swear words in it because he's dealing with business leaders who swear.

And so, uh, and directly quoting them. But, uh, that book really got me on this path of. College doesn't have to be the end all be all for your career. You can find different paths and the people who are starting, uh, companies like, uh, you know, oh man, like loom, [00:50:00] right. The video recording, that guy didn't finish college.

Like you can go and create. A new job that doesn't exist and start a company there and you don't need a degree to do it.

isaac: Yeah, I highly recommend that book as well. Michael's a great guy who's been in this space. He runs a venture capital fund called the 1517 fund and they specifically fund startups started by college dropouts or opt outs and The little backstory and how that came about, uh He, a bunch of different funds were like analyzing the difference between founders that had succeeded versus those that hadn't.

And they saw this pattern that like, what they're looking for is this combination of boldness and confidence and willingness to do things differently and whatever, and the single greatest thing that correlated to those characteristics. Was dropping out of college. And so they were like, let's find more founders who are willing to drop out of college to start their company, because this is so [00:51:00] strongly correlated with the traits that lead to success as an entrepreneur, the willingness to think differently from the status quo about how to get what you want and to drop out of college has a very high social cost to those willing to do it.

So it was just such a, it's a cool story. The genesis of that. Fun. And they've had a ton of success funding, um, dropouts. And so like the takeaway is not, Oh, you have to be a genius, you know, Bill Gates dropout in order to, for college to not make sense for you. This applies so much more broadly than that.

So yeah, I'm a, I'm a big fan of Michael in that book. And one of the

Jon: things, so I had a conversation with him too, about his book and, uh, you know, we hear about the home runs, right? The guys who are starting companies that are making almost a billion dollars a year, right? But he says like, he's got so many people in his network that, you know, he gave like a thousand bucks to, and they started a company and it's doing a million dollars a year.

That's still a very successful company, but it's not grabbing headlines because there's a lot of million dollar a year companies out there, but they're able to provide for their family. You know, they're pulling in [00:52:00] 150, 000 a year or whatever it is that they're pulling in. And they're able to support their family and create jobs for other people.

And it's such a great way. To, to just look at post K 12 education. Yeah, I love it.

isaac: I love it. You got me all fired up. Hey, John, thanks so much for finally sitting down with me and chatting. Uh, I'm sure we'll be talking more and we'll feature, uh, you know, some of your research, some of your stuff in the open ed daily, great to connect with you as always,

Jon: thanks for having me

isaac: on.
