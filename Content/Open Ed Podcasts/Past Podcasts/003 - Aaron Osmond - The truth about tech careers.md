📍 📍 📍 📍 So what are companies looking for in terms of IT and tech roles?

Once upon a time, it was a CS degree. Now, is it a bootcamp? Like, like what is the current philosophy there?

Industry vs. Education: Bridging the Skills Gap

📍 📍 📍 📍 For the last 30 years, I have been in roles connecting the tech industry to students in education for a very specific reason. Industry is not satisfied and has not been satisfied for decades around the quality

of potential future tech worker that is coming out of the education system, with the rare exception that there is a lot more satisfaction with what's happening coming out of the tech and community college system than the university systems across the globe.

While college and degrees and high school degrees prove that students can do hard things, that they can endure, that they can work hard, that they can finish things, it does not necessarily prove that they know how to do or utilize the tools and technologies that industry demands to be successful in the commercial marketplace.

Certification is nothing more than industry defining the technical skills required to be successful in the workplace and validating that independent of the education system itself. And it's a, been a critical project going on for decades, trying to meet this insatiable need, especially in tech around potential candidates that actually have proven skills in a given technology or suite of technologies.

### Clip 2 - Foundational Skills (Wordpress)

LinkedIn (Knowledge Pillars):  
WordPress powers almost 50% of all websites globally, with 400 million new sites built annually. In collaboration with @openedhq, we're ensuring students master these foundational skills critical for success in business, whether they're aspiring techies, marketers, or entrepreneurs.  

Twitter (Knowledge Pillars):  
Foundational skills like WordPress are crucial in today's digital landscape. That's why we've partnered with @openedhq to make these skills accessible to all, from techies to marketers and entrepreneurs.  

Facebook (Knowledge Pillars):  
Mastering foundational tech skills opens up a world of career possibilities. Through our partnership with @openedhq, we're helping students build these fundamentals, allowing them to better identify their interests and potential career paths in the tech world.

  

📍 📍 📍 📍 Let's take WordPress, for example, WordPress is used by almost 50 percent of all websites globally. 50%. There are 400 million new websites built on WordPress every year. Every major company, small business, and entrepreneur has to have a knowledge of WordPress to maximize the power of the web, enable social media, and turn on e commerce, all of these tools, right, that are so critical.

It's just a basic skill set, not just for techies. This applies to business and marketing personnel as well, right? They have to have these core skills. And most parents and families all do respect to all the families. They just have no idea that that's out, right? And so those basic skills are so critical for success in business.

And the same thing from a coding perspective, those foundational understandings of scripting language and web application languages, dynamic building of websites, for example. Those foundational skills are what you're going to learn and then it opens up your mind to all the other career paths that you can pursue that you didn't even think were possible.

Once you have those fundamentals, you know where you want to go. You can tell where your interests are. It just opens up a whole world of career possibilities.

📍 📍 📍 📍 And I'm telling you, if uh, you're a great WordPress developer who can take a mockup and build a site that looks just like that, I'm always looking for you, so send me an email.

### Clip 3 - Will AI Replace Humans?

[https://share.descript.com/view/a3pFwb4ojwP](https://share.descript.com/view/a3pFwb4ojwP)

**Captions**

LinkedIn (Knowledge Pillars):  
AI is a powerful tool, but it doesn't solve every problem. To maximize its potential, you need a fundamental understanding of how technology works. That's why we've teamed up with @openedhq to ensure students develop the problem-solving and critical thinking skills crucial for career success, regardless of technological advancements.  
Twitter (Knowledge Pillars):  
AI makes things faster and more efficient, but it doesn't replace the need for fundamental tech knowledge. With @openedhq, we're equipping students with the problem-solving and critical thinking skills needed to succeed in any career.  
Facebook (Knowledge Pillars):  
In the age of AI, having a strong foundation in tech skills is more important than ever. Our partnership with @openedhq focuses on helping students understand the fundamentals, allowing them to maximize the use of new tools and technologies, keeping them ahead in their careers.

[00:00:00] **Isaac:** Here's an objection that I get from , young people sometimes. "Eh, I don't think it's worth trying to learn to code or anything like that because, I can just pick up my phone and say, build me an app like this.

[00:00:10] And some AI tool will build it all. Why would I waste my time learning that it's going to be outmoded? What is your take on that?

## [00:00:17] The Role of AI in Future Careers

[00:00:17] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** AI is nothing more than a technology tool.

[00:00:20] It does make things happen faster, more effective, more efficiently, but it doesn't problem solve everything for you. If you don't have a fundamental understanding of how it actually works, you can't make those connections work seamlessly, nor can you direct. Chat GPT or open AI from AWS to build what you want to build.

[00:00:38] You have to have the fundamentals to maximize the use of the tools. If you don't learn problem solving and critical thinking skills, you will not be successful in any career, regardless of whatever tool that you want to use or you're interested in from a tech perspective, you will be behind the rest of the pack.

[00:00:54] I mean, let's stick to a simpler analogy. People used to dig ditches. Now if you can [00:01:00] learn to build, or maintain, or repair or operate a backhoe, you can command a lot more in terms of earnings and and value creation. Because of the leverage.

[00:01:10] **Isaac:** There's always a human at directing, making the decisions using the creative problem solving capacity that we have.

[00:01:17] And I think finding these things exciting is the approach you need rather than being like, well, I might as well just chill and let AI solve it.

[00:01:27]

# Misc.

**"What do employers actually want?"**

It's a question that's becoming harder to answer in today's rapidly evolving tech landscape.

Aaron Osmond, CEO of [Knowledge Pillars,](https://www.notion.so/knowledge-pillars.com) put one thing we do know bluntly in our recent podcast chat:

"Industry is not satisfied and has not been satisfied for decades about the quality of the education system."

Ouch.

It used to be that a Computer Science degree was the key to the tech kingdom. Now, the path isn't so clear-cut.

You’ve heard coding boot camps are the way forward.

But just when you think you've got it figured out, AI comes along and threatens to code us _all_ out of a job. It's enough to make you want to throw your laptop out the window and take up basket weaving instead.

But before you trade your keyboard for a loom, let's take a step back.

**The tech industry isn't dying; it's evolving – says Osmond.**

And with that evolution comes a shift in what employers are looking for.

It's not just about knowing the latest programming language or having a fancy degree. It's about proving you can solve real-world problems.

As Aaron emphasized, "If you don't learn problem solving and critical thinking skills, you will not be successful in any career, regardless of whatever tool that you want to use.”

Aaron and his team at Knowledge Pillars are pioneering a new approach to certifications. Forget multiple-choice tests about coding theory. These certifications put you in the driver's seat, coding in real-time, solving actual problems.

And like with learning to drive, reading the manual is good, but you've got to get behind the wheel. These certifications are the digital equivalent of a driving test – you can't fake your way through it, and passing means you're ready for the real thing.

### "Isn't AI going to make all of this obsolete?"

Not so fast.

AI, Osmond says, is nothing more than a tool.

“It does make things happen faster, and more efficiently, but it doesn't problem solve everything for you."

Understanding how to leverage AI is becoming a crucial skill in itself. It's not about competing with AI; it's about being the person who knows how to use it effectively.

"If you don't have a fundamental understanding of how it actually works, you can't make those connections work seamlessly, nor can you direct ChatGPT or OpenAI from AWS to build what you want to build."

In other words, the tech industry doesn't just need coders; it needs people who can think critically about how to apply these tools to solve real-world problems. It's not about memorizing syntax; it's about understanding the logic behind it and knowing how to apply it creatively. And that's exactly what these new certifications are designed to test and validate.

### **“Isn’t it about who you know?”**

Even the best certification won't land you a job if nobody knows you have it. That's where networking comes in. And I'm not talking about schmoozing at fancy tech conferences (though that doesn't hurt). I'm talking about leveraging the connections you already have.

Remember that neighbor who works in IT? Or your friend's parent who runs a tech startup? You don’t need a rich uncle or friends in high places. Everyone has a network. If you don’t know what all of your friends’ parents do for a living, your missing out on some of the best networking opportunities out there.

Building a portfolio goes hand in hand with networking. It's your chance to show off what you can do, not just what you know. Whether it's a GitHub repository full of personal projects or a WordPress site you built for a local business, these real-world examples speak louder than any resume bullet point.

**Pro tip:** when you're applying for jobs, don't just submit an application. Reach out directly to the hiring manager with a sample of what you can do for their company. (Trust me, it works.)

### Take the Wheel

The days of following a predetermined path to a tech career are over. But here's the good news: you don't have to wait for the system to catch up. You can take control of your learning journey right now. Whether it's through hands-on certifications, building your portfolio, or tapping into your network, the power is in your hands.

[Knowledge Pillars](https://www.mytechhigh.com/knowledge-pillars) is just one of multiple OpenEd Direct courses that offers hands-on, industry-recognized certifications in coding and web development.

And if your child is interested in [their WordPress Certified Editor course](https://www.mytechhigh.com/knowledge-pillars), let them know we’re always hiring ;-)

The same goes for you, whether you're a student, a career-changer, or just curious about tech.

# Transcript

**Isaac:** Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. I'm Isaac Morehouse, the OpenEd CEO and occasional host of this show.

Today I'm joined by Aaron Osmond, CEO of Knowledge Pillars, one of our curriculum partners at OpenEd. Aaron has over 25 years of experience as a leader in IT training and certification. Aaron, welcome to the show.

**Aaron:** Great to be here, Isaac. Thanks for the invitation.

**Isaac:** I've always told young people looking to start their careers that they need two things: the ability to create value and the ability to prove it. The relationship between these can be tricky. Sometimes people chase the signal - maybe a college degree - without getting the skills to back it up, or vice versa. In the fast-moving tech space, certifications have become crucial. Degrees are expensive and don't necessarily signal skill, but you need some way to demonstrate your abilities.

### Aaron's Career Journey: From Receptionist to IT Leader [00:01:59]

**Isaac:** Aaron, I heard you started your career without what most people think you need - a degree. Yet you got a job at WordPerfect, which was the predecessor to modern word processors. How did you break in from the start?

**Aaron:** One of the first pieces of advice I'd give to both kids and parents is that connections still matter in this world. I had the benefit of a mother working at WordPerfect in their customer support division. She connected me with their HR department, and I got a job as a receptionist. But what I did next is what really matters. I dove in and started self-teaching, building my skills around DataPerfect, a database coding software. I built trust and credibility by developing technical skills on the side while doing my HR work, setting myself up for the next career step.

**Isaac:** That's interesting. You've highlighted two aspects of networking. On one hand, everyone knows people who work places - your network is better than you think. On the other hand, your network won't do all the work for you. It can get you a chance, but if you show up and you're terrible for three months, your network won't help you anymore.

**Aaron:** Absolutely. Over the last 30 years, I've focused hard on my network. I have over 7,500 contacts on LinkedIn that I've earned over the years, maintaining connections with many of them. This network matters for creating opportunities, not just for me but for friends and colleagues too. That's one piece of advice for students and parents: build your network, start now, and maintain those relationships.

On the career side, you've got to practice continuous learning, constantly developing and refining your skills. It's never over, especially in the technology industry where skills are constantly changing. Even in a year's time, you've got to be reinventing yourself. And that's fun, not a burden - it's exciting to be constantly learning.

**Isaac:** That's great advice, especially for those doing homeschooling or alternative education. How do you network if you're not in a traditional setting?

**Aaron:** You have to realize that within your own environment - your neighborhood, friend group, family, and family friends - there are professionals working in industries you might be interested in. Be proactive and confident about asking for information. Learn about various careers through people you already know, and they'll connect you to others.

For example, my son was interested in a career in Homeland Security. I had a friend who worked in the FBI, and through that connection, my son was able to network with individuals across different U.S. government security groups. He's now building his own network of people in the careers he wants to pursue. The same principle applies whether you're homeschooling or in a college environment - you still need to build those networks, and you have resources all around you.

**Isaac:** That's a great point. There's both a vertical and horizontal aspect to networking. Finding peer groups who are also tinkering and experimenting, and then vertically connecting with professionals in fields you're interested in. I always tell young people, if you don't know what all your friends' parents do for a living, find out. I guarantee one of them will do something you've never heard of before that sounds interesting.

**Aaron:** Remember, your educational networks are also valuable. For example, if you take a Knowledge Pillars course and obtain a certification in coding or web development, you can network with other students across the country who have the same certification. Connect with them on LinkedIn and start building your professional network that way.

**Isaac:** It's funny how LinkedIn is secretly the most valuable social media network for careers. People don't realize how valuable it can be.

Let's move from networking to your experience in tech companies. Before Knowledge Pillars, you worked at places like Amazon Web Services and WordPerfect. In those corporate roles, you focused on certification and training. What are tech companies looking for in terms of skills and signals?

**Aaron:** For the last 30 years, I've been connecting the tech industry to students in education for a specific reason: industry is not satisfied with the quality of potential future tech workers coming out of the education system. While college and high school degrees prove that students can do hard things and finish tasks, they don't necessarily demonstrate proficiency with the tools and technologies that industry demands.

That's why certification is crucial. Certification is simply industry defining the technical skills required to be successful in the workplace and validating that independently of the education system. We're not relying on the educator or school to test it; we're providing our own certifications from industry to validate skills competency.

This has been a critical project for decades, trying to meet the insatiable need in tech for candidates with proven skills in specific technologies. That's what my job has been for almost 33 years now, and it's why I'm now the CEO of Knowledge Pillars, focusing specifically on coding and web development technical skills for students.

**Isaac:** I love that approach - going to industry and asking what they need, then educating to that standard, rather than hoping that what we teach will be valuable to employers.

**Aaron:** Exactly. Most tech companies globally have reached a saturation point with standard bachelor's degree qualification requirements. They're finding that students with these degrees often lack practical skills, problem-solving abilities, and critical thinking skills. Companies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars every year retraining or training graduates for the first time for skills needed in entry-level positions.

That's why building your own portfolio of skills and proven projects - whether websites, e-commerce capabilities, or technical skills demonstrated on GitHub - is super important to employers right now. We're also solving the problem of validation. Even with portfolios, employers still need to verify if the student actually built what they claim. That's where third-party certification comes in, providing evidence that the student can actually code or build a web application.

**Isaac:** That combination of portfolio and third-party validation is powerful. It's like saying, "Here's what I did, I can show you, and I have this third party verifying it." If you're looking at job applicants, you don't have time to validate everything yourself.

**Aaron:** Exactly. Another challenge with college degrees and some certifications is that they've been focused on knowledge transfer and memorization. But that's not enough. An important change taking place is the shift to practical, competency-based assessment. We're assessing students in the technology live during the exam. Can this person actually code in Python in a time-sensitive, high-pressure environment? Can they develop on WordPress? This kind of hands-on testing in real-world environments significantly increases the value of the certification in the eyes of an employer.

**Isaac:** That's fantastic. How are you adapting to the rise of AI tools in this landscape?

**Aaron:** AI is just another technology tool. It makes things happen faster and more efficiently, but it doesn't solve every problem for you. If you don't have a fundamental understanding of how it actually works, you can't make those connections seamlessly, nor can you direct ChatGPT or OpenAI from AWS to build what you want to build.

You have to have the fundamentals to maximize the use of these tools. AI isn't going to completely take over all the human elements required. If you don't learn problem-solving and critical thinking skills, you won't be successful in any career, regardless of the tech tools you're interested in. That's the power of learning coding – it helps you master those problem-solving and critical thinking skills.

**Isaac:** Absolutely. When new tools emerge that can do what humans previously did, the answer isn't that there's nothing left for humans to do. The question becomes: Who's building the tool? Who's maintaining it? Those become the highest leverage roles.

**Aaron:** Exactly. As human beings, our capacity to innovate is what differentiates us from technologies and tools. We are constantly innovating. If you can learn the value of continuous learning and always improving your skills, diving deep on the newest technologies, not only is it super fun, but it keeps you relevant and highly valuable in the marketplace.

**Isaac:** Let's talk about methodology. When it comes to learning these tech skills, you offer courses on WordPress, CSS, Python, and more. Are these self-paced, online courses? What do you find to be the most effective methods for learning these skills?

**Aaron:** The reality is that we all learn a little differently. Some are more wired for self-study, some prefer following an instructor, and others enjoy collaborative learning in a classroom. It's about understanding what works best for you.

The power of the MyTechHigh model is that it's self-directed. You can create groups, leverage your mentor, or work at your own pace. We have several third-party curriculum resources that we recommend, but the key is reinforcing hands-on experience using the actual technology tools through our practice exams and labs.

Ultimately, you come back to Knowledge Pillars for hands-on experience in the platform and tools through our practice exams and certifications. This is where most students excel because the practical use of the software creates the most engaging learning experience.

The next step is to teach someone else. If you can do it as a group and teach your colleagues or friends, you learn even more. Teaching others is one of the most effective learning methodologies there is.

**Isaac:** That makes sense. It's like learning to drive - studying the rules is good, but you've got to get behind the wheel and practice.

**Aaron:** Exactly. We've enabled the WordPress lab option specifically so students can iterate on their own website over the course of the class. They can then show that website to a potential employer or higher education institution as proof of their skills. It's a completely self-contained, safe environment where they can practice without risk of any security issues.

**Isaac:** That's really cool, especially the safety component. Every parent is concerned about their kids getting addicted to screens or encountering inappropriate content online. It sounds like you're providing a curated, safe environment for learning these skills.

**Aaron:** Absolutely. We're giving them an opportunity to practice in a safe environment without any risk. It's password protected, and only the student and educators can access it. They have all the relevant tools without any of the risks.

**Isaac:** That curation role is becoming more important than ever. Instead of just telling kids to look things up on YouTube, which can be risky, you're providing vetted materials in a safe environment.

**Aaron:** Spot on. Couldn't have said it better.

**Isaac:** Well, Aaron, this has been so much fun. Any teasers about where Knowledge Pillars is going next? What's your focus?

**Aaron:** The key thing to know about Knowledge Pillars is that we're providing a complete learning solution - curriculum, lab, practice test, exam, certification, and validation from industry. Our goal is to support both educators and students, making it easier for teachers and more engaging and valid for students to qualify for jobs in the marketplace.

And as parents, I encourage you to study and understand the market opportunity around coding and web development. Give your child a chance to explore this and see the multiple career paths available. There are literally dozens of career paths with that basic coding and web development foundation that they can pursue in high school, college, community colleges, or on their own through bootcamps and other resources. Your child will be grateful that you gave them that opportunity. That's what we're here to provide.

**Isaac:** I love it. Aaron Osmond, thank you so much for joining us on the OpenEd podcast.

**Aaron:** It's been a pleasure, Isaac. Talk to you later.

**Isaac:** Until next time.

[00:00:11] **Isaac:** Welcome back to the open ed podcast. I am the open ed CEO and sometimes host of this show, Isaac Morehouse.

## [00:00:41] Meet Aaron Osmond: CEO of Knowledge Pillars

[00:00:41] **Isaac:** And, uh, today I've got Aaron Osmond with me. Aaron is the CEO of knowledge pillars, which is one of our curriculum partners at open ed. And he has 25 plus years of experience as a leader in it training and certification.

[00:00:57] So really excited to get into this. Aaron, [00:01:00] welcome.

[00:01:00] **Aaron:** Great to be here, Isaac. Thanks for the invitation.

[00:01:02] **Isaac:** Yeah, you bet.

## [00:01:03] The Importance of Skills and Signals in Career Building

[00:01:03] **Isaac:** So I'm going to give a little queue up here. We're going to talk, I think a lot today about skills and signals or something that I've told young people, uh, who are kind of looking to get their career started for a long time is that the two things you need are the ability to create value and the ability to prove it.

[00:01:21] And the relationship between those things can get kind of murky. Sometimes like people can go chasing the signal. Maybe it's a college degree or some piece of paper, That says, Hey, I'm really smart. And they may get that without actually getting the skills to back it up or vice versa. You may have the skills, but you don't know how to signal it or prove it to the world.

[00:01:42] And I think this whole world of, especially in the tech space that moves so fast. Certifications like there's got to be a lot, you know, a lot of people rightly recognize that degrees are really expensive and they don't necessarily signal skill, but you got to have some way to signal your skill.

## [00:01:59] Aaron's Career Journey: From Receptionist to IT Leader

[00:01:59] **Isaac:** So I want to [00:02:00] start at the beginning of your career because I heard something that I think is a perfect tie in. start, you started your career without what most people think you need, the signal they think you need to get in the door. You had no degree. And yet you got a job at word perfect, uh, which was, you know, the predecessor to basically word and all of the, the word documents that we have today. So how did you do that?

[00:02:23] How did you break in off the get go?

## [00:02:25] The Power of Networking in Career Advancement

[00:02:25] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** I think one of the first pieces of advice I want to give to both kids and parents is that it still does matter who you know in this world and connections help. You know, I had the benefit of having a mother who was actually working at WordPerfect in their computer support, their customer support division.

[00:02:41] And she connected me with the, with the representative there in their HR department. And I got a job as a receptionist at WordPerfect Corporation. But where I went with it next is what really matters. Is that I, I then dove in and started self teaching my, you know, my own abilities. Around data perfect, which was a database [00:03:00] coding software and built trust and credibility, you know, having some technical skills, and I earned that over time, right?

[00:03:08] As part of my full time job, I was doing HR work, but I was building my skill set on the side to set me up for my next career step,

[00:03:15] **Isaac:** You know, that's funny. You kind of, uh, Implied to two different things that are true about the whole, like who, you know, in your network. One is cause a lot of people will say, Oh, well, you just got lucky. You just had to have an apparent that worked at a place that, well, like everybody knows people that work places.

[00:03:31] Right? So, so on the one hand, like I always tell people, your network is better than you think. Like it really, I had this experience with my own son a couple of years ago. He wanted to get a job at a gym. And he went and applied and he told me after he had applied and I said, well, wait a minute, I actually happened to meet the owner of that gym at the chiropractor just last week.

[00:03:51] And I don't know him well, but we chatted, had a good conversation and exchange numbers. You should have told me I could have texted him. Right. And often [00:04:00] like there is people, one or two steps removed from you in your network. If you let them know and kind of like, Hey, everybody, here's what I'm good at.

[00:04:08] Here's what I'm interested in. Do you know anybody? Yeah. But on the flip side, so your network is better and stronger than you think, but your network also won't do all the work for you. Like it can get you that first, Hey, I'll get you an introduction. I'll get you a chance. I'll give you a shot. But if you show up.

[00:04:25] And they hire you and you're terrible for three months. Your network won't help you anymore. You know,

[00:04:30] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** I want to say two things on that.

## [00:04:31] Building and Leveraging Your Network

[00:04:31] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** First of all, over the last 30 years, I focused very hard on my net. You know, right now I have, for example, 7500 plus contacts on LinkedIn that I've earned over the years, and I've focused on developing and maintaining connections to a lot of those people in the network because Not only for me, but for my friends and my colleagues, that network matters to create opportunities.

[00:04:53] So that's one piece of advice for students and parents is build your network. Start now, connect and maintain those relationships. [00:05:00] And then on the career side, you've got to be constantly practicing this principle of constant, continuous, learning, developing and refining and improving your skills. It's never over.

[00:05:12] It is a lifelong pursuit, especially in the technology industry where skills are constantly changing and the demand for those skills adjusting. Even in a year's time, you've got to be reinventing yourself and that's fun, not a burden. That's fun to be constantly learning and building that discipline in your life.

[00:05:28] **Isaac:** I want to go, I know this is not really, um, where we initially intended to go, we'll, we'll, we'll get back onto

[00:05:34] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** We'll get back there.

## [00:05:35] Networking for Homeschoolers and Self-Directed Learners

[00:05:35] **Isaac:** certifications, but this networking thing, it's a really great, I think it's a great topic for people if they are, let's say homeschooling or doing something alternative. And they're doing a lot of self directed learning.

[00:05:48] So maybe they're going through knowledge pillars courses and they're, they're getting the skill, they're learning the things they need. Maybe they're tinkering on their own and doing some coding. How do you network? Cause like a [00:06:00] prebuilt network, right? If you're plugged in and you're at like a, I don't want to say, I'm not going to credit every college campus would be in a good place to network, but there are some where you can, if you're not in one of those settings, how do you go about building that deliberately starting at an early age?

[00:06:13] So you're not just learning in isolation.

[00:06:16] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** I think that you have to realize that within your own environment, your neighborhood, your friend group, your family, your family's friends, that there are professionals that are working in those industries that you might be interested in, and to be proactive and confident about going and asking for information.

[00:06:31] Learn about the various careers through people you already know, and then they connect and then they connect to somebody else. I have an example of a son of mine who was very interested in pursuing a career in Homeland Security. I had a friend that worked in the FBI, and he simply networked through me to that individual who then connected him to multiple different individuals across the different, you know, security groups that are in the U.

[00:06:53] S. government, and he has built and is starting to build his own network of people that are interested and are doing the careers that he wants to [00:07:00] pursue. The same principle applies, whether you're doing homeschooling or you're in a college environment, you still need to build those networks. You have the resources all around you.

[00:07:07] Don't assume that you don't have that network accessible to you from your own family's connections, right there alone,

[00:07:13] **Isaac:** Yeah, it's, um, there's kind of two prongs to that too, right? You need a, you need a vertical network and a horizontal network. So if you're, If you're interested in, you know, coding or a particular thing, finding groups, they can be online. They can be in person of peers who are also tinkering and experimenting and creating those sort of horizontal connections.

[00:07:32] But vertically, like if you don't, I'm just going to tell you, if you're a young person out there listening to this, If you don't know what every one of your friend's parents do for a living, find out because I guarantee one of them will do something that you've never heard of before. And you're like, that sounds interesting.

[00:07:49] What's that? Like, uh, my, my son met a guy, uh, he was working. My son was working at a restaurant. Uh, this is after he worked at a gym. He's worked lots of places and, uh, and he was talking to a guy and [00:08:00] he, and he said, yeah, this guy told me that all he does is write copy for ads. And my son didn't know that that was a thing.

[00:08:06] Now, of course I could have told him that was a thing, but he won't listen to me cause I'm his dad. And he's like, that's really intriguing. I didn't know you could just write like as an independent agent, write copy for advertisements. Like, that's really cool. So he started asking him about, he started learning.

[00:08:21] And I think just, just at least knowing and being curious, cause I, I've had the same experience. A neighbor of ours. Found out what I did and came and asked me if he could do video editing for me. And he asked if he could do it for free. And I said, I'll give you a shot. And then I started paying him to do it.

[00:08:35] So, uh, I think that's, that's great to start, start where you are in the networking.

[00:08:39] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** that. Remember, don't forget about your networks also from an education perspective, like for example. Let's say you take a Knowledge Pillars course and obtain a Knowledge Pillars certification, validating that you have skills in coding or web development. There are dozens and hundreds of other students across the country that have also obtained that certification, who you can network with socially, right, on the social networks.

[00:08:59] You post your [00:09:00] information on LinkedIn, you connect to everybody that has a similar Knowledge Pillars credential or certification digital badge, and you start networking in that way as well. There's just so many different ways to network, and we could do a whole show, Isaac, just on this topic.

[00:09:13] **Isaac:** Yeah. It's funny how LinkedIn is secretly the most valuable social media. Network there is and it's not like it's not as fun and it's not going to give you all the like current events and debates about politics, which is probably what makes it valuable. But career wise, it's like people don't really realize how valuable it can be.

## [00:09:36] The Role of Certifications in the Tech Industry

[00:09:36] **Isaac:** So well, let's let's move from the networking thing to, you know, You know, you've worked in tech companies. So before knowledge pillars, which is all about training and giving people the knowledge they need and the certification in a lot of these tech skills, whether it's, uh, I know you have like various programming languages and a lot of different it, it, uh, specialties, but you have worked in various companies, Amazon web [00:10:00] services.

[00:10:00] Uh, we mentioned way back when you started at word perfect. And it seems like in those corporate roles, You have been focused on certification and training. And so I'm curious in, in the tech world, what are those companies? Look, what is the connection between skill and signal there? Because I know this is an imperfect thing.

[00:10:22] I like to use an analogy. If, if you're, if you're buying a house and your realtor asks you for a wish list, You give them 10 things you want, but they know that they're probably going to find a house that doesn't have a couple of those, but maybe it has a couple of things you didn't expect. So like these are not perfect.

[00:10:37] So like a certification, like we're looking to hire somebody, they need certain skills and we don't know how to describe it except to say, how about you have to achieve this survey? And we know that those are like imperfect metrics, but we're always trying to find better ones. So in the corporate world, what are companies looking for in terms of it and tech roles?

[00:10:58] For certifications, like these seem to [00:11:00] be changing all the time. Once upon a time, it was a CS degree. Now, is it a bootcamp? Like, like what is the current philosophy there?

[00:11:06] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** Who was connected to my, my speaker? My apologies, I just turned that off. Right here.

## [00:11:18] Industry vs. Education: Bridging the Skills Gap

[00:11:18] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** Okay, so let me, let me respond in this context, Isaac, that for the last 30 years, I have been in roles connecting industry, the tech industry to students in education for a very specific reason. Industry is not satisfied and has not been satisfied for decades around the quality, industry.

[00:11:42] A potential future tech worker that is coming out of the education system, whether that's from high schools or colleges, community colleges, with the rare exception that there is a lot more satisfaction with what's happening coming out of the tech and community college system than the university systems [00:12:00] across the globe.

[00:12:00] Okay, the reason for that, I'll get to it. I think the key here is that. While college and degrees and high school degrees prove that students can do hard things, that they can endure, that they can work hard, that they can finish things, it does not necessarily prove that they know how to do or utilize the tools and technologies that industry demands to be successful in the commercial marketplace.

[00:12:24] So that's why certification, which is, let me define that. Certification is nothing more than industry defining the technical skills required to be successful in the workplace and validating that independent of the education system itself. We're not relying on the educator or the school or the college to test it.

[00:12:48] We are providing our own certifications from industry to be used in education to validate skills competency in the And it's a, it's been a critical [00:13:00] project going on for decades, trying to meet the need, this insatiable need, especially in tech around people that have potential candidates for jobs that actually have proven skills in a given technology or suite of technologies.

[00:13:14] So that's what my job has been for almost 33 years now. I've been in leadership roles for over 25 in these different types of companies. My most recent one was with Amazon. Where I brought an e learning based tech and certification solution into education. And now I'm the CEO of Knowledge Pillars, focusing specifically on coding and web development, technical skills for students.

[00:13:36] **Isaac:** Yeah, I love, I love what you said there that it's not a certification. That's you go through the education system and then the education system says, based on our standards, we're going to say you did good or bad or in between. You're going to industry and saying, what is it that you need as a minimum or a mat, you know, whatever, whatever is going to signal goodness, [00:14:00] greatness, and then educating to that.

[00:14:02] And I think it's so funny that we approach it this way. And I, I understand education is about a lot of things. It's not only about preparation for career, but preparation for career is a very large part of what we are looking for in an education for our kids, for ourselves. Right. So that we can gain skills that can help us create value and have a meaningful and successful life.

[00:14:24] And, and if you look at that and say, okay, I want this thing called a career. Instead of saying what's needed to get that. We just sort of say, okay, I'm going to do a bunch of stuff and hope that and hope that hirers like it. Right. Instead of going and asking and saying, hey. What are you actually valuing right now?

[00:14:44] It's funny. I had, um, so many young people over the years that I've helped in in two previous companies to get jobs say, well, no one will hire me because I don't have a degree. And I'm like, well, have you asked? And I said, well, the job listing says degree required. And I said, look, I've [00:15:00] literally helped hundreds of people without degrees get jobs that said degree required.

[00:15:03] And they're like, how? So, well, you go and you ask them what things are the most valuable, what employers are the most valuable. Then you learn from that. And we have this amazing opportunity today that you didn't use to have pre digital era, the ability to show your work, to build things that demonstrate value.

[00:15:20] So like I, you know, I would place people mostly in non technical roles. So say a marketing role. And I would tell them, If you apply for a job, but instead of just doing the online application, you also email directly the hiring manager and say, Hey, I saw this job. Sounds really cool. By the way, I built a little landing page for you with a five email drip sequence for anyone who opts in and just kind of like to demonstrate what I can do.

[00:15:45] And here's a little video of me walking through. They'll see that and they'll say, I got to interview this person and they won't ask about your degree, right? Cause you have the ability to demonstrate. So, and obviously your GitHub repository, if you're committing code, if you're building projects, [00:16:00] it's, it's like you can be your own credential in a way that wasn't possible before.

[00:16:04] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** I want to add a couple of things to that.

## [00:16:06] The Future of Skills Validation and Certification

[00:16:06] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** I think that this this opportunity to prove your skills with tools other than a degree, like a certification or portfolio and things like that are the future. In fact, it's now most most companies, most tech companies globally have reached a saturation point.

[00:16:24] With the, the standard bachelor's degree qualification requirements, they're finding that students that come out with those degrees lack practical skills, lack problem solving skills, lack critical thinking skills, and they're having to spend literally hundreds of millions of dollars every year for U. S.

[00:16:42] companies alone, retraining or training the student for the first time for skills needed for entry level positions, Isaac. So this idea of the importance of building out your own portfolio of skills and proven things that you've done or built, whether that be websites, e [00:17:00] commerce capability, marketing services, technical skills, GitHub sites, showing your web micro applications, whatever it is, super important to employers right now.

[00:17:10] Now on the side note. Another area that we're trying to solve is that oftentimes, even then, employers still have to go about validating, did that student actually build that? Was it really them? Unfortunately, we live in that kind of world right now. And so another power of certification from a third party is the validation that that student not only built those things, here's a third party evidence.

[00:17:35] That that student actually can code, for example, or can build a web application validated by a third party in the commercial sector that says we assess their live in the software capabilities. That's what Knowledge Pillars is about. We're validating on behalf of the individual. Not only do they have the skills, but look, here's their portfolio.

[00:17:53] The two of those things together make it so easy for a hiring decision from a tech company. That's what they're asking for.

[00:17:59] **Isaac:** [00:18:00] Oh, I love that. That combination, because, you know, pre let's just say pre digital era. I mean, most eras in human history. The time required to validate someone's claims was so extreme, which is why you needed some kind of third party signal. So if I come to you and say, Hey, I'm really smart and talented and trustworthy.

[00:18:20] You know, you can't hire a private eye to follow me around for three months and see if that's true. But if you say, Oh, the university of North Carolina said that, and they're, they have a good reputation. So I'm going to trust that. So that's, you know, the basic signaling over time. As that signal became more and more inflated and what that university is doing to decide whether they should put the stamp is all behind a black box.

[00:18:45] It's all, it's all secretive. It's like, well, what did you do there to earn that degree? There's no transparency. And so having the combination, like, here's what I did. I can show you, we can, we can open it up and I can show you what I built. And [00:19:00] I have this third party. So if you don't want to go in and validate it all yourself, you don't have to, but if you're at all suspicious, you can.

[00:19:07] And I think that's that great medium, because if you're, if you're looking at applicants for a job, you don't have the time to validate everything. I, okay, this is great. Sorry. I'm rambling, but a great little test of this. So I, I had a previous company that we just could never get it big enough, but we had basically a video pitches.

[00:19:23] It was like a, a builder of skills, profiles, and pitches for job seekers. And on there, we would have them list the tech tools that they knew how to use. And so it might be simple stuff or might be like, you know, Zapier or WordPress. And then we had a little button that said, watch me prove it. And you could upload a little video, a screen share of you demonstrating your knowledge of that tool.

[00:19:45] And what's interesting is if you put a video on there, the job, the hiring managers took that as they didn't even watch the video, but the fact that you were willing to put one there. And that, and that meant that you [00:20:00] knew that someone could watch it. They were like, cool, good enough. I don't need to watch your 10 minute video, but I believe you.

[00:20:04] So like, I think it's that combination of like, if you want to look under the hood, I'm not scared of that, but you can also trust me cause I've put the certification on it.

[00:20:12] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** I think you're just nailing my point about the importance of that third party validation and the importance of validation of the individual's actual skills, right? That it wasn't just done in collaboration with some experts or as a team or a group that they did it together. That this kid or this student.

[00:20:26] Actually has those skills. Another challenge I would just bring up right now about, um, college degrees and also certifications is that it's become more of a problem actually for certifications in the recent decade. Is that it's all been about knowledge transfer. It's been about do you can you memorize,

[00:20:45] **Isaac:** Hmm.

[00:20:46] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** memorize information and knowledge about a technology or about a skill set and a lot of certifications actually have actually devalued the the usefulness of of third party credentials because they're only memorizing [00:21:00] knowledge.

[00:21:00] So an important change that's taking place is this practical competency based assessment where the student is actually being assessed in the technology live during the exam. Right. The ability to see, can this person actually code in Python in a time sensitive, high pressure, high stakes exam? Can they actually develop on WordPress?

[00:21:24] Can they go in the tool and complete tasks while in a testing environment? And enabling those live, real world, hands on testing environments, validating that skill set, takes the value of the certification from here. To hear in the minds of an employer.

## [00:21:40] The Value of Certification in Coding

[00:21:40] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** I know what that certification is I know that they could not pass it unless they could actually code.

[00:21:45] I know that it was actually proctored by a third party So I know nobody could have influenced the outcome That's the validation I need and that will differentiate that student from another applicant that just has github Just saves the time for the employer. So that's what we're trying to [00:22:00] accomplish at knowledge builders is supporting the student in that way

[00:22:02] **Isaac:** Oh man. That, that, I love that.

## [00:22:04] The Impact of AI on Learning and Testing

[00:22:04] **Isaac:** What, what is the, it's AI tools coming on the scene and they're just kind of, in a way, at least the first generation, it's like, It's like when Google emerged on hyperdrive, right? Suddenly you can Google anything and find the answer. Uh, now you can not only find the answer, but you can have it put into words that you don't even have to write.

[00:22:25] So, so testing someone on memorization is, is pointless, right? Like those, those questions can get answered. No, it's not that they're like perfect or whatever, but you need something more fundamental. Then ability to find an answer to a question. You need an ability to know how to thrive in a dynamic environment and adapt and do those things on the fly and time constraints.

[00:22:49] So how have you acknowledged pillars? That's a very tricky thing to try to figure out how to certify because certification requires. Some form of like a rubric, [00:23:00] some form of standardization, but yet these things, part of what you're trying to get is how do you, how do you respond in a nonstandard situation?

[00:23:08] So how can you, how can you try to marry those two things? Where are you at with that?

## [00:23:12] Creating Real-World Testing Environments

[00:23:12] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** First of all, in in tech, you know, this Isaac, that there is no one way to accomplish a task in a software tool. There are multiple paths, right, that could lead to solving that task or fixing that problem, or doing this project in a given software tool like Python. So the best way for us to do it is to create an environment where the actual tool is part of the exam.

[00:23:34] Where the student can use any method that they know how to go in and solve that particular project. One of the item types in our exam is live in the application. It's the best equalizer for all of the exam environments because it allows the student to do what they know how to do or not. Right inside the actual tool.

[00:23:54] So across all of our exams, whether it's WordPress or Python or JavaScript or whatever, we've enabled that live in [00:24:00] the application, live in the browser testing capability. We're literally watching. The student were sitting on top of the software, the coding platform, and we're watching what they do as they compile their script.

[00:24:11] We validate the end result. Correct. We don't validate whether they did the steps in a certain way, because that's not real world. So that's how we accomplished that goal.

## [00:24:21] Engaging Students Through Practical Application

[00:24:21] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** And then I'll just say this too about this practical application. Most students. Find it so much more engaging and fun and interesting to prove what they can do rather than be tested on something they've memorized the learning experience itself as part of knowledge pillars is also in the lab.

[00:24:42] It's in the practice exams. Unlimited attempts to go in and do the tech, the technology, use the tool, work through the questions, figure out the projects, and learn by doing. And then by the time they come to the certification exam, they've not only had so much fun, but they have absolutely [00:25:00] learned the product and they are so confident when they walk into that exam experience.

[00:25:04] No problem, they're going to pass that test.

[00:25:05] **Isaac:** Oh, I love that. I think if I have learned anything about Uh, coders and technical people, uh, of which I am not one, uh, I've worked with a lot of really, really great ones. They love just personalities that tend to be attracted with it. They love problem solving. They love a challenge and a puzzle, and they want to be able to kind of flex their, their problem solving, you know, skills and just being told, okay, memorize a bunch of stuff and answer a bunch of yes or no questions.

[00:25:33] That's not inspiring or interesting. There's a part of them that's like, well, I question the whole premise, right? Like they always believe they have a better way and saying, here's,

[00:25:41] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** It is right.

[00:25:43] **Isaac:** yes. Like, here's the end state. You figure out the best way to get there. And every coder worth their salt is going to be like, I have a way that's better than everyone else.

[00:25:51] Right. Like, and that's part of the great, the great thing. So

[00:25:54] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** It's so real world Isaac that's the power of it.

[00:25:57] **Isaac:** what, so give me a, let's say there's [00:26:00] parents listening to this.

## [00:26:00] Identifying and Nurturing Young Coders

[00:26:00] **Isaac:** Whose kids are, you know, on the younger end, anywhere from middle school, high school, and they're. They don't know yet. They haven't decided, Oh, I'm passionate about, let's say coding. How do you kind of figure out, how do you dabble and find out?

[00:26:15] Cause like, it's not the, it's not the career path for every kid, but for those who it is, what are those early indicators or things maybe you can expose kids to, to help them figure out if that's something they like. I'd love to hear your thoughts on that.

[00:26:25] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** Well, I, this is an area that I have. Uh, you know, I've had so many conversations with educators and parents, um, with, with the tech industry itself about the type of individual that they're really looking for, and it really comes down to both aptitude and attitude, right? There are some basic things that you notice in these kids.

[00:26:49] Problem solvers, puzzle lovers, right? People that are super creative and focus on the details that they're interested in figuring out how something works. They want to tear [00:27:00] things apart, right? They want to know what makes something tick. It's that type of personality that typically is a good fit.

[00:27:06] Honestly, they, they are, you know, usually more interested in math. They're, they're curious about math and logic. They're very, they're very deep thinkers, analytical in their approach, right, to everything in life. You can spot it pretty quick, early on, middle school time frame for sure. So the best way to do it is to give them an opportunity to go and try it, right?

[00:27:26] What's powerful about the partnership with MyTechHigh and Knowledge Pillars is we're enabling students to get these foundational exposure to Python and JavaScript and to WordPress and go in and try these technologies, use the labs, use the practice exams, get a feel for the technology, do some projects and see if it's something that they're passionate about.

[00:27:44] And in most cases, if they had any interest at all, they just become super engaged because they want to know more. And then the powerful thing is, there's a whole pathway now ahead of them. There's five different certifications on WordPress. There's 14 different coding certifications that are [00:28:00] available to them.

[00:28:00] They can pursue it on a self paced basis, pass exam after exam after exam, and do it on their time and in their interest. That's what the kind of learning that we're trying to enable together from a Knowledge Builders and MyTech high perspective.

[00:28:12] **Isaac:** Yeah. You know, it's funny. There's such a great world of, and this didn't exist nearly to disagree 20 years ago, maybe even 10, 15 years ago of what I would call like, like in between like low, low. Type of software tools where if you don't know, you know, you see somebody sitting there doing like serious coding and it just looks like, you know, foreign language and you're like, I don't know.

[00:28:34] I don't, how, how could I know if that's interesting to me? I don't know what they're even doing. There's all these in between things. Like, and I tell young people all the time, I'm constantly. Looking for employees, contractors who can customize a WordPress site that involves very little coding, maybe a little CSS, a little HTML here and there, but a lot of it's working with like widgets and pre designed things or Zapier.

[00:28:59] [00:29:00] Like you're going through and connecting two pieces of software and making them talk together. You're not doing any coding. You're just setting up HubSpot to, to set up automated email triggers. This is not technical per se, but most people in there, you know, if you're a, if you're a marketer and you specialize in writing great content, you're not an expert in how to set up different fields in HubSpot and all this kind of like, it's like semi technical.

[00:29:26] And that's such a great place to start because conceptually it's easier to understand what's happening. And then if you get into it and you're the type who figures out, Oh, I like, I want to do more customization than this tool is allowing me to. Now it kind of is nice gateway into the actual coding stuff.

## [00:29:43] The Importance of Foundational Skills

[00:29:43] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** Well, I'll just add that, you know, like, let's take WordPress, for example, WordPress is used by almost 50 percent of all websites globally. 50%. There are 400 million new websites built on WordPress every [00:30:00] year. Every major company, small business, and entrepreneur has to have a knowledge of WordPress to maximize the power of the web, enable social media, and turn on e commerce, all of these tools, right, that are so critical.

[00:30:13] It's just a basic skill set, not just for techies. This applies to business and marketing personnel as well, right? They have to have these core skills. And most parents and families all do respect to all the families. They just have no idea that that's out, right? That's why we're here to share that. And so those basic skills are so critical for success in business.

[00:30:30] And the same thing from a coding perspective, those foundational understandings of scripting language and web application languages, you know, dynamic building of websites, for example. Those foundational skills are what you're going to learn and then it opens up your mind to all the other career paths that you can pursue that you didn't even think were possible.

[00:30:47] Once you have those fundamentals, you know where you want to go. You can tell where your interests are. It just opens up a whole world of career possibilities.

[00:30:54] **Isaac:** And I'm telling you, if uh, you're a great WordPress developer who can take a mockup and build [00:31:00] a site that looks just like that, I'm always looking for you, so send me an email. Um, so here's a, here's an objection that I get from young, young people sometimes. Eh, I don't think it's worth trying to learn to code or anything like that because, We're pretty much, we're almost to the point where I can just pick up my phone and say, build me a website that looks like this, or build me an app like this.

[00:31:22] And some AI tool will build it all. Why would I waste my time learning that it's going to be outmoded? What is your take on that?

## [00:31:28] The Role of AI in Future Careers

[00:31:28] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** Well, I think it's super important to know that technology is constantly changing. AI is a great example of fundamental transformations that are happening to every career. We're actually going to be releasing our own AI curriculum and exams and certifications, because you need to know how to use AI. AI is nothing more than a technology tool.

[00:31:52] It does make things happen faster, more effective, more efficiently, but it doesn't problem solve everything for you. If you don't [00:32:00] have a fundamental understanding of how it actually works, you can't make those connections work seamlessly, nor can you direct. Chat GPT or open AI from AWS to build what you want to build.

[00:32:11] You have to have the fundamentals to maximize the use of the tools. AI is nothing more than a tool. It's not going to completely take over all the human elements that are required. And I'll reinforce it with this last point. If you don't learn problem solving and critical thinking skills, you will not be successful in any career, regardless of whatever tool that you want to use or you're interested in from a tech perspective, you will be behind the rest of the pack.

[00:32:34] That's the power of learning coding, because those problem solving and critical thinking skills will be mastered,

[00:32:39] **Isaac:** Yeah. It, you know, when people say, uh, Hey, this thing that humans previously did, uh, we now have a tool for that. The answer is not, well, there's nothing for me to do now. The answer is, Who's building the tool, who's maintaining the tool, right? And that, and that is, and those are the, the highest leverage roles.

[00:32:57] I mean, let's stick to a simpler analogy. People used to [00:33:00] dig ditches. Now you have a, a powered backhoe that can dig those ditches much faster. If you can learn to build, or maintain, or repair or operate a backhoe, you can command a lot more in terms of earnings and and value creation. Because of the leverage.

[00:33:19] So rather than saying, Oh, this, this current job digging ditches is now gone. I might as well. I don't know what do nothing. Uh, what, what's coming in? Who is behind that? There's always a human writing the code at some point. There's always a human at directing, making the decisions using the creative problem solving capacity that we have.

[00:33:39] And I think finding these things exciting and as a, and as a reason to go learn more and experiment more. Is the approach you need rather than being like, well, I might as well just chill and let AI solve it.

[00:33:52] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** more. I mean, I think the key is that as human beings are are defining differentiation right between [00:34:00] us and technologies and tools, robots and infrastructure is our capacity to innovate. We are constantly innovating. And if you can learn like I started with on this show, the value of continuous learning and always improving your skills, diving deep on the newest technologies.

[00:34:15] Not only is it super fun, but it keeps you relevant and highly valuable in the marketplace. So AI is just another innovation, right? Then there's going to be another one after that and another one after that. And we're going to continue to shift the tools that we use, but we'll always need human innovation to take it to the next level.

## [00:34:30] Effective Learning Methodologies

[00:34:30] **Isaac:** So I briefly want to ask you a little bit on methodology. I don't know a lot about this, or I guess it would be pedagogy for some reason. Whenever I hear the word pedagogy, it sounds snooty. And I kind of don't like it, but it is the, it is the right view is teaching method. When it comes to learning a lot of these tech skills, you guys have courses on, as you mentioned, WordPress, CSS, Python, you've got a whole lot of things.

[00:34:51] Yeah. The, a lot of these are kind of self paced self serve online courses, correct? Do you find, [00:35:00] and maybe this is just different for every, for every learner that, you know, kind of doing that on your own self paced is the most effective or doing it like getting a group together and creating a little learning, you know, co op or micro school, or having some kind of a mentor that can come in and check you out or watch over your shoulder.

[00:35:19] Um, yeah. What are the kind of methods that are the most effective for, for learning these skills?

[00:35:24] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** well, I think as as part of, you know, the pedagogy response of how you learn, but the reality is, is that all of us do learn a little bit different. Some are more wired for self study. Some are more wired for following an instructor. Others really enjoy collaborative learning in a classroom. It's part of a project based approach, and it's really understanding yourself what works best for you.

[00:35:45] I think the power of the my tech. My tech high model is it is so self directed, right? You can create groups. You can leverage your mentor. You can do things on a self based basis. You can move faster or slower, depending on what your skill set and interest levels are. The curriculum that we use, we [00:36:00] have several different third party curriculum resources that we recommend.

[00:36:03] And then the key, though, is that we really want to reinforce one important learning aspect, spending time in the actual technology tools through our practice exams and labs, getting the hands on experience using the tool right building. And testing your knowledge in a hands on practical way in the actual software applications.

[00:36:23] That's what we reinforce all of the curriculum that we use points to projects and and and tasks that need to be completed But ultimately you come back to knowledge pillars for the hands on experience in the platform and tools to our practice exams and certifications That is where I think most students will all excel because the the practical use of the software Creates the most engaging learning and then the last the next step is if you can do it as a group and teach someone else You Teach your colleague, teach your friends, do it as a team, you're teaching each other, you learn more by teaching someone or showing someone else how to do it really than by any other learning methodology that there is.

[00:36:58] **Isaac:** I love that. It's funny. [00:37:00] My, one of my daughters is 14 and she said, dad, there's a, you know, I want to get ready to get my permit next year. There's a online thing I can do to do the written portion of the permit test. And so she's like, Oh, I went through, I did it. I did great. So I'm going to be a great driver.

[00:37:16] I'm like, well, let's go out to the parking lot and practice driving. And, and if you, as a parent, you know, the difference between those things, right? Like that's good. You studied what you're supposed to do at a stop sign, learning the, the pressure you need to apply to a break to have a smooth stop. You gotta get in there and do it.

[00:37:36] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** Perfect. And now I think that's awesome,

[00:37:38] **Isaac:** And what I, what I think is really cool too, for, especially for younger kids, but, but even, you know, who are, I guess have a harder time making the connection, the old adage of like, you know, you're not laying bricks, you're building a cathedral. Some people, especially as you get older, you're able to see, Hey, I'm doing something that doesn't look like much now, but I can see that it connects to something bigger when you're young.

[00:37:58] And that's harder to [00:38:00] do. And so having something that has a tangible outcome, that's exciting, quicker is so important. I think that WordPress is a great example of that. You like go built by the time you're done, you've got a little website and it's like, I have something I built for myself and other people can literally type in the URL and go visit it and go visit something I built, you know?

[00:38:20] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** We enabled, we enabled the WordPress lab option specifically for this Isaac so that students could go out and over the semester or whatever period of time they're taking the class or doing the class, they can iterate on their own website. And then they can take that website structure and go show it to a potential employer or to a higher education institution as part of an entrance exam or whatever they want to do to prove their skills.

[00:38:43] I built this and it's so fun for the kids too, to be able to go out and actually iterate the WordPress lab that we've enabled in this case, completely self contained, it's the full WordPress environment, all the e commerce tools, admin tools, everything's there, but it's in a safe way. Environment where they can't have any nefarious actor coming in through [00:39:00] the open web.

[00:39:00] It's completely, you know Enabled for the protection of the kid and the safety of the student So we're just super excited about that opportunity for kids to get that hands on practice and show what they can do

## [00:39:10] Safe and Secure Learning Environments

[00:39:10] **Isaac:** That's really cool that, um, the safety component you mentioned, because one of the things, and we, you know, we, we're very Open about this that, Hey, all these digital tools online, it enables so much. You can, you can learn from anywhere on your own schedule, but every parent is like, yeah, but I also don't want my kid addicted to screens coming across weird stuff on the internet, getting hacked.

[00:39:33] And like recognizing that I almost feel like the digital world is still so young that like we got this magical new tool called the internet. And now we like figured out real quick, all the, all the ways you can make it terrible now. And now it's that phase where it's like, okay, now let's try to kind of pull it back and have the best of both worlds, get all the benefits of digital, but figure out how to do it in a way that.

[00:39:56] It's working for us and not feeling like [00:40:00] a threat or something that's, you know, driving us to be crazy all the time and, and feel scared.

[00:40:05] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** safe setting for the kids to practice and play It's like a playground behind, you know, all the fences on a schoolyard. We're giving them an opportunity to do it in a safe environment without any risk of any nefarious player coming in or, or any kind of problem with any kind of third party resource.

[00:40:19] It's on a safe, secure structure. It's password protected. Only the student and educators can get in. They can have access to all the relevant tools without any of the risk. That's the power of the hands on learning environment we're trying to create at Knowledge Pillars.

[00:40:32] **Isaac:** Yeah, I love it. I love it. Yeah, I think the curation role is only becoming more important because, you know, maybe handful years ago, I would have said, Oh, if you want to learn how to do anything, go, go look it up on YouTube. Go Google it. Now, not only is there just so much content that it's hard to sort through what's worth your time and what's a waste.

[00:40:51] There's also all kinds of crazy stuff. You don't want your kids to see. And so being able to say, look, don't just go out to the wild of the worldwide [00:41:00] web or YouTube and try to find something. Go somewhere where someone you trust is going to have the materials that are actually going to be vetted and are going to help you.

[00:41:08] Like, that role is becoming more important than ever.

[00:41:11] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** Spot on. Couldn't have said it better.

## [00:41:13] The Future of Knowledge Pillars

[00:41:13] **Isaac:** Well, Aaron, this has been so much fun. Uh, give me any, any teasers. I know you mentioned an AI curriculum coming. Anything else about where you're looking, where's knowledge pillars going next? What are your, what's your focus?

[00:41:24] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** Well, I think the key to know about Knowledge Pillars is that we're there to provide a complete learning solution, curriculum, lab, practice test, exam, certification, validation from industry. And our goal is to support both the educator to make it easier for them, as well as the student to make it fun and engaging and valid for them to actually qualify for jobs out in the marketplace.

[00:41:47] And then the last thing I'll say is, we're parents. I encourage you as parents to study and understand the market opportunity around coding and web development. Give your kid an opportunity or [00:42:00] your child a chance to explore this and see the multiple career paths. I mean, literally dozens of career paths with that basic coding foundation and web development foundation that they can pursue.

[00:42:11] In high school, in college, community colleges, or on their own in bootcamps and other resources that are available in the marketplace, your child will be so grateful that you gave them that opportunity. That's what we're here to provide.

[00:42:23] **Isaac:** I love it. Aaron Osman, thank you so much for joining us on the OpenEd podcast.

[00:42:28] **riverside_aaron_osmond_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0010:** Been a pleasure, Isaac. Talk to you later.

[00:42:30] **Isaac:** Until next time.
