### OUTSCHOOL Clip 1: "Not All Screen Time Is Created Equal" (As previously compiled - this works well)

**FOR OUTSCHOOL**  

**Amir (25:33):** "Not all screen time is created equal. Just watching stuff on YouTube is completely different to building a virtual world or learning a tool or building a virtual world with others."

**Amir (25:47):** "The great thing about kids interacting and building virtual worlds is, ultimately they want to build in the real world. But when you're a kid, it's not safe to let kids do real world building..."

**Amir (26:01):** "But in virtual worlds they can practice, and you can start that practice young. And kids instinctively want to learn the powerful tools of adult society."

**Isaac (26:34):** "You can see the difference. If I have a kid who has spent the last hour watching YouTube videos, they have a different look on their face and they need a few minutes to detox or they're a little edgy."

**Isaac (26:47):** "Versus he would come away from those Outschool classes brimming with creativity and excitement. And you could not convince me that was a bad use of his screen time."

  

  

‘Not all screen time is created equal.'  
Watching videos passively is completely different from building virtual worlds, learning new skills, or connecting with teachers and peers in a live class.  
We've seen it countless times—kids who come away from interactive learning experiences 'brimming with creativity and excitement' rather than the glazed-over look that comes from passive consumption.  
Quality matters more than quantity when it comes to digital learning. What positive screen experiences have you noticed with your kids?

### Clip 2: "The Box Is Now Open" (Stronger hook from education freedom section)

~~**Isaac (37:43):** "Anyone who's doing two or more [education approaches] at the same time has basically said they may have it open to varying degrees. They may just have it open a crack, right? But like the box is closed. You're all in one school all day, every day that is closed."~~

~~**Isaac (38:28):** "You open up that box to varying degrees and then say, I'm gonna modularly add this one component. Now you're an open educator, you've opened it."~~

~~**Amir (38:54):** "It's an ecosystem. The other kind of verbiage I started to play with is networked schooling and that you're members of multiple networks."~~

~~**Amir (42:04):** "It's a better structural model for how humans actually are. You have these different parts to yourself, different interests, different identities and they're intersectional..."~~

  

### Revised Clip 3: "Beyond School vs. Homeschool"

**Isaac (37:43):** "Anyone who's doing two or more [education approaches] at the same time has basically said they may have it open to varying degrees. They may just have it open a crack, right? But like the box is closed. You're all in one school all day, every day that is closed."

**Amir (14:53):** "We blame our kids for our issues. That's what's happening."

**Amir (39:23):** "My son goes to an alternative micro school in San Francisco, and he spends also a lot of time on OutSchool. He has multiple other memberships."

**Isaac (40:22):** "We don't live in a world where our entire existence is contained in one box and one set of networks. We have our friends that we only do sports stuff with. We have our work friends and our life over there."

**Amir (42:04):** "It's a better structural model for how humans actually are. You have these different parts to yourself, different interests, different identities and they're intersectional."

**Amir (39:52):** "Network schooling is something I'm playing with, but we share this vision of openness and integration of multiple different approaches, which are incredible."

**Isaac (41:43):** "I think we've crossed the chasm, especially since COVID, to the pragmatists who are like, 'I don't have any strong feeling about one being better or worse. I'm not doing this for some really strong ideological reason. I just know that my kid is miserable in this class or in this school. I just need something that's better.'"

The education box is finally breaking open..

The most innovative families today aren't picking sides – they're blending micro schools, online classes, and specialized programs—because life isn't lived in one box. Our kids have multiple interests, identities, and learning styles.

This conversation with @Outschool's CEO Amir Nathoo explains why education is becoming like network TV!

Is your family breaking out of the traditional education box? Share your journey!

"🔓 BREAKING OPEN THE EDUCATION BOX 🔓

For generations, we've forced children into single-approach education systems, then blamed them when they didn't thrive. But the world is changing—especially since COVID.

Parents are now mixing and matching approaches:

- Micro-schools for community and structure
- Online platforms for specialized interests
- Memberships for continuous learning

As Amir says, 'It's a better structural model for how humans actually are. You have these different parts to yourself, different interests, different identities and they're intersectional.'

Has your family explored multiple education approaches? What combination works best for your children?

### Clip 3: "We Blame Our Kids For Our Issues" (Provocative hook on technology and generations)

**Amir (15:53):** "We blame our kids for our issues. That's what's happening."

**Isaac (15:14):** "I've been to lots of my kids sporting games with their parents who are in their 30s and 40s and they're on their phone the whole time, barely watching the game."

**Isaac (15:25):** "I wonder if the generation that's so worried about technology is the generation who don't realize the younger kids, they've already started to figure out the difference, figure out how to adapt."

**Amir (17:36):** "Technology and the tools we build are immensely powerful tools of our civilization. And you're doing kids a disservice if you do not give them access to it at appropriate ages."

**Amir (17:51):** "Access to technology should be a key part of education because if you go too far in restricting it, then how are you going to prepare your kids for the future?"

Who’s the real screen addicts? 👀📱

'I've been to lots of my kids sporting games with parents in their 30s and 40s on their phone the whole time, barely watching the game.' - Isaac

The irony? We're the ones worried about our kids and technology.

Maybe the younger generation is already figuring out how to adapt in ways we haven't. Instead of blaming them, perhaps we should reconsider our approach.

As @AmirEducator puts it: 'Technology and the tools we build are immensely powerful tools of our civilization. You're doing kids a disservice if you do not give them access at appropriate ages.'

The real question isn't if we should allow technology in education—it's how we prepare our children for a future where these tools are essential.

🔍 THE SCREEN TIME HYPOCRISY 🔍

'I've been to lots of my kids sporting games with parents in their 30s and 40s on their phone the whole time, barely watching the game.' - Isaac

The uncomfortable truth: 'We blame our kids for our issues.'

But here's something to consider—what if the younger generation is actually developing a healthier relationship with technology than we have? What if they're figuring out the balance that we struggle with?

As Amir points out: 'Technology and the tools we build are immensely powerful tools of our civilization. And you're doing kids a disservice if you do not give them access to it at appropriate ages.'

The real challenge isn't keeping technology away from our children—it's teaching them to use it wisely in a world where these skills are essential.

'Access to technology should be a key part of education because if you go too far in restricting it, then how are you going to prepare your kids for the future?'

What's your approach to technology in your family? Has your thinking evolved over time?

### Clip 1: "What Minecraft Taught Me About Modern Education"

**Amir (24:36):** "I had exactly the same experience. I can program, but I still can't learn Minecraft. It's very complicated unless you invest significant time. I don't know how much money I spent on a Minecraft tutor of all things."

**Amir (25:05):** "He's building worlds in a collaborative way with other kids supervised by a teacher who's helping the kids use Minecraft. He does that every Sunday afternoon and absolutely loves it."

**Amir (25:33):** "Not all screen time is created equal. Just watching stuff on YouTube is completely different to building a virtual world or learning a tool or building a virtual world with others."

**Amir (26:01):** "Kids instinctively want to learn the powerful tools of adult society, and these are playgrounds that can be used for that purpose."

### Clip 3: "When Your Child's Interests Go Beyond Your Knowledge"

**Isaac (22:42):** "My son said on his own, 'I want to learn how to make mods.' And I was immediately stressed because I want to say yes to my kid. But I don't know how to code."

**Isaac (23:02):** "I bet there's something on Outschool. So I go to Outschool and I'm like, 'Minecraft mod creation classes.'"

**Isaac (23:32):** "He hops on Zoom and there was only one other kid in the class. This great instructor gets on there. He's got his cat walking around on his desk. My son thinks he's great."

**Isaac (23:46):** "After the six weeks, he's like, 'let me show you. I created like this custom block.' And I'm like, good. I don't know how to do that. He already knows more than I do about this."

  

**The Big Picture Insight:Isaac (24:25):** "What I love about it is rather than think of it as like a Lyft or Uber or Marketplace, it's almost like YouTube, if instead of just having a passive consumption of a video, it was like, can I find a person who will walk me through live and I can ask them questions while they're going? That's Outschool."

**Second Example:Isaac (24:42):** "It's just so cool that there's all these niches. Then my other daughter who wanted to learn hair braiding found someone to do a hair braiding course with her and she went through and got a mannequin head and now she's doing all kinds of different hair braids."

  

**Transition to Teacher Side:Amir (44:40):** "We aim to treat all of our teachers as creative entrepreneurial professionals, which is what teaching is. Unfortunately there's so many roadblocks within the traditional system to teachers acting like that."

**The Vision:Amir (45:16):** "It's truly exciting to think about what could happen if a generation of kids are educated by a generation of creative entrepreneurial teachers who are genuinely passionate about their subjects."

**Powerful Conclusion:Amir (45:27):** "They're given the freedom to teach the way they always wanted to teach. That sounds like the future to me."

  

---

  

"The joy of modern parenting: when your kid wants to learn something you have zero expertise in...

My son: 'Dad, I want to make Minecraft mods!'  
My daughter: 'Dad, I want to learn hair braiding!'  
Me: _has skills for neither_

@Outschool connected them with experts who actually love teaching these things."

  

---

For Isaac on X

"That moment when your 7-year-old wants to learn something you have zero expertise in... @amir and @Outschool to the rescue. My kid now teaches ME about coding."  
"Parents: We don't have to be experts in everything. Sometimes the best thing we can do is connect our kids with people who are. Thanks @Outschool for making this possible."  
"The look on my son's face after his @Outschool Minecraft class was all I needed to see. He wasn't just entertained—he was empowered. Hat tip to @amir for building something that lets kids go beyond what their parents know."  
"My parenting hack: When your kid wants to learn something you know nothing about, don't fake it. Find them a real expert. @Outschool has been a game-changer for our family."  
"The future belongs to kids who can find and learn from the right people. Thanks @amir for creating @Outschool where my son could learn Minecraft modding when I couldn't teach him."

Stop Limiting Your Child's Screen Time (Do This Instead)

  

**Timestamps:**  

**Show Description:**

Traditional education was designed for a factory era—not for how humans actually learn. In this conversation between Isaac Morehouse (CEO of OpenEd) and Amir Nathoo (CEO of Outschool), we explore how education is being unbundled into something more natural and effective.

"We don't live in a world where our entire existence is contained in one box," Morehouse points out. So why do we expect children to get everything they need from a single institution?

This conversation reveals the growing movement toward what they call "open education" or "networked learning"—where families combine multiple approaches rather than choosing just one path. Whether it's a child learning Minecraft modding from an expert when parents can't help, or teachers finally getting to share their genuine passions without institutional constraints, the educational landscape is shifting dramatically.

## Potential Cold Open Montage Elements:

1. (14:15) Amir: "We blame our kids for our issues. That's what's happening." [This provocative statement challenges assumptions]
2. (18:50) Amir: "Technology and the tools we build are immensely powerful tools of our civilization. And you're doing kids a disservice if you do not give them access to it..." [Strong statement on technology's role]
3. (25:40) Amir: "Not all screen time is created equal. Just watching stuff on YouTube is completely different to building a virtual world..." [Nuanced take on screen time]
4. (37:49) Isaac: "We love calling that an open education. You have opened it up and you're not only in one box." [Core concept explanation]
5. (42:04) Amir: "It's a better structural model for how humans actually are. You have these different parts to yourself, different interests, different identities..." [Philosophical perspective]
6. (45:16) Amir: "==What could happen if a generation of kids are educated by a generation of creative entrepreneurial teachers who are genuinely passionate about their subjects==?" [Inspiring vision]

  

You're right - let me find stronger hooks for clips 2 and 3 using real quotes from other sections of the transcript. I'll make sure these are actual quotes with maximum impact.

## Clip 1: "Not All Screen Time Is Created Equal" (As previously compiled - this works well)

**Amir (25:33):** "Not all screen time is created equal. Just watching stuff on YouTube is completely different to building a virtual world or learning a tool or building a virtual world with others."

**Amir (25:47):** "The great thing about kids interacting and building virtual worlds is, ultimately they want to build in the real world. But when you're a kid, it's not safe to let kids do real world building..."

**Isaac (26:34):** "You can see the difference. If I have a kid who has spent the last hour watching YouTube videos, they have a different look on their face and they need a few minutes to detox or they're a little edgy."

**Isaac (26:47):** "Versus he would come away from those Outschool classes brimming with creativity and excitement. And you could not convince me that was a bad use of his screen time."

## Clip 2: "The Box Is Now Open" (Stronger hook from education freedom section)

**Isaac (37:43):** "Anyone who's doing two or more [education approaches] at the same time has basically said they may have it open to varying degrees. They may just have it open a crack, right? But like the box is closed. You're all in one school all day, every day that is closed."

**Isaac (38:28):** "You open up that box to varying degrees and then say, I'm gonna modularly add this one component. Now you're an open educator, you've opened it."

**Amir (38:54):** "It's an ecosystem. The other kind of verbiage I started to play with is networked schooling and that you're members of multiple networks."

**Amir (42:04):** "It's a better structural model for how humans actually are. You have these different parts to yourself, different interests, different identities and they're intersectional..."

## Clip 3: "We Blame Our Kids For Our Issues" (Provocative hook on technology and generations)

**Amir (15:53):** "We blame our kids for our issues. That's what's happening."

**Isaac (15:14):** "I've been to lots of my kids sporting games with their parents who are in their 30s and 40s and they're on their phone the whole time, barely watching the game."

**Isaac (15:25):** "I wonder if the generation that's so worried about technology is the generation who don't realize the younger kids, they've already started to figure out the difference, figure out how to adapt."

**Amir (17:36):** "Technology and the tools we build are immensely powerful tools of our civilization. And you're doing kids a disservice if you do not give them access to it at appropriate ages."

**Amir (17:51):** "Access to technology should be a key part of education because if you go too far in restricting it, then how are you going to prepare your kids for the future?"

These clips now have stronger hooks that create immediate interest and challenge common assumptions, while still using only real quotes from the transcript.

  

  

I'll create compelling clips that function as subtle advertisements for Outschool's social media accounts. These will highlight the value of their platform while maintaining an authentic, non-promotional feel that audiences will genuinely want to engage with.

## Outschool Social Media Clips

### Clip 1: "What Minecraft Taught Me About Modern Education"

**Amir (24:36):** "I had exactly the same experience. I can program, but I still can't learn Minecraft. It's very complicated unless you invest significant time. I don't know how much money I spent on a Minecraft tutor of all things."

**Amir (25:05):** "He's building worlds in a collaborative way with other kids supervised by a teacher who's helping the kids use Minecraft. He does that every Sunday afternoon and absolutely loves it."

**Amir (25:33):** "Not all screen time is created equal. Just watching stuff on YouTube is completely different to building a virtual world or learning a tool or building a virtual world with others."

**Amir (26:01):** "Kids instinctively want to learn the powerful tools of adult society, and these are playgrounds that can be used for that purpose."

### Clip 2: "Why Your Child Needs Multiple Learning Networks"

**Amir (39:23):** "My son goes to an alternative micro school in San Francisco, and he spends also a lot of time on Outschool. He has multiple other memberships."

**Amir (38:54):** "It's an ecosystem. The other kind of verbiage I started to play with is networked schooling and that you're members of multiple networks."

**Isaac (40:22):** "We don't live in a world where our entire existence is contained in one box and one set of networks. We have our friends that we only do sports stuff with. We have our work friends."

**Amir (42:04):** "It's a better structural model for how humans actually are. You have these different parts to yourself, different interests, different identities and they're intersectional."

### Clip 3: "When Your Child's Interests Go Beyond Your Knowledge"

**Isaac (22:42):** "My son said on his own, 'I want to learn how to make mods.' And I was immediately stressed because I want to say yes to my kid. But I don't know how to code."

**Isaac (23:02):** "I bet there's something on Outschool. So I go to Outschool and I'm like, 'Minecraft mod creation classes.'"

**Isaac (23:32):** "He hops on Zoom and there was only one other kid in the class. This great instructor gets on there. He's got his cat walking around on his desk. My son thinks he's great."

**Isaac (23:46):** "After the six weeks, he's like, 'let me show you. I created like this custom block.' And I'm like, good. I don't know how to do that. He already knows more than I do about this."

### Clip 4: "Teachers Unleashed"

**Amir (44:40):** "We aim to treat all of our teachers as creative entrepreneurial professionals, which is what teaching is. Unfortunately there's so many roadblocks within the traditional system to teachers acting like that."

**Amir (45:16):** "It's truly exciting to think about what could happen if a generation of kids are educated by a generation of creative entrepreneurial teachers who are genuinely passionate about their subjects."

**Amir (45:27):** "They're given the freedom to teach the way they always wanted to teach. That sounds like the future to me."

### Clip 5: "The Expert is Just a Click Away"

**Isaac (24:25):** "What I love about it is rather than think of it as like a Lyft or Uber or Marketplace, it's almost like YouTube, if instead of just having a passive consumption of a video, it was like, can I find a person who will walk me through live and I can ask them questions while they're going? That's Outschool."

**Isaac (24:42):** "It's just so cool that there's all these niches. Then my other daughter who wanted to learn hair braiding found someone to do a hair braiding course with her and she went through and got a mannequin head and now she's doing all kinds of different hair braids."

These clips highlight Outschool's value proposition in authentic ways that would resonate with parents looking for educational solutions, while avoiding overly promotional language that might turn viewers off.
