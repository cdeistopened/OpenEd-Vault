# Middle School Is the Second Toddlerhood
*Preview: Jean Eddy shares the brain science behind ages 11–14—and why waiting until high school is already too late.*

Greetings!

Jean Eddy—CEO of American Student Assistance—dropped a bomb on the pod: “Middle school kids have brains that are as thirsty and as willing to take in information as toddlers.” She’s citing UVA and NYU research that made ASA shift its entire roadmap. If you’ve been waiting for high school to talk about careers, Jean says you’re already late. Today’s note covers what that brain science means, why career day now belongs in 6th grade, and which free ASA tools make the work feel more like play.

Let’s dive in.

**THOUGHT: Middle School Is the Second Toddlerhood**  
Neuroscience shows that ages 11–14 soak up information like toddlers. Peer pressure hasn’t fully calcified, which means they’ll actually try new things without fear of looking foolish. “This is the time to start introducing all kinds of things,” Jean told me. That’s the moment when our questions shift from “Did you finish your homework?” to “What excited you today?”—and we record the answers because the patterns emerge fast.

**TREND: Career Exploration Is Moving From 11th Grade to 6th**  
ASA’s free Futurescape already has millions of tweens running virtual internships during homeroom. States like Illinois and Massachusetts are now expecting middle-schoolers to build interest inventories before picking high school classes. Teachers are sneaking relevance into core subjects: one hybrid lesson on drone delivery has turned a Long Beach algebra unit into the class kids talk about on the bus. The signal is clear—career exploration is becoming a middle school staple, not an 11th grade scramble.

**TOOL: ASA Futurescape + Day-in-the-Life Experiences (Free)**  
Open Futurescape with your middle schooler and watch the “games” translate strengths into potential paths they never considered. Pair those insights with ASA’s Day-in-the-Life library for virtual internships, shadow experiences, and journal prompts. Inside the portal you’ll find Jean’s “Middle School Career Toolkit”—guides, timelines, and conversation starters so you can keep the momentum going.

**BONUS QUESTION OF THE WEEK**  
Jean reframed the dinner table ask: “Wouldn’t it be great if the parent just said every day, ‘What excited you today?’” Try it tonight. Record the answer. You’ll see trends faster than you think—and you’ll catch that second toddlerhood window before it closes.

That’s all for today!
