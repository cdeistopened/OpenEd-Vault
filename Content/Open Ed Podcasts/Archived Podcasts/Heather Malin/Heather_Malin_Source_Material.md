## OpenEd Daily: RESEARCH CONFIRMS JEAN'S DISCOVERY

Here are some alternative titles with more punch and wordplay:

- **Stanford Says: Purpose Works**
- **When Research Meets Real Life**
- **The Purpose Proof**
- **Purpose: Not Just a Feeling—It's Science**
- **Academia Catches Up**
- **Research Reveals: Jean Was Right All Along**

Research from [Stanford's Center on Adolescence](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/63532/tapping-into-the-power-of-purpose-to-engage-students) confirms that when students identify purpose in their learning, academic performance rises, persistence increases, and social belonging improves.

Heather Malin, former director of research at Stanford's Center on Adolescence, developed a four-part purpose learning framework. Teen brains are wired for exploration and impact. "If we can align school learning activity to that exploratory process," she says, "we have a powerful way to motivate teens."

Jean's son didn't need external motivation. He had purpose. Real work. Real stakes. Real people counting on him.

    [Having a purpose](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Path-to-Purpose/William-Damon/9781416537243) comes with benefits, according to [Heather Malin](https://twitter.com/heathermalin), a consultant and former director of research at the [Stanford Center on Adolescence](https://coa.stanford.edu/). When students identify a greater purpose in what they learn at school, their academic performance, persistence and social belonging rise, Malin said during a talk at the recent [Learning and The Brain: Teaching Engaged Brains](https://www.learningandthebrain.com/conference-514/teaching-engaged-brains/) conference. The most purposeful people have many intentions, she said. “They seem to get boundless energy from having a lot of [meaningful intentions](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/52620/four-pillars-of-a-meaningful-life-that-could-be-part-of-every-learning-community) for their lives.”
    
    So how can schools tap into the [power of purpose](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/57946/striving-or-thriving-steps-to-help-kids-find-balance-and-purpose)? Malin pointed to her purpose learning framework, a four-part set of recommendations for educators, distilled from her work at Stanford, as well as the work of the [Open Future Institute’s QUESTion Project](https://openfutureinstitute.org/) and other research rooted in purpose learning. According to Malin, purpose learning helps students explore and connect with their deeper whys. This approach provides “space at school for students to discover who they are, what they want in life, and how they want to be in the world,” she said. In some of her research that is not yet published, alumni of purpose learning programs have reported improved relationships with teachers and peers.
    
    Malin identified three dimensions of purpose that teachers can help students explore:
    
    - **Generalized and meaningful intention** – This involves the student’s understanding of who they want to be in the world and informs how they set goals.
    - **Beyond-the-self motivation** – Engaging students in issues outside their own lived experiences and helping them find ways to contribute empowers them with the skills and mindset to live a purposeful life.
    - **Goal-directed action** – Because [future planning is challenging for teens](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/57424/the-two-types-of-independence-growing-tweens-need-to-practice), they need support in learning to set and work toward goals.
    
    Teen brains are neurologically wired to [seek excitement and new stimuli](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/61026/10-things-to-know-about-how-social-media-affects-teens-brains). “If we can align school learning activity to that exploratory process, we have a powerful way to motivate teens,” Malin said. Focusing on purpose can do that. “It engages that novelty seeking, risk taking, [identity forming](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/62189/school-shapes-teens-identities-and-relationships-what-role-do-teachers-play) and [social engagement](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/63456/6-ways-educators-can-bolster-boys-social-skills) that are so rewarding for adolescent brains.”
    
    ## Step 1: Self-exploration
    
    The first step in the purpose learning framework is inviting students to self-discovery with questions such as:
    
    - Are there any societal or cultural influences that have shaped your values?
    - How well do you think your family of origins values align with your personal values?
    
    Self-exploration discussions allow students to [foster deeper connections with their peers](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/62649/mental-health-tools-for-tweens-by-phyllis-fagell) and teachers that can allow for deeper learning. “[The students] didn’t realize they had so many shared experiences, challenges, hopes and worries,” she said regarding [student feedback](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/60120/helicopter-teaching-how-using-student-feedback-can-help-with-that) she and her team received during research.
    
    ## Step 2: Look outward
    
    Prompting students to look outward, the second step of the framework, can help them to define their own sense of purpose. “Self-awareness is important, but it’s meaningless if we have no idea how to connect our inner self to the world beyond ourselves,” said Malin. This process often includes exercises in social awareness and social responsibility, such as interviewing a member of the community.
    
    ## Step 3: Future planning
    
    The third step of the purpose learning framework is engaging students in forward thinking and future planning. “The mechanics of looking forward, looking to the future with a goal setting and planning approach can be much more challenging for adolescents,” so it’s important that teachers scaffold these forward looking steps for students, said Malin.
    
    ## Step 4: Action
    
    When it comes to taking action, the fourth step of Malin’s framework, educators can encourage students to do meaningful work outside the classroom and in their community. Adolescents often feel discouraged from [real-world change making](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/61388/why-nashville-student-activists-arent-going-to-wait-a-generation-for-gun-control) because of their youth, Malin said. “Teens need [real opportunities](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/62163/are-dress-codes-fair-how-one-middle-school-transformed-its-rules-for-what-students-wear) to do things in the world,” and “they need opportunities to reflect on how their actions impact others,” she said. According to Malin, action and well-being are associated with more engaged students, but, “our school system is largely set up to inhibit this kind of real world learning.”
    
    Malin advocates for a less traditional approach to learning that is more aligned to adolescent brains. “If we want to really motivate students in school, we need to be giving them opportunities to have an impact beyond the classroom.” According to Malin, one way to do this is by giving educators opportunities to collaborate and connect. “We’ve found that when teachers have the opportunity to talk about what they’ve experienced, they actually can inspire each other to come up with solutions.”
    
    Malin recommended starting a purpose learning approach as early as possible so that students are familiar with the framework by high school. Teachers at the high school level should start “with the understanding that it’s really vulnerable to do this, that students aren’t sure what they’re doing … so you can ease them into it,” Malin said.
    
    Malin emphasized that she sees educators as the experts when incorporating the purpose learning framework into their curriculum. She said some teachers have used advisory periods or elective classes to incorporate the purpose learning framework into an otherwise full curriculum. Others have included the ideas in wide-ranging courses, like health or communications. Another public middle school with a large student population reworked their schedule to include a 15 minute block every day after lunch dedicated to the purpose learning framework. Malin is currently building out a network for educators to exchange resources, information and teaching strategies rooted in purpose learning.
    

## Rough Transcript

Ela Bass (00:00.857)
Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. I'm your sometimes host Ella and today I'm joined by Heather Malin. Today I'm very excited because I've heard a lot of parents ask the question, how do I help my child care about their education? How do I help my child care about the subject? And today our guest brings a really amazing combination of personal experience. She was a former K-12 teacher and research. So she has a really cool research background. So today we're going to dive into this question.

Heather, just to start, what is the most fascinating thing that you've learned so far about children's, I guess, purpose and their interest in care? yeah.

Heather Malin (00:46.732)
Yeah.

Yeah, so most fascinating thing, I mean, I love doing research and getting to know about youth development. So I find a lot of it fascinating. I think it's been really helpful to learn and understand. There's a few things. So one that.

You know, sometimes we, I think if we don't really take time to take it apart, we can think of purpose as this like thing, like you either have purpose or you don't have purpose. And it's just this like, you know, entity in itself that you have to like have or you don't. And also that it's like connected to passion in the sense of like, you have to have a passion and that's what gives you purpose. Or there's these different ideas about purpose being this kind of thing that you have.

Ela Bass (01:16.817)
Hmm.

Ela Bass (01:22.353)
Like an entity almost, it's like a, yeah.

Heather Malin (01:37.486)
And what I've really been able to understand better through working, with young people in developing purpose, is that it's really a process of development. And it's really, so much of it is about, especially for young people, it's about how you explore.

Ela Bass (01:45.777)
Mmm.

Heather Malin (01:55.51)
yourself, who you are and who you want to be in the world and what kind of person you want to be. And that is, that is, you know, when we work with kids, we try to engage that as instill that as a process that they can carry with them throughout their lives so that they're not just looking for that one thing that's going to be theirs forever, but they have the opportunity to.

try things in the world to and to develop an understanding of what really reflects who they are as a person and how that sense of self meets the world in a way that allows them to meet needs in the world or to understand what the world needs from them. And so that's where the purpose comes from is understanding what does the world need from me and what do I have inside and what can I develop to meet those needs. So that's been a really

really fascinating kind of learning, understanding how that works. And we have, we can go deeper into how that works. That's kind of what our research has been about. There's one other thing that I, there's, well, there's a lot that's fascinating, but I think that there's one other thing is, that I think is worth exploring more is, and it's what I'm doing a little bit with my mental health work now, which is how purpose supports

well-being or resilience or kind of capacity to bounce back when things get hard and to you know define that inner self that allows me to continue going in the face of challenges.

Ela Bass (03:18.352)
Hmm.

Heather Malin (03:33.743)
and negative life experiences and stressors to build from there to actually connect with purpose and both support my own recovery from negative experiences or difficulties, but also provide some kind of positive contribution to the world or others by learning from my own different experiences. Yeah.

Ela Bass (03:57.041)
Mm.

That's super interesting. You've mentioned a couple of times the idea of an inner self. How do you define that?

Heather Malin (04:07.15)
Good question. I think in ourself is when we look inward and it's all gets very abstract. It's kind of like, what does this mean to different people? It can mean different things. we think of it as, I think of it as this looking at, taking time to reflect and look at.

Ela Bass (04:18.628)
yeah.

Heather Malin (04:29.208)
Who is the person that I want to be in the world? What do I care about? What really matters to me? What do I find meaningful? And staying connected to that, even when things around us might pull us away from that.

Ela Bass (04:31.729)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (04:44.272)
Hmm.

Heather Malin (04:45.006)
and owning that and being aware of who I am. And you know this gets to a lot of other values like integrity like so when I have an understanding of the kind of person that I am and that I want to be and that comes into conflict in some kind of interaction, I know that that inner self is

is a foundation that I'm going to use to respond to those circumstances. And so that is addressed in different ways with young people in through dialogues and, you know, it be in a classroom setting or in some kind of group setting. It could be one-on-one, but it's about this, could be a kind of a discussion process or a dialogue where young people share.

reflect on and explore and respond to meaningful questions about who I am, what is my life about, and share those responses with each other. And it can also be journaling or writing. There's different ways of doing it, lots of different ways to connect with that inner self. But that's what I mean by that.

Ela Bass (05:42.918)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Bass (05:54.235)
That's really interesting. Something that I've been exploring just in myself and thinking about this in terms of children as well as like how through different, through the different developmental cycles, like children figure out more and more who am I and who am I not? Right? And like, what am I, what am I not? So like in the very beginning, obviously there's no differentiation between child and mother. Like they think they are one, you know, and then over time,

Yeah. And then over time they start to realize, there's a difference. And like, I've kind of been seeing that like part of this process of figuring out like, who am I? The inner self part is, what am I not? So like, whenever it comes to the question of purpose, Even like the smallest personality details, like, okay, I'm not a detail oriented person. Or I like my brain works a little differently. Like being aware of those like small things that

make it more clear what you could potentially do better. I think those are really cool areas to explore. I'm curious, so you mentioned that right now, and a lot of your work has been done in helping kids to explore these things. Can you talk a little bit about where do you even begin? What is too young to start? Is there too young? how do you even start this conversation of the massive question, what is your purpose that?

You know, some adults don't even have figured out yet.

Heather Malin (07:25.134)
Sure. So there's a few ways that I think about that. one is very informed by my own background, which was as an art teacher. So when I started my career in education, I taught art to kindergarten through fifth grade or so. And I actually did research on this afterwards, but I really found that

art making for young kids, as in that young developmental stage, is really a way for them to explore what's meaningful to them, what they care about, how they want to express themselves, how they want to...

Ela Bass (08:04.966)
Mm.

Heather Malin (08:10.238)
share their inner world with the world outside. That's what art really, so much of art making is, sharing that inner world with the outer world. And that is something that I, when I did research on children's art making and I went and spoke with kids who were making art, that's what I heard so much about was even, know, kids as young as eight years old saying, I have, you know, my imagination and it's in my head. And the way I get that imagination out into the world is by, is through drawing.

Ela Bass (08:12.305)
Mm.

Heather Malin (08:40.312)
art and that's how I share the person that I am. I explored a lot of different ways that art making is meaning making for young kids and I think art making can be translated into a lot of different media that happens to be the media I was using. I do think it opens up avenues for meaning making and expression that young kids might not have access to verbally yet.

But another way I think about this is, you know, there's a lot or there's not a lot. There are have been a number of purpose education programs that have come out over the past decade or so. And they so many of them started either with college age students or with high school students. And, you know, did this work because purpose that's like the important time of life for really coming to understand what gives you a sense of purpose. But what they found again and again was, we need to

go younger. We need to start working with middle school students because when they come to high school they've already got really, really solidly formed ideas about how you engage in a classroom or how you engage with others.

Ela Bass (09:48.037)
Mmm.

Heather Malin (09:50.227)
in dialogue, in any kind of like interactions, they've really like internalized social structures in terms of what I can share in that space with people who I am interacting with all the time. And so if we start with middle school, we can at least start engaging them in dialogue and discussion about, what does matter to you? Who are you? Who do you want to be? You can have those discussions with kids at that age.

And then even getting into middle school, it's like, what if we start younger and, you know, just, just engaging kids in expressing that inner world, that inner mind, that inner self, and figuring out ways to talk about it and just practicing doing that.

Ela Bass (10:28.582)
Mm.

Heather Malin (10:34.7)
doesn't have to be what is your purpose, as we've already covered is not what we're moving towards anyway, but it gets kids used to having those conversations about who I am and what I find meaningful and what I care about and who I want to be in the world. And that just gets more mature the more opportunity they have to do it and the more they develop as.

you know, from childhood to adolescence to adulthood, they, you know, their cognitive abilities develop as well. And so if those things are developing together, you can get a lot more.

out of that process once you're in high school or college or that age. So that's why I think I definitely think starting young is great. I just want to make sure it's clear that we're not starting with asking you know eight-year-olds like what is your purpose in life? It's more like what matters to you? Who are the people you care about? What have been experiences in your life that you found really important and why? What do you take away from those experiences?

Yeah, so I definitely am on board with I totally agree with starting young and scaffolding it upwards.

Ela Bass (11:46.543)
That's quite interesting. You mentioned a couple of questions. What are some other good questions to ask? And then something that I'd be curious about as well is, is it good for kids to see and hear other kids' as well so that they see kind of like, there's a difference. Like that was my answer, but somebody had an entirely different one.

Heather Malin (12:03.478)
Yeah, absolutely. So what are questions? think, I mean, there's a zillion different questions you can ask. And I definitely would think about the age of the kids you're working with. But I think some important things to consider when coming up with questions is that they're open-ended. And this is especially a classroom.

This is about the classroom context, but I think for adults to think about when engaging in people and having these discussions, it is a lot about open questions so that the young person is.

you don't know what they're going to respond. It's giving them the space to come up with their own ideas. And so there's not, we want to be aware of not asking close ended questions, yes, no answer questions and thinking meaningfully. So, sorry.

whole lot of distraction right outside my door right now, so I apologize. There's a lot of noise, so if there's too much noise, let me know, because there's a lot of activity outside right now.

Ela Bass (13:08.837)
You're so good.

Ela Bass (13:15.076)
Okay, no worries.

Heather Malin (13:17.364)
So, the questions you can ask are those, you you can start with values. think some people don't like the word values, but it's, that's kind of asking about like, you know, what kind of person do you want to be? Who, maybe who are people that you admire and why? A lot of the purpose questioning is why. So what matters to you or?

Ela Bass (13:40.486)
Mmm.

Heather Malin (13:41.519)
These are really, these might be even a little too open. You might want to ground it in something, but then following with the why. So really digging down into having them think about, like not just the surface level answer, but really digging in on why they're thinking that or why they came up with that answer and sticking with it.

Absolutely. think this why I emphasize the dialogue and discussion because I think it's really, important for anyone of any age to have this kind of discussion and think about these questions in dialogue with other people because there's so much value to hearing how other people

think about purpose, think about life, think about what's meaningful to hear both as a model. So you get like kind of a role model, like, those are things I didn't even think about. And now I'm thinking about other possibilities for my own life. And also what we see, what comes out of this work that I think we didn't really expect is how much

students or kids come to realize that they didn't know people. So if they're sitting in a group or a classroom or some kind of organized setting where they're having this discussion or answering these questions and hearing other people answer these questions, what we hear is things like, I have been sitting with these people. I've known these people my whole life. I've been sitting next to them, you know, in school my whole life and I even know them. I didn't know that.

they have the same challenges as me, they think about the same things that I do, or they have very different experiences. I didn't even know that. And so that creates a whole new level of sense of connection belonging with the people around

Ela Bass (15:49.797)
That is so fascinating. And I think that's a good thing to note. It sounds similar to just like the gold standard of Socratic dialogue as well, because it's like, okay, well, it makes sense that the more that you ask open-ended questions, the more that kids have to think and come up with their solutions. And they start to like, hierarchize their own values in their head of like, well, this is actually more important to me than this, or this is why I'm thinking a certain way.

And they start to put words around it and it becomes less of this black box like I just I just think that And more of I can actually pinpoint exactly why I think that Can you talk a little bit? yeah

Heather Malin (16:32.555)
But yeah, or expand it out, right? To give kind of more depth to my own understanding of myself.

Ela Bass (16:38.321)
Yeah, exactly. So one of the things that a lot of our parents are interested in is motivation, right? And this idea that like, since a lot of our families are homeschooling, a lot of them are doing some sort of an alternative education approach. They are the ones that have to help their kids get motivated themselves, right? And sometimes that's really, really difficult, right? Like even in a classroom setting, teachers struggle with it all the time. But whenever you are

parent and teacher and the environment is similar. It is very common that kids have a little bit of a harder time listening because it's just mom. What are the basics and the most important parts of motivating a child to some end, to care about math, to care about language arts, to care about these subjects?

Heather Malin (17:16.033)
Yes.

Heather Malin (17:24.717)
Yeah.

Heather Malin (17:30.83)
well. So let me just start with a little bit of caveat that some subjects for some kids are going to be, you need a carrot, right? Like you need to just use some reward to get them through. Okay, so I'm not above, I'm not above.

providing rewards when the task is really just unpleasant. Okay, so that said, the more we can use intrinsic motivation, the better. And so I'll go to the research that my team and the other teams have done on purpose. Well, that's a source of motivation for learning and just some of the things we've learned along the way. So,

There is research showing that when students have the opportunity to reflect on and connect with and express a beyond the self purpose goal or purpose idea. And so this is kind of a lot of

maybe a confusing language, but when we talk about beyond the self, we're talking about something that I'm going to be doing for others or some way that I'm going to be contributing to the world beyond myself. And so there's at least one study that found when students can identify and have the opportunity to even write about or talk about some kind of beyond the self goal that they have that has nothing to do with their learning, but is something that they want to do.

in the world or for other people and then they can see how their learning connects to and sets them up to be able to do that. That seems to be very motivating. It does improve engagement and it does improve academic performance actually on the tasks.

Ela Bass (19:20.625)
Hmm.

Ela Bass (19:28.987)
That's very fascinating. I'm wondering too, how you actually get kids to care about things outside of themselves. Because I think like, you know, a kid starts, like I was saying, with this idea of like, I am one with everything. And then over time they grow and they start realizing the separations. It's just kind of very normal for people and us to do the things that either benefit us or are closely

close to us at least. When we talk about the idea of purpose though, right, there's this like really abstract thread where it's like, okay, well, now as a kid, you have to care about something that's like really big or way outside of yourself. How do you get kids to do that? Because I think like, I really say I would guess that that's kind of difficult, right?

Heather Malin (20:17.965)
Yeah. Yeah. And I wouldn't, I wouldn't necessarily push it as in that sense of kind of mandating that, now we're going to focus on purpose. So what's beyond what, know, what do you care about beyond the self? What do you want to do for the world? But it can be approached, um, you know, more like kind of over time or like

a softer way, I guess. Because of course with kids and teens who are trying to discover themselves and then you tell them they need to care about something beyond themselves and they'll be like, yeah, not me. I'm just even as a way to say like, no, I'm trying to define myself here, you know, so don't tell me what to think and what to do.

But one of the reasons to do that asking why process. So this is something that happens actually pretty reliably. someone says, especially a young person says, well, I want to make a lot of money. What's your goal? Well, I want to make a lot of money. I want to have a good, you know, get a good job and have a lot of money. And you start asking why and you dig down and you say like, yeah, but why is that important? Okay, but why is that important? And you really, you know,

have them really dig in about why is this important? You start to hear things like, well, my parents took really good care of me and provided for me really well, and I want to be able to provide for them. Or I had a really difficult upbringing, we were really poor, but I want to be able to provide for my family as I get older. Or.

You name it, you often can start to hear, they can connect to something in there. And so purpose doesn't have to be like, I am only doing something because it helps other people or contributes to the world. But they can tap into that. They can access that like, somewhere deep in this kind of aspiration I have or this way I want to be in the world. I want to be really wealthy. Well, why? Well,

Heather Malin (22:20.705)
You know, often, not always, but often, what people find is that underneath that desire to be wealthy is like some kind of like way I want to connect with the world and really connect and be someone who does good things in the world. Even if it's just for my own parents or my family or my own children.

So that is that's one way. that's one of the reasons we get into this. Okay, but why? Like, let's really dig into why this matters to you if something matters to you. And the other way is to start with questions about what does matter to you in the world. So

So we start with looking inward, tend to start with looking inward, but then we start to look outward and say, like, who are the people that matter to you? And what are the things that you care about out there in the world, you yourself in your community or at...

Maybe there's family members or maybe it's sports or arts, or whatever it is, something that really, really grabs you, really, that you really care about. And let's really look at why and what is it about that that really matters to you. And so you can explore towards understanding how they're going to be a contributing member of that, whatever it is they care about. And it could be, you know, we think about arts as a really good one because

You may not be doing art to contribute to the lives of others, but you may be wanting to make art because you want to bring new ideas about the arts or about creativity into the world or just have your creativity bring something positive into the world.

Heather Malin (24:03.115)
So there's a lot of ways to think about, and that's one thing is being really expansive about how you think about beyond the self. It's not just like I'm volunteering to help others or clean the environment or something. Those are definitely beyond the self obvious activities and goals, but they're not the only ways that we can think about beyond the self.

Then the third way I think about with young people is action first. So rather than trying to get them to think about beyond the self through this kind of dialogue and discussion and reflection process, you get out and you do things in the world and you conduct interviews with people in your community or you do volunteer activity or you do something that connects you with people around you. So you really grow to understand them and

There's an empathizing process. So you understand like what needs people have in the world. And so often that stirs people, especially kids, that stirs their feeling of wanting to do something for those people. So then it's a matter of kind of exploring that.

Ela Bass (25:07.567)
Yeah, I think that actually makes a lot of sense to me. It's like there's all of these, like there's all these conceptual things, right? And the questions and all that stuff that gets a kid to go deeper. like the best way to get a kid to care about the things in the world are just to expose them to it and to help them to find the things that they actually care about because we each have different personalities. We each have different characteristics. Like we're going to care about different things.

And so as a parent, if you can introduce them in the world to the things that they can care about, and then also help them to realize how they can actually impact things. think that is like some of the coolest life lessons that I've had and I've talked to friends about is when as a child, they first started learning, like I can, I can make a difference in some way, or form, on the things that I care about. I think like,

You know, sometimes it starts with a kid. Sometimes you'll have a very, very passionate, you know, intrinsically motivated child, but more likely most children, you know, you kind of have to help them and stir the motivation inside of them a little bit. What does a, like a child, a kid, a growing adult look like when they have purpose? So I know that you mentioned like,

This is really, really important and it changes the way that children and eventually adults handle different setbacks, different challenges in their life. How does it also change like childhood?

Heather Malin (26:48.397)
I think I can imagine that I think some of the things that come along with it that we've seen like not really through research, know, kind of a little bit qualitatively, but so the words that coming to mind are curious and agency and so

and empowered. And so I think if we see a young person who has had the opportunity to kind of go through this process of exploring both actively, like engaging with things as you were just saying, and reflecting on who I am and who I want to be, that they...

they become better able to kind of go out with their own initiative to find opportunities to act on what they care about and find ways to find the needs and find what in the world around them needs them to do something and to be something.

So I have a couple of examples that are on my mind. One is a, there was a young girl who, young, I mean, she was at middle school. And this was a while back. she, Twitter was when there was Twitter and Twitter was 140 characters. It was really like really basic social media platform. And she experienced a lot of bullying and she struggled a lot with depression because of it.

And she was able to do this, this kind of process of reflecting and understanding that this gave her a perspective on the world that could help others. And she tapped into Twitter as a resource to connect herself as a resource for other kids who might be experiencing bullying, going through the same things, the same depression, these hard things that she was dealing with. She found the initiative to create an account

Heather Malin (29:02.287)
and invite other kids in to have someone to go to when they were feeling depressed or feeling like the bullying was getting too much so that they could have a resource. So that's what I mean when I say that I think when they can tap into that self-reflection and they can tap into that capacity to do something about it, which is how we define purpose, that...

That kind of builds up that.

that sense of agency and empowerment to say, okay, I'm going to do this. No adult is going to tell me what to do here. Sometimes we need adults, you know, obviously to pay. If what you want to do is much grander than then start a Twitter account, need more support. But that's kind of one image. then another, you know, there was a I spoke with a college student who in high school had gone through a purpose learning program. And what she took with her to college was realizing she could be the one to speak up.

And she could be the one not only to speak up for herself, but to speak up for others in her college community who might be experiencing discrimination or whatever experiences they might be having, or there's something wrong with the class that it's not. Maybe the professor is not handling things appropriately or that she felt because of that experience she had had where she got to learn about

connecting with her inner self and what matters to her and expressing what matters to her in front of others and acting on what matters to her. She brought that with her and she was able to be the person who, nobody else was speaking up. She felt like she was able to speak up and change things in her college environment.

Ela Bass (30:53.851)
That's really cool. I wonder, do you ever have the experience where in your research and practice, like where children actually don't want to find their purpose and where they push back and what do you do whenever that happens?

Heather Malin (31:09.821)
That absolutely happens because it's not and that goes to why we say like don't we don't think of it in terms of just going and saying what is your purpose. It's so much a process especially now academically I think young people feel so much pressure to have goals and work towards goals and college and career and there's so much pressure

And then when you say, identify your purpose, what's your purpose? That's like another thing on top of that. It feels really heavy. And so they'll push it away. They don't want to deal with that. And I have a teenager and she's more receptive now, think, but through her early teen years and 12, I could not say the word purpose around her. She got so tired of hearing it and she didn't want to think about that.

And so if that is why I think it's really important to not go in to this process saying, well, you need to identify your purpose. What do you care about? What you need to do is have those conversations about what is it that you care about?

and have those experiences of going out into your community, into the world, like engaging with people to understand what the world might need from you and how you might want to connect and engage and contribute to the people around you. So, I mean, think that just goes back to it again, that it's really about process. If we think about teenagers especially, and the neural, the brain development that's going on, that neural development.

that they're going through, really want to take risks, try new things. And so really tapping into that rather than saying, we're gonna pin you down to a purpose right now, or even temporarily pin you to a purpose. But that's not what we're doing here. What we're doing is really getting you to understand who you are. And that taps into young persons really.

Heather Malin (33:15.053)
strong drive to for identity right to understand like who they are who they want to be on their own terms and to explore that to like try things and take risks with things that are new to them so that they can explore different ways of expressing who they are and who they want to be.

Ela Bass (33:17.84)
Mm.

Ela Bass (33:28.753)
Mm-hmm.

Heather Malin (33:38.287)
how do you get kids? Yeah, so.

The other thing I want to say about that is if we look ahead, I've worked with college administrators and faculty and about these very questions and you know what they say is so many students today feel like they you know they don't feel like they really do need to really package themselves and even package themselves in terms of saying what their purpose is just to get through admissions process and to get into college. But what

the college faculty and administrators say is once you get there, we actually wish that you would come without that predefined purpose and be open and receptive to what this environment has to offer you so that you can develop yourself even more and expand out the sense of who you can be using what we're here to provide you with in terms of learning resources. they actually get very frustrated when college

students arrive having already predetermined that purpose and have been kind of forced through that process unfortunately in order even to get into college having kind of shaped that purpose sometimes often artificially.

Ela Bass (34:58.501)
That's really fascinating. I think something that sticks out to me is just this underlying level of care. Kids, it's a process. To convince a kid that you actually care is a process, but once you've earned their trust, then they are willing to talk to you or answer questions. And so I think that goes back to the things that you were talking about. Sometimes you just have a really difficult child that doesn't want to answer certain things or will make a joke out of a lot of things.

But oftentimes over time after continuing to do it over and over over and over again and approaching it in lots of different ways, they'll start answering. I think I love how you're basically saying that the process is well worth it, especially as a parent, you care so, so, so much. So it's well, well worth it.

Heather Malin (35:38.445)
Yeah.

Heather Malin (35:54.415)
Yeah, and you know, in terms of, you know, it's funny, so I've done a lot of interviewing and so you have to get kids to open up pretty quickly when you have a 30 to 60 minute interview. And I know I do therapy with teenagers and that's also, you know, I have a lot more time but you have to build that trust pretty quickly if you can. One of the questions I like to start with,

to do that is if someone wanted to get to know you what would be some of the important things to know and I think that gets at two things that are really helpful.

Ela Bass (36:25.009)
Mmm.

Heather Malin (36:30.284)
not for all kids, I think there's, it gives you a good head start. One is really open-ended. It's not telling them what to, there's no right or wrong answers there. You really are just expressing that you want to hear about them. And two, you really want to hear about them. So you're getting right into you, what's important about you, but in a, but in an open-ended way. And it's also not, it's,

It's not you don't have to tell me everything about yourself. You're just choosing some things that would be important to know. And it's not what's important to you. It's just what do I need to know if I wanted to get to know you can select. You can learn a lot. And also, I think that that kind of so just questions with that kind of quality, open, very curious about who you are. And there's no right or wrong answers. And there's no

Ela Bass (37:10.214)
Mm.

Heather Malin (37:28.29)
You're not bearing your soul. You're choosing what level of information you want to provide.

Ela Bass (37:33.509)
That's really, really awesome. I'm curious. So given all this research that you've done, how would it, looking back, change the way that you teach?

Heather Malin (37:53.581)
Yeah, good question. I taught art, so I had the good fortune of being able to be very not scripted in my curricula, very open to what I was doing. And I think I would have been more aware of and tapping into how children make

make meaning and express meaning in so many different ways through the media that you give them. And this is just going to be an art teacher. I mean, think some of the things I learned were about how intentional even young children are about.

Ela Bass (38:28.848)
Hmm.

Heather Malin (38:43.096)
how they use media, whether that's art media or words, whatever the expressive material is, that's a very intentional process. And sometimes we think of children as just being kind of spontaneous, like, they're not really thinking about anything. they are actually. They're actually being quite intentional about what they're sharing with the world about them, their inner mind when they express things. And so...

I think being more aware of that and providing more space for that intentional exploration and expression of self and engaging that process then I think you know in different ways as kids get older and go through you know stages of development and become more yeah again with the cognitive abilities but always providing that space for the open

Ela Bass (39:16.721)
Super cool.

Heather Malin (39:39.061)
exploration and expression of who they are with a variety of media. And you know one of the things for teachers and I think I think when it's parents working with their own kids it's a little easier to do this. I think one thing that's really challenging for teachers is you have a short amount of time

bunch of people and you got to keep this like under control. Right? Like that's for some teachers that's just like like if I can just keep this contained for 45 minutes. But that process of asking open-ended questions that you don't know the answer to that you're inviting the child or the teen to you know respond to in whatever way is meaningful to them that

That's really huge to me. And I think if you're working with kids, think that's really important to keep in mind.

Ela Bass (40:34.693)
This has been so fascinating. I have a couple of rapid fire questions to end the interview. This is kind of my thing, the thing that I love to do. Rapid fire question number one, what advice would you give to parents? Top piece of advice for instilling motivation in kids and also helping them to develop their purpose over time.

Heather Malin (40:58.314)
keep it as an exploratory process. it's, it's about this and to me it's about this interplay of, of doing real things in the world and reflecting on those things and reflecting on yourself. And so it's kind of like an interplay of those things and really not being too concerned about finding that one thing because you can spend your whole life.

you know, trying, you know, going through different things. The time going I'm not going rapid fire. But there's something important about purpose, which is that it's kind of like the higher level idea that can be implemented in a lot of different ways. And so I would say allow for all the different ways. And so what I mean by that is you might feel really driven to help other people. That's a purpose. But that can be done in a million different ways. And so everyone has a different way of expressing that desire to help others.

Ela Bass (41:46.683)
Mm-hmm.

Heather Malin (41:52.847)
Motivation, tap into those beyond the self goals. And if you don't hear them, that's totally normal, but you can help your child search for them or connect with them by getting them out in the world and by kind of reflecting on who are the people you care about and what are the things in the world you care about without being too direct about them.

Ela Bass (42:14.063)
I love that.

Second question, when it comes to parents and trying to help your kid find their purpose, a lot of the time it is, it's easy to get so caught up in it as a parent. How much space should you actually give your kid in this pursuit of purpose?

Heather Malin (42:35.092)
All the space. mean, so parents should absolutely be involved. The way parents can be most involved is role modeling. So doing your own purpose and showing what that looks like and being open about that.

and providing connection with mentors so they can kind of support your child to develop their own interests and skills. But the less directive you can be, the more it is actually purpose. There's a lot to say about

that culturally I think but in general I think if you can model what it means to have purpose, provide the resources for your child to explore what their interests are. That could be getting a ride to go somewhere that you know will help them connect with an activity they want to do. Giving books like there's a lot of different ways you can provide the resources for that and give them the space to kind of you know ask those open-ended questions and kind of explore those ideas.

Ela Bass (43:38.065)
I love that. And then my last question is about boredom. So what role does boredom play in developing purpose?

Heather Malin (43:42.413)
and

Heather Malin (43:48.781)
Well, boredom is easy to get sucked into, I think. Okay, so there are a few different answers I think that we could go towards, but what I want, maybe it's something that's good to point out here, is that the thing about purpose and why I distinguish it from passion, and I think it's important for kids to understand, is that purpose can be boring. that when it involves doing things that are not always...

your interest. You know, have to develop those skills. You have to get through the parts that support.

whatever it is you want to do. And so it can be boring. And so in a way, that's a developmental process of being able to stick with the boringness. That's cognitive development, especially for teens. That's the prefrontal cortex is regulating them to make the plans and be detailed and be organized and do those parts of doing something that's really interesting to you in a way that you can like stick with it and commit to it over the duration.

So that's the main thing I think about when I think about board and the purpose.

Ela Bass (44:59.599)
Very, very cool. This has been amazing. What can people look up if they want to learn more from you?

Heather Malin (45:05.402)
so one of the resources I have is the purpose [hub.org](http://hub.org/). Just a long word, the purpose [hub.org](http://hub.org/). I've put up a lot of resources there in terms of articles. I'm slowly putting in more podcasts and, I don't know, blog posts. Yeah. Just lots of information there. that's probably the main resource.

Ela Bass (45:28.017)
Super cool. Yes, everybody go check that out. We'll be linking all of your things below and I hope that you enjoyed today's conversation. If people want to reach out, can they go onto your website and reach out?

Heather Malin (45:41.676)
Yeah, there is a form there that you can fill out and I'll get that.
