**Music Physically Changes Your Kid's Brain**

## COLD OPEN (30 seconds)

**Deb Pratt (04:18)**
"I have a daughter who was in high school taking trumpet for band. I got her private lessons and she didn't practice. I was flabbergasted and embarrassed. Here I am a music teacher and my daughter is not practicing. So I had her stop lessons."

**[JUMP CUT]**

**Deb Pratt (24:24)**
"Music is the only thing they found that actually the whole brain lights up when you do it. The section between your two sides of your brain called the corpus callosum, it's larger in musicians."

**[JUMP CUT]**

**Deb Pratt (05:36)**
"She was probably 30 or 35, and she said to me, *'I really wish you'd let me continue to take lessons because I could be playing today if you had let me keep playing.'*"

## EPISODE DESCRIPTION

Music is the only activity that lights up your entire brain. It physically enlarges the corpus callosum—the bridge between brain hemispheres—in ways nothing else can. Yet many parents make their kids quit lessons the moment practice becomes difficult. Deborah Pratt, founder of Southern Oregon School of Music with 172 students, shares what she learned through hard experience: the moment you let a child quit during the frustration point is the moment you rob them of breakthrough. She reveals why "just showing up" to lessons—even without daily practice—is enough to keep a child in the discipline long enough to find their instrument, develop mastery, and build the confidence that transfers to everything else in life. For homeschooling families, music becomes something far more valuable than a skill: it becomes proof that persistence pays off.

## KEY MOMENTS

### The Brain Science That Changes Everything
Music is the *only* activity that lights up your entire brain. The corpus callosum—the bridge between your brain's two hemispheres—is physically larger in musicians. This isn't metaphorical. This is structural brain development that supports math, literacy, emotional regulation, and persistence across every domain.

### The Practice Paradox
Deborah's biggest lesson came from her own daughter, who quit trumpet in high school because she wasn't practicing. At 30, the daughter told her: *"I could be playing today if you had let me keep playing."* This shifted Deborah's entire philosophy. Just attending lessons—even without home practice—keeps a child in the discipline long enough for breakthrough to happen.

### Never Quit at the Frustration Point
Every musician hits a wall. Suddenly they have to play with both hands. Or tackle a new technique. The child wants to quit. This is exactly when parents should NOT let them. Deborah's advice: help them through that spike, give it time, then reassess. Most of the time, persistence through frustration is the moment everything changes.

### Piano as Universal Language
If you're starting from scratch, begin with piano. Unlike guitar (where "the notes are kind of all equal"), piano visually maps music theory. After a year of piano, a child has a mental scaffold that accelerates learning any other instrument. This is the single most important curriculum decision parents make.

### The 8-Year Discovery
One of Deborah's students tried piano, guitar, ukulele, and came back to piano before discovering bass at age 16—and finally practicing on his own. Eight years of "just showing up" to lessons created the conditions for genuine passion. Had his parents forced daily practice, he would have quit long before finding his instrument.

### The Social Glue
Kids don't quit activities where their friends are. The real secret to music persistence isn't parental pressure—it's building community. Group classes, bands, and choirs transform music from isolated practice into *doing something with other people*. That's the motivation that lasts.

## DISCUSSION POINTS FOR PARENTS

- Do you see music as a "nice hobby" or as essential brain development?
- When your child hits frustration during lessons, what's your instinct: push through or let them quit?
- Are you creating conditions for community (group classes, ensemble) or just private lessons?
- What if you stopped worrying about daily practice and just made sure they attended lessons?
