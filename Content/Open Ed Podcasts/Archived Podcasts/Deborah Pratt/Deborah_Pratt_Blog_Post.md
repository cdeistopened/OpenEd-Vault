# How to Keep Your Kid in Music Lessons Without Making Them Practice

**Ela Richmond**

Confession: I quit piano lessons when I was in middle school. My mom thought it would be good for me, but I lost interest. It felt forced.

Looking back, I wonder what would have happened if someone had told my mom that keeping me in lessons didn't require perfect practice habits—that showing up itself might have been enough to build a lifelong skill.

That realization changed everything for Deborah Pratt, a music educator who runs the Southern Oregon School of Music and teaches 172 students, many from homeschooling families.

## When Homework Battles Become About Music Too

Deborah's perspective shifted when her own daughter hit a breaking point. In high school, her daughter was taking trumpet lessons but struggling with practice at home. As a professional music teacher, Deb was "flabbergasted and embarrassed"—and she made what seemed logical: no practice, no lessons. Her daughter quit.

Thirty years later, her daughter said something that changed how Deb sees everything: "I really wish you'd let me continue to take lessons because I could be playing today if you had let me keep playing."

That decades-long regret taught Deb a counterintuitive truth: **just taking lessons keeps a child in it, even without practice at home.**

This challenges what we've been told. We believe practice is non-negotiable. But Deb discovered something else entirely: there's a crucial difference between ideal practice and the value of continuity. A child who shows up every week—even without practicing—is still building muscle memory, absorbing concepts, staying connected to the instrument. They're not starting from zero.

"There are so many different personalities with kids," Deb explains. "Some love to play at home and it becomes part of who they are. But not all kids are that way." The real insight is that we've made not practicing into a reason to quit. But what if the lesson itself is the anchor point for some kids, and practice is secondary?

## The Real Problem With Forcing Practice at Home

Here's what most of us do: if they're not practicing, lessons feel pointless. So we pull them out. It feels logical. It feels responsible.

But what we're actually teaching our kids is dangerous. We're teaching them that when something gets hard or requires discipline, quitting is the answer.

Deb has watched this cycle hundreds of times. A child hits a frustration point—they need to play with both hands now, songs are getting harder, progress stalls. They say, "I don't want to do this anymore." And parents, respecting their child's autonomy, agree. Lessons stop.

The child never experiences pushing through difficulty to reach mastery. They never feel what's on the other side. They learn that quitting is the default response to struggle.

Most skills have valleys. You learn something, feel good, hit a wall, get frustrated. If you quit in that valley, you never reach the plateau where everything clicks. Stay with it, and everything changes.

## What Actually Works (When Your Kid Won't Practice)

Deb's advice moves beyond the simple "require practice" approach. Instead:

**Talk to the teacher first.** Most parents never do this. They assume lessons are just about the kid and instrument, but teachers have tools. Maybe the songs are too hard. Maybe the approach isn't clicking. Maybe there's something missing from the lesson structure itself.

**Treat practice like homework, not optional enrichment.** Deb makes this clear: "If your child said, 'I don't feel like doing my math homework,' would you say, 'OK, if you don't want to'? You wouldn't." Set the expectation kindly but firmly, and be consistent. Practice becomes something they do, not something they ask permission to skip.

**Don't make practice the condition for continuing lessons.** This is the paradigm shift. Practice should be expected, yes. But not practicing shouldn't end the story—it should prompt a conversation with the teacher about what might help.

## Why Music Changes the Brain (And Your Child's Future)

[Research from Harvard Medical School](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996135/) shows that music activates the entire brain in a way almost nothing else does. Music engages auditory processing, motor control, language, and emotional centers simultaneously.

Even more significant: [music training physically enlarges the corpus callosum](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/3/1282)—the part of your brain connecting your left and right hemispheres. This structural change has lasting implications for how your child thinks, processes information, and solves problems throughout life.

But there's more than neuroscience here. A teenager processing emotional turmoil through an instrument isn't just learning music. They're developing [emotional intelligence and regulation](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8037606/). They're learning that feelings can be channeled into something meaningful.

And then there's the long view: Deb's daughter at 45, looking at her hands, thinking "I could be playing right now."

Most parents don't want that regret for their kids. They want them to look back and feel grateful. The way to make that happen isn't punishment or forcing practice. It's keeping them in. Showing up. Having hard conversations. Adjusting when needed. But not letting them quit in the moment of difficulty.

Your kid might not love clarinet or piano. But if they stay long enough—through the hard parts—they might discover they love the bass. Or they might discover they love learning itself. That discovery only happens if they don't quit.
