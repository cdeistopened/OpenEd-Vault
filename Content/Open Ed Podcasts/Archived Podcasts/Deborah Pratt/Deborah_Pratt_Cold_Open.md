# Cold Open & Clips - Deborah Pratt

## COLD OPEN: The Mashup

**Deb Pratt (04:18)**
"I have a daughter who was in high school taking trumpet for band. I got her private lessons and she didn't practice. I was flabbergasted and embarrassed. Here I am a music teacher and my daughter is not practicing. So I had her stop lessons."

**[JUMP CUT]**

**Deb Pratt (24:24)**
"Music is the only thing they found that actually the whole brain lights up when you do it. The section between your two sides of your brain called the corpus callosum, it's larger in musicians."

**[JUMP CUT]**

**Deb Pratt (05:36)**
"She was probably 30 or 35, and she said to me, *'I really wish you'd let me continue to take lessons because I could be playing today if you had let me keep playing.'*"

## CLIP 1: Don't Quit at the Frustration Point

**Story Arc:** Setup (child gets frustrated) → Tension (parent wants to let them quit) → Resolution (push through, it gets easier)

**Deb Pratt (08:55)**
"Probably like any skill, you hit points where you feel frustrated. Like you master the beginnings of it, you go along and it's nice, and then all of a sudden, now you have to play with both hands. Or now they're asking you to do something else and the child gets frustrated and wants to quit."

**[PAUSE]**

**Deb Pratt (09:24)**
"Don't ever allow your child to—encourage them, help them, find a way to help them through that one thing and then give it some time and see if they're still not liking it. A lot of times they've just hit a spot where they have to step it up and it's frustrating and hard. But it won't stay that way if they persist in it."

## CLIP 2: Just Showing Up Is Enough

**Story Arc:** Setup (8-year practice myth) → Tension (what if they don't practice?) → Resolution (lessons alone have power)

**Deb Pratt (34:01)**
"I have a student that started with me when he was eight. Then he went to guitar, then he went to the ukulele. Then he said, 'I want to go back to piano because I want to learn the notes better.'"

**[JUMP CUT]**

**Deb Pratt (35:03)**
"*He was 14 when he told me that. He never practiced much at home.*"

**[PAUSE]**

**Deb Pratt (35:18)**
"Then one day he said to me, *'I bought a bass. Yeah, and I've just been playing it and playing it.'*"

**[JUMP CUT]**

**Ela Richmond (35:46)**
"He's 16 now, so he's been with you for eight years and he's just now finding what it is."

**[JUMP CUT]**

**Deb Pratt (36:42)**
"If I had been on him about practicing and his parents had required him to practice to have lessons, **he would never have reached this.**"
