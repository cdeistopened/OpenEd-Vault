## "How to Fix American Education in One Simple Step" - Interview Setup

### Opening Question Setup

"If you had to identify just ONE fundamental change that would transform American education, what would it be?"

### Expected Soundbite

This question is designed to get Corey to deliver his "fund families, not systems" message in a concise, shareable clip. He'll likely respond with something like:

_"The one simple step is to fund families directly instead of systems. When education dollars follow the child rather than being locked into institutions, we create a market that responds to what families actually need. This single change would drive innovation, improve quality across ALL education options, and restore the natural joy of learning."_

## Key Sound Bites to Explore

### On the Problems with Traditional Education

- "The biggest problem with American education isn't funding—it's the lack of freedom for families to choose what works for their children."
- "The one-size-fits-all approach isn't just ineffective—it actively suppresses children's natural curiosity and love of learning."

- "When we force children to adapt to the system rather than adapting education to the child, we're setting them up to fail."

- "Traditional schooling was designed for the industrial era. We're preparing kids for a world that no longer exists." (THIS ONE ALWAYS SLAPS)

- "The question isn't whether public schools are 'bad'—it's whether any single system can possibly meet the unique needs of every child."

### On the Benefits of Educational Freedom

- "Educational freedom isn't just about where your child learns—it's about restoring joy to the learning process."

- "When parents have choices, schools have to listen. Competition drives improvement across the entire system."

- "The data is clear: when education funding follows the child instead of the system, outcomes improve for everyone."

- "Educational freedom allows families to align learning with their values, rather than outsourcing their child's formation to strangers."

- "The beauty of school choice is that it doesn't force anyone to leave their current school—it simply gives options to families who need them."

### On the Parent Revolution

- "Parents became a new interest group during the pandemic—I call them the 'Kids Union'—and they're more powerful than the teachers unions when they band together."

- "What we're seeing isn't just policy change—it's a fundamental shift in how families view their role in education."

- "The pandemic didn't create the problems in our education system—it just revealed what was already there."

- "We've seen more progress toward universal school choice in the last three years than in the previous three decades."

- "This isn't a partisan issue for families—it's about doing what's best for their children. Politicians on both sides are starting to recognize that."


## Potential Questions 
1. "You've called the pandemic a 'transparency event' for education. How did virtual learning change what parents could see about their children's education?"
    
2. "Many parents became 'accidental homeschoolers' during the pandemic. What were the most surprising discoveries parents made when they saw classroom instruction up close?"
    
3. "There's a saying that 'you can't unsee what you've seen.' How has parents' direct observation of their children's learning during lockdowns permanently changed their perspective on education?"
    
4. "We saw an explosion in microschools and learning pods during the pandemic. What lessons should we take from these spontaneous educational communities?"
    
5. "Many families discovered that their children thrived with more personalized attention and flexible schedules during remote learning. How can we preserve these benefits in post-pandemic education?"

6. "What's the single biggest misconception about school choice that you encounter?"

7. "We've seen tremendous growth in homeschooling, microschools, and hybrid models. Do you see this as a temporary reaction to the pandemic or a permanent shift?"

8. "What would you say to parents who are interested in educational alternatives but worry they're not qualified to make these decisions?"

9. "What role should technology play in creating more personalized learning experiences?"
10. Ask about his vision for the future of education in America
11. What practical steps can parents take right now, regardless of their state's policies?
12. How can families start exploring educational alternatives even if they're currently in traditional schools?




[Bryan Caplan’s review of _The Parent Revolution_](https://www.betonit.ai/p/parents-take-control) positions Corey DeAngelis as both strategist and chronicler of one of the most significant political shifts in American education policy in recent decades. Caplan opens with a stark indictment of public schools during the COVID-19 pandemic, framing Zoom schooling as a farce that deprived students of real education, social connection, and childcare—while still paying teachers full salaries. In contrast, private schools responded swiftly to parental demand, reopening as soon as legally allowed. This divergence, Caplan argues, made the case for school choice suddenly visceral and urgent for millions of American families.

DeAngelis' book traces the rise of what Caplan calls a “Red State Strategy,” a tactical shift away from decades of fruitless bipartisan appeals for education reform. Instead of attempting to convert moderate Democrats with arguments about equity and opportunity, DeAngelis and his allies chose to rally Republican legislatures already inclined toward school choice. In this telling, the failure of public schools during the pandemic—combined with growing frustration over ideological curricula around race, gender, and sexuality—created a unique opportunity to galvanize conservative voters and politicians.

What makes _The Parent Revolution_ stand out, according to Caplan, is not just its subject matter, but DeAngelis’s role as a direct participant in many of the political victories he documents. The book offers a play-by-play of how states like Arizona, Florida, Utah, and West Virginia moved toward universal or near-universal school choice, and how political momentum continues to build in places like Texas. DeAngelis also aligns himself with a combative style of advocacy, frequently calling out the hypocrisy of public figures who oppose school choice while sending their own children to private schools. Caplan, though typically averse to ad hominem attacks, concedes that such tactics are effective given the demagoguery and ideological rigidity of the teachers unions.

The review acknowledges that DeAngelis’ success is impressive but also points to a broader and more pessimistic dynamic: rather than building national consensus, school choice is accelerating political polarization. Caplan warns that while school choice is flourishing in Republican-led states, blue states remain firmly aligned with teachers unions. He doubts that successful models in red states will persuade their counterparts elsewhere. Instead, he predicts increasing migration from blue to red states as families seek better educational options alongside lower taxes and cheaper housing.

Caplan closes by observing that _The Parent Revolution_ is ultimately a story of both democratic responsiveness and hard-nosed political calculation. The optimistic headline is that parents are finally being heard. But the deeper takeaway, for Caplan, is that persuasion has failed where strategic partisanship has succeeded. DeAngelis, in this view, hasn’t just won policy battles—he’s rewritten the rules of engagement for education reform.
