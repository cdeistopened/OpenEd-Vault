# The frictionless parenting trap

Michelle Rhee spent years reforming schools and now she's got something to say to parents: you're doing it wrong. Not the helicopter parenting thing everyone talks about—something more subtle and way more damaging. "I think that for many women of my generation who are working moms, we had that sort of like working mom guilt," she says. "And so when we did spend time with our kids, we wanted to make everything so like frictionless." Of course we did. We felt bad about missing bedtime stories, so we overcompensated by removing every possible obstacle from their lives. But here's the thing Rhee discovered: "When we do that as parents, we do a disservice to our kids." The research backs this up—kids who have to navigate hard things become more successful adults. Which means our guilt-driven parenting is accidentally creating the exact opposite of what we want: confident, capable humans.

# Kids are making millions in careers that don't exist in college

Here's a story that'll make you question everything: Michelle Rhee moves into this fancy LA apartment building, super expensive place, and realizes she and her husband are literally the oldest people there. Times two. So naturally she starts asking: what do all these kids do for money? The answer? "They're in cannabis, they're in crypto, they're gamers, they are content creators." None of these existed when we were planning our college majors, and exactly zero of them require a degree. Isaac Morehouse nails it: "Those are things that they couldn't have even tried because 10 years ago they didn't exist." Meanwhile, we're still obsessing over getting kids into "good colleges" for careers that might not exist by the time they graduate. The parents of these crypto-rich 22-year-olds are probably freaking out right now because their kids didn't follow the script. But maybe the script is the problem.

# Getting the reps in builds real confidence

Isaac Morehouse learned this the hard way with his oldest kid: we're accidentally crushing our children's natural confidence. Watch any toddler—they see mom cutting vegetables, they want to try. They see dad mowing the lawn, they grab for the handle. And what do we do? "I was too quick to be like, no, you can't do this. I'm trying to get something done." Sound familiar? Michelle Rhee calls it "getting the reps in"—the same way athletes build muscle memory through repetition. "If you watch something enough times or hear something enough times, you sort of gain confidence. And then young people are gonna be like, okay, I've seen it. I have some pattern recognition now. Like, I can do this." The solution isn't complicated: let them try, let them fail, let them figure it out. Yes, they'll do it worse than you. Yes, it'll take longer. But that's how humans learn to be human.

## 01:00 How Michelle Went From Education Reform to Workforce Development

**Ela:** Can you give me a little bit of background on where you come from, how you got started in the space?

**Michelle:** I spent the vast majority of my career in K-12 education, leading nonprofits, the Washington DC public school district, and then some advocacy organizations after that. When I was in DC in 2007, we would hear all the time that the vast majority of employers in America were saying that they could not find the skilled workers they needed for their mission critical jobs. I always used that as sort of a rallying cry for what we needed to do in public education. 

I found myself decades later thinking nothing has really changed. The employers are still saying the exact same thing. I left public education and then a colleague called me and said, "Hey, I'm thinking about starting this new company." It was a software company called Build Within that was focused on apprenticeships. I was like, "Well, I don't know anything about workforce development, but very quickly I figured out, oh, this is a way that I could potentially meet the same goal that I was trying to bring to fruition in education and just doing it more directly."

## 04:00 The "College for All" Mindset That Failed a Generation

**Michelle:** When I was in the field of K-12 education, the pathway to a successful career was through college. And so as education reformers, I think we were overindexed for sure on this sort of college for all mindset. I think it was only when we began to see that lots of the kids that were going through successful charter management organizations, who we'd really sort of closed the gap with those kids in terms of their academic achievement levels. But then they were going on to higher ed and getting into a lot of debt, not necessarily graduating or graduating and not really having the job prospects that we had guaranteed were going to happen.

I think the landscape has changed significantly now because I think young people just think way differently about work.

## 09:45 The Mystery of Rich Kids in Expensive Apartments

**Michelle:** I tell this story about how a few years ago, my husband and I moved into this fancy apartment building in downtown Los Angeles, super pricey place. We realized very quickly that we were the oldest people in the building. Times two, easily. And I kept saying to my husband, "What do all these kids do for a living? We can barely afford to live in this place."

So my husband was like, "I'm gonna find out." For two weeks, every time he was in the lobby or got in an elevator with one of these kids, he was asking them what they do. He came back and reported to me: "They're in cannabis, they're in crypto, they're gamers, they are content creators." All these things that they can go to college for these things, right? Their parents are probably freaking out right now because they don't know what their kid is doing.

**Isaac:** And those are things that they couldn't have even tried because 10 years ago they didn't exist.

**Michelle:** They didn't exist. And so I think that is a big part of the landscape change—there are jobs that there are not college and very specific pathway programs to prepare folks for those careers. And kids are seeing those and thinking, "Okay, well how do I access those?"

## 12:00 Isaac's Reverse Journey: From Workforce to K-12

**Isaac:** I was working in a nonprofit doing fundraising when I kept meeting with all these business owners who said the exact same thing Michelle said: "I can't find any workers." This was 2008, 2007 era. There's all these kids coming out with degrees, master's degrees, they don't know how to do anything. "I don't want to hire any of them. Who am I going to find to help grow my company?"

And many of the young people were like, "Oh, nobody wants to hire me. I guess I'll go back and get a master's because it's the only way I can defer making payments on my student loan." Literally that was the decision. Take on more debt so I can wait and maybe that will make me hireable.

So I started an apprenticeship program that was an alternative to college. "Hey, come spend six months, we'll give you a bootcamp and then we'll place you and someone will pay you for six months to work." With the knowledge that you don't quite know everything yet, but you're inexpensive—entry level talent at intern level prices.

## 18:00 Why Apprenticeships Beat College Debt Every Time

**Michael:** If you think about any post high school pathway that students take, taking on a lot of debt when your success rate is six out of 10—if you're low income, by the way, it's closer to one out of 10—and then if you do graduate, 50% of those people get a job that doesn't require the degree, and then 90% of those people are stuck in a job five years later that still doesn't require a degree. That's a lot of risk to be taking on as an individual.

So the notion of an apprenticeship where you can get paid while you're learning all of a sudden takes off that risk. But companies clearly need to find ways to de-risk this as well. Because they know talent only stays in the job for four years. There's a lot of movement. They don't want to be training the person that someone else is going to free ride off of.

## 25:00 The Sports World Has Figured Out What Education Hasn't

**Isaac:** An area that gives me a lot of hope is the realm of sports. You kind of have this—it's not like fully vertically integrated, but you do have an actual system. You have IMG Academy. I was getting my haircut and the woman there said, "Yeah, my grandson, he just got all of his tuition paid to go to IMG Academy by Under Armour."

My son, he's eight, he's on a travel baseball team. The coach of the local high school realized he wants a feeder, he wants all the best talent to come to his high school. So he created a middle school club team. And then he created a younger one. And a younger one. Now they start at age eight and he has this whole mechanism to filter up so that by the time they're in high school, he's already been working with them for years.

**Michael:** That porousness that you just referenced is really important though as we do this, to keep people generalists before they overspecialize too early. David Epstein's written really well about this in Range—overspecialization in youth sports is the dramatic craziness on the other side, where we specialize way too early as opposed to generalize and figure out where does this really resonate.

## 27:00 AI Is Making Your Resume Worthless (Networks Matter More)

**Michael:** AI is now writing the applications and resumes, matching it to the job description. AI on the other side is filtering. And so AI's having a conversation with AI. If I'm the hiring manager, I don't believe at all that that resume coming through represents the real person. And so I call up Michelle and I'm like, "Hey, do you have a good person for X post?" She's like, "Oh yeah, totally." That's how I de-risk it.

Social Capital Network becomes even more important and we have to be really intentional about making sure kids get connected as a result.

## 34:00 Getting the Reps In: The Athletic Approach to Life Skills

**Michelle:** What people in sports refer to—it's about getting the reps in. If you watch something enough times or hear something enough times, you sort of gain confidence. And then I think young people are going to be like, "Okay, I've seen it. I have some pattern recognition now. Like, I can do this." And so I think a lot of it is about that consistency of getting the reps in.

I think that can build confidence both from an employer side, but also from the worker side.

## 35:00 How Parents Accidentally Crush Natural Confidence

**Isaac:** Kids, if you watch kids, they watch their mom cutting vegetables or their dad mowing the lawn. They watch and then all of a sudden they want to do it too. And it's not always practical. You can't always, but the more you're willing to let them, and even though they're going to do it way worse and they're going to slow you down and it's going to be crazy, maybe slightly dangerous sometimes. The more you can allow them to, the more that they now have that naturally baked in.

I was not good at this. I was too quick to be like, "No, you can't do this. I'm trying to get something done." I think that's really important because if you don't crush it, it doesn't really get wired in them. They don't think that my youngest, he thinks he can do everything sometimes. But that kind of attitude of, "Yeah, I can participate. I see something new, why don't I try it?" I think it's kind of more natural to humans if we don't beat it out of them.

## 58:00 The Research on Why Hard Things Make Strong Kids

**Michelle:** I think that for many women of my generation who are working moms, we had that sort of working mom guilt. And so when we did spend time with our kids, we wanted to make everything so frictionless. And I think that when we do that as parents, we do a disservice to our kids. 

The research is very clear that kids who have to go through hard things and figure it out and there is actually a lot of friction in their lives that they have to muster their way through are much more successful in the long run. And so I'd say like letting go of all that working parent guilt stuff and letting your kids do hard stuff.
