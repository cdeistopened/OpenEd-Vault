**Michelle Rhee:** [00:00:00] they're in cannabis, they're in crypto, they're gamers, they are content creators. all these things that they can go to college for these things. Right? Um, their, their parents are probably freaking out right now 'cause they don't know what their kid is doing.

**Isaac Morehouse:** And those are things that they couldn't have even tried because 10 years ago they didn't exist.

**Michael Horn:** it's actually really hard to create change in K 12 because it's somewhat of a dependent system on higher ed. That is, we think of good high schools as that, which gets its students into quote unquote good colleges. But if colleges are misfiring, then the whole system behind it misfires as well.

​

**Ela Richmond:** Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm your sometimes host Ella, and today I'm joined by your other sometimes host Isaac. Um, today we have something really special. Today's gonna be a panel on the future of work, right? So everybody talks about what is the purpose of education, where are kids going, what's gonna light them up? So to get us [00:01:00] started, I am going to introduce Michael Horn and Michelle Ree. I'm so excited to have them on the podcast as additional guests today. Um, so let's start one by one. Can you gimme a little bit of information, background on where you come from, how you got started in the space, just so that parents who are not familiar yet with your work, um, kind of understand where you came from.

**Michelle Rhee:** All right. Um, Michelle Ree, I spent the vast majority of my career in K 12 education, leading nonprofits, uh, a school district, the, um, Washington DC public school district, and then some advocacy organizations after that. And what I would say. Is that when I was in the field of K 12 education, um, uh, and in particular when I was in DC uh, in 2007, we would hear all of the time the fact that, um, employers, the vast majority of employers in America were saying that they could not find the skilled workers [00:02:00] that they needed for their mission critical jobs. And so I always used that as sort of a, a rallying cry for what we needed to do in public education. And I found myself like decades later, um, and thinking nothing has really changed. Like the employees are still saying the exact same thing. Uh, I left public education and then a colleague of mine, um, called me and said, Hey, I'm thinking about starting this new company.

And it was a, um, a software company called Build Within, um, that was focused on apprenticeships. And I was like, well, I don't know anything about workforce development, but like very quickly I sort of figured out, oh, this is a way that I could potentially meet the same goal that I was trying to sort of, um, bring to fruition in education and just sort of doing it more directly.

And so that is where, um, and how my, uh, passion and workforce development really [00:03:00] evolved.

**Ela Richmond:** Very fascinating. Michael would love to hear your story.

**Michael Horn:** Yeah, sure. So, I, I, I guess like Michelle, I started in education in the K 12 space. Um, I started working with Clay Christensen, the legendary, uh, professor of innovation at the Harvard Business School. Uh, we wrote a book called Disrupting Class, how Disruptive Innovation Will Change the Way the World Learns. And midway through that, um, I co-founded the Clayton Christensen Institute for Disruptive Innovation, which I ran for about a decade. And we were initially focused on K 12 education. And then in 20 10, 11, somewhere around then, uh, a lot of people in higher ed were reading our work and we're like, you're describing our universe and there's actually disruptive innovation going on here as opposed to your wishes.

Uh, in K 12 perhaps. And very quickly, the unlock that I had was. Gosh, like it's actually really hard to create change in K 12 because it's somewhat of a dependent system on higher ed. That is, we think of good high schools as that, which gets its students into quote unquote good colleges. But if [00:04:00] colleges are misfiring, then the whole system behind it misfires as well. And so I was like, gosh, we gotta start working on higher ed and disrupting that system. And then you go up one more rung and you realize actually how we think about skills and talent and developing individuals is pretty flawed, uh, at, at that level as well. And it's sort of this series of dependencies.

And that brought me up, uh, through guild education, which I, I, I worked at for a couple of years. And then this book Job Moves, uh, that came out in November. Uh, we started just focusing a lot more on how does the workforce itself work and how do we, uh, help individuals navigate it and develop their passions and potential.

Um, and so now really. K through career, I spend time on all those problems and how do we rethink it and make it both less linear in all three, but so that people can find their way through at the same time, which I think is the big challenge that we have at the moment.

**Ela Richmond:** I love that.

**Isaac Morehouse:** it's so funny hearing both of you because I have [00:05:00] kind of had the reverse version in

terms of where in the life cycle, so I. I was working in a nonprofit, I was actually doing fundraising. When I kept meeting with all these business owners who said the exact same thing, Michelle, you said, I can't, I can't find any workers.

And this was like 2008, 2007 era. Uh, you know, there's all these kids coming out with degrees, master's degrees, they don't know how to do anything. I don't wanna hire any of 'em. Who am I gonna find to help grow my company? And I was raising money for programs that were like career coaching and and placement programs to help people.

And many of the young people were like, oh, nobody wants to hire me. I guess I'll go back and get a master's 'cause it's the only way I can defer making payments on my student loan. Like literally that was the decision. Take on more debt so I can wait and maybe, maybe that will make me hireable. So I started at the higher ed side, at the career side. Saying, well, what is it that these employers are actually looking for? If it's not a degree, what is it and why do these kids not have it? And who does have it and how can you help 'em get it? [00:06:00] So I started an apprenticeship program that was, you know, an alternative to college. Hey, come spend six months, we'll give you a bootcamp and then we'll place you in and someone will pay you for six months to work. And with the knowledge that you don't quite know everything yet, but you're inexpensive, you're kind of, we used to say like entry level talent at intern level prices, right? So for the employer, it's like, Hey, don't worry. We're giving them additional support and helping them. And it was really successful on a small scale, we had a couple hundred people will go through every year.

It's still going today. Great program. But I got this itch to see if I could do this at a larger scale. So I started a tech, uh, platform called Crash. Uh, long story short, it crashed. Don't name your company crash, I guess. Uh, but I, I really wanted to take one slice, like. How can we help people create a signal of their value that is more effective than the degree?

It's, the degree is a very devalued signal. It really doesn't say that much about you, and a typical resume [00:07:00] doesn't either. So how can they prove value? Demonstrate. And so it was like video pitches and things that we had found work for Praxis grads all the time. Kids who were 19 and had no experience and no degree were getting jobs that said degree and three years of experience required by, by doing this. But it was really, really hard to get more than a couple hundred people a month to do this. And I had the reverse of, of y'all who were working to, you know, earlier in this stage, I thought, huh, by the time kids are 18, 19, 20, and they start looking at careers, their habits and mindsets, it was really hard to, what I call deschool them. So there's only a small percentage and you really have to work hands on and like coach them. And it wasn't very scalable. So I thought, well, we gotta start earlier. We have to try to help people get out of that conveyor belt mindset earlier so that by the time they get here, it's not so hard to get them out of the, all I gotta do is buy a degree and someone will hand me a job mindset.

So I ended up now in the K through 12 side trying to help people think [00:08:00] differently there, but very similar, uh, ways that our, our paths have have crossed.

**Ela Richmond:** I absolutely love that, and I think, yeah. Um, it's, it's fascinating that you all have had this experience going through K 12, having seen all of these different, you know, these kids and then these adults, um, go through this path. Michael, you said that, um. That you are trying to make it less linear. Right.

And, and Michelle, I'm curious, so how has this conversation changed over time? Like as you've been in this industry, how has the conversation that you've been having with parents and also students changed over time? Because I know that like when y'all started, it was all wishes, right? These are the things that we wish would happen.

Um, now there's a lot that is actually happening. Um, so what have you exactly seen?

**Michelle Rhee:** Well, I, I would echo what both Michael and Isaac said, which is that when I, uh, was, uh, initially involved in K 12 public education, the pathway to a successful career was through [00:09:00] college. And so as education reformers, I think we were overindexed for sure on, you know, this sort of college for all mindset. Um, and I think it was only when. We began to see that lots of the kids that were going through successful charter management organizations and that sort of thing, who, you know, we'd really sort of closed the gap with those kids in terms of their academic achievement levels. But then they were going on to higher ed and getting into a lot of debt, not necessarily, um, you know, graduating or graduating and not really sort of having the job prospects that they, but I think we had guaranteed right were gonna happen. Um, and I think the landscape has, has changed significantly now because I think young people just think way differently about work. Um, I tell this story about how a few years ago, my husband and I moved [00:10:00] into this fancy apartment building in downtown Los Angeles, super pricey place. And um, we realized very quickly that we were the oldest people in the support building. Times two, easily. And I kept saying to my husband, like, what, what do all these kids do for a living? Like, we can barely afford to live in this place. Like, what, what do they do for a living? So my husband was like, I'm gonna find out. Um, and for two weeks, every time he was in the lobby or got in an elevator with one of these kids, he was asking 'em like, what do you do? Um, and he came back and reported to me and reported out after that time period. And he was like, all right, they're, they're in cannabis, they're in crypto, they're gamers, they are content creators. Um, all these things that we were like, they can go to college for these things. Right? Um, their, their parents are probably freaking out right now 'cause they don't know what their kid is doing.

**Isaac Morehouse:** And those are things that they couldn't have even tried because 10 years ago they didn't exist.

**Michelle Rhee:** They [00:11:00] didn't exist. And so I think that is a big part of the landscape change is that now there are jobs that. Um, there are not college and very like, specific pathway programs to, uh, prepare folks, um, for those careers. And kids are seeing those, young people are seeing those and thinking, okay, well how, how do I access those?

And so I think one of the biggest challenges that we face right now is that there are so many different kinds of opportunities out there that were not even, you know, dreamed

of a few years ago. And I don't think young people are clear on, okay, what are they, how, how can I prepare myself for them? And I think we as adults in the system are equally sort of befuddled as to like, okay, how are we gonna match kids with these various jobs that are out there?

And I think that's one of the biggest challenges that exist right now.

**Ela Richmond:** I agree with that [00:12:00] and I wanna bring it back to this in a moment, but first I wanna kick it over to Michael actually. So, um, as Michelle was talking, it was clear that. What kids want has changed, or maybe not even. Um, what does the, the ambitions that kids have say about what the job that they are searching to get done, what is the thing that they're actually looking for?

Um, in, in pursuing all these like various, you know, non-traditional pads.

**Michael Horn:** Yeah, it, it's a great question. I think what, where I'm hesitating is I think it also depends on context, right? In a lot of cases and it's there, there are some trends for sure, right? Um, but it's hard to overgeneralize, I think one way or the other. Something that Michelle told me on when, when she was on our podcast, um, was. Like 10 years ago, everyone was about purpose in work and now it's a little bit more utilitarian. People say like, Hey, I'm gonna have a couple gigs and like, you know, it allows me to do my purpose, which might [00:13:00] not be connected to work. And I think both of those answers are totally okay and different individuals have different answers, um, around it. But the point I think is that sort of the mindset 40, 50 years ago around our, which our structures are built around was, you know, you're gonna go four years of college and like have your 40 year career. And that is definitely not what's happening and either of those two visions, right? Like that's the big thing that's changing is people change jobs every four years.

On average. A billion people switch jobs worldwide every single year and. It's not linear, right? They're not like, okay, I'm coming in as the entry level employee. I'm an individual contributor. Now I wanna be a manager then a director. Then no, it's not looking like it swirls. It loops. People have a couple side hustles. Sometimes it's super purposeful what they're doing and sometimes it's not right. And it's very stage context dependent. And I think that's [00:14:00] part of this also is like motivation. It like context and motivation have

both shifted, um, quite a bit in this moment. And I think that's one of the reasons we also struggle.

And, and maybe I'm

jumping ahead, but just like to Michelle's point around how it was such a college for all movement and now it's careers we don't even understand. I, I think the answer of schools to think like you can shut the outside world and keep it outside the school walls, and somehow teachers and co and school counselors are gonna be able to provide the answers to students in a world that like they've never been in, that they don't understand is incredibly naive.

Um,

and we have to think of like.

a much more set of porous boundaries between these worlds to help people frankly, meet different individuals and figure out what those pathways are, get those opportunities or figure out like, which part of the tribe am I gonna be in, right? Am I working to find purpose elsewhere or do I find purpose in work? I don't [00:15:00] think there's a right answer on that, but I think we have to be able to create opportunities for individuals to navigate regardless of where they land on those different spectrums.

**Isaac Morehouse:** You know, one, one thing, as you guys were both talking, it's really easy when we talk about like, Hey, how to prepare people for careers. Getting caught up in. What should we teach? What specific skills or methods of teaching those skills? And sometimes there's like a much simpler starting point, which is just exposure.

Can we just increase the exposure to different things that humans can do and make a living doing? And even as a homeschool dad who works from home, I have to remind myself, my kids have no idea like how, what my job is and what I do all day. And I, I try to remind myself, like have 'em come in and like sit in here while I'm working and ask me questions about what's this spreadsheet or what's this? Because often like the critiques you hear when people say, oh look over here in China, kids all wanna be scientists. And the number one job kids want in America is YouTuber. It's 'cause that's what [00:16:00] they've seen. Like when I was a kid, you were told that the jobs available to you were like firefighter, astronaut, and like guy who carried a briefcase.

No one knew what that other one was. Right? So of course I wanted to be like a baseball player or fighter pilot. 'cause everything else was just in this big bucket like business. I don't know what that means. I remember my brother took a career assessment when he was like 16 and it said you should be a jeweler. And it's, he is like the most random. He's one of the most successful entrepreneurs by the way. He went into accounting, whatever else, but like this idea that you just kind of take a couple of things and put labels on him. It, it, it's really being around and being exposed to. So the more, that's what I love about the work from home and remote work and even kids doing virtual and blended school, just increasing the exposure to different types of careers and knowing that they're possible.

And this is what's cool about all the YouTube and all that stuff. Yes, kids can get addicted to it, but them seeing, I'm not good at engineering, but my kid gets to watch Mark Rober and now he has an idea of a possible future that I couldn't provide [00:17:00] him just on my own. So I think just exposure alone opens the imagination for kids.

**Michelle Rhee:** I, I would go, I, I agree with that, but I would go with step further to say like, in addition to exposure, it's actually just doing

right. And this is one of the things that when Jimena and I were running build within We, I was. Most shocked about amongst employers, which was that what we realized is like, all right, this notion that you're gonna go to school for four year, go to college for four years and learn, learn, learn, and then you're gonna go do right, was just so outdated.

So antiquated for the way that that young people think. Um, and, and that's why we built Build Within, right? Is because like, okay, um, you, you have to be able to train people in a much more sort of elastic, flexible way because to Mike Michael's point, they're gonna go go into a new, new job in a new career in, uh, a few years time. Um, and so the notion around it was like. [00:18:00] You know, not just the exposure piece, but also like we have to have young people like in these jobs actually doing, and as educators, we know that this is the best way that people learn, right? It's not just reading books, but actually doing things. But the pushback that we got from employers was pretty significant, right?

Like at first they'd say, oh, I don't think we can hire these folks. They don't know this. And, and it took a while, but you could tell like once something clicked in their heads where we were saying to them, any entry level employee who has never done this job before, like they are learning on the job and you have to do things and make mistakes and see other people do it

Well et cetera, to really become good at something.

And then once they sort of realize like,

oh, like, yeah, I mean this, all of our entry level like payroll specialists. Right. They, we, we have to like train them for a certain amount of time and we're like, right. That's essentially an [00:19:00] apprenticeship. Right? And so it took a while because the, an, the notion of an apprentice in immediately in their mind like, didn't resonate. But once we sort of said, it's, it's really just about like learning and doing simultaneously to become effective at your job. Um, with some employers, they were finally able to say, well, this is what happens with all entry level people we're like, right.

**Ela Richmond:** Uh, interesting. Michelle, I'm curious, what was the further pushback? So like what, what else were they afraid of? The people that told you No, at the end.

**Michelle Rhee:** I would say the other thing was I would chalk it up to like a shortsightedness, which is people would say to us, we don't lack talent. We lack skilled talent. We need somebody who can be productive for us today. Like we can send out for a call, right? Or to build a website and we don't have to teach them anything.

Like they can do that [00:20:00] from day one. And so then their strategy for how to build the workforce was just poaching from other companies, right? 'cause I know this person knows how to do that. And it just to us seems so shortsighted. Like, well, especially in like the trades and construction, some businesses where sectors where like you have an aging workforce and continuing to just poach from other people is not like figuring out how you're gonna build the workforce of the future. Um, it was hard to get people past that and thinking more long term about like, you got, you have to start earlier in the pipeline and you really have to build up skills, um, with people earlier and you. In the, in the pressure of like, we have to pro, you know, produce these deliverables, we gotta get this job done.

It was hard to get people to think in that way.

**Michael Horn:** Yeah, Ella, just on that, I think something that I think shares across the ecosystem is like [00:21:00] reducing risk for each of the parties in all these transactions, right? So if you think about like college or any higher education path, like any post high school pathway that students take. Taking on a lot of debt when your success rate is six outta 10.

If you're low income, by the way, it's closer to one out of 10. Um, like, and then graduating. And then if you do graduate, sorry, if you are quote unquote successful and you graduate, 90% of, uh, sorry. 50% of those people get a job that doesn't require the degree, and then 90% of those people are stuck in a job five years later, that still doesn't require a degree. Like that's a lot of risk. To be taking on as an individual, right? So the notion of an apprenticeship where you can get paid while you're learning all of a sudden takes off that risk. And so then I asked the same question that Michelle did. Okay. Well, so companies clearly, like, clearly the zero sum game of just poaching is not gonna solve their pipeline challenges, but [00:22:00] for most companies, it seems that they need to find ways to de-risk this as well.

Because they know talent only stays in the job for four years. There's a lot of movement. They don't wanna be training the person that someone else is gonna free ride off of. And so how do you create, uh, either through government or frankly like innovative fi financing mechanisms and things of that nature, or different contracts like ways to de-risk it for the employer as well and make it easier for them to come to a yes and be a little less, uh, short-term focused.

Um, on, on, on that question. And then I think the third piece of it, frankly, is like. Managing people, particularly as we start to think about middle and high school age, right? Who are really gonna be inexperienced and sort of this youth apprenticeship model that people really wanna see take off, but is struggling to, in a lot of places. How do you give meaty work for those individuals, but also supervision that doesn't

take away from the day-to-day of the business. Um, you know, these are, these are

harder problems I think to work out in the day-to-day than, than sort of [00:23:00] someone like me in a, in my office writing, uh, articles, uh, wishes it were a lot of times.

But, but this is sort of where I think you have to figure out how do you take off risk or work that feels like, yeah, I know it's the right thing in the long run. It's like taking vitamins and exercising. But maybe in the short term, day to day, it'd be better if I just, you know, cranked on email for an extra hour instead of went to the gym.

**Isaac Morehouse:** You know, an area that gives me a lot of hope and that I'm kind of like following with great interest is the realm of sports. You see something really happening, and I think the college rule changes accelerate this. Where you kind of have this, it's not like fully vertically integrated. It's not like the Los Angeles Lakers have a peewee five-year-old basketball team that they own. But you do have an actual system because now you're able to, you know, colleges are all competing for these kids. So then they have these high schools that are just designed to get you ready for a certain sport. And brands are also competing to [00:24:00] sign people. So I live down here in Florida. You have IMG Academy. I was getting my haircut and the woman there said, yeah, my grandson, he just got, uh, all of his tuition paid to go to IMG Academy by Under Armour and Under Armour will sponsor a bunch of people. 'cause they're, they're like, Hey, a few of these might end up in the NFL and if we caught 'em when they were 17 or 16. Great. And you have like my son. He's eight, he's on a travel baseball team. They don't travel very far, but it's, they the, they keep, they keep making younger and younger teams. It's part of this club. The coach of the local high school, which is a very competitive baseball team. He realized he wants a feeder, he wants all the best talent to come to his high school.

So he created a middle school club team. And then he created a younger one. And a younger one. Now they start at age eight and he has this whole mechanism to filter up so that by the time they're in high school, he's already been working with 'em for years. He's been training 'em, he's helping them. And it's like you're taking some elements of that apprenticeship.

'cause they're not just learning about baseball, they're playing [00:25:00] baseball, but they're, they're playing it with other eight year olds. They're not playing it in the big leagues at age eight. Right. And I think there's kind of this interesting, it takes some elements from the old, like trade guilds, but it adds the freedom. To, to come and go as you please. My son might play for one year and then decide he wants to quit. Right. It's not the rigidity of like cartels and guilds that are very, very structured and, and rigid without the freedom of mobility, but it does have that. There are levels and there's like this whole feeder system, and I think it'd be really cool to see that happening more in more other careers.

**Michael Horn:** That poorness that you just referenced at the end, I think is really important though as we do this, right, to keep people generalists before they overspecialize too early. Right. I mean, um, David Epstein's written really well about this in range, um, about, you know, overspecialization in youth sports, I think is the dramatic, uh, craziness of that as well on the other side, right?

Where we specialize way too early as opposed to generalize, um, and figure out [00:26:00] like, where do I grok? Right? Where, where, where, where does this really resonate? And then frankly, just meeting people. So I, I think there's the three legs exposure. Actually doing the work and meeting real people who do the work and building up networks in different places. Um, because at the end of the day, that's also how we get jobs is through who, you know, it's not through applying with a resume online. And I think that's gonna become even more so as you know, AI is

now writing the

applications and resumes, matching it to the job description. AI on the other side is filtering.

And so AI's having a conversation with ai, if I'm the hiring manager, I don't believe at all that that resume coming through represents the real person. And so I call up Michelle and I'm like, Hey, do you have a good person for X post? She's like, oh yeah, totally. That's how I de-risk it. Again, coming back to that notion of risk. Um, and so I think Social Capital Network becomes even more important and we have to be really intentional about making sure kids get intro, uh, get [00:27:00] connected as a result.

**Ela Richmond:** I love this and I kind of wanna switch the, the focus of this conversation. So you all were talking about all of these approaches to apprenticeships and, um, creating a non-linear path for your kids and focusing on being a generalist before you specialize too much. Most of our audience is homeschool parents, right?

And so they are doing this on their own. They're looking at this, they're saying, okay, yes, I want my kid to get an apprenticeship. Or maybe even it's the kid themselves that's saying, okay, yes, you know what, this is gonna be really valuable for me. Um, Isaac, I know you have a lot of thoughts on this, um, but I would love to kick it over to y'all.

Where would you even begin as a parent, as a kid trying to say, okay, I know I need experience. I know I need to create some sort of foundation for where I'm going next. I need to just take a step, even though it's kind of hard sometimes and it's kind of scary. Um, where would you suggest people go first?

**Isaac Morehouse:** I'll be really brief here and kick it over to the others. I would just don't look at the [00:28:00] whole humongous problem that you just outlined, like. How do I get to some world where I am entrepreneurially, you know, apprenticing, just start with like the lowest hanging, simplest step, lowest hanging fruit. Like is there something that I don't hate that seems somewhat interesting that someone would let me do, or shadow them while they do and just try it.

And if you go shadow someone for a couple days or a couple weeks and you're like, oh, this stinks, I don't want this anymore. Okay, fine. You can check that off your list. But just start there with something really simple. If your kid's interested in something, can you find like, my girls like to bake. Can you find a bakery and say, would they be able to come in and just like shadow, what if they wash dishes?

They may say no, but, but just try to find some step like that that lets them get a little bit, a little higher degree of exposure than they currently have and participation if possible.

**Michael Horn:** I I love that. Um, I was gonna say something very similar and something my wife is always telling me when, um, we're talking, solving this for our, our twin girls is like, [00:29:00] let's solve the current problem as opposed to the problem five years from now. Right? Um, and, and I think that's the same mindset, right?

Is like lots of sprints, lots of exposure, lots of opportunities to build. And if you're homeschooling right, quote unquote, the academics are, you know, taking what, a couple hours a day you have. A lot of time and flexibility to plug into different organizations in a variety of different ways and, and, and use that flexibility and freedom and connections and, uh, frankly, other parents in the network to, you know, Hey, can my kid come over there to your, you know, to your office?

I, I'd, I'd love to take, you know, your kids right over here. Um, power of network can go in a lot of different ways and, and just, you know, follow what the kid thinks is their interest. Um, and and then keep pushing 'em out of it slightly just so that they learn more right. Over time. And, and I think Isaac said one thing that's really important also, which is this is less about finding the thing and more about [00:30:00] learning and also crossing things off the list.

**Michelle Rhee:** I would just add to that, um, that you can't underestimate the, um, power and the value of just general, you know, sort of general skills, what people would say. Soft skills, durable skills, you know, those sorts of things. Um, but I remember, um, you know, when my girls were little, um, they had to sit through too many car rides where I was on speaker phone, you know, having a performance evaluation, hiring somebody, firing somebody, negotiating a contract, whatever, and they would be in back listening to all of that stuff, right? Um, and, uh, you know, sort of that, and, and when they were young, I, I also paid both of them before they, uh, graduated from high school work in a service job. Right. I was like, you go scoop ice cream, flip hamburgers. You, you [00:31:00] have to have that experience of dealing with an unhappy customer. Uh, you know, you name it. And I think that, uh, if, when I look at my girls now, I would say that them just sort of learning a lot of those general skills, serve them and serve them well now, and have served them well in like, lots of different roles that they've had. Um, because they have some of these just really strong foundational skills.

And, and Isaac, to your point, uh, you know, I think my kids were lucky 'cause they had exposure to that. I mean, it wasn't, it wasn't necessarily voluntary that they

sat through all of those calls. Um, but, you know, they had the exposure. They, they, they heard the language, they, you know. Saw like how you navigate through some of these difficult and challenging situations and when you don't have that experience, you don't have that exposure, you don't, then, then those can be sort of the the things [00:32:00] that really surface obstacles for young people in terms of seeing success in the workplace.

**Isaac Morehouse:** Okay.

**Ela Richmond:** Yeah, I like that. Um, at what point, so like, I mean this might differ between children, it might differ between, you know, how ready they are, but like at what point do you actually start wanting them or letting them get hands on? So you were talking about exposure is the most important part. And, um, something fascinating.

So one of our partners in Kansas, super cool. Um, they do a lot of different things with us for open education. They're called the learning lab. And inside the learning lab there is a micro school where the, um, the founder and leader has been working to get each of his kids apprenticeships that fit them.

Um, so he has a really cool network within the Wichita area. He talks to individual small businesses and he says, okay, I will go drop them off. They'll be with you for two hours. We're just gonna get them exposure. Um, y'all were all [00:33:00] mentioning that at a certain point, right? Like the, the skills that they're going to be needing are going to be more complex, right?

So how do you over time start to convince people to like let your kid, let's say you have a 16-year-old who's ready to go, um, to have more responsibility.

**Michelle Rhee:** I mean, honestly, I think it's about. What you, what people in sports refer to in sales, et cetera. It's about getting the reps in, right? You, if you watch something enough times or hear something enough times, um, you know, you, you sort of gain confidence. And then I think young people are gonna be like, okay, I've seen it.

I, like, I have some pattern recognition now. Like, I can do this. Right? And so I think a lot of it is about, um, just, you know, ha not, not just like, okay, I'm gonna show you how to do this once, like, are you ready to do it or not? It's about sort of like that consistency of getting the reps in. I think that that, [00:34:00] um, that can build confidence both from an employer side, but also from the, the worker side.

**Isaac Morehouse:** You know, there's a, this kind of happens naturally unless you, unless you crush it. And as parents, like, we crush it a lot. Uh, not intentionally necessarily, but kids, if you watch kids. watch stuff, they watch their mom cutting vegetables or their dad whatever, grilling, mowing the lawn. They watch, they watch and then all of a sudden they wanna do it too. And it's not always practical. You can't always, but the more you're willing to let them, and even though it's gonna, they're gonna do it way worse and they're gonna slow you down and it's gonna be crazy. Maybe slightly dangerous sometimes. Uh, the more you can allow them to, the more that they now have that naturally baked in and they're, that, that comes naturally to them later on in life. I know, like with my oldest child, I was not good at this. I was too quick to be like, no, you can't do this. I'm trying to get something [00:35:00] done. And it took him, I've actually like learned later, he has way more of a, I can't do things unless I'm an expert. Sort of thing going on than my other kids do. Because each kid, you get a little more patient, you get right. And like I realized, oh, okay, it's on me, the parent to take the added burden of the messes and the frustration and the slowdowns. Again, you can't always, there's not everything you can have your kid involved you, but like, it was too easy for me to just be impatient and say, no, you just watch. Let me handle it.

Let me do it. Um, I think that's really important because if you don't, if you don't crush it, it doesn't really get wired in them. They don't think that, like my youngest, he thinks he can do everything sometimes, uh, hilariously. So, and he has to, you know, learn the hard way that he really isn't as good as, uh, grown adults at many things.

But like that kind of attitude of, yeah, I can participate. I see something new, why don't I try it? I think it's kind of more natural to humans if we don't beat it out of 'em.

**Michelle Rhee:** I wonder though how we. How we create those kinds of environments with [00:36:00] employers. 'cause like we were talking about before, the stakes are higher there. Right? And, and it, the employers, they, they gotta deliver things. They have to complete jobs. They have, you know, to, uh, please the, the client. And so I think that in those environments, it's hard for them to give that kind of freedom and, you know, leeway and experimentation because they feel like they can't afford to.

**Isaac Morehouse:** You know how you have like the parent driving the car and then you got like the little baby steering wheel next to them that the kid is driving? I imagine like walking up to a store and having the normal cash register and the attendant there, and then having a little one off to the side that says like, apprentice register.

Like, you can go here if you want to, but be warned, you know.

**Michael Horn:** But, but you're speaking to where I think I was gonna go, which is like, I think something that's gonna change and, and is changing, right, is using AI to create simulations so that people can get reps in,

[00:37:00] in low stakes settings. Um, and frankly, lots of them, even if you, even if your parents don't know right?

The opportunities is something that I think is gonna get much, much more possible. Um, I will say like I've been a bit of the vr, ar skeptic over the years. Um. And I think with AI being able to very rapidly create very real situations in those environments. Now that is changing. Like we're at a tipping point and you see like the meta glasses or RayBan glasses and stuff like that.

Like this is not hard to imagine. Very low stakes, uh, simulation environments where you can get reps in and then you can start to take those next steps into actually you, you know, you're less of a risk. Right. Um, to, to Michelle's point. Um, 'cause I do think at the end of the day it does also have to be a real performance at some point.

Um, the, the second thought on that also is I think entrepreneurship is an opportunity for young people to get [00:38:00] some of those reps in as well and then bring professionals in to perhaps like, give feedback, right. Um, on whatever they created. Um. in, in in a very real way. And look, maybe it doesn't start into a business, but you know, the kid just get, getting a, getting a rep, right?

In a very real way. Trying to build a business, trying to, you know, code an AI agent that does something. And then getting real feedback, like these are things that we can actually start to do, um, that maybe are a little less depen or path dependent on the employer sitting alongside and having to get an outcome on the other side.

Um, are, are a couple ideas there.

**Michelle Rhee:** I am, I'm totally with you on the sort of ar, vr, um, I, I'm all like this. I feel like this is the way that we're gonna train folks and one of the things that I have been thinking about, 'cause I've, I've talked to a lot of companies, um. Through, through, uh, equal Opportunity Ventures where I am now. So I talk to founders every day, um, who [00:39:00] have different kinds of solutions.

And I think along these lines of, you know, how do you get the rubs in, uh, what I think is most interesting or has the most potential is when you don't have people sitting in a cave somewhere saying, okay, like, what's an example of some of a, of a scenario that somebody might go through as a teacher or a police officer or a salesperson, right? But now we have the ability to actually gather real data,

right? And so, um, you know, I was talking to somebody the other day about like simulations for teachers, right? Because, um, uh, classroom management and sort of, you know, those, those tough interactions with kids, um, is what kills most. First year teachers like spirits, right?

Is because they can't get their way through those. So could somebody sit there and be like, huh, what are those tough interactions versus like, we now have the ability to gather this [00:40:00] information like real, you know, how often are these kinds of situations happening and when effective teachers are sort of diffusing that situation versus like more ineffective teachers and how are they handling it right?

And, and which ones like produce the outcomes that we want. Like we have so much more ability with technology now to, to to figure out like how do we aggregate that, those real life situations and put them to use in trainings. And I would say from our standpoint, like we're trying to figure out. Who are the founders who are doing that, in what verticals and, um, and how can we like quickly sort of, you know, capitalize those things and, and bring them to market so that we can have just much more effective training programs in place.

**Michael Horn:** Super interesting that, um, you said that, 'cause I, I hadn't thought about this before, but like you imagine some of the apps that took off right during the teacher eval, uh, like the last decade or so, [00:41:00] they have hours and hours and hours of authentic video and audio capturing of those moments, right? Um, like some of them are trained on teacher talk time versus student talk, et cetera, et cetera. Um, and it's designed to give feedback to the teachers actually in the classroom, but could they turn around and build those simulations off that, that's really interesting.

**Michelle Rhee:** Yeah.

**Ela Richmond:** Do you think that that would change the way that people hire too? Um, so like instead of going through a regular job application as they do now, it's like everybody goes through the simulation and you hire the best of the best.

**Michael Horn:** So yes, but with a caveat. Um, and the caveat is, uh, there are some regulations, uh, in, in the us um, that, uh, are very, um, that may wanna make sure there's no bias right in, in terms of certain hiring decisions. I think you could very easily argue that the college degree is actually one of the most biased signals, uh, that we have, um, in, in the economy, but it's been traditionally [00:42:00] interpreted around assessment and that you have to show that it's valid and reliable without, um, disparate impact, which is a pretty high bar to clear on the disparate impact one, um, because there's a lot of factors that go into that, right?

And so I, I, think we need a little bit more evolution of like. We don't wanna be biased and we have to think through how can we give like meaningful task-based, if you will, um, assessments that like you would actually do in this job and, and lower the barriers to employers feeling like that's a valid way to, to, to make choices.

Um, there's a lot of experimentation, but there's a lot of nervousness, I think on the part of hiring managers that I talk to about going all in because of some of those regs.

**Michelle Rhee:** And, and Michael, to your prior point about the way that people get jobs is through networks and connections. I mean, we also see that that is oftentimes how people, um, get promotions and new [00:43:00] opportunities is through those networks and those relationships. We have another portfolio company, um, at our firm called Sigma Squared, and what they're really focused on is working with employers to base decisions off of data on the effectiveness of their workers versus those sort of more relational things and really kind of taking the bias out of of those decisions.

Um, and also another thing that they've, they've done, um, which I think Ella goes to a little bit, what you were talking about is by gathering the data from the employers, they're able to create what they call like the success DNA. Right. What do we know? What, what, what, what do we know about our workers who are most effective, and how can we map that back to, um, what we knew about them before we hired them?

And so can we hire people who are more likely to stay and who are gonna be more likely to be successful, but do that based on the data? And I [00:44:00] think the more we can move to those kinds of systems, um, and, um, I think you're gonna see more sort of equity and, and better, you know, diversity, et cetera, um, uh, across our, our companies, because it's gonna be less sort of, you know, based on relationships and more based on like, what do we actually know about folks?

**Ela Richmond:** Interesting. Um, as you're talking about this though, I'm wondering if there's any issue whenever it comes to, like when you put, for example, um. An intern in a situation that they're not yet comfortable with. Sometimes they don't like it, like they don't enjoy it because of the fact that they're not comfortable with it.

You know? So like, how do we make sure that whenever you do something like a, for example, uh, an assessment in the beginning just to put people in situations that might come up that it's not a deterrent because Right. Like I, I would be curious to hear your take [00:45:00] on this as well, but I've definitely seen, at least among my friends, that they're more motivated to do work that they love, um, more recently than not.

Um, and I, I'm curious if that would be a deterrent at all. So like I've, I've undergone this assessment. I really didn't like a couple of these experiences. Everybody goes through experiences they don't like in a job. Right. Um, so how do you make sure that that's not, not an issue either?

**Michael Horn:** I think it's a great point. So, uh, two, two, um, sets of data points, I guess from you. So the research we did in job moves, the process that came out to help people make progress in their careers focuses a lot on the underlying activities of what you do and where do you get energy and where does it drain energy and being super reflective about that and at different points in your life.

So if you were talking about students right now, like after they do things like, did that drain or drive your energy? And then reality check, there is no perfect job where you get a hundred percent energy drive like it [00:46:00] does. It does not exist. There are trade-offs and elements of suck in every single job. A good job, frankly, from the research is one where you are just over 50%. So roughly 50%, like just wow, it drained my energy. So the second part of that is, um, a, a, a a friend colleague of, of mine, um, and, and, uh, Diane Tavner who, uh, started ran Summit Public Schools for 20 years or something like that. She has a new startup called Future, uh, future Me. And she basically has young people looking through their actual experiences and figuring out like, what do I like doing right? To your point, where do I get energy and where do I not? And then start to understand some of like, okay, so what these patterns in advance. I think one of the biggest tragedies, frankly, of high school right now is that, or I should say conventional high school, I think it's less true in the homeschool community, but that people graduate with no sense of what am I [00:47:00] good at and what do I like doing?

Where do I get energy? Um, and I think it can't be at a surface level like. I like working with people. Okay. Like what about working with people? Do you really like, where are you most in flow? What does that look like? Is it you leading a team huddle? Is it you bouncing ideas off? Like really getting deep into what does that look like? Um, and then starting to find matches off of that. So hopefully that starts to answer a little bit is like, ideally we know more about ourselves before we even get to that simulation, if that makes sense.

**Michelle Rhee:** So I'm wondering if we could go back to something that, that, that, um, we brought up earlier, which is this notion, Michael, you and I talked about this on your podcast, is like, I am hearing more and more that young people are saying that their job is just sort of,

it means to make money so that they can do the things that they wanna do.

And that, I think is very counter to, you know, our generation where we, we thought the ideal thing is to love your job and [00:48:00] be passionate about your job. And I feel like. Nowadays, young people, just, that's, that's not the priority. And I wonder, I, I started writing a, a LinkedIn post on this. I haven't finished it yet, but I'm, I'm wondering whether, uh, that may be a detriment to us in the long run, to have a generation of workers who don't really, aren't really as invested and engaged and passionate about their jobs. Does it, is it fine because, you know, they, they'll be happier people and maybe happier workers, you know, make better workers, that sort of thing? Or is it gonna put us at a disadvantage and make us less, um, innovative and less productive as a country? Because people don't really feel passionately about what they're doing?

I, I'm, I, I really sort of wonder about

this.

**Isaac Morehouse:** I, I'll give a, uh, you know, off the, off the top of the head, hot take, I guess. I think the pendulum swung too far in the, you have to find your greatest passion. You have to do what [00:49:00] you're called to. And it created all this stress and all this worry and kind of made us forget that like one thing that makes people feel fulfilled is just working, is just working hard and feeling good that you put in a hard day's work and even if what you do doesn't seem to be like this lofty vision.

So I think it swung a little too far. It's swinging back, which I think is good. It definitely, and probably will, could swing too far in the other direction. I, but I love though like, 'cause I tend to be on that lofty, find work that you love, find your passion. That's just the way I'm wired. But I always like to try to bring back and like remind myself not to be like judgy or overly highfaluting.

And I always think of this story, Barry Sanders, who I think is the greatest running back ever, he was known for just like crazy juke moves and insane spins and stuff. And somebody asked him once, like, how do you come up with all these moves? Like where does all this come from? He said, I don't know what you're talking about.

Getting tackled hurts really bad. I'm just trying not to get hurt. And it was like, there was nothing amazing about it. [00:50:00] He wasn't like, oh, the art and the grace and I practice dance and I do. He's literally just like, I'm just trying to avoid pain. And the result of him avoiding pain was this masterful,

graceful thing that we all got to watch.

So sometimes like just trying to make a living can actually result in something beautiful and artful as well.

**Michael Horn:** Yeah. I've been thinking about this in terms of the purpose piece, which is like, and, and, and Michelle, like, again, our conversation really sparked me thinking about this, right? And, and looking back at our dataset, and it seemed like some people get purpose through work. Some people work to get purpose outside of work, and some people frankly work to like, try to figure out what is the purpose, right?

Like it's, it's part of a question that they're asking. Um, and so I think like those are three very different sort of answers to the purpose question, which like, I, like, I'm, I'm in the man search for meaning Victor Frankel Camp of the world, but like, um. I think we, we, we shouldn't over index on where it is. And to Michelle's wondering, like I do think there [00:51:00] has to be engagement though. And like what we see right now in the world of work is roughly 70% of individuals say they're completely checked out their

**Michelle Rhee:** Hmm.

**Michael Horn:** Um, 50% are actively looking for something new right now. And there's a whole wor phrase to describe that now quietly quitting.

Right? That's not sustainable either. Um, and so I think we have to find that balance, right? Um, and it will look different for different individuals and I think, and it will look different for different individuals also, different stages of your life, right? Like. I, I, I constantly say this, um, to my wife, 'cause she's like, she, she was in food and and beverage and so forth and she's trying to figure out, like with our kids in, in, in early teens, like, you know, what am I doing?

What's my purpose? Blah, blah, blah. I'm like, clay Christensen, my mentor went back to business school at age 40 with five kids to get a doctorate. And like no one heard of him until like seven years after that. Right? [00:52:00] Life is much longer also than I think we need. And we're like in such a rush to climb the ladder sometimes that we don't take the longer view.

**Ela Richmond:** And does that go back to your point about us needing to redefine the linear aspect of career?

**Michael Horn:** A hundred percent. And school, frankly. Right? Like I was really good at playing the game in school of like, just tell me the hoop and I'm gonna jump through it, um, for the minimal work possible. Um, and then at some point when you get out in the real world, you realize like, oh, life isn't lived on this like. Just ladder that I'm constantly comparing myself to other people. In fact, that's a way to be destined for unhappiness, I think. Um, and so yes, I think it's less linear at all. Stages would be a healthier thing for, for, for, for all of us.

**Ela Richmond:** So you were saying that, um, my, this is my last question before I hit y'all with a couple of rapid fire questions, but, um, you were saying that young people today jump between jobs quite [00:53:00] frequently and also young people today are not the most satisfied by their jobs or fulfilled. Maybe, maybe they're doing it for other purposes.

Um. I'm curious how, how that all relates. Like why are they jumping right? If they're not seeking their job to be their fulfillment?

**Michael Horn:** I guess my quick answer, and then I'm sure Isaac and Michelle have a take, but from, from our data, like people, it's not necessarily a drive for. Purpose, but it is a drive for progress in their lives. And so if you were just getting beaten up, destroyed, like dead end manager micromanaging you, whatever, like set of pushes, right? Can't pay the bills. You know what, what? Struggling for time with my kids, whatever it might be, those are like really big pushes that cause someone to say, wow, I need to start looking for something different, right? And so in our data set of, um, thousands of individuals who switch, there's 14 [00:54:00] different pushes that sort of occur.

And when three to five of them are present, that's when people are really actively looking for, for the next thing. And they switch to make progress, but they're not seeking perfection. None of us are. And I will tell you a lot of the people who switch, because they didn't understand what progress looked like for them, they wind up right back in the same situation that they were. Not making the progress that they desired, if that makes sense. So, and we can see this data again, really clearly. In the great resignation, a hundred million people left their jobs in two years in the United States, 75% of them within six months regretted the move. And

**Michelle Rhee:** Hmm.

**Michael Horn:** I think it's just 'cause like, we actually haven't really thought about what's progress and we're almost so hyped up on, we just gotta get the job that like we, we, we'll say anything about our past experience and what we like just to get it.

And then we find ourselves in and we're like, oh man, this isn't helping me.

**Isaac Morehouse:** I, I have a, I have a [00:55:00] hypothesis or a guess. I have no validation for this. I'm not, I don't have all the great research back. Could be like Michael does, but an observation and a, and a, I guess a question. I remember when we were running Praxis, there was a certain type of person who was amazing at the job hunt, the part of trying to win an apprenticeship, and they would end up with a whole bunch of offers and they didn't wanna take any of

them. And I used to say like, don't let, don't let options blind you to opportunity this idea that once I say yes to one, then I can't do any of the other ones. Now I'm, I'm locked in. And they didn't want, they liked having all these, Theo, theoretically I could do 10 things, but the minute I choose one, I can't do those other nine anymore.

And I, and I wonder if just I. We're having to try to relearn the ability to, uh, stick with something and, and say sometimes doing one thing concretely, even if it's not the perfect thing, is better and sticking with it until we get through the dip and come into the good [00:56:00] part. Because we are in a world where like, I can customize this.

None of us watch the same TV shows at night. None of us listened to the same music during the day. We all used to just have to take what was given. There was three options and we're so used to, I don't like this song. Immediately skip it 10 seconds in. That's not a bad thing, but it makes it harder for us in other areas.

I've seen this with my son. He is, had some jobs where he is been like, that's it. I'm gonna put in my two weeks. I'll just ask him a few questions and eventually he'll be like, well, maybe I'll wait a little longer. And then a month later he'll be like, I'm so glad I stuck with it. I'm finally getting it. I love this job.

Now, sometimes two months later, he hates it again. But the the, the reward for sticking through, and again, I feel crazy saying this 'cause I'm the guy that wrote articles all the time about how you should leave the bad situation and get out of the job that's sucking your soul and drop outta college if you hate it. But I do think there is a little bit of sticktuitiveness that gets lost in a, in an culture full of options.

**Michael Horn:** I'm in violent agreement with, uh, with [00:57:00] what? With what you just said there. Um, I, I will say I think we also need to teach people how to make trade-offs. and to get their highest priorities, if that makes sense. And not see it as settling, but like, again, there's gonna be an element of suck in anything you do.

It's just, just life. But you choose the thing that's gonna suck so that you get the thing that you're most prioritizing at that moment in time. We never talk about that. Um, we, we imagine a friction free environment, which Isaac, to your point, there's certain parts of our lives where we've created that, but it's not life in general.

**Isaac Morehouse:** Hey, and everybody has nostalgia for Blockbuster too. We all kind of have fatigue on, uh, streaming. Too many movies to choose from. You know,

**Ela Richmond:** No, exactly. Okay. My final question, I'm gonna hit y'all all with quick. The first answer that comes to your head, y'all are all parents. From the parent perspective, um, what is your best advice for a parent becoming an open education designer for their kid and helping them to go [00:58:00] through this line of K 12 to career?

**Michael Horn:** Wow.

**Isaac Morehouse:** All right. I'm gonna drop something. Just kind of a funny little thing. What if you know when your kid gets a great report card or they, they get a, a recognition or a ribbon at a sport? You hang it on the fridge, you hang it on the wall. What if them getting someone other than family to pay them their first dollar for something, for anything was treated with that same level of pride like a restaurant does Hang that first dollar on the wall, you got somebody to pay you a dollar for some value you created for them.

I think that's a really fun question to think about getting them thinking career and entrepreneurially early.

**Michelle Rhee:** I am gonna say something that we were literally just talking about, which is I think that for many women of my generation who are working moms, we had that sort of like working mom guilt. And so when we did spend time with our kids, we wanted to make everything so like frictionless, right?

[00:59:00] Like make sure that I'm doing everything for them.

And I, I think that when we do that as parents, we do a disservice to our kids. Um, the, the research is very clear that kids who have to go through hard things and figure it out and, uh, there is actually a lot of friction in their lives that they have to muster their way through are much more successful in the long run.

And so I'd say like letting go of like all that working parent guilt stuff and letting your kids do hard stuff.

**Michael Horn:** I kind of want to just leave it there. That was such a good answer. Is that a cop out of my partner? Could I just say what Michelle said?

**Ela Richmond:** Nope. We'll let you say what do That Let's do that.

**Isaac Morehouse:** Mic drop on

**Ela Richmond:** Yeah,

**Michael Horn:** Yeah.

**Ela Richmond:** the perfect note to end it on. Thank you both so much for coming on the podcast and this was such a cool conversation.

**Michael Horn:** you.

**Michelle Rhee:** so much for having us.

[01:00:00]
