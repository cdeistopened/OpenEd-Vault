# Why We're Blaming the Wrong Thing for Our Kids' Anxiety

I was sitting across from Dr. Peter Gray during our podcast recording when he said something that stopped me cold. Not because it was complicated or new, but because it was so simple—and because it contradicted nearly everything I'd been assuming as a parent for years.

"Eighty-three percent of anxious teens cite one specific cause of their stress," he said calmly. "And it's not social media."

I had to ask him to repeat it.

Dr. Peter Gray is a biopsychologist and author of "Free to Learn," a book that's been foundational for anyone questioning the way we educate and parent. What he's discovered through decades of research is both surprising and deeply hopeful—but first, you have to understand the actual timeline of this crisis.

## The Crisis We're Ignoring

Here's what most people don't know: the rise in anxiety and depression among young people didn't start in 2010. It didn't start with TikTok or Instagram. It's been happening since the 1950s.

By 1990, rates of anxiety and depression among young people were 5-8 times higher than they were in 1950. That's not a recent phenomenon. That's 40 years of gradual decline.

But here's the part nobody talks about: between 1990 and 2000, those rates actually got better. Kids' mental health improved. Significantly. And then they leveled off from 2000-2010, only to spike again after 2010.

"We all notice when things bad happen," Peter told me, "but we tend to ignore when something good happens."

So we have a mystery on our hands: What made kids better in the 1990s? And what made them worse again starting around 2010?

## The Liberation That Was Computers

This is where the story gets interesting. Between 1950 and 1990, childhood changed completely. School expanded (by 5 weeks annually). Homework became standard (it didn't exist in the 1950s). Organized sports replaced free play. Television brought kids indoors. Families got smaller. Houses got bigger.

Every single change? It eliminated children's freedom. They had no space to play, explore, fail, or figure things out on their own.

Then computers arrived.

By the early 1990s, most teenagers had access to computers. By mid-decade, they had internet. And suddenly—kids had a new way to escape adult control. They could play games, explore, interact with peers without adults watching.

"Computer games are real play, people," Peter said, directly challenging the panic many parents feel about screen time. "Adults wanna demonize them, but that's not the science."

The research is clear: kids who played computer games in the 1990s were doing better psychologically than kids who didn't. This wasn't addiction or avoidance—it was liberation. For a decade, kids had freedom again.

## The Social Media Scapegoat

Fast forward to 2010. Mental health starts declining again. Smartphones become ubiquitous. Social media explodes. And suddenly, we have our villain.

Except the data doesn't support it.

There have been hundreds of studies examining the correlation between social media and mental health decline. They show no meaningful connection. Some show slight positive effects. Some show slight negative effects. Overall? They cancel out.

But here's the smoking gun: the United States and the UK are the only two developed countries that experienced this recent mental health spike. Europe adopted smartphones and social media just as quickly. Kids in France, Germany, Spain—they're on TikTok and Instagram just as much as American kids.

Yet mental health in the European Union actually improved during the same period when it worsened in the US.

"So we, as a culture, would far rather blame social media than blame school," Peter said. "School has a halo around it."

## The Real Stressor

When teenagers are asked what's causing their anxiety and stress, 83% cite school.

Not TikTok. Not their peers. School.

Every summer when school ends, teen mental health improves. Every fall when school starts, it gets worse. This pattern repeats annually. During COVID lockdowns, when schools closed, mental health improved across the board. It only got worse again when kids returned to in-person school.

Peter calls this pattern consistent with one conclusion: "School is a direct cause of anxiety and depression."

This isn't because teachers are bad or schools are mean. It's structural. Kids are constantly being judged, assessed, compared. They internalize the message that their grades = their worth. We've created a system where failure feels existential.

## What Actually Matters

The purpose of childhood, according to Peter's research in evolutionary biology, is simple: becoming increasingly independent. Kids need freedom to fail, to problem-solve, to interact with peers without adults orchestrating every moment.

Instead, we've done the opposite. We've scheduled every hour, monitored every activity, turned parenting into an active job of optimization instead of a relationship.

But here's the hopeful part: kids in self-directed education environments—where they follow their own interests and solve their own problems—show better outcomes than kids in traditional school. They're happier, more capable, more resilient.

The solution isn't restricting technology. It's giving kids back the freedom we took away.
