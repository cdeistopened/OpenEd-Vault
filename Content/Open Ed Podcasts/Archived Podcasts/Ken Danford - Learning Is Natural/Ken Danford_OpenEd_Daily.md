# When “Just Stop Going to School” Is Actually the Plan

The former teacher who helps kids walk out—without burning bridges. PLUS: learning centers replacing transcripts with portfolios.

Greetings!

Ken Danford spent six years teaching eighth grade, read *The Teenage Liberation Handbook*, and promptly resigned to help teens leave school. We unpack his playbook in today’s episode; here’s your TL;DR.

Let's dive in.

**THOUGHT**: What Happens If Your Teen Simply Stops Going?  
**TREND**: Learning Centers > Letter Grades  
**TOOL**: North Star & the Liberated Learners Network

# What Happens If Your Teen Simply Stops Going?

Ken’s first line to a miserable student isn’t “hang in there.” It’s “Have you considered not going to school?” Then he backs it with an exit ramp: file a homeschooling plan, use North Star as your headquarters, keep a weekly advisory to stay on track, and rebuild a life around interests, jobs, college classes, or rest. He isn’t pitching a theory—he has three decades of teens who traded hall passes for autonomy and still showed up to community college, trades, or UMass when they were ready.

The part parents inhale and replay: “There’s no such thing as falling behind. You can learn something today or tomorrow.” Ken watched straight-A kids implode under the myth that missing a chapter of algebra at 14 ruins adulthood. His frame flips the risk: the real danger is staying in systems that make your kid sick. When a student looks at him like he’s speaking forbidden magic, he knows he’s doing his job.

# Learning Centers > Letter Grades

North Star sparked a movement of unschooling hubs that function more like coworking spaces for teens than classrooms. The Liberated Learners network now includes Launchpad (NY), Compass (VA), Lighthouse (NYC), and microsites sprouting up in Texas, Oregon, and the UK. Their offering is remarkably consistent: flexible drop-in hours, à la carte classes, community college partnerships, and advisories focused on portfolios, not report cards.

This syncs with a broader shift. Mastery Transcript Consortium schools, My Tech High, and even public districts piloting learner profiles are replacing GPA fetishism with evidence of work. Parents who once clung to weighted grades now screenshot micro-credentials, internship logs, and the “here’s what I built” videos their teens create at these centers. Colleges are catching up—unschoolers are showing up with competency snapshots, and admissions offices are saying yes because the signal is clearer than a string of seat-time credits.

# North Star & the Liberated Learners Network

If school is breaking your kid and you don’t want to DIY the entire solution, start with Ken’s map:

- **North Star (MA)** — in-person hub with 50–60 teens, weekly advisories, and a culture of “we’re not in charge of you.”
- **Liberated Learners** — directory + consulting for launching similar centers: https://liberatedlearners.net
- **North Star resources** — sample homeschooling plans, GED timelines, community college partnerships, Ken’s book *Learning Is Natural, School Is Optional*, and his TED Talk.

No North Star nearby? Steal the model: treat school like a community center if it still supplies friendships, or build a patchwork week from youth orchestras, jobs, volunteering, outschool classes, and grandparents. Pair it with a weekly check-in (Ken’s advisors spend 5–40 minutes reviewing the plan) so freedom doesn’t feel like free fall. And remember his parting encouragement: if your gut says something is wrong, you’re probably right. Your kid’s refusal is healthy data. Listen to it.

That's all for today!
