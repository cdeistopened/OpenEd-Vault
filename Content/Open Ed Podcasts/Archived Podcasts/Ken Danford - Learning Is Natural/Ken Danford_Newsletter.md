# Your Teen Can Quit School (and Still Win)
*Preview: Former teacher Ken Danford shows exactly how teens leave school legally. PLUS: learning centers replacing GPA culture.*

Greetings!

Ken Danford spent six years teaching eighth grade, cracked [*The Teenage Liberation Handbook*](https://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Liberation-Handbook-Without-School/dp/0962959170), and resigned to help teens leave school. Thirty years later, his center is busy proving “falling behind” is a myth. Today’s episode breaks down his playbook—here’s the TL;DR.

Let’s dive in.

**THOUGHT:** School Is Optional, Misery Isn’t Required  
**TREND:** Learning Centers Replacing Transcripts  
**TOOL:** North Star & the Liberated Learners Network

## School Is Optional, Misery Isn’t Required
Ken’s opening line to a miserable student is, “Have you considered not going to school?” No drama, no loopholes. File a homeschooling plan, plug into [North Star](https://northstarteens.org), meet with an advisor once a week, rebuild the week around interests, jobs, community college—or rest. Three decades of alumni later, he’s still watching teens walk out, catch their breath, and re-engage when learning matters again.

Parents rewatch this part on loop: “There’s no such thing as falling behind. You can learn something today or tomorrow.” The real risk isn’t leaving school; it’s staying in a system that makes your kid sick and calling it resilience.

## Learning Centers Replacing Transcripts
North Star’s hub-and-advisory model now fuels [Liberated Learners](https://liberatedlearners.net) sites from Launchpad (NY) to Compass (VA) to Lighthouse (NYC). They look more like teen coworking spaces than classrooms: flexible drop-in hours, à la carte classes, community college partnerships, portfolios instead of GPAs.

The shift matches a broader trend. Mastery Transcript Consortium schools, My Tech High, and even public districts piloting learner profiles are moving from seat-time credits to evidence of work—micro-credentials, internship logs, “here’s what I built” videos. Admissions officers aren’t panicking. They’re bored of inflated report cards. Portfolios are a clearer signal.

## North Star & the Liberated Learners Network
- **North Star (MA):** Ken’s flagship center—weekly advisories, 50–60 teens, zero compulsory anything.
- **Liberated Learners:** Directory + support for launching similar hubs.
- **DIY Playbook:** Treat school like a community center if the friendships still matter, or build a patchwork week from youth theater, jobs, volunteering, online classes, sports, and grandparents. Pair it with a weekly check-in so freedom doesn’t feel like free fall.

Ken’s parting shot: if your gut says something is wrong, you’re probably right. Celebrate the squeaky wheel—it’s your kid refusing self-sabotage. School is optional. Learning isn’t.

That’s all for today!
