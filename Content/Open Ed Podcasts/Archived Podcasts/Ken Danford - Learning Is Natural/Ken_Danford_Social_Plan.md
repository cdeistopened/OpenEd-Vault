**Primary Post - Option 1: "The Observation Post"**

```
One pattern I've noticed in miserable teens:

They don't hate learning.
They hate school.

After 30 years running North Star, I've met hundreds of kids ages 11-18 who:
• Got straight A's but refused to go
• Had anxiety, self-harm, hospitalization
• Were autistic, LGBTQ, bullied, non-conformist
• Just couldn't understand why they had to waste their lives until 18

Here's what happened when they left school:

They came to our center (not a school—more like a YMCA for teens).
They chose their own classes.
They had weekly advisor check-ins.
They could come and go as they pleased.
They used community college, got GEDs, found jobs, learned trades.

Most importantly? They stopped being miserable.

The question isn't "Are kids ready for autonomy?"
The question is: "Why do we think forcing kids to sit still for 13 years is normal?"

Because here's the truth: Almost nobody likes going to school.

Even honor roll kids can't wait for vacation.
Even "successful" students are stressed and anxious.
Even kids with friends would rather be in charge of their own time.

So why do we act like school is the only option?

It's not.

At North Star in Massachusetts, we've spent 30 years helping families discover what happens when you stop trying to make school work and start letting kids live.

Not everybody needs to leave school.
But everybody could.

**Primary Post - Option 2: "Flipping the Question"**

```
"Are kids really ready for that much autonomy?"

Wrong question.

Ken Danford flipped the question on me in our latest podcast:

"Why would you consider the kookiness of school to be normal and asking kids what they want to learn to be abnormal? That's insane."

He's been running North Star—a self-directed learning center for teens—for 30 YEARS.

Here's what happens when you stop forcing kids to go to school:

❌ They DON'T fall behind
❌ They DON'T become lazy
❌ They DON'T lose all structure

✅ They DO get their GEDs
✅ They DO go to community college (and UMass, and even Amherst College)
✅ They DO get jobs
✅ They DO become healthy, self-aware adults

But most importantly?

They stop being miserable.

Because here's what Ken knows after 30 years:

"How many people like going to school? Almost nobody likes going to school."

Even the straight-A students.
Even the kids with friends.
Even the "successful" ones who manage it fine.

They all can't wait to be done with school.

So Ken built something different:
• A physical space (not a school)
• Weekly advisor check-ins (not teachers)
• Classes to choose from (not requirements)
• The freedom to come and go (not bells and attendance)

For the 70% of families who wouldn't homeschool without support, this changes everything.

Because the problem isn't your kid.
It's that we've normalized an abnormal system.

**Primary Post - Option 3: "The Story-Based Post"**

```
The night Ken Danford read the Teenage Liberation Handbook changed hundreds of lives.

It was fall 1995. He'd been teaching for 6 years.

His friend Joshua kept telling him to read this book about homeschooling.
Ken kept refusing.

Then one particularly lousy day at school, he finally picked it up.

What he discovered:

Kids were leaving school.
Not going to different schools.
Just... not going.

And they were fine.
Actually, they were more than fine.
They were learning what they wanted, going as far as they wanted, living better lives.

Ken and Joshua quit their teaching jobs.

Their plan: Help all the kids they'd been "tormenting in school" leave school and start learning on their own terms.

That was 30 years ago.

Today, North Star serves 50-60 teens at a time in Massachusetts.

The model is simple:

Parents write a homeschool plan.
Kids come to the center when they want.
They choose classes, work with tutors, meet with advisors weekly.
They use it like adults use a gym—as much or as little as they need.

No one takes attendance.
No one assigns homework.
No one is "in charge of" the kids.

And you know what?

After 30 years, Ken has seen these kids:
• Get their GEDs
• Attend community college
• Go to 4-year universities (including Amherst, where he went)
• Learn trades
• Start businesses
• Become healthy, centered adults

But most importantly, they spent ages 12-18 NOT miserable.

Because Ken's right:

"Who likes going to school? It's really kind of sad."

The same kids who hate school love their camps, their sports, their theater.
They cry when those things end.

North Star kids cry about snow days. "Why are we closed? We could have gotten there."

That's the difference between forced schooling and chosen learning.

🎙️ Listen to the full conversation with Ken Danford—30 years of proof that school is optional.

```

**Primary Post - Option 4: "Challenging Common Beliefs"**

```
"There's no such thing as falling behind."

Ken Danford has been saying this for 30 years.

And after working with hundreds of teens who left school, he's got the receipts.

Because here's what actually happens when a 13-year-old "falls behind":

They can learn it at 14.
Or 15.
Or 16.
Or never, if it's not relevant to their life.

You can always learn stuff tomorrow.
You can run home right now and learn it today.

The idea that there's a "right time" to learn algebra?
Or that missing 9th grade English means you're doomed?

That's not education.
That's an assembly line.

At North Star (the self-directed learning center Ken founded), kids:

• Leave school at 12, 13, 14, 15
• Spend 2-3 years deschooling, exploring, finding themselves
• Pick up their GED when they're ready
• Start community college at 15, 16, 17
• Go to 4-year colleges (or don't)
• Learn trades (or don't)
• Live their lives on their own timeline

Most common outcome after 30 years?

A kid who was miserable and refusing to go to 8th grade becomes a healthy 19-year-old going to UMass, working at Walmart, with a driver's license and friends and confidence.

"It all matters. The spacious time they had with us matters. The support for moving at their own pace matters."

The alternative?

Force them to "catch up."
Force them to "get on grade level."
Force them to prove they're not falling behind.

Until they actually fall apart.

School creates the crisis.
Then blames the kid.

Ken's been offering a different path for 30 years:

Stop going to school.
Start living.
Learn what you want, when you're ready.

It's not radical.
It's just honest about how humans actually learn.

**Primary Post - Option 5: "The Hard Truth Post"**

```
Hard pill to swallow:

Your kid doesn't have a school problem.
School has a kid problem.

Ken Danford (30 years running a self-directed learning center for teens):

"How many people like going to school? Almost nobody."

Think about that.

Not the kids who are "failing."
Not the kids who are "struggling."

ALL kids.

Even the ones with straight A's.
Even the ones with great friend groups.
Even the ones who "manage it just fine."

Ask them: "Should we cancel vacation and keep school open year-round?"

They look at you like you're from Mars.

Because they ALL can't wait to be in charge of their own time.
They ALL can't wait to learn what they want, their way.
They ALL can't wait to be done with school.

So why do we act like it's normal?
Why do we act like it's necessary?

Ken's been proving for 30 years it's not.

70% of families at North Star wouldn't be homeschooling without his center.

These aren't "homeschool types."
They're regular families with 3-4 kids.
The other kids are fine in school.
Parents are busy.
Some are single parents.

But one kid is miserable.

So they leave.

And what happens?

• Weekly advisor check-ins (not therapy, just check-ins)
• Classes to choose from (theater, math, hiking, cooking)
• Community of 50-60 other teens
• Freedom to come and go
• Support to use community college, get GEDs, find jobs

Most common result?

A kid who was anxious, depressed, refusing to go to 8th grade...

Becomes a healthy 19-year-old at UMass with a job and friends and confidence.

"The spacious time they had with us matters."

So here's the uncomfortable truth:

The problem isn't that your kid can't handle school.
The problem is we've normalized a system that almost nobody actually likes.

And Ken's message after 30 years?

You don't have to fix it.
You don't have to find a better school.

You can just stop.

### Instagram Strategy

**Post 1: Reel - "I Don't Want to Be in Charge of You" (60s)**

**Video:** Ken explaining the first meeting with kids at North Star

**Caption:**
```
"I don't want to be in charge of you."

This is what Ken Danford tells every teen who walks into North Star for the first time.

And they do a double take.

Wait, what?

Because they thought they were being dragged to another school.
Another principal.
Another place telling them what to do.

Instead:

"You can come here whenever you want.
You can leave whenever you want.
You can have your phone.
You can have your food.
Leave me alone.
You can use us just as you please."

For most kids, no one has ever said this to them before.

Some say "thank God."
Some sit up straighter.
Some look at their parents like "really?"

It's like Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
Or The Matrix.

An accommodation moment—when you have to make a new bucket in your brain for something you didn't have a category for before.

Ken's been running North Star in Massachusetts for 30 years.

Hundreds of teens who were miserable in school have walked through those doors.

They left school.
They found community.
They chose their own learning.
They became healthy adults.

Not because someone forced them.
Because someone finally stopped trying to control them.

Ken Danford quit teaching in 1995 after reading the Teenage Liberation Handbook.

30 years later, he's helped hundreds of teens leave school and live better lives.

Here's what he's learned 👆

The most important one?

"You are born ready for that autonomy."

After school and in summer, parents ask kids:
Want to go to this camp?
Want piano lessons?
Want to try this sport?

We live in a culture where asking people if they want to do stuff is normal.

So why is asking kids what they want to learn considered radical?

"Schooling is the abnormal thing. Why would you consider the kookiness of school to be normal and asking kids what they want to learn to be abnormal? That's insane."

**Post 3: Reel - "Your Kid Isn't Broken" (45s)**

**Video:** Ken's passionate rant about kids standing up for themselves

**Caption:**
```
"Your kid doesn't want to do the things they're being asked to do in the way they're being asked to do them.

The problem is most likely not your child."

— Ken Danford, 30 years running North Star

If your kid is:
• Refusing to go to school
• Anxious every morning
• "Falling behind"
• Just doesn't fit

Good for them.

"That's what we want—for your kid to stand up for themselves. Let's see that as your kid standing up for themselves as a healthy first step."

After 30 years, Ken has seen:

• Straight-A students who couldn't take it anymore
• Kids with anxiety and self-harm
• Autistic kids, LGBTQ kids, bullied kids
• Artists, musicians, outdoorsy types
• Non-conformists who just couldn't see the point until age 18

And you know what they all had in common?

They weren't broken.
The system was.

When they left school and came to North Star:
✅ They chose their own classes
✅ They met with advisors weekly
✅ They came and went as they pleased
✅ They got GEDs, went to college, learned trades
✅ They became healthy, centered adults

"Your kid is probably healthy and right."

### Twitter/X Strategy

**Launch Thread:**

```
🧵 After 30 years running a self-directed learning center for teens, Ken Danford has one message for parents:

School is optional.

Not "find a better school."
Not "fix this school."

Just stop going.

Here's what he's learned:
(1/12)

In 1995, Ken was a teacher.

His friend kept telling him to read the Teenage Liberation Handbook.

Ken kept refusing.

One lousy day, he finally picked it up.

And discovered: Kids were leaving school and having BETTER lives.

So Ken quit teaching.
(2/12)

Ken and his friend Joshua started North Star in Massachusetts.

The idea: Help kids leave school and learn on their own terms.

But most families can't homeschool alone.

So they built a community center.
(3/12)

North Star operates like a YMCA:

• Open certain hours
• Kids come and go as they please
• Classes to choose from (theater, math, hiking, cooking)
• Weekly advisor check-ins
• 50-60 teens in the community

No attendance.
No grades.
No one "in charge" of you.
(4/12)

When kids first visit, Ken tells them:

"I don't want to be in charge of you. You can come here whenever you want. You can leave whenever you want. You can have your phone. You can have your food. Leave me alone."

Most kids have never heard this before.
(5/12)

Ken's first question when I asked about autonomy:

"You are born ready for that autonomy. What kind of question is that?"

Then he flipped it:

"Why would you consider the kookiness of school to be normal and asking kids what they want to learn to be abnormal? That's insane."
(6/12)

Here's Ken's observation after 30 years:

"How many people like going to school? Almost nobody."

Not just the struggling kids.

Even the straight-A students.
Even the kids with great friends.

They ALL can't wait to be done with school.
(7/12)

About 70% of North Star families wouldn't be homeschooling without the center.

These aren't "homeschool types."

They're busy parents with 3-4 kids.
The other kids are fine in school.
Some are single parents.

But one kid is miserable.

So they leave.
(8/12)

What happens to these kids?

• Most use community college starting at 15-17
• They get their GEDs (which lets them do anything a HS grad can do)
• Some go to 4-year colleges (even Amherst, where Ken went)
• Some learn trades
• All become healthy, centered adults
(9/12)

Ken's advice if there's no North Star near you:

OPTION 1: Stay in school for the social value. Let your kid get bad grades. Don't stress. Eventually they'll drop out, get a GED, go to community college if they want.

Use it as a community center until you can't.
(10/12)

OPTION 2: Leave school. Homeschool with Outschool classes, volunteer work, after-school activities.

"Go work with animals at the vet once a week. Work at the senior center. Volunteer at the library. Build the best life you can. Stop worrying about school."
(11/12)

Three rapid-fire answers from Ken:

Q: Why is there no such thing as falling behind?
A: "You can learn stuff tomorrow or today. I didn't do it when everybody else did it, so now I lose? Shut up."

**Tweet A:**
```
"I don't want to be in charge of you."

This is what Ken Danford tells every teen who walks into North Star.

After 30 years, he's helped hundreds of miserable school kids become healthy adults.

Not by controlling them.
By finally stopping.

**Tweet D:**
```
The same kids who hate going to school love their summer camps.

They cry when those things end.

Ken Danford built something kids cry about when it's CLOSED.

North Star kids complain about snow days: "Why are we closed? We could have gotten there."

That's the difference.
```

### Facebook Strategy

**Post 1: Emotional Story Angle**

```
"Something's wrong."

You know it as a parent.

Your kid is miserable.
They're anxious every morning.
They're refusing to go.
Or they're going—getting straight A's—but you can see it's killing them.

And everyone tells you:
"Try this school."
"Get a tutor."
"Maybe they need therapy."
"Just push through."

But Ken Danford has a different message:

"You're right. Something's wrong. Your kid doesn't want to do the things they're being asked to do in the way they're being asked to do them.

The problem is most likely not your child."

Ken has been running North Star—a self-directed learning center for teens—for 30 YEARS.

He's met hundreds of kids ages 11-18 who were miserable in school.

Some were getting straight A's.
Some were having anxiety, self-harm, hospitalization.
Some were autistic, LGBTQ, bullied, just didn't fit.

And here's what he tells their parents:

"Your kid is probably healthy and right. Good for them for being a squeaky wheel. That's what we want—for your kid to stand up for themselves."

When these kids leave school and come to North Star:

✅ They choose their own classes (theater, math, hiking, cooking)
✅ They meet with an advisor weekly
✅ They come and go as they please
✅ They get GEDs, go to community college, learn trades
✅ They become healthy, centered, self-aware adults

Most importantly?

They spend ages 12-18 NOT miserable.

And Ken's seen this work for 30 years.

"The spacious time they had with us matters. The support for moving at their own pace matters. How could it not impact the rest of their lives that they didn't hit rock bottom and stay there?"

If your kid is struggling, Ken's encouragement:

"Your kid is probably healthy and right."

**Post 2: Data + Permission**

```
Ken Danford asked me a question that stopped me in my tracks:

"Why would you consider the kookiness of school to be normal and asking kids what they want to learn to be abnormal?"

After 30 years running North Star (a self-directed learning center for teens), he's seen hundreds of kids leave school.

Here's what happened:

📊 70% wouldn't have homeschooled without North Star's support
📊 Most common path: Leave school → Get GED → Community college → 4-year college or trades
📊 Even kids who go to Amherst College (where Ken went)
📊 ALL became healthier than they were in school

Most importantly?

Ken's observation after 30 years:

"How many people like going to school? Almost nobody."

Not just the "struggling" kids.

Even the straight-A students.
Even the kids with great friends.
Even the "successful" ones.

Ask them: "Should we cancel vacation and keep school year-round?"

They look at you like you're from Mars.

Because they ALL can't wait to be in charge of their own time.

So here's Ken's radical message:

School is optional.

Not "find a better school."
Not "make this school work."

Just... stop.

And for the 70% of families who can't do it alone:

Find (or build) community.

```
Ken was recently interviewed on the OpenEd podcast about the North Star model and self-directed learning for teens.

If you've ever wanted to understand how North Star works—or share it with families considering alternatives to school—this is a great resource.

**🎬 Short Video Clips:**

I've also created 6-8 short clips (30-90 seconds each) that you can share individually. These are great for social media. I'll send you the links when they're ready.

Top clips:
1. "I don't want to be in charge of you" (first meeting with teens)
2. "Why do you think school is normal?" (flipping the autonomy question)
3. "There's no such thing as falling behind"
4. "Who likes going to school? Almost nobody."

Please let me know if you'd like me to adjust any of this messaging, or if you'd like graphics/images to go with your posts.

Thank you again for the incredible conversation!

Best,
Ela

P.S. If there are specific Facebook groups, email lists, or community spaces where this would be valuable to share, let me know and I'm happy to provide specific copy for those audiences.

### Comment Ken Can Leave on OpenEd Posts

```
Thanks for having me, Ela! After 30 years at North Star, I'm still passionate about helping families discover that school is optional. If anyone has questions about self-directed learning or the Liberated Learners network, feel free to reach out.

## Ela's Personal LinkedIn Post

```
I asked Ken Danford if kids are really ready for autonomy.

He stopped me.

"You are born ready for that autonomy. What kind of question is that?"

Then he flipped it:

"After school and in the summer, parents ask kids—do you want to go to this camp? Piano lessons? This sport?

We live in a culture where asking people if they want to do stuff is normal.

So why would you consider the kookiness of school to be normal and asking kids what they want to learn to be abnormal?

That's insane."

Ken has been running North Star—a self-directed learning center for teens in Massachusetts—for 30 YEARS.

He's seen hundreds of kids ages 11-18 leave school.

Some were getting straight A's.
Some had anxiety, self-harm, hospitalization.
Some were autistic, LGBTQ, bullied, non-conformist.
All were miserable.

When they came to North Star:
✅ They chose their own classes
✅ They met with advisors weekly
✅ They came and went as they pleased
✅ They got GEDs, went to college, learned trades
✅ They became healthy adults

And here's what Ken observed:

"How many people like going to school? Almost nobody."

Not just the struggling kids.

Even the honor roll students.
Even the kids with friends.

They all can't wait to be done.

So why do we act like school is the only option?

Ken's been proving for 30 years it's not.

## Final Notes

This episode has strong potential for:

1. **Viral clip performance** - "I don't want to be in charge of you" and "school is normal?" moments
2. **Deep engagement** - Parents will comment with their own stories
3. **Permission-giving** - Many parents need to hear "it's okay to stop"
4. **Network effect** - Ken's 30-year network + Liberated Learners amplification

**Priority:**

Make it EXTREMELY easy for Ken to share. His network is the goldmine here—30 years of families, Liberated Learners centers, homeschool community connections.

**Monitor:**

Comments for parents asking "what do I do next?" Have response template ready with:
1. Find local Liberated Learners center
2. Connect with homeschool community
3. Read Teenage Liberation Handbook
4. Start with Ken's book: "Learning is Natural, School is Optional"

**Opportunity:**

This could be a pillar episode for the "School Is Optional" narrative. Consider:
- Running as paid ad creative targeting "homeschool" and "struggling teen" audiences
- Creating lead magnet: "The School Is Optional Starter Guide"
- Building out "Self-Directed Learning" as a content series
- Partnering with Liberated Learners for co-marketing

**Unique Angle:**

Ken has 30 YEARS of data. This isn't theory—it's proof. Lean into that credibility hard.
