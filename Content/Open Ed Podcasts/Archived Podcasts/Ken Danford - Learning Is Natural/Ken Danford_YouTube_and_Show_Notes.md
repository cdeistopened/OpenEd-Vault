# Ken Danford — YouTube & Show Notes

## Final YouTube Package
- **Primary Title:** What Happens If My Teen Simply Stops Going to School?
- **Thumbnail Text:** "You can leave. Today."

### Cold Open (Final Cut)
**Ken Danford:** Kids show up thinking their parents dragged them to another principal. I sit down and say, "I’m sorry you’re miserable. Have you ever considered not going to school?" ~~They do a funny look.~~ I tell them, "We’re not a school. I’m not in charge of you. Come when you want, leave when you want. Keep your phone, keep your snacks." Nobody has ever said that to them. They look at their parents like, "This existed while I was stuck in algebra?"

**Ela Richmond:** And what about “falling behind”?

**Ken Danford:** There’s no such thing. You can learn something today or tomorrow. Missing the moment everyone else learned it doesn’t doom you. That idea is nonsense.

## Notes for Production

- Use the primary title plus thumbnail quote; alternate titles available for A/B tests.
- Chapters are timed to the polished transcript and can be pasted into YouTube/Spotify metadata.
