# What Happens When a Teacher Tells Teens to Stop Going to School

*By Ela Richmond*

When I scheduled a podcast with Ken Danford, I expected a measured conversation about alternative education. What I got was a former public-school teacher who now spends his life inviting teens to quit school—and helping families make that decision without panic.

Ken doesn’t hedge. “Have you considered not going?” is the first thing he tells a miserable student. Then he backs it up with a plan. The plan has been running for nearly 30 years.

## From Eighth-Grade Hallways to Unschool Headquarters

Ken was six years into teaching eighth-grade U.S. history when a fellow teacher, Joshua Hornick, pushed a copy of *The Teenage Liberation Handbook* into his hands. He ignored it—until the day he couldn’t. One particularly infuriating afternoon in 1995, Ken opened the book, expecting fringe theory. Instead, he found case studies of teens who had left school, learned on their own terms, and turned out fine. Better than fine. They learned what interested them, went deep, and built adult lives without the anxiety spiral of GPA culture.

The realization hit him instantly: “We should quit and help these kids leave.” Ken and Joshua resigned, rented a small space in western Massachusetts, and founded North Star, a community center for unschooling teens. It's not a school—Ken is emphatic about this. It's a hub where teens could write a legal homeschooling plan, connect with other students and mentors, and rebuild a life outside of compulsory classrooms.

## North Star’s Homeschool Community Model

North Star has a physical building with couches, classrooms, a kitchen, and a front desk that greets about 60 teens on any given week. Families file their homeschool paperwork with the state (North Star walks them through it), then use the center like a gym or coworking space. The structure is light but intentional:

- Drop-in hours Monday through Thursday
- A weekly advisory meeting with one of nine staff members
- A menu of classes, tutorials, clubs, and field trips
- Optional community-college courses, apprenticeships, or jobs woven into the week

Some teens dive into three classes their first day. Others sit in the library for a week, testing whether the autonomy is real. They leave to grab coffee mid-morning. They join a hiking club. They ask staff to connect them with a math tutor or a welding mentor. The culture is simple: “We’re not in charge of you. Use this place as much or as little as you need.”

## Teens Are Ready—School Is the Abnormal Thing

Critics often ask Ken whether teens are ready for that level of autonomy. He flips the question.

“Why assume they aren’t? That’s insulting.”

Outside school hours, parents routinely ask kids whether they want piano lessons, another season of soccer, or a robotics club. We already treat young people as decision-makers in every other context. Compulsory school is the cultural outlier, not agency.

North Star’s advisories reinforce that point. Each week, staff run through a casual but consistent checklist:

How is the center working for you?

Which classes or clubs are worth your time?

Did you open the book you promised your parents you would?

Do you want a tutor?

Where else are you going during the week—jobs, grandparents, youth groups, volunteering?

Some teens talk for forty minutes; others say, “I’m good,” and jet for chess. Either way, the advisory affirms that freedom comes with support, not surveillance.

## Who Walks Away from School?

Roughly 70 percent of North Star families come directly from school and would not have homeschooled otherwise. Their reasons range from exhaustion with straight-A pressure to chronic bullying, anxiety, neurodiversity needs, or simply boredom with the seat-time ritual. The other 30 percent are former homeschoolers who want a community for the teen years. Ken notes that even high achievers often hate school; they just tolerate it better. The ones who arrive at North Star are done tolerating.

He also points out that school often holds no monopoly on joy. “Kids cry when summer camp or theater ends. They complain that we close for snow days. That’s the feeling I wanted to create—where young people are sad to leave because it nourishes them.”

## The Scarcity Myth Is the Real Villain

Ken’s urgency comes from watching teens break under the myth of scarcity: the belief that there are only a handful of “good jobs,” that a missed homework assignment in third grade ruins college prospects, that the sky falls if you aren’t on track for Amherst or Stanford by freshman year. He went to Amherst himself. He’s grateful for it. But he calls the price-tag-plus-pressure combo “criminal” when it’s presented as the only respectable path.

Unschoolers still get into selective colleges. They also launch microbusinesses, apprentice with tradespeople, take community college courses at 15, and test-drive careers without debt. The common thread: they don’t spend six years choking down stress in the name of transcripts. They build portfolios—projects, internships, language immersion, actual work—that admissions officers and employers increasingly value over traditional report cards.

## Two Paths When You Don’t Have a North Star Nearby

Ken is blunt with parents who say, “We can’t pull out—we have no alternative.” His answer comes in two parts:

1. **Stay for the social piece, not the grades.** If school still provides friendships or activities, use it like a community center. Let your child skip assignments that trigger panic. Assume they will eventually leave, take a GED, and pursue community college or work. That diploma isn’t the only ticket forward. Treat the school as a service provider, not a master.
2. **Build a patchwork week.** If staying is untenable, stitch together a life from what you already do after 3 p.m.: music lessons, youth theater, church groups, part-time jobs, volunteering, online classes. Yes, relative will assume you’re ruining your kid. They’re wrong. The only barometer that matters is your child’s health and curiosity.

In both scenarios, the job is to listen to the squeaky wheel. “Your kid’s refusal is probably a healthy response,” Ken says. “Celebrate it. They’re standing up for themselves.”

The phrase Ken rejects most fiercely is “falling behind.” Behind what? Behind whom? Learning is not a conveyor belt. You can pick up algebra at 20, biology at 12, or entrepreneurship at 16. His point isn’t motivational fluff; it comes from watching dozens of teens re-enter formal learning after a year or two away. They hadn’t lost capacity. They gained confidence and direction. When they needed geometry for an electrician certification or essay writing for community college, they learned it quickly because it had purpose.

## This Is What Flourishing Looks Like

A decade ago, Ken gathered North Star alumni over age 30 for a panel called “What Still Matters.” They weren’t living in yurts or running rogue startups. Most had the same mix of college degrees, trades, and careers as their peers. What differed was the baseline confidence of people who knew they could walk away from systems that didn’t serve them. They had already done the unthinkable when they were 15.

That’s Ken’s final encouragement to parents. Listen when your teen says, “This is hurting me.” Assume they’re right. Then build the scaffolding that lets them recover: a community hub, a weekly advisory, a handful of mentors, and the freedom to rebuild their day from scratch. School is optional. Learning isn’t.
