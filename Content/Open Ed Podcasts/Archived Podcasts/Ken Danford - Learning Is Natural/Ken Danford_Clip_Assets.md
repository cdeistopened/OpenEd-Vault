# Ken Danford — Final Clip Assets

## Clip 1: "You’re Free. And Yes, Teens Can Handle It."
- **Segments:** 05:22-06:14, 12:57-14:43 (polished transcript)
- **Hook:** Ken invites teens to walk away from school, then flips the classic “are they ready?” objection.
- **Edited Transcript:**
  - **Ken Danford:** Kids arrive thinking their parents dragged them to another principal. I say, “I’m sorry you’re miserable. Have you ever considered not going to school?” ~~They give me that look.~~ I tell them, “We’re not a school. I’m not in charge of you. Come whenever you want, leave whenever you want. Keep your phone, keep your snacks.” No one has ever said that to them. They stare at their parents like, “This existed while I was stuck in algebra?”
  - **Ken Danford:** People ask, “Are teens ready for that autonomy?” You’re born ready. Why assume kids can’t choose how to spend their time? That’s insulting. After school and in summer, parents constantly ask, “Do you want piano lessons? This sport?” We live in a culture of asking for buy-in. School is the abnormal thing. I flip the question: why treat letting kids choose as radical, but compulsory school as normal?

## Clip 2: "Two Options When School Is Breaking Your Kid"
- **Segments:** 39:37-41:37, 45:17-46:20 (polished transcript)
- **Hook:** Ken hands parents a pragmatic playbook—stay for friendships or leave entirely—and reframes defiance as healthy data.
- **Edited Transcript:**
  - **Ken Danford:** Option one: stay in school for the social piece. Let your kid get lousy grades if that keeps their friends. Assume they’ll leave eventually, grab a GED, and move on. Use the school like a community center and ignore the threats. Option two: pull them out, stack after-school arts, jobs, volunteering, online classes. Relatives will think you’re ruining your kid. They’re wrong. There’s no “falling behind” when the conventional path is hurting them.
  - **Ken Danford:** If you think something’s wrong, you’re probably right. Your kid’s refusal is likely a healthy response. Listen to them. Brainstorm alternatives, including leaving the place demanding senseless things. Celebrate the squeaky wheel—it’s your child standing up for themselves.
