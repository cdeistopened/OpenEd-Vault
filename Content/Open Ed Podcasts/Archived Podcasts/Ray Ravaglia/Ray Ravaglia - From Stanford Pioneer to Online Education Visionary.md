## 00:00 – Welcome & The Stanford Genesis Story

**Ela:** Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I have on today, Ray Ravaglia and Matt Bowman, who are two incredible thought leaders and educators in this open education space. So today we're going to hear all about Ray's background, all of the things that he has done, amazing things in education. And to kick it off, Ray, can you give us a little bit of insight into like how you even got started in education to begin with?

**Ray:** Yeah, absolutely. So I went to Stanford University as an undergraduate. And as I was entering my final year, I was trying to figure out what to do next. I thought I would spend a year goofing off before going to graduate school in philosophy. Found an opportunity to help work on a first year course to be taught computer based on calculus, a grant from the National Science Foundation.

## 02:30 – 1987: Building the First Computer-Based AP Calculus Course

**Ray:** So this is back in 1987 and wound up over that next year and a half developing a complete first year AP calculus course that was delivered by computer. Now this was pure text and graphics and some automated mathematical processing so we could actually have students enter equations and evaluate those. We can have them justify some logical reasoning and verify that as well, but this was before the advent of easy multimedia technology.

So when we built that out, had some great success with it with students in the 1991 academic year, wound up pivoting to work with gifted middle school and early high school students. So that year we had one seventh grader, five eighth graders, four ninth graders, and three 10th graders take the AP exam—six fives, six fours, and a three. And in particular now was the seventh grader and five of the eighth graders that scored five. So these younger kids really did quite well.

## 05:45 – The Pivot: From NSF Rejection to Business Innovation

**Ray:** Went to the National Science Foundation and said, hey, look, this seems to really work. Why don't we scale up? And they said no, thank you. This was proof of concept. We're not interested. So at that point we did this strange thing in a university context, which was to reinvent ourselves as a business inside the university with the idea that the intended beneficiaries of this research—i.e. the students—we'd go direct to them on a tuition-based model.

And so we created a thing called Education Program for Gifted Youth, quickly built out courses in mathematics from algebra up through calculus so that we could go out and build our own supply line of students needing calculus. And then ultimately wound up pushing that down to kindergarten level mathematics and building it up through the undergraduate degree. So by '95 or so, we were offering a full mathematics curriculum really all the way from kindergarten through what you would need for an undergraduate degree. And then sort of rolled out from there into other subjects.

## 08:00 – "What Are You Doing?" - Explaining the Impossible in the 90s

**Ela:** Wow, that's crazy. Just a follow up question. So what was your goal? So you said you reinvented this and you built up this business.

**Ray:** Yeah, and initially the goal was—so the National Science Foundation's goal was something like only 20% or so of the high schools in the country at that time were offering calculus. Calculus was a real filter in terms of who could ultimately go on to more advanced courses in mathematics, the sciences, engineering, et cetera. And the question was, how do we get more students successfully through this stuff?

Our thought was that a computer-based course would be an easy way to get it out to the students who needed it. But when we looked at the high schools that were a convenient drive from Stanford, even though 80% of the high schools in the country didn't have calculus, most of those near us did. And that's what led us to pivot to gifted middle school students, because there aren't any middle schools out there that are offering calculus on a routine basis.

**Ela:** That's so fascinating. So Ray, back to this whole like, this is the 90s, right? Was this like a wild thing where people were looking at you and saying, what are you doing? This is weird.

**Ray:** Absolutely. I mean, my joke was that at that point, it would take about five minutes to explain what it was we were doing. If somebody says, "Ray, what are you doing now? You graduated from Stanford, you're in grad school, you're working on this project. What is it?" And then you'd sort of have to set the stage and really explain it. I mean, these days you'd say something like "online learning" and they'd get it. So it's been really fun to see something that was so on the fringe become so mainstream that it's hard for people to imagine it being any other way.

## 10:30 – Matt's Parallel Journey: Bringing Internet to Classrooms

**Ela:** Yeah, I'm curious, Matt, did you experience the same thing? So like you got a grant for this, right? To bring online into the classroom. Did you also experience parents pushing back?

**Matt:** Not so much parents, just other teachers. It was super interesting that when they announced it, teachers were complaining that that grant was even available and, you know, saying we shouldn't do that. We shouldn't bring, you know, this weird thing online into the classroom. And I jumped at the chance and I just loved it. And so, yeah, there's always skeptics, but I think parents loved it because we started seeing the student engagement kind of go off the charts.

Because you know, when they would do a project before they would, you know, their friend would see it, their mom would see it and I would see it. And so they kind of said, "Oh, good. It's good enough for who it's for." Right. Whereas if we had a sister school in Germany and it was like swap your projects, they would spend hours on it, getting it better because someone out there would see it instead of just their mom and teacher. So I just loved having that ability to see the engagement that another audience added to that mix created.

## 12:15 – The Engagement Revolution: Why Sixth Graders Need Joy

**Matt:** So yeah the general sense was you know let's keep technology out of the classroom and still there's some, you know, some threads there. I remember we were given all the CDs on SimCity and SimRollercoaster and SimTower. You know, and kids just loved it. And I loved it. It was the most engagement on economics. And I was teaching social studies and language arts. These kids were just absolutely engaged in, you know, SimCity trying to create a city that's effective and, you know, works well for everybody. Like it was really fun.

**Ray:** And what I love about that too is just the moment that, you know, anything that pulls them in so that it captures the mind share so that they're thinking about it. And it doesn't really matter so much what it is because ultimately it's the productive time thinking that is going to lead to get them better at thinking and is going to produce the skill acquisition, you know, even if they're not learning any new facts about anything. You're gonna get better.

**Matt:** Yeah, I agree 100%. And you know, I joke the memories I have of teaching sixth grade, the parents would say this 11 and 12 year old kid, "I have no idea what's going on in their mind or body. It's twitching, it's moving, it's awkward." And they're like, "If you can get anything in that head, like good luck to you," right? And I fell in love with that 10 to 14 year old age group.

## 15:00 – The Fatal Flaw: Why Self-Paced Learning Fails

**Ray:** Absolutely. I mean, what I find so interesting in listening to your story is, and this is what I found, because we made this move as the 90s rolled on into the 2000s, where we realized that when we started, everything was about individualized self-paced, anytime, anywhere. And the thought was, you know, just set people down and go through the material. They're going to learn the stuff. And what we found is that, yeah, they could accelerate for a while, but then they would lose interest and drift away.

But that if we could connect them with other students, that's what would keep them engaged for years. And you want to be able to say, "Dude, check this out." I mean, when you've learned something new, when you find something cool, if you create something you wanna show off, you need to have that interaction. And if it's missing, it's just, you know, it's ultimately not gonna be compelling.

**Matt:** I'll just insert there too, you know, into the early 2000s, the big complaint about online education was that students aren't finishing, right? There was always, they had this big start ramp and to your point, they engage and then they just stop. And I didn't view that as a failure of the function. I viewed it as the learner got what they wanted, right? And stopped. And so it's not like our whole goal is always to finish and get a credit or finish and get the checkmark or certificate of the class. It's like, go as far as your brain is interested in learning that and move on when you're done.

## 18:00 – Technology vs. Relationships: The Critical Balance

**Ray:** Well, I mean, it's funny because if you were saying the same thing about, I mean, you know, kids go to the library and they pick these books up and they read a few pages and then they put them back on the shelves. Why would we have—I mean, you know, again, it's just the expectation of how a thing is being used is really going to set up the test for whether or not it's successful in its use.

I mean, one of the things that I found, and sort of this is slightly tangent, but looking at satisfaction. And it wasn't just the student satisfaction, it was the instructor satisfaction. We found that when we were doing things that were purely sort of individualized self-paced, where there was a big defined curriculum that students were working through asynchronously, we found our instructors would do everything they could to optimize and make it efficient and they'd build up stacks of answers to common questions.

And they could whittle their job down to something that could be done in three hours a day. And then they would quit. Because at the end of the day, when you're just a tool of the machine, it's not enjoyable. You don't go into teaching to do that. When we went to synchronous classes where the instructors actually had to teach and they had to meet with the students live in video, they'd complain about how much work it was. They'd talk about how inconvenient it could be to have to do this stuff at a set time every day. They'd never quit.

They would be there year in and year out, and they really enjoyed it. They'd make these great relationships with their students. And the same way the students, the attrition rates for an individualized self-paced course, even kids who are gifted and really good at it, the attrition rate could run north of 30%. And once you got to the synchronous environment, attrition was down around two to three percent because again, the relationships they would build and if somebody stops coming to class, their friends would hunt them down and ask what's up.

**Ela:** Interesting. Can you speak to that from a level of, okay, you've done online education, you were a big proponent of technology, and now you've realized that technology has a purpose. You are still a big proponent of technology, but now you've realized that relationships are core. Like, what is the role of each and how does that interplay?

**Ray:** Yeah, absolutely. You know, 2005 is when I created the Stanford Online High School. And one of the things that we did at that moment was decide we were going to conduct this with synchronous classes. The kids were going to have to come together in real time to meet. And because we had kids, you know, theoretically around the world, it could be really inconvenient for some. But we knew that the payoff would be there because they needed to see that there were other students, they needed to feel that they were part of a community.

And what we found was that the technology was all about enabling rather than replacing. And I would say to the parents, look, if we had the technology to beam kids in, if we had Star Trek quality transporters, we could beam them into a seminar room and conduct it in person and then beam them home afterwards, we would do that. We don't, but what we have is the video conferencing that can approximate.

## 21:30 – Fire Your School: Becoming an Intentional Education Consumer

**Ela:** That's interesting. So tech, in your opinion, makes things accessible. So back whenever you were talking about Stanford, it was this recognition that these kids could not access the calculus class, right? And that is the value that you were giving them. You were allowing them to recognize the things that they could possibly do and say, here, here are all these tools in your tool belt to go do what you could possibly do.

**Ray:** Yeah, exactly. First problem you solve is access. And then once things are accessible, what you need to do is ensure that the relationships are there because access without the relationships is going to unravel. The relationships are what are going to preserve and sustain and keep things moving forward.

**Ela:** I love that. How would you recommend a parent think about this? So you've talked about this a lot from the level of like an administrator, but like, how would you talk to a parent about thinking about their kid's education?

**Ray:** So, the first question is, what's the goal? And I would always tell parents, look. If your goal is get them into an Ivy plus institution, just remember that getting in isn't what's gonna matter at the end of the day. They at least have to be prepared to be successful when they get there. And whatever they learn there has to prepare them to be successful in life. And that's where you're gonna start measuring whether the whole path was successful.

What I would say to the parents is figure out what problem you're solving and why you're bringing technology in to address it. And if you have a school—this is when I was doing online schools—I would always say, look, if you have a school nearby that you love, enjoy it, be happy. Most people don't.

## 25:00 – The Public-Private Partnership Model That Works

**Ray:** I mean, if you have a school, and you're someplace where a school is meeting half of your need, talk to them about, "my kid wants to come half time." And the stuff that isn't meeting your need, like say your kid's math science off the charts, we'll let them go to school and do the English and Humanities stuff, and then they go online and do the math and science three years ahead. Or the flip side, if they are sort of Dwight Global Online School, which is the second online school that I've created, which is modeled on a standard prep school experience, they have a lot of students who are very talented artists, athletes, dancers, what have you. They have serious, you know, substantive outside activities that they're pursuing, but they don't want to do it at the cost of a high quality education.

So for those students, it's easy because the problem they're solving is how do I get something just as good as the prep school that I would have gone to, but that doesn't nail me to the desk so that I can go out and, you know, be on Broadway or I can go travel with my team when we play internationally, but still get the education.

So again, to the parent, it's always figuring out what's the problem you're trying to solve and how is technology actually solving it. Don't just embrace the technology because it's technology and you think it's cool.

**Matt:** Well, I just need to chime in. Ray, you just summarized the [open education book](https://openeducationbook.com). We've mailed you a copy. I hope you get a chance to read it. And when you do, you're going to see that what you just said is what open education is. And just for the audience, that's how we connected that. You wrote a great article around intentional education and the rise of that and the need for parents to ask those questions of what is it? What's the role that I'm hiring my schools to do for me and my children? And are they happy or not? Like those are some of the foundational questions. If yes, thumbs up, keep doing. If not, tap into what else might be available and mix and match the resources you have available in your community. And you did a great job of summarizing that Ray, so thank you.

**Ray:** Thank you. It's funny, I wrote an op-ed a number of years back called "Fire Your School," which would just run through these questions. I don't view them as somebody you owe something to. You're fundamentally their employer. If you're not happy, go in and make demands. And if you don't see the changes you want, go somewhere else. If people demand options and alternatives, they will look—those options and alternatives will appear. I mean, if the market need is there, the market will create the alternatives.

## 27:00 – Why Every Child Needs Something Different

**Matt:** Just add to that that when we started OpenEd, my wife and I did in 2009. So right on the heels again of your 2005 launch and we saw we had five kids and they all needed something different and we thought other families felt the same. So we started OpenEd and it was interesting. I had gone to the Stanford executive business management program when I had worked in the tech industry and one of their principles was lasting innovation, I'll never forget this lasting innovation, and this is from the center for social change from Stanford. Lasting change only occurs when there's a public private partnership. Because the public kind of has the stability and some resources and funding and the private can act and think quickly and differently. And the combination of those two is what makes lasting innovation. And that was the thesis of OpenEd.

So we contracted with school districts to run online learning for them because they didn't know how to do that. That partnership, that public private partnership, and I always say tax status doesn't matter. Like judge quality on quality, but don't judge it on tax status. That's the most ridiculous judgment of how to judge quality. So totally aligned there, Ray, that you can see good and bad on both sides equally.

**Ray:** Yeah, no, I love your story. I mean, having five kids that really and where they all need something different that nothing's going to cause sort of more awareness and sort of responsiveness than having that. When you look, is it available? It's almost never going to be available when it's five different things. And so, you know, creating it yourself and rolling it together the way you did, I think commendable. Well done.

**Matt:** Well, and again, my wife and I thought all the kids were going to be the same because our house was the same. The rules were the same. The expectations were the same. We posted every Saturday, the job chart. It was the same. And our cadence and culture was very similar, but every child needed something different. And we didn't realize that. And, you know, as they started getting older and they started needing something different, we ended up at one point had four different schools that the five kids were going through. And so we agreed that it was inconvenient for the parent to coordinate that, but our children were worth it. And so let's do what benefits them instead of what benefits us. And so that's a really, you know, it's a messy way to try to figure it out. And we say that over and over again in the book that there's no simple, easy roadmap. You just have to be intentional and think about it in a way that you embrace every child's unique and their education might need to be too.

## 30:25 – The Art of Group Projects: Symphony vs. Solo Work

**Ray:** Yeah, yeah, and that's very well said. And I think, that's what I found when doing that piece on intentional education, though, you know, had I seen your book ahead of time, and we may have had to call it open education. I may take you up on that. But what I found that was interesting there is sort of the recognition that, you know, the learning needs can be very individual, but they need to have interaction with each other and that when you have kids together, figure out what the right way of doing things with them together is. And that's probably not all sitting at a desk listening to someone talk. I mean, that's just not the best use of having people in the same space.

**Ela:** That's fascinating. Can you elaborate on that so that I understand you correctly? You said there are going to be apparent differences between kids. You're going to do different things with them, but for the things that you do together, make sure they're the right things.

**Ray:** Yeah, so it's, I'm looking at, you know, so say I am working with students in middle school age, late elementary school age, even high school, and I've decided, okay, we're gonna, you know, we're gonna break up and we're gonna be, you know, we're doing literature, we're gonna read novels, we're gonna talk about them. You know, rather than sort of pulling together everybody who is 14 and making them read the same novel, I mean, let us look at sort of current levels of fluency and ability and, you know, sort of if you're the fifth child in a family of five, you probably have a pretty different sense of the world than if you're the first child in a family of three, say.

You know, so assemble groups that make sense for the novel you're reading and do that. You know, everybody could read their own novel individually, but part of the joy and part of the value of that sort of activity is discussing it with each other. So you don't wanna do that as a separate activity. When you're doing something like, so say you're doing a theatrical production or you're doing some other sort of thing that involves natural group activity, well then it's probably similar to kids who have musical talent and have them do something.

When you look at why group projects fail, so you often talk to kids about how much they hate group projects because they wind up doing all the work and the other kids are just sort of dragging along. Well, I mean, that's a design flaw for what the project was because it should be, you know, good group projects should be like playing a symphony or it should be like playing soccer where if you don't have the players on the field, if you don't have the instruments all engaged, you cannot play the piece, you cannot play the game. You know, if you're doing something that is capable of having one person do all the work is just bad design. And I think that that's something that people are reluctant to really think through for whatever reason.

## 32:30 – Entrepreneurship as the Ultimate Team Learning

**Matt:** Yeah, let me add to that Ray one of the threads of themes in the book and in my life philosophically is that entrepreneurship is one of those things that creates a group setting that is naturally everyone needs to contribute in their own talent. You know, it's so fun to see kids organize groups. Now all of a sudden the one who reads and writes all the time is extremely valuable for your website. The one who codes all the time builds the website. The one who is always drawing and designing all of sudden has a place on the team. And you have this interdisciplinary group in an entrepreneurship setting that I have found is unlike any other group cohort you can find. When they're motivated to go build something that solves the problem. Hopefully there's a dollar on the line that they can get. So you need the outspoken salesperson to, you know, and so you kind of get the, I love entrepreneurship is one of the ultimate interdisciplinary team projects you can ever find.

**Ray:** I think that's really well said. And it's also the only activities that really build empathy are things like that where you're trying to meet a need. So you actually have to figure out what the need is, as opposed to prescribing what it should be. If I give you a product and tell you to go out and sell it, then you're going to make me think I need it. If I'm saying, here's some resources, I want you to figure out what the market wants. Go interview people, find out what they need, and then you know, build the company that creates it. I mean, that's really the thing that's going to build empathy.

**Matt:** Absolutely, I love bringing in the empathy part of entrepreneurship. Well said.

## 35:00 – From Non-Consumers to Mainstream: The Evolution Path

**Ela:** How did you figure all of this out, Ray? Was it just like watching people and like realizing over time?

**Ray:** Yeah, definitely a lot of hard earned experience, a lot of mistakes. I mean, the best way to learn things is to do it wrong and realize you've done it wrong. So collect the data, look at the data as it rolls in. Some of it too was as we were successful. So when we built the, when I built my first online high school, the thought was we want to be the best high school in the world, not the best online high school. If you say we want to be the best online school, you're going to make easy decisions that you'll come to regret later. But if you decide we want to be the best high school, then you need to figure out, OK, what problems are you solving and how are you going to get there? And then you look at who are your students.

And initially, we were getting people who had really no alternative. They would get what Clayton Christensen would call the non-consumers, the people who they're desperate. And so maybe they live in the middle of nowhere, they don't want to ship their kid off to boarding school, so they think an online high school, we're going to give it a try. Over time, as you have success, you begin to seem like a real option for people who do have alternatives. And so you need to stay ahead of what are they expecting.

So when you start getting people who could have gone to any number of good boarding schools, but have chosen to keep their kid home and put them in an online school, you think of what are the things that they would have found at the boarding school that they would be missing if, now that they've gone on your thing, that the earlier students weren't looking for. And that's what leads you to do things like having a director of student life or something that you might not have had when you first stand up at school, but as you become more mature, you realize people are gonna be looking for that.

**Ela:** That's fascinating. And how would you categorize those non-consumers back in the 90s? They were the people that couldn't find anything?

**Ray:** I'll give you some very, the very first kid I admitted to the Stanford Online High School was, you know, he was a 12 year old, 13 year old young, but you know, the parents were desperate. They were running a successful medical practice in Arizona, but they were about to shut up shop and move to Washington State to put him in the Robinson School at the University of Washington. And then they found this and thought, this could be the solution. This could let us stay where we are in our lives and not have to disrupt the other children to meet our son's need. And they did and it worked. So that was one.

Earlier had a student whose mother was running a medical practice, sort of this is in West, far West part of Idaho, running a medical practice out of the home, and dad was a blacksmith. And the son was off the charts gifted in mathematics. I think he went on to Harvard. But for high school, he loved all of the freedom that living out in sort of the frontier gave him. But the parents felt they were really shortchanging him because they could not meet his educational needs with the options that were available. And again, we were the solution that let that happen. And so those are the people who start off as the non-consumers, where it's just, it's an existential problem that they're solving.
