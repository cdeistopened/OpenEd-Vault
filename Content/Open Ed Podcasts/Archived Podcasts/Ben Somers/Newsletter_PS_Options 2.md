## Option 1: Two Buttons Meme (Recommended)

```
---

**P.S.** Someone needs to make this meme:

[Guy sweating over two buttons]

**Button 1:** "Adapt education system to fit energetic 11-year-olds"  
**Button 2:** "Put 25% of boys on methamphetamines"

Guy labeled: **"Traditional Education System"**

Somehow we picked button 2. 

Send this to a friend who needs to hear there's a better way. →

That's all for today!

## Option 2: Drake Meme

```
---

**P.S.** The real insight from Ben's story:

❌ Spending $10 million on perfect curriculum  
✅ Making sure your kid has one friend in class

Connection > everything else.

Send this to a parent who's agonizing over which curriculum to buy. →

## Option 3: Vocabulary Callback

```
---

**P.S.** Your new favorite word: **Verschlimmbessern**

*(German: when you make something worse by trying to improve it)*

Like medicating a quarter of boys to fit a system that should have adapted to them.

Use it in a sentence this week. Impress your friends. →

## Option 4: Question/Engagement

```
---

**P.S.** Real talk: Have you ever felt pressure to medicate your child to "fit" a system that wasn't designed for them?

Hit reply. I read every response.

(And if you're designing your child's education instead of forcing them into a mold, you're doing it right.) →

## Option 5: Recess CTA

```
---

**P.S.** If the "$10M < friends" insight resonated with you, check out Recess.

It's literally built around that insight: kids choose classes, meet others who like the same stuff, and motivation spreads through actual friendships.

No medication required. →

## Recommendation

**Use Option 1 (Two Buttons)** because:
- Most shareable concept
- Visual enough people can picture it
- Invites people to create/share
- Drives conversation
- Stays in voice (not too salesy)

**Alternative**: Option 3 (Vocabulary) if you want something lighter and more playful

**Avoid**: Option 4 if you don't want to invite potentially heavy email responses about medication decisions
