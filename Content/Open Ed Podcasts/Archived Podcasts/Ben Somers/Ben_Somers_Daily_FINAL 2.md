# You're Not a Teacher. You're an Education Designer.

When a quarter of boys are medicated to fit the system, something's broken. PLUS: Why homeschooling is now high-status in San Francisco.

Greetings!

Ben Somers was 11 when a teacher, frustrated that he was a foot tapper and wiggler, sent him to a psychiatrist. He was put on 70mg of Concerta—that's a really large dose of methamphetamines for a kid who weighed about 100 pounds.

The medication wasn't prescribed to help Ben learn better. It was prescribed to make him easier to manage. He was aware when he took the pill in the morning that his day looked way different. Anger issues. Constipation. A host of side effects that would eventually include, years later, some impact on his puberty.

**In his town that year, 25% of all the boys were on some kind of ADHD medication.**

Not to help them. To make the classroom run more smoothly.

Fast forward: Ben dropped out of high school, eventually worked his way into education technology, and now runs a platform called Recess that's trying to solve the problems he experienced firsthand. This week we talked about what he's learned—including a surprising data point that should make every parent who's agonizing over curriculum choices relax a little.

Let's dive in.

## THE EDUCATION DESIGNER

There's a guy who tried to make a chicken sandwich completely from scratch. Grew the wheat for the bun, raised the chickens, harvested salt from the ocean—the whole thing. Six months later, he had... a terrible sandwich.

Most parents think homeschooling means becoming that guy. You dig your own soil, grow everything yourself, and hopefully don't produce a terrible sandwich after six months of exhaustion.

Ben has a different take: **you're not supposed to be the teacher of everything. You're the education designer.**

You don't need to personally deliver every math lesson, science experiment, and writing workshop. You need to curate the right mix of resources, experiences, and relationships that work for your unique child. Some families cook every meal from scratch. Most people want to pick their meals and occasionally cook. When you make it easier to be involved, parents actually want to design the experience—they just don't want to grow the wheat.

The tools exist now. The question is: are you designing, or are you trying to be a one-person school system?

## HIGH-STATUS HOMESCHOOLING

In San Francisco, homeschooling is now high-status.

I know, I know—San Francisco, the progressive capital, where you'd expect public school to reign supreme. But when someone there hears another parent is homeschooling, they assume it means those parents are really smart. They're doing something good, different. The stigma has flipped.

**Why? Two things.**

First, it signals you're dissatisfied with the quality of conventional education—which means you have high standards. Second, it means you've organized your life in such a way that you can solve childcare and instruction yourself. You've carved out enough time and figured out how to make it work in an expensive city. High standards plus life control equals status.

Of course, this feels a bit elitist—and it is. But here's what's interesting: **the reason homeschooling is easier now isn't just resources. It's realizing you don't have to do everything yourself.**

Back to Ben's story. The system's answer to an active 11-year-old? "To fit into the standardized model of how you're supposed to learn, we load up hundred-pound 11-year-olds with methamphetamines," Ben told me. "That seems really crazy. There has to be a better way."

The system adapts the child to fit the model. Homeschooling—especially the mix-and-match kind we talk about here—adapts the model to fit the child. That's the actual privilege worth having.

**Vocab Check:** The Germans have a word for this: *Verschlimmbessern* (fer-SCHLIM-bess-ern)—when you make something worse by trying to improve it. Medicating active kids to fit a broken system? Textbook verschlimmbessern.

## WHERE KIDS DESIGN THEIR LEARNING

Recess is what happens when you build a platform around kid choice and friend-making.

Here's the insight that shaped it: when Ben worked at Synthesis School (the SpaceX school), they spent **$10 million a year on developing the best educational games possible.** You know what beat all of it? Whether the kid had a friend in their class. Not teacher credentials. Not curriculum quality. If a kid had one friend in class, they stuck around forever and performed better. Without a friend, they churned in 3-6 months.

So Recess built around that.

**Kids browse a marketplace of classes** (taught by YouTubers and professionals) and **request the ones that excite them**. Parents approve or deny. When kids join a class, they meet others who like the same stuff. After class, Recess suggests those kids as friends and gives them Discord-style chat to stay connected.

Things trend on the platform—one kid gets into engineering, their friend joins, another friend joins, and suddenly you've got a wave of motivation spreading through actual friendships. Not coercion. Not medication. Just genuine interest spreading through social connection.

Your kid picks the classes. You approve them. Friends form naturally. That's Recess.
