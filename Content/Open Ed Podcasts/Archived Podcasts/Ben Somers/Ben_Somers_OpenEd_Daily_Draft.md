# You're Not a Teacher. You're an Education Designer.

What if you're not supposed to teach everything yourself? PLUS: The $10M lesson about what kids actually need to thrive.

Greetings!

This week I talked with Ben Somers, founder of Recess, about his journey from being medicated at age 11 to building learning platforms. One insight keeps coming back to me: the shift from thinking like a teacher to thinking like an education designer. It changes everything.

Let's dive in.

## THE EDUCATION DESIGNER

There's a guy who tried to make a chicken sandwich completely from scratch. Grew the wheat for the bun, raised the chickens, harvested salt from the ocean—the whole thing. Six months later, he had a terrible sandwich.

Most parents think homeschooling means becoming that guy. You dig your own soil, grow everything yourself, and hopefully don't produce a terrible sandwich after six months of exhaustion.

Ben Somers has a different take: **you're not supposed to be the teacher of everything. You're the education designer.**

You don't need to personally deliver every math lesson, science experiment, and writing workshop. You need to curate the right mix of resources, experiences, and relationships that work for your unique child. Some families cook every meal from scratch. Most people want to pick their meals and occasionally cook. When you make it easier to be involved, parents actually want to design the experience—they just don't want to grow the wheat.

The tools exist now. The question is: are you designing, or are you trying to be a one-person school system?

## FRIENDS > $10 MILLION

Here's something that should make curriculum-obsessed parents relax a little.

When Ben worked at Synthesis School (the SpaceX school), they spent roughly **$10 million a year on developing the best educational games possible.** Hired the best game designers, built complex team simulations, iterated constantly based on data.

You know what beat all of it?

Whether the kid had a friend in their class.

Not teacher credentials. Not winning games. Not curriculum quality. If a kid had one friend in class, they stuck around forever and performed better. Without a friend, they churned in 3-6 months—regardless of how "good" everything else was.

The kids with friends could take criticism better, talked about what they learned outside class, and made projects in their free time to share with their friend. Connection unlocked everything else.

Everyone's sleeping on friends—both to make learning stick and to make kids actually enjoy it. Which, honestly, should be obvious. But we keep treating curriculum selection like it's the make-or-break decision.

## WHERE KIDS DESIGN THEIR LEARNING

Recess is what happens when you build a platform around those two insights: you need friends, and you need choice.

Here's how it works: **Kids browse a marketplace of classes** (taught by YouTubers and professionals) and **request the ones that excite them**. Parents approve or deny the requests. So there's no such thing as a kid stuck in a class they don't want, and no parent paying for something they don't value.

When kids join a class, they meet others who like the same stuff. After class, Recess suggests those kids as friends and gives them Discord-style chat to stay connected. Then kids can see what classes their friends are taking and easily join them.

Things trend on the platform—one kid gets into engineering, their friend joins, another friend joins, and suddenly you've got a wave of motivation spreading through actual friendships.

Oh, and for California families using charter school funds, Recess handles all the approval and payment headaches. Every dollar actually goes toward your kid's education instead of sitting locked up in administrative limbo.

Your kid picks the classes. You approve them. Friends form naturally. That's Recess.
