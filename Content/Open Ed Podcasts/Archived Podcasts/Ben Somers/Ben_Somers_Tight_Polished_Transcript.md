## Full Transcript

**Ela Richmond:** Ben, welcome to the podcast. What got you interested in education to begin with?

**Ben Somers:** I was truant from grade six to grade nine and dropped out of high school. When I was 11, I had a teacher who was frustrated that I was a foot tapper and wiggler. We had to go see a psychiatrist and I went on 70 milligrams of Concerta when I weighed about a hundred pounds. That's a really large dose of methamphetamines.

I was already rebellious in school. Now as an adult, I think this idea that to fit into this model of how you're supposed to learn, you're supposed to load up a hundred-pound, 11-year-old with tons of drugs—that seems really crazy. There has to be a better way. I felt wronged during my school process, but I liked learning and liked a bunch of my teachers. I can imagine a version that's much better.

**Ela Richmond:** Did you in the moment know that it was wrong?

**Ben Somers:** For sure. If you're 100 pounds and you take that, you have anger issues, you're crazy constipated—there's a ton of side effects. We went to an endocrinologist years later and it had some effects on my puberty. When I was 11, I was aware that when I took this pill in the morning, my day looked way different.

**Ela Richmond:** And the purpose was just to keep you paying attention in school?

**Ben Somers:** It was really about the other kids. It wasn't about me. I was disruptive and probably talked a lot and was running around all the time. It was to make it easier for the teacher to deal with the classroom. What's funny is in my town that year, almost a quarter of all the boys in the school were on stimulants.

As I got older, I started looking back thinking, I wonder who I would have been if my education looked different. The classic—I always thought I'm bad at math. But what if you're not?
I think there are only two reasons you work in education if you're building something that changes the system. Either you had a bad experience and can imagine a version of yourself that's better than you are now, and you want to build the education that would have produced that version of yourself. Or you felt you had a particularly good schooling experience and want to bring that to more people. But if you're working on net new things, it means you can imagine a version of yourself that's better than you are now. That's definitely true for me.

**Ela Richmond:** Did you do any education things before Recess?

**Ben Somers:** I did some tutoring in high school and college and debate coaching. Then three or four years ago, I went to work at a company called Synthesis School, which makes team simulation games for kids and a digital math tutor. I decided to work in education after building a company with my brother and wanted something I could work on for 40 years. So I picked education as a problem and went to work for the smartest people I could find—Josh Dahn and Chrisman Frank. Josh had built this school at SpaceX. Chrisman had made these great stories called the Conundrums and built tutoring companies. I went to learn from them and hang out with them and follow Josh around and annoy him at times.

**Ela Richmond:** What did you learn from them?

**Ben Somers:** I learned a lot about company building. The company grew from zero to 20 million in two years, then all the way back down to 3 million after a crazy product pivot, then clawed its way back up to 10 million ARR. Chrisman in particular is really comfortable with his back against the wall. He's very fearless and endlessly optimistic. I saw the power of that and learned the need for total perseverance.

I learned a lot about education. It was the Mecca for two years for forward-thinking teachers—right as COVID hit, this company launches with a cool SpaceX backstory. I learned a ton from them—details about how to make a kid feel seen, how to use after-class time to pull them aside, how to motivate a room of people. Josh was particularly good at making kids feel like whatever they were doing was really important. He would really get everyone to buy in. I say it's a thousand tiny skills.

**Ela Richmond:** How did it evolve your understanding of education?

**Ben Somers:** There were two core insights. The first was that the number one predictor of retention—both a business metric and a learning metric—was if the kid had a friend in their class. It wasn't who the teacher was, whether they were Illinois Teacher of the Year, or whether they won or lost a ton of games. All these things you'd expect—which game you were playing, whether it was fun or bad—didn't make that big a difference. But really, if you had a friend in your class, you stuck around forever. If you didn't, you churned in three to six months.

The kids performed way better when they had a friend in the class. They could take criticism way better. They would talk about it when they weren't in the class. They'd make maps in their free time and send them to their friend. I was shocked by how much a good social experience led to a better learning experience and a better business model.

We spent maybe $7 million a year on games. The games had less impact on retention than "friend in a class," which is close to free. Everyone was sleeping on friends—both to make their products sticky and to make the learning experience better.

The second insight: the kids had a mandatory Recess session once a week, then could choose from events for the rest of the week. The feeling in the mandatory class versus the chosen class was really different. The chosen class felt electric. Every kid wanted to be there. They chose to be there. Their level of commitment, their drive, their skill in the game was so different. Kid buy-in matters way more than we treat it or think about it. Other than homeschooling, I don't really know of any good model that works kid choice in as a serious part of their curriculum design.

The two core insights that led to Recess: you hang out with your friends a lot at recess and you get to choose what you do. So if you were a kid in Idaho really into building circuits and crazy Minecraft contraptions, you could find other homeschoolers from around the country who did that. Or if you loved publishing books, you could make friends who liked that and making art—one does cover art, another writes, one copy-edits, then you publish it on Amazon. Kids do that kind of stuff on Recess all the time.

**Ela Richmond:** That's really fascinating. What is the topic I hear kids bring up all the time today? Roblox. And why? Because they're playing with their friends.

**Ben Somers:** Yeah. And on iOS, a lot of kids can't download apps without their parents. Roblox is actually just a giant app marketplace hidden as if it's a game. If you open it up, it's 10,000 games and the kids get to pick which ones they want. So both a place where you hang out with your friends and a place where you choose what you do with total freedom.

**Ela Richmond:** How have you taken these insights and put them into Recess? What's surprised you?

**Ben Somers:** Recess started as once a day at the same time, kids would log on to something like Gather Town, run around and talk and meet each other. I would place games down and they could convene around the games they wanted to play. Just a place to spend time with a bunch of other kids.

Now the friend thing and the choice thing work really hand in hand. There's a big marketplace of classes run by YouTubers and professionals. The interesting thing: your parents can't sign you up for any classes. The kids pick the classes. But there's a second trigger. The kids look through this marketplace and all the thumbnails are really exciting to them. It's not "learn circuit design and the basics." It's "how to build a trap door in Minecraft," "how to write a show for your favorite TV show." They're presented in a way that kids are excited about them, because the only way you sell the class is if the kid wants to click on it.

Then the kid requests it from their parent and the parent can approve or deny the request. So there's no such thing as a kid being in a class they don't want to be in. Every room you go into, everyone wants to be there. And there's no such thing as a parent paying for a class they don't value. It's a nice double trigger that puts the kid in charge with trust from the parent.

When you join a class, you're going to meet everyone who wants to be there and they all like the same stuff as you. After the class, we suggest friends—all the kids you just met—and you can add them. We give you a Discord-style chat where you can chat and call and hang out and play games. Then you can see what classes your friends are in, so you can organize and easily schedule joining up with them.

What's cool is things trend on Recess. One kid will get really into this engineering thing, one of their friends will see and join that class, then one of their friends will see and join. Now you've seen three people join that class this week and it becomes popular. I think there are waves of motivation that come over, and it helps make topics that might not normally be picked up by kids become more popular.

**Ela Richmond:** What have you been surprised by?

**Ben Somers:** We launched this jobs feature—kids were going to hire each other. We were trying to make a mini economy. I was surprised at how much kids like to fire each other. I didn't see that coming. So we had to take that feature away.

I'm continuously surprised by how often kids you would label as unmotivated or not diligent totally morph into absolutely those things in the right circumstance. We all know this intuitively. You ask some kid who can't memorize state capitals and they can rattle off all 372 Pokemon and which ones were part of the different leagues and memorize them perfectly and all their moves. You can't remember 50 easy things, but you can remember 372 complicated things. Every time you help it happen or see it and can do something with it, it's always surprising. Something about that feels slept on.

**Ela Richmond:** There's a lot of criticism around unschooling approaches. The criticism is, are you preparing kids for a world where they don't feel like they have to do things they have to do? I'm curious about your take on the balance between fostering what they're interested in and also, well, math.

**Ben Somers:** I have a few thoughts. Things have a reason. It's useful if you can attempt to figure out what the reason you do things are. I'm particularly bad at doing things I don't want to do or that I don't think matter. I don't entirely reject the premise. I do think there are things you have to do, but I'm way more willing to pay my taxes when I think about the purpose of taxes and the purpose of a country and what it means to be a citizen. At the same time, I think this is where good entrepreneurs come from. You're doing your taxes and you're like, "this is total nonsense. Why do I have to do it this way?" And someone's like, "well, maybe you don't have to, maybe we could make something that would make it simpler."

I do think a small amount of discipline training is useful. Sometimes there's something to learn about when you can rely on an expert authority and when you can't. When you can rely on an expert authority, you don't always have to ask why if you really trust them. We do a bunch of full school for kids—they're doing rigorous math practice every day, even if they don't want to. They're occasionally doing reading comprehension tests. So as radical as I am, I still think there's room for that stuff.

The second part is kind of the Montessori idea. I actually don't really think kids should play Pokemon. I think it's a pretty bad game from a learning design standpoint. There are other games that are similarly fun that have you do a lot more problem solving and have more transferable skills.

This is where Montessori was really smart. She really wanted to give the kid a lot of freedom and have them learn independence and self-motivation and how to focus themselves. So she would let kids choose whatever they wanted within a curated environment. You couldn't bring your toys from home. But anything she had in her space, you could take out and play with. There were materials she had custom designed that would help scaffold the kids' knowledge and build upon each other. When given that curated environment, the kid earns a lot more freedom.

This is similar to if you grew up in a nice town that's super safe, where your parents spend a lot of time learning, working, doing interesting things, they have good value systems. The kid can have a ton of freedom from the time they're eight years old. They can walk four blocks to their friend's house. If you grew up in other environments where there are tons of bad influences and lots of negativity and potentially violence, you shouldn't get a lot of freedom as a kid. So the better you can make the environments—this is where I get super obsessed—is the digital environment. Almost every parent I know with a kid under 10 is terrified of screens. They have a lot of anxiety about them. I think it makes sense and it's really sad.

**Ela Richmond:** I love this idea of curating the environment and having kids earn a higher level of freedom. But how do you determine when is the right point to expose them to things that are highly addictive? They could use YouTube for tutorials. They could also use YouTube for a host of other things. Where does technology fit in?

**Ben Somers:** If you are a crazy involved parent who spends a lot of time with your kid and is nearby them with the screens all the time, and you use your screens in a really great way—you don't model watching TikTok on the couch for 45 minutes, but you do model showing them how to build something in CAD or that you wrote a short story—and you're going to talk to them about the pitfalls of where tech can get dangerous, I think you can give them a ton of freedom really young.

If you are the 99.8% of parents who have a lot of other stuff going on and you are not going to dedicate probably a full-time job to curating their screen time, then I agree that I don't really know when. Three doesn't seem like a good time. Seven doesn't seem like a good time. Twelve doesn't seem like a great time. Fifteen doesn't seem like a great time. And then 18, you've gotta stop doing stuff for them anymore. You can't rely on the tech to raise your kids correctly or teach the kids how to use them safely. They will not do that. That really has to be you.

Or you work on the thing I'm working on, which I hope will have this effect. The super long story short is you download an app on your iPad and it turns your iPad from bad to great. It goes from something you're nervous about giving your kid to something you're absolutely hyped to give your kid. They're coming to you at the end of the day teaching you all these things they learned.

We do that by relying a lot on AI. One of the things AI is really good at is mimicking text, parroting something or translating it. For us, if we can get a good description of a parent's values, their value system—whether they're really into faith and want faith to be a big part of their kid's life, or they really want their kid to develop strong technical skills, or they want them to have a strong moral backbone in this area—if we can get a good picture of what their value system is, I actually think we can have AI help the kid discover the internet within the confines of their parents' values. Same as if I was looking up tons of cool sites and sending them to you as a parent, and you'd be like, "I don't like this. I like this. I don't like this."

We're gonna basically automate that and give you as a parent samples and experiences that make you feel connected to your kid's screen time so you understand what they're doing on it so it's not a mystery to you. Then you can tell if this thing is working and you trust it to help you parent your kid. It's kind of like a digital companion for you on the iPad that makes the iPad good.

**Ela Richmond:** That's really fascinating and it aligns with what we recently compiled—this vision of what education can be. It's basically education should be mix and match aligned with your values and your priorities as a family and a child's individual personality, their interests, their strengths and weaknesses. This is what always scared me. I never thought I'd be a good homeschool mom because I always thought homeschooling was "I'm gonna sit in front of a whiteboard and personally teach you every single subject forever." That never excited me.

Really expanding my idea to, okay, I'm not necessarily having to be the teacher in everything. Rather, I'm becoming an education designer. What could my child's education become? I'm designing the education that aligns with our values, that aligns with them and that becomes something that can help them to become who they could possibly be. You get into education thinking, oh, if I had these different experiences, who could I possibly be? And as a parent, you get to look down at your kid and you're like, okay, who could you possibly be? Let's figure it out. That is infinitely more exciting to me than picking this path and this is it.

**Ben Somers:** I think you're gonna remove the fear too. There's a product that's missing that would remove the fear. In school they have these things called learning management systems and they're really built for the administrator, not for the kid. They're built to keep track of a whole class or a whole grade and notice trends.

There's this one called Math Academy. I'll connect you to the guy who runs that. School treats all knowledge like it goes in a line. So it's really scary as a homeschool parent because if you don't want to go in that line, then you are no longer on the same track as school and you can't compare yourself to the school benchmarks anymore. That's really scary because if we deviate from this line, we're kind of flying blind.

I think in reality, knowledge is not ordered in a straight line. It's ordered in a big complex graph of ideas that are connected to each other in different ways. There are prerequisites and post-requisites, but it's much messier. There are many different ways to get to the same idea. Some ideas rely on a bunch of ideas, others you can skip right over.

What I think is missing is a really good tool that maps the kid's knowledge in a more open-ended and less linear way and is backed and connected to standardized test scores. I think you can actually build a system that allows for rabbit holes and offshoots and tangents and a totally different way of going about it and still have it feel really clear about all the knowledge that you're supposed to acquire in school and what your kid has acquired thus far and what they're not going to acquire and what they will if you get on this path. If you're missing this knowledge, here's a really clear and easy way to go get it if you do want to go back into physical school or traditional school.

This is part of the thing we're making for the browser. Part of what we think is making the right environment for the kid to exist on the screen is to have a good experience with their computer. With this tool, it should build a lot of confidence and make it really clear for the parent about how they're using their computer, how it's affecting their learning and where they can go. Computers are uniquely good at measuring and mapping this kind of stuff compared to even if you had a human sitting next to the kid 24/7.

**Ela Richmond:** This was the very first thing—I think everybody that saw that first Khan Academy video of Sal Khan on the iPad. That was the very first aha moment of like, wow, what could possibly be the future of education? There is this shift happening where in the past education was this thing that you entirely outsourced. But it's not working for a lot of families. A lot of families are seeing their children being mistreated by the system. It's not set up to treat their kid properly. So they're creating this new paradigm where parents are becoming education designers. They need different information if they're education designers. They need information about what do my kids want? What do my kids like? Where are my kids struggling?

Something I love to bring back is this phrase—the person most invested in making your child successful is the parent, period. Because they're the one that has to live with them, they're the one that has to experience them all day long, they're the ones that later in life get to look back and be like, all right, we're good. They're the closest to wanting this kid to succeed. So empowering them to be able to make these decisions is really fascinating.

**Ben Somers:** Yeah, the idea that you design your kid's education, not necessarily that you facilitate every part of it. It feels like a big shift. You're on a spectrum from "I dig all my soil and mix it with the cows that I have and make my own manure and find all the seeds and plant them all"—there's this video where one guy tries to make a chicken sandwich from scratch, truly from scratch, and it takes him six months and it's a terrible sandwich. The video is pretty entertaining.

On the other end is someone chooses every single meal for you and sends it to you and you have no choice in the matter. Most people actually want to definitely pick their meals and sometimes cook and do some other things with them. But if they had to do all that stuff on their own, they'd be like, please just someone feed me. But when you can make it really easy, they actually want to be involved. The fact that it's way easier to homeschool now and there are lots of good software materials and good online classes and tutors available, I think are a huge contributor to why homeschooling is getting way more popular.

**Ela Richmond:** I think it's easier to homeschool now than ever. A lot of the stigma is falling away as to what a homeschooler is.

**Ben Somers:** Where I am now in San Francisco—it's now high status to homeschool. Like it is the opposite. If someone in San Francisco hears another person in San Francisco is homeschooling, they assume that means those parents are really smart. They're doing something really good, different. The stigma is for sure falling away.

**Ela Richmond:** Isn't that fascinating that the privileged thing to do now is to be able to teach your own kids and take them out and choose how they learn?

**Ben Somers:** I think it makes sense because it means two things. One, you're dissatisfied with the quality of the education, which means you've got high standards. And two, it means you've organized your life in such a way that you can solve childcare and good instruction, that you've figured out how to carve out enough time to be able to do a good job with that and be able to figure out childcare in an expensive city. So it means you've got really high standards and you have a lot of control over what your lifestyle looks like.

**Ela Richmond:** What do you see, ideal world, the future of education looking like?

**Ben Somers:** Flexible campuses with lots of great resources and amenities. Pottery workshops and basketball courts and sports fields. They're flexible in that you can go at different times. You can come late, you can leave early. Your family can go on vacation for a week when you want. Your parent can come hang out with you for an hour in the middle of the day and get lunch if they've got the hour free. Nice places where kids can have lots of physical freedom and they get to know the same people from the time they're five to 18, so they can have long-standing relationships.

Plus, an extremely rigorous interactive dynamic learning experience. I'm really into this guy named Seymour Papert who has this concept of microworlds—how kids should learn things. They are immersed in a microworld. He talks about language learning and how much better language learning is when you're immersed in it. I can imagine this for things that aren't just learning foreign languages. I can imagine versions for math, versions—Ms. Frizzle's Magic School Bus. You get transported into the inside of a vein. That's how you start learning biology because you're trying to get out and you've got all these problems you encounter. The white blood cells come to attack you. That's how you learn about the immune system. I think that is the right model.

So one half is this wonderful physical place with great culture, great resources, tons of cool people, flexibility for the family and for the kid. Combined with spectacular interactive dynamic experiences that respond to the individual kid and make their learning experience really good and fun and interesting and visceral. So what it looks like is that campus plus a few hours a day working really hard on a screen.

**Ela Richmond:** Second question, give me the top two education books you'd recommend everybody read.

**Ben Somers:** I'm gonna give such lame answers. One is the dialogues—any of the conversations between Plato, Socrates and Aristotle. I only get two. That's too hard. Seymour Papert's *Mindstorms*, or actually *The Children's Machine* better.

**Ela Richmond:** That's a good one. I haven't read that one yet. I was very surprised whenever you said his name. I haven't heard of him before.

**Ben Somers:** I'm obsessed with that guy. If you want to figure out what I'm attempting to build, you can basically just read his books. Even the campus I described is somewhat similar to the way he envisioned. He talks about Samba schools and these different places. I really think he had it mostly down. Just the things he was trying to do were technically infeasible at the time.

**Ela Richmond:** The best way I've currently seen this done is in Kansas, they have this thing called a Learning Lab. Have you heard of it?

**Ben Somers:** I've heard of Learning Labs, but not the one in Kansas.

**Ela Richmond:** It's basically a kid coworking space. There are seven different school models inside of it. They have a ton of amazing resources. They have a podcast studio, video studio, what they call a mess lab, which is a decked out science lab, a whole print shop. The way their facility works is they have rooms that people can rent. There are microschools that rent them, different homeschool co-ops, and they also have a subscription model. So families can purchase a month of subscription and then they can just go in whenever.

**Ben Somers:** Wow. Is it working?

**Ela Richmond:** What's interesting is the people that have the hardest time buying into it are homeschoolers. People that are open to microschools, people that want an alternative type of education—they're down. But if they explain what they're doing as homeschooling, usually that's not the crowd that they hang out with. It's a really cool space. I'd recommend going to check it out if you ever have a chance.

**Ben Somers:** I will go. I like flying to go look at schools and hang out with them and see what they do right and do wrong. So I actually probably will reach out to them and see what's up.

**Ela Richmond:** I can introduce you. They're great. But I think it will take a cultural movement shift in the definition of what is education? What is homeschooling? How are we doing these things for it to work?

**Ben Somers:** True for all—sometimes I'll talk to other people who are working on education and it'll get competitive between different people. My perspective is none of us are fighting against each other really. We're really attempting to fight the status quo. The amount of dollars in education, the amount of room for expansion of new ideas is ginormous. We should figure out as a community, as ed tech, as people who are working on new things, how to help each other make that true. Because if there's anything we do to crack the—put cracks in the system, it'll have a much bigger impact for all of us, even as businesses, than it would be to compete for the relatively small alternative or homeschool market.

**Ela Richmond:** The thing I love about OpenEd is it was started with the mindset, we celebrate when a student leaves because they're going on to find something better. We are creating this robust ecosystem of educational options because if we actually believe that kids need something different—no child is standard, they're going to need different things. To be that prideful to say, yes, my company is going to solve every single homeschool need—you just can't do it. The more that people see this space as something that they can pick and choose from, the more you have to be okay with that. They're going to choose the best thing for them and that's good.

**Ben Somers:** Yeah. And I think it's extremely good for the overall system. When people get locked into contracts or experiences or products for too long—right now, when you're in school, you're kind of stuck there for a long time and you don't really leave the school except if it goes absolutely terribly. The school makes unilateral decisions. So you just don't get a lot of evolution. There's not a lot of iteration. The good products don't float to the top. They don't become popular. It's very hard to break into the model with new things. If you can move into a pick-a-mix world or a mix-and-match world, I think the products will get a lot better just by nature of the fact that people are making more choices.

**Ela Richmond:** Last question. When parents haven't found out yet what clicks for their kids, what do you recommend?

**Ben Somers:** Find out what video games they play. That's the most actionable piece of advice I can come up with. Your kid could play lots of different video games and they choose to play a small number of them. If they read a lot, what books they read. Video games, it tends to be easier for them to choose because the games are really made to be available to kids and easy to find. And hidden in their video game choices are a bunch of preferences about what kinds of problems they like to solve and what kinds of topics they like to think about. So don't look at them as trivial, look at them as signal. Go hang out with your kids and play video games for an hour. I think you'll come back thinking they're very passionate.

**Ela Richmond:** Very interesting. That was a perfect note to end it on. Thank you so much for coming on the podcast.

**Ben Somers:** This is really fun. You're great at this.
