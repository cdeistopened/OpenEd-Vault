**For OpenEd Daily**:
- **DRAFT B** is my recommendation - best balance of all angles

  - Empowering without being too provocative

**For Long-Form/Blog**:
- Use `Ben_Somers_Article_Ela_Voice.md` as written
  - Ela's voice adds personal vulnerability and authenticity
  - Bari Weiss style works well for this content
  - Length is slightly over target but flows naturally
  - Could trim 100 words if needed, but current version is strong

**For Podcast Promotion**:
- Could excerpt sections of article for social posts
