# DRAFT C: When Schools Medicate Kids to Fit the System

It wasn't about Ben. It was about the other kids. PLUS: The $10M lesson about what actually drives learning.

Greetings!

When Ben Somers was 11, he was put on 70mg of Concerta. He weighed about 100 pounds. That's a really large dose of methamphetamines for a kid.

The reason? He was a foot tapper. A wiggler. He moved around a lot in class.

Here's what Ben realized as an adult: **the medication wasn't about him. It was about making it easier for the teacher to deal with the classroom.** In his town that year, almost a quarter of all the boys were on stimulants.

This week we talked about his journey from that experience to building learning platforms—and what he discovered about what kids actually need to thrive.

Let's dive in.

## MEDICATED INTO COMPLIANCE

To fit into the standardized model of how you're supposed to learn, we load up hundred-pound 11-year-olds with drugs.

That's not me editorializing. That's Ben's experience—and the experience of 25% of boys in his school that year.

He was aware when he took the pill in the morning that his day looked way different. Anger issues. Constipation. Side effects everywhere. Years later, they discovered it had affected his puberty. But at the time, the priority was clear: make the disruptive kid sit still.

The system demands compliance. When a kid doesn't naturally fit the "sit still and listen" model, we medicate them until they do. We adapt the child to fit the system instead of adapting the system to fit the child.

**Which is why what Ben learned years later, working at Synthesis School, hit so hard.**

They spent roughly **$10 million a year developing the best educational games possible.** Hired the best game designers. Built complex team simulations. Iterated constantly based on data. You know what beat all of it?

Whether the kid had a friend in their class.

Not teacher credentials. Not curriculum quality. Not winning games. If a kid had one friend in class, they stuck around forever and performed better. Without a friend, they churned in 3-6 months.

Kids with friends could take criticism better, talked about what they learned outside class, made projects in their free time to share. **Connection unlocked everything.**

We spent millions optimizing content while ignoring what actually matters: relationships and choice.

## YOU'RE AN EDUCATION DESIGNER

So what does this mean for parents?

You're not supposed to be the teacher of everything. You're the education designer.

There's a guy who tried to make a chicken sandwich completely from scratch—grew the wheat, raised the chickens, harvested salt from the ocean. Six months later, he had a terrible sandwich. Most parents think homeschooling means becoming that guy.

But here's the actual shift: you don't need to personally deliver every lesson. You need to curate the right mix of resources, experiences, and relationships that work for your unique child.

The tools exist now. Some families cook every meal from scratch. Most people want to pick their meals and occasionally cook. When you make it easier to be involved, parents actually want to design the experience—they just don't want to grow the wheat.

Are you designing, or are you trying to be a one-person school system?

## WHERE KIDS DESIGN THEIR LEARNING

Recess is what happens when you build a platform around those insights: kids need friends, and they need choice.

**Kids browse a marketplace of classes** (taught by YouTubers and professionals) and **request the ones that excite them**. Parents approve or deny. So there's no such thing as a kid stuck in a class they don't want, and no parent paying for something they don't value.

When kids join a class, they meet others who like the same stuff. After class, Recess suggests those kids as friends and gives them Discord-style chat to stay connected. Kids can see what classes their friends are taking and easily join them.

Things trend on the platform—one kid gets into engineering, their friend joins, another friend joins, and suddenly you've got a wave of motivation spreading through actual friendships. Not medication. Not coercion. Just genuine interest spreading through social connection.

For California families using charter school funds, Recess handles all the approval and payment headaches. Every dollar actually goes toward your kid's education.

Your kid picks the classes. You approve them. Friends form naturally. That's Recess.
