# DRAFT A: You're Not a Teacher. You're an Education Designer.

When a quarter of boys are medicated to fit the system, something's broken. PLUS: What $10M couldn't buy.

Greetings!

This week I sat down with Ben Somers, founder of Recess. When he was 11, Ben was put on 70mg of Concerta—not because he needed it, but because the system did. He was a foot tapper. A wiggler. In his town that year, a quarter of all the boys were on stimulants.

Today he's building platforms that adapt to how kids actually learn. The conversation kept coming back to one shift: parents aren't supposed to be teachers of everything. They're education designers.

Let's dive in.

## THE EDUCATION DESIGNER

There's a guy who tried to make a chicken sandwich completely from scratch. Grew the wheat for the bun, raised the chickens, harvested salt from the ocean—the whole thing. Six months later, he had... a terrible sandwich.

Most parents think homeschooling means becoming that guy. You dig your own soil, grow everything yourself, and hopefully don't produce a terrible sandwich after six months of exhaustion.

Ben Somers has a different take: **you're not supposed to be the teacher of everything. You're the education designer.**

You don't need to personally deliver every math lesson, science experiment, and writing workshop. You need to curate the right mix of resources, experiences, and relationships that work for your unique child. Some families cook every meal from scratch. Most people want to pick their meals and occasionally cook. When you make it easier to be involved, parents actually want to design the experience—they just don't want to grow the wheat.

The tools exist now. The question is: are you designing, or are you trying to be a one-person school system?

## 25% MEDICATED TO FIT

Here's what Ben learned the hard way.

The medication wasn't about him. It was about making it easier for the teacher to manage the classroom. He was disruptive, talked a lot, ran around. So they medicated him into compliance. **In his town that year, 25% of all the boys were on some kind of ADHD medication.**

Looking back as an adult, Ben sees it clearly: to fit into the standardized model of how you're supposed to learn, we load up hundred-pound 11-year-olds with methamphetamines. That seems really crazy. There has to be a better way. {make this a quote!}

The system adapts children to fit the model instead of adapting the model to fit children.

Which brings us to what Ben discovered when he worked at Synthesis School (the SpaceX school). They spent **$10 million a year on developing the best educational games possible.** You know what beat all of it? Whether the kid had a friend in their class.

Not teacher credentials. Not curriculum quality. Not winning the games. If a kid had one friend in class, they stuck around forever and performed better. Without a friend, they churned in 3-6 months—regardless of how "good" everything else was.

## WHERE KIDS DESIGN THEIR LEARNING

Recess is what happens when you build a platform around those insights: you need friends, and you need choice.

**Kids browse a marketplace of classes** (taught by YouTubers and professionals) and **request the ones that excite them**. Parents approve or deny. So there's no such thing as a kid stuck in a class they don't want, and no parent paying for something they don't value.

When kids join a class, they meet others who like the same stuff. After class, Recess suggests those kids as friends and gives them Discord-style chat to stay connected. Then kids can see what classes their friends are taking and easily join them.

Things trend on the platform—one kid gets into engineering, their friend joins, another friend joins, and suddenly you've got a wave of motivation spreading through actual friendships.

Your kid picks the classes. You approve them. Friends form naturally. That's Recess.
