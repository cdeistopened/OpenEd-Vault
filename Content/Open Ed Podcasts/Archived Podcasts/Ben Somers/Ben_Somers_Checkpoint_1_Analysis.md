# Ben Somers - Checkpoint 1 Analysis & Asset Proposals

## Core Message & Hooks

### Big Ideas (3-5 Provocative, Brand-Aligned Takeaways)

1. **Schools are medicating kids into compliance instead of adapting to how children naturally learn** - A quarter of boys in Ben's school were on stimulants just to fit the system, revealing how broken the "sit still and listen" model truly is.

2. **The #1 predictor of learning success isn't curriculum quality or teacher credentials - it's whether kids have a friend in class** - Companies spend millions on content while ignoring the free solution that actually drives retention and performance.

3. **Kids labeled as "unmotivated" instantly transform when given choice and autonomy** - The same child who can't memorize 50 state capitals will memorize 372 Pokemon because true learning happens when curiosity leads, not compliance.

4. **Parents don't need to be teachers - they need to be education designers** - The future of homeschooling isn't about doing it all yourself, it's about curating the right mix of resources, experiences, and relationships for your unique child.

5. **Technology isn't the enemy - bad digital environments are** - Instead of banning screens, we should be building curated digital spaces that align with family values and turn passive consumption into active learning.

### Key Questions Answered

**For Parents Considering Alternatives:**
- How do I know if my child's struggles are a "them" problem or a "system" problem?
- Can I really provide a quality education without being an expert in every subject?
- How do I balance giving my child freedom while ensuring they learn essential skills?

**For Homeschooling Parents:**
- How do I provide the social connection my child needs outside traditional school?
- What's the right balance between child-led learning and necessary structure?
- How can I use technology safely and productively in our homeschool?

**For All Parents:**
- What if my "unmotivated" child is actually just in the wrong environment?
- How do I design an education that celebrates my child's uniqueness rather than suppressing it?

### Cold Open Candidate #1: "The Medication Story" (Dramatic/Emotional Hook)

**Timestamp:** 00:01 - 03:58 (edited)

**Hook Angle:** A shocking personal story that exposes the dark side of standardized education's compliance model.

**Edited Transcript:**

**Ela Richmond:** Ben, welcome to the podcast. I wanted to kick this off with a question that I've been wondering ever since you and I started talking backstage. What got you interested in education to begin with?

**Ben Somers:** ~~I was truant from grade six to grade nine and dropped out of high school. And I think that probably some, really didn't like school as a kid, but I spent a lot of time doing school and like worked pretty hard in it. And yeah, actually the other thing is that~~ When I was 11, I had this teacher who was really frustrated that I was kind of like a foot tapper and wiggler. ~~And I'd move around a lot. And so kind of,~~ We had to go see a psychiatrist and I went on 70 milligrams of Concerta ~~, which is one of the drugs you can take at 11~~ when I weighed like a hundred pounds. And that's a really large dose of methamphetamines. ~~And I think it developed some...~~

~~I was already like a little rebellious as a kid and felt rebellious in school. And then~~ Now as an adult looking back, I think this idea that to fit into this model of how you're supposed to learn, you're supposed to just load up ~~like~~ a hundred pound, 11 year olds with tons of drugs. ~~And~~ I'm like, that seems really crazy. And there has to be a better way than that. ~~So I guess something about, I felt wronged during my school process, but I liked learning and liked a bunch of my teachers. And so I can imagine a version that's much better.~~

**Ela Richmond:** ~~Yeah, that's crazy.~~ Did you in the moment know that it was wrong ~~or like know that you didn't enjoy it~~?

**Ben Somers:** For sure. Do you know how much 70 milligrams of methamphetamines are? If you're 100 pounds and you take that, ~~you're you're~~ really going and ~~like~~ you have anger issues, you have all these things, you're ~~like~~ crazy constipated. ~~Like there's like a ton of...~~ There's a ton of side effects. ~~Yeah, and it actually like, we went to an endocrinologist years later, whatever, and it had some effects on like my puberty and things like that, but they think, they don't really know. The causes there are questionable.~~ But for sure, when I was 11, I was aware that when I took this pill in the morning, my day looked way different.

**Ela Richmond:** ~~Wow. And like the~~ The purpose of the pill was just to keep you ~~like~~ paying attention ~~and what you needed to be in school or like~~?

**Ben Somers:** ~~I think that was not, I mean, had tons of great teachers. My fifth grade teacher was not good. I think there,~~ It was really about the other kids. It wasn't about me~~, which I like understand. You know,~~ I think I was ~~like~~ disruptive and probably talked a lot and was running around all the time. And so it was ~~like~~ to make it easier for the teacher to deal with the classroom and make it a better experience for ~~their~~ the other kids. ~~What's funny is~~ In my town that year, I think ~~like~~ almost a quarter of all the boys in the school were on stimulants. ~~Yeah.~~

### Cold Open Candidate #2: "The Friend Discovery" (Counterintuitive Insight)

**Timestamp:** 08:37 - 11:27 (edited)

**Hook Angle:** A business insight that challenges everything we think we know about what makes education work.

**Edited Transcript:**

**Ben Somers:** There were two core insights ~~that were very specific, I'd say, and then other ones that like like I walked away from saying, I'm going to start a company around these ideas and this thing I learned. And then now I look back and it's like, oh, there's other stuff that philosophically made its way in. But~~ The first was that the number one predictor of retention ~~. And this is a business metric, but also a learning metric.~~

Was if the kid had a friend in their class. So it wasn't who the teacher was, whether they were Illinois teacher of the year, or they were one of the ~~Josh Mo's who didn't was not, didn't, didn't work out great at synthesis. That didn't affect retention that much.~~ If you won a ton of games or lost a ton of games, didn't affect retention that much. ~~There were all these things that you'd expect,~~ Which game you were playing, ~~you know,~~ if you're playing a fun game or a bad game~~, because the games are different, some of them are really great, some of are bad.~~ That didn't make that big of a difference. ~~And like, those are crazy. I would have put all of this first, but it really,~~ If you had a friend in your class, you stuck around forever. If you didn't, you churned in three to six months. ~~And that struck me as being a big deal because you got to make your business work if you're in education and you got to figure out how to do that. So, and then my anecdotal experience was that...~~

The kids performed way better when they had a friend in the class. They could take criticism from the teacher or from their peers way better when they had a friend in the class. They would talk about it sometimes when they weren't in the class. So they actually were progressing because they were thinking about it in their free time or talking about it in their free time. ~~They're like all these things or making~~ Making maps in their free time because they would make it and send it to their friend. ~~And there were like all these things that were,~~ I was ~~kind of~~ shocked by how much a good social experience led to a better learning experience.

~~And a better business model. And I was like, that's really interesting.~~ We spent, at one point, ~~like,~~ I wanna say $10 million a year on games. ~~It's probably $10 million a year on engineering as a whole, so maybe like $7 million on games and like that. And.~~ The games had less of an impact on retention than friend in a class, which is close to free.

~~So from a business perspective, I was like, that's really, we really gotta laser in on this and make this experience really good. And then the learning one was true too. So that was the first part.~~ Everyone was sleeping on friends, ~~like a lot,~~ both to make their products sticky and fun and good and to make the learning experience better.

### Cold Open Candidate #3: "The Pokemon Revelation" (Transformation Story)

**Timestamp:** 19:52 - 20:50 (edited)

**Hook Angle:** A moment that reframes how we think about "unmotivated" kids.

**Edited Transcript:**

**Ben Somers:** ~~I think I'm continuously surprised by...~~ ~~How like~~ A lot of people would try to label kids as being ~~like~~ motivated or diligent or ambitious ~~or whatever or curious.~~

~~And~~ I've been surprised at how often kids you would label as none of those things totally morph into absolutely those things in the right circumstance. ~~Like~~ When you get them going about their thing, ~~and like~~ we all know this intuitively, ~~like~~ You ask some kid ~~about~~ who ~~like~~ can't memorize state capitals and then you ask them and ~~can~~ list ~~Rattleoff.~~ all 372 Pokemon and which ones were a part of the different leagues ~~and like~~ memorize them perfectly ~~and like~~ all their moves ~~and it's like~~ this doesn't make sense ~~like~~ you can't remember 50 things that are pretty easy but [you can remember 372 complex Pokemon]...

**Ela Richmond:** ~~That's interesting. What do you think that means? So like, there's a lot of criticism around homeschool approaches, more unschool approaches, right? Like, let your kid do a lot of what they like. And this probably depends on the kid and their personal interests, their self-directedness. It probably depends on the kid.~~

**Ben Somers:** ~~Yeah.~~

**Ela Richmond:** ~~But there's a lot of criticism around an unschooling approach, because it's like, OK, but in life,~~ There are things that you have to do, right? ~~And like, for example, you might not want to memorize the 50 states, but at some point, yeah, or taxes, yeah, exactly. There are some things that you have to do. And I've heard the criticism quite often that, like, are you preparing kids for a world where they don't feel like they have to do the things that they have to do? I'm curious to hear your take on the balance between...~~

~~Having them figure out what they're interested in and fostering that and really, really promoting that as a thing that is valuable. Yes, you're interested in Pokemon and that's the coolest thing ever, but then also, okay, well, math, right? How do we make that really, really interesting? Or maybe it's history. Yeah, I'm curious to hear your take on that.~~

**Ben Somers:** ~~I have a few thoughts. The first is.~~ Things have a reason. ~~And I, I think it's useful if you can attempt to figure out what the reason that you do things are.~~ Like I'm particularly bad at doing things I don't want to do or that I don't think matter ~~or things that I have to do. And I like, I don't entirely reject the premise. I do think there are things you have to do, but~~ I'm way more willing to pay my taxes when I think about the purpose of taxes and the purpose of a country and what it means to be a citizen~~and all these things. And like, when I start to think about them, even though I don't like doing the paperwork and these things, but~~ At the same time, ~~I think like,~~ this is where good entrepreneurs come from. You're doing your taxes and you're like, this is ~~a~~ total nonsense. ~~Like,~~ Why do I have to do it this way? And someone is like, well, maybe you don't have to, maybe we could make something that would make it simpler~~to do this.~~

### Clip #3: "372 Pokemon"

**Hook:** Viral moment that every parent with a "distracted" kid will relate to

**Timestamp:** 19:52 - 20:36

**Full Edited Transcript:**

**Ben Somers:** I've been surprised at how often kids you would label as none of those things totally morph into absolutely those things in the right circumstance. When you get them going about their thing, we all know this intuitively. You ask some kid who can't memorize state capitals and then you ask them and they can list all 372 Pokemon and which ones were a part of the different leagues and memorize them perfectly and all their moves. This doesn't make sense - you can't remember 50 things that are pretty easy but [you can remember 372]...

### Clip #4: "Parents as Education Designers"

**Hook:** Paradigm shift for homeschool parents - you don't have to teach everything

**Timestamp:** 33:18 - 35:47

**Full Edited Transcript:**

**Ela Richmond:** I never thought I'd be a good homeschool mom. Cause I always thought homeschooling was I'm gonna sit in front of, you know, a whiteboard and I'm going to personally be the one to teach you every single subject forever. And that never excited me. Like I'm not a teacher. I don't think I could explain it well. I think I'd get frustrated. And really expanding my idea to, okay, I'm not necessarily having to open myself up to being the teacher and everything. Rather, I'm becoming like an education designer. What could my child's education become? And I'm designing the education that aligns with our values, that aligns with them.

**Ben Somers:** Yes. Yes.

**Ela Richmond:** And that becomes something that can help them to become who they could possibly be, kind of back to what you and I were talking about. You get into education thinking, oh, if I had these different experiences, who could I possibly be? And as a parent, you now get to look down at your kid and you're like, okay, who could you possibly be? Let's figure it out. And that is infinitely more exciting to me than the alternative.

**On-Screen Text Options:**

1. **Paradigm Shift:** "You're not a teacher. You're an education designer."
2. **Permission Grant:** "You don't have to teach everything yourself"
3. **Reframe:** "From 'Can I do this?' to 'What could this become?'"

5. **Homeschool Mom Relief:** "I don't have to stand at a whiteboard forever"
6. **Empowerment:** "Design the education your child deserves"
7. **Identity Shift:** "Parent → Teacher ❌ Parent → Designer ✅"

### Clip #5: "Curated Digital Environments"

**Hook:** Solves the screen time dilemma every parent struggles with

**Timestamp:** 28:00 - 29:44 + 30:44 - 32:10 (combined)

**Full Edited Transcript:**

**Ben Somers:** The second part is kind of the Montessori idea. She really wanted to give the kid a lot of freedom and have the kid learn independence and learn self-motivation and how to focus themselves. And so she would let the kids choose whatever they wanted within a curated environment. So you couldn't bring your toys from home in. But anything she had in her space, you could take out and play with.

If you grew up in a nice town that's super safe, where your parents spend a lot of time learning, working, doing interesting things, they have good value systems, the kid can have a ton of freedom from the time they're eight years old. I think if you grew up in other environments where there are tons of bad influences around and lots of negativity and potentially even violence, you shouldn't get a lot of freedom as a kid. And so the better you can make the environments, and this is where I get super obsessed is the digital environment.

Almost every parent I know with a kid under 10 is terrified of screens. Has a lot of anxiety about them, frustrations about them, doesn't want their kid on them, worrying about how much time to spend on them.

**Ela Richmond:** I love this idea of curating the environment and then having kids earn a higher level of freedom as they get to it. But how do you determine when is the right point to expose them to things that are highly addictive?

**Ben Somers:** You can't rely on the tech to raise your kids correctly or to teach the kids how to use them safely. They will not do that. That really has to be you. Or you work on the thing I'm working on, which I hope will have this effect. You download an app on your iPad and it turns your iPad from bad to great. It goes from something you really are nervous about giving your kid to something you are absolutely hyped to give your kid.

**On-Screen Text Options:**

1. **Paradigm Shift:** "Screens aren't bad. Bad environments are."
2. **Montessori Wisdom:** "Freedom within a curated environment"
3. **Parent Solution:** "Turn your kid's iPad from bad to great"
4. **The Real Problem:** "We're not banning screens. We're building better ones."
5. **Permission + Protection:** "Maximum freedom in the right environment"
6. **Tech Parent Relief:** "From terrified to hyped about screen time"
7. **Digital Montessori:** "Curate the environment, then give them freedom"

### Clip #6: "High-Status Homeschooling"

**Hook:** Cultural shift moment - homeschooling is now the privileged choice

**Timestamp:** 42:33 - 44:12

**Full Edited Transcript:**

**Ben Somers:** In San Francisco now, it's high status to homeschool. Like it is the opposite. If someone in San Francisco hears another person in San Francisco is homeschooling, they assume that means like, those parents are really smart. They're doing something really good, different. The stigma is for sure falling away.

**Ela Richmond:** Isn't that fascinating that the privileged thing to do now is to be able to teach your own kids and take them out and choose how they learn and imbue your culture?

**Ben Somers:** It makes a lot of sense. It means two things. It means one, you're dissatisfied with the quality of the education, which means you've got high standards. And two, it means you've organized your life in such a way that you can solve childcare and good instruction. You've figured out how to carve out enough time to be able to do a good job with that and be able to figure out childcare in an expensive city. It means that you've got really high standards and you have a lot of control over what your lifestyle looks like.

**On-Screen Text Options:**

1. **Status Flip:** "In San Francisco, homeschooling is now high status"
2. **Cultural Moment:** "The stigma has flipped"
3. **Paradigm Shift:** "Homeschooling = high standards + life control"
4. **Permission Grant:** "Taking control of your kid's education is now privileged"
5. **Counter-Narrative:** "From weird to wealthy: the homeschool shift"
6. **Bold Claim:** "Smart parents are pulling their kids out"
7. **Identity Shift:** "Homeschoolers aren't weird. They're winning."
