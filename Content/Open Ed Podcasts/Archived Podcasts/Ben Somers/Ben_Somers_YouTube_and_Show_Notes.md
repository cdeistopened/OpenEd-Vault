### Edited Cold Open Transcript:

**Ela Richmond:** What got you interested in education to begin with?

**Ben Somers:** When I was 11, I had this teacher who was really frustrated that I was kind of like a foot tapper and wiggler. We had to go see a psychiatrist and I went on 70 milligrams of Concerta when I weighed like a hundred pounds. That's a really large dose of methamphetamines.

Now as an adult looking back, to fit into this model of how you're supposed to learn, you're supposed to just load up a hundred pound, 11 year olds with tons of drugs. I'm like, that seems really crazy.

**Ela Richmond:** Did you in the moment know that it was wrong?

**Ben Somers:** For sure. When I was 11, I was aware that when I took this pill in the morning, my day looked way different.

**Ela Richmond:** The purpose of the pill was just to keep you paying attention?

**Ben Somers:** It was really about the other kids. It wasn't about me. I was disruptive and probably talked a lot and was running around all the time. So it was to make it easier for the teacher to deal with the classroom. In my town that year, almost a quarter of all the boys in the school were on stimulants.

**(Swoosh Effect / Cut)**

**Ben Somers:** I've been surprised at how often kids you would label as unmotivated totally morph into absolutely those things in the right circumstance. You ask some kid who can't memorize state capitals and they can list all 372 Pokemon and which ones were a part of the different leagues and memorize them perfectly and all their moves. This doesn't make sense...

## YouTube Description

**Hook:**
In 2025, we're still medicating boys at alarming rates just to make them fit a learning model designed for compliance, not curiosity. Ben Somers was put on 70mg of Concerta at age 11—not because he needed it, but because the system did. Now he's building the alternative.

**What's Inside:**
- Why a quarter of boys in Ben's school were medicated to comply
- The shocking business insight: what actually makes kids want to learn (it's not curriculum)
- How kids labeled "unmotivated" transform instantly in the right environment
- The Montessori principle applied to digital spaces and modern homeschooling
- Why parents should think of themselves as education designers, not teachers

**About Ben Somers:**
Ben dropped out of high school and later worked at Synthesis School (the SpaceX school) before founding Recess, a platform where kids choose their own classes and make friends who share their interests. He's now building tools to turn screens from "bad" to "great" for families.

### Spotify/Podcast Platforms:
- **Title:** "Ben Somers: Why So Many Boys Are Medicated in School (And What Actually Makes Kids Want to Learn)"
- **Description:** Use same hook and bullet points, but add: "Listen as Ben shares his personal story of being medicated at 11, the shocking insights from working at the SpaceX school, and why the #1 predictor of learning success isn't what you think."

### Instagram/TikTok (for clips):
- Lead with visual/emotional moments
- Use chapter titles as video hooks
