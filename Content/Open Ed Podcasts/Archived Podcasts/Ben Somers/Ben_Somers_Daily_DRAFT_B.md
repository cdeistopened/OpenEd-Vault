# DRAFT B: You're Not a Teacher. You're an Education Designer.

25% of boys medicated to fit the system. And what actually works instead. PLUS: Why homeschooling is now high-status in San Francisco.

Greetings!

Ben Somers was 11 when a teacher, frustrated that he was a foot tapper and wiggler, sent him to a psychiatrist. He was put on 70mg of Concerta—roughly a quarter of boys in his school were on stimulants that year. Not to help them learn better. To make them easier to manage.

Fast forward: Ben now builds learning platforms. This week we talked about what he discovered along the way—including why, in San Francisco of all places, homeschooling has become the high-status choice.

Let's dive in.

## THE EDUCATION DESIGNER

There's a guy who tried to make a chicken sandwich completely from scratch. Grew the wheat for the bun, raised the chickens, harvested salt from the ocean—the whole thing. Six months later, he had a terrible sandwich.

Most parents think homeschooling means becoming that guy. You dig your own soil, grow everything yourself, and hopefully don't produce a terrible sandwich after six months of exhaustion.

Ben has a different take: **you're not supposed to be the teacher of everything. You're the education designer.**

You don't need to personally deliver every math lesson, science experiment, and writing workshop. You need to curate the right mix of resources, experiences, and relationships that work for your unique child. The tools exist now. The question is: are you designing, or are you trying to be a one-person school system?

When you make it easier to be involved, parents actually want to design the experience—they just don't want to grow the wheat.

## HIGH-STATUS HOMESCHOOLING

In San Francisco, homeschooling is now high-status.

I know, I know—San Francisco, the progressive capital, where you'd expect public school to reign supreme. But when someone there hears another parent is homeschooling, they assume it means those parents are really smart. They're doing something good, different. The stigma has flipped.

**Why? Two things.**

First, it signals you're dissatisfied with the quality of conventional education—which means you have high standards. Second, it means you've organized your life in such a way that you can solve childcare and instruction yourself. You've carved out enough time and figured out how to make it work in an expensive city. High standards plus life control equals status.

Of course, this feels a bit elitist—and it is. But here's what's interesting: **the reason homeschooling is easier now isn't just resources. It's realizing you don't have to do everything yourself.**

Back to Ben's story about being medicated. The system's answer to an active 11-year-old? Drug him into compliance. Load up a hundred-pound kid with methamphetamines so he fits the "sit still and listen" model. In his town, **25% of all boys were on stimulants** that year.

The system adapts the child to fit the model. Homeschooling—especially the mix-and-match kind we talk about here—adapts the model to fit the child. That's the actual privilege worth having.

## WHERE KIDS DESIGN THEIR LEARNING

Recess is what happens when you build a platform around kid choice and friend-making.

**Kids browse a marketplace of classes** (taught by YouTubers and professionals) and **request the ones that excite them**. Parents approve or deny. So there's no such thing as a kid stuck in a class they don't want, and no parent paying for something they don't value.

When kids join a class, they meet others who like the same stuff. After class, Recess suggests those kids as friends and gives them Discord-style chat to stay connected. Then kids can see what classes their friends are taking and easily join them.

Things trend on the platform—one kid gets into engineering, their friend joins, another friend joins, and suddenly you've got a wave of motivation spreading through actual friendships. Not coercion. Not medication. Just genuine interest spreading through social connection.

For California families using charter school funds, Recess handles all the approval and payment headaches.

Your kid picks the classes. You approve them. Friends form naturally. That's Recess.
