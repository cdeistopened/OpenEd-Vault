## Meme Distribution Strategy

### Recommended Memes to Create:

**Priority 1: Drake Pointing Meme**
- Use for Instagram Post 1
- Repurpose for Twitter
- High shareability, low controversy

**Priority 2: Two Buttons Sweating Guy**
- Use for Twitter/X engagement
- More provocative, drives conversation
- Good for newsletter ending

**Priority 3: Brain Expansion Meme**
- Use for LinkedIn (more professional looking)
- Use for Instagram Stories
- Positive, aspirational

## Newsletter Integration

**Add to end of newsletter (before signature):**

```

**P.S.** Someone needs to make a meme of that guy sweating over two buttons:

Button 1: "Adapt education system to fit energetic 11-year-olds"
Button 2: "Put 25% of boys on methamphetamines"

[Guy labeled "Traditional Education System" sweating profusely]

Somehow we picked button 2. Send this to a friend who needs to hear there's a better way.
