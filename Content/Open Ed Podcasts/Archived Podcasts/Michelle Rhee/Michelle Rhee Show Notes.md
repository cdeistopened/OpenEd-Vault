# Michelle Rhee: From Classroom Chaos to Education Reform Champion | Show Notes

## Episode Description

Every educator knows the moment when you've lost control of your classroom. Michelle Rhee—the woman who transformed Washington DC's failing school system from worst in the nation to leading the country in academic gains—once had students who "ate her for lunch." Her first-year teaching experience was so catastrophic that parents pulled their kids from her classroom. Yet by her third year, those same parents were begging her to stay. Her transformation wasn't magic—it was strategy, structure, and an unwavering commitment to not letting eight-year-olds run her out of town. From classroom disaster to DC Schools Chancellor to venture capitalist, Michelle's journey offers powerful lessons for anyone committed to transforming how children learn.
