# How to Regain Control of Your Students When You've Lost the Classroom

*Lessons from Michelle Rhee's transformation from classroom disaster to education champion*

---

Every parent who's stepped into the role of educator knows the moment: you've lost them. The kids are talking over you, ignoring assignments, and what started as an organized lesson has devolved into chaos. You're wondering if you're cut out for this, if maybe you should just send them back to traditional school.

Before you give up, consider this: Michelle Rhee—the woman who would go on to transform Washington DC's failing school system from worst in the nation to leading the country in academic gains—once had students who "ate her for lunch."

Her first-year teaching experience at Baltimore's Harlem Park Elementary was so catastrophic that parents pulled their kids from her classroom. Yet by her third year, those same parents were begging her to stay and teach their younger children. The transformation wasn't magic—it was strategy, structure, and an unwavering commitment to not letting eight-year-olds run her out of town.

## The Moment of Truth: When Everything Falls Apart

Rhee's rock bottom came in her first year teaching 36 second-graders in Baltimore—the lowest-performing kids academically and behaviorally in the school. "They freaking ate me for lunch," she recalls. "Some of the lowest moments of my life were in that classroom."

The breaking point came when, in frustration, she asked her students: "Do you want me to just leave and go teach some rich kids somewhere?" One student looked at her and said, "If you want to, what are you talking about lady?"

That moment of brutal honesty from an eight-year-old changed everything. As Rhee puts it: "I was like, 'I am not gonna let eight-year-olds run me out of town. This is ridiculous.'"

Sound familiar? Whether you're homeschooling, running a learning pod, or just trying to get through homework time, every parent-educator faces moments when the students seem to have all the power and you're scrambling to regain control.

## The Summer That Changed Everything

Instead of quitting, Rhee spent her entire summer between first and second year planning. She attended professional development sessions, studied classroom management techniques, and most importantly, she developed a partnership strategy with a colleague.

The lesson for parent-educators is clear: when you're overwhelmed, don't go it alone. Rhee and her teaching partner Michelle Jacobs decided to combine their classrooms—60 kids total—and team-teach with each person leading their strengths. Jacobs handled reading while Rhee focused on math.

For homeschooling families, this might mean:
- Partnering with other homeschool families to share teaching responsibilities
- Joining co-ops where different parents teach different subjects
- Utilizing online resources and tutors for subjects outside your expertise
- Creating accountability partnerships with other parent-educators

## The Power of Consistency and High Expectations

Rhee's transformation strategy had three key components that any parent-educator can implement:

### 1. Structure Over Chaos
Where traditional wisdom might say "give kids freedom," Rhee recognized that her students needed more structure, not less. "When you go home, it's not like our students were going to soccer practice and piano lessons. They were just going to go home and sit on the stoop all afternoon."

She gave them two hours of homework nightly and kept them after school for additional instruction. The key insight: **context matters**. Kids from chaotic environments need more structure, while over-scheduled kids might need more freedom.

### 2. Investment in Excellence
"We got them really invested in their academics and doing well," Rhee explains. At first, parents pushed back: "This is too much. What are you doing? You're asking for too much." But as students began showing progress and pride in their accomplishments, families bought in completely.

The lesson: don't lower your standards to meet resistance. Raise your students to meet your standards.

### 3. The Looping Advantage
Perhaps most importantly, Rhee and her partner decided to "loop" with their students—teaching the same group for multiple years. "That second year, that's when we saw massive acceleration. We didn't have to spend the first month of school learning each other."

For homeschoolers, this is a natural advantage. You're already positioned to provide the continuity that research shows is crucial for academic success. As Rhee notes: "People who have done it, both on the family side and on the teacher side, they swear by it."

## The Transformation Results

The results speak for themselves. Rhee's students, who started "performing on average at the 13th percentile on nationally recognized standardized tests," ended up with "the majority on grade level" by the end of their second year together.

But the real victory wasn't just academic—it was relational. The same parents who had initially pulled their kids from her classroom were eventually asking, "Where are you going? We got some other kids that you need to be here to teach."

## Practical Steps for Regaining Control

Based on Rhee's experience, here's your action plan when you've lost control of your classroom:

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Take a step back and plan**: Don't try to fix everything in the moment. Use evenings or weekends to strategize.
2. **Identify your strengths**: What subjects or activities do you handle well? Lean into those while addressing weaknesses.
3. **Set non-negotiable standards**: Decide what behaviors and academic expectations are absolutely required.

### Medium-term Strategies:
1. **Find your teaching partner**: Whether it's a spouse, another parent, or online resources, don't try to do everything yourself.
2. **Increase structure where needed**: If your kids are struggling with freedom, provide more guidance and boundaries.
3. **Invest in relationships**: Spend time getting to know each child's learning style and motivations.

### Long-term Vision:
1. **Embrace the looping advantage**: Use your multi-year relationship with your students to build deeper learning.
2. **Focus on growth, not perfection**: Track progress over time rather than comparing to arbitrary standards.
3. **Stay committed to the transformation**: Real change takes time—Rhee's turnaround took two full years.

## The Bigger Picture: Why This Matters

Rhee's experience reveals a crucial truth: "The environment these kids were growing up in didn't change—their healthcare, the food they were eating, who their parents were. None of that changed. What changed were the adults who were in front of them every single day in the classroom and what we were doing with that time."

As a parent-educator, you are that adult. You have the power to transform your children's educational experience, even when everything seems to be falling apart. The question isn't whether you're qualified—it's whether you're committed.

## The Choice Is Yours

Michelle Rhee could have quit after that first disastrous year. She could have decided that teaching wasn't for her, that some kids are just too difficult, that the system was broken beyond repair. Instead, she chose to dig deeper, plan better, and refuse to give up.

Today, she reflects: "I wanted to do something that was going to fix" the inequality she saw in education. That same spirit—the refusal to accept that some kids can't learn, that some situations can't improve—is what drives successful parent-educators.

When you feel like you've lost control of your classroom, remember: you're not the first person to feel this way, and you won't be the last. But with the right strategies, partnerships, and commitment, you can create the same kind of transformation that took Michelle Rhee from complete disaster to educational champion.

The only question is: are you ready to refuse to let anyone—including yourself—run you out of town?
