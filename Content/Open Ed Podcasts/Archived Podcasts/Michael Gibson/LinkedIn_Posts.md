## Post 1: Based on "The Unsolvable Problem"

**Video Clip:** Clip 1
**Core Concept:** The power of not knowing something is "impossible."

**Post Copy:**

What most people get wrong about genius:

MYTH: The world's hardest problems are solved by seasoned experts with decades of experience.

TRUTH: They're often solved by someone who didn't know they were supposed to be hard in the first place.

There's a legendary story about a Berkeley grad student who showed up late to class and mistook two of the field's most famous *unsolved* problems for the homework assignment.

He just went home and did them.

He later said that if he'd known they were considered "unsolvable," he never would have even tried.

Our system is obsessed with telling young people what's "impossible."

What if we stopped teaching them the limits and started encouraging them to test them?

Listen to the full story on the latest OpenEd podcast with Michael Gibson of 1517 Fund.

## Post 2: Based on "The Startup is the Real School"

**Video Clip:** Clip 2
**Core Concept:** Building a company is the ultimate education.

**Post Copy:**

What an elite degree ACTUALLY requires (that no one talks about):

• Following instructions someone else wrote.
• Solving problems someone else defined.
• Delaying real-world feedback for years.
• Getting good at a game with no real stakes.

What building a startup ACTUALLY requires:

• Confronting your own flaws, daily.
• Making decisions with incomplete information.
• Learning to sell, build, and lead, simultaneously.
• Developing a tolerance for high-stakes ambiguity.

One path trains you to be a good employee.
The other forges you into a capable person.

As Michael Gibson says on our latest podcast, a failed startup is a better education than an MBA.

Agree?

## Post 3: Based on "We Must Rewild the American Child"

**Video Clip:** Clip 3
**Core Concept:** We need to give kids more freedom and less supervision.

**Post Copy:**

The real flex as a parent isn't getting your kid into an elite school.

It's raising a kid who doesn't need one.

We've created a generation with a "brittle dependence" on institutions, says 1517 Fund's Michael Gibson.

By scheduling every hour and supervising every move, we're robbing our kids of the one thing they need to handle the real world: the ability to manage risk on their own.

It's time to stop managing their lives and let them go.

It's time to rewild the American child.

## Post 1: Based on "The Unsolvable Problem"

**Video Clip:** Clip 1
**Core Concept:** The power of not knowing something is "impossible."

**Post Copy:**

Your child's greatest strength is that they don't know what's "impossible" yet.

Agree or disagree?

I was so struck by a story Michael Gibson shared on our podcast this week.

A Berkeley grad student was late to class and saw some problems on the blackboard. He thought it was homework.

He went home and solved one.

It turned out to be one of the most famous unsolved problems in statistics.

He only succeeded because no one had told him he was supposed to fail.

It makes me wonder: how often do we, as parents and educators, accidentally place limits on our kids by telling them what can't be done?

What could they achieve if we just got out of their way?

## Post 2: Based on "The Startup is the Real School"

**Video Clip:** Clip 2
**Core Concept:** Building a company is the ultimate education.

**Post Copy:**

I was talking to a young founder the other day who had just shut down his first company.

He wasn't defeated. He was energized.

He told me, "I learned more in that one year of failure than in four years of college. I learned about my own fears, my blind spots, and what it actually takes to make something people want."

It reminded me of what Michael Gibson says on our new podcast: a startup is a project of self-knowledge. It exposes every flaw and forces you to grow in ways a classroom never can.

We're so focused on protecting our kids from failure.

But what if failure is the best teacher they'll ever have?

I'm curious... what's the most valuable lesson you've learned outside of a classroom?

## Post 3: Based on "We Must Rewild the American Child"

**Video Clip:** Clip 3
**Core Concept:** We need to give kids more freedom and less supervision.

**Post Copy:**

I've noticed a pattern:

The most capable and resilient young people I meet all have one thing in common.

It's not their GPA, their test scores, or the college they went to.

It's that at some point in their childhood, they were given the freedom to be truly on their own.

To get lost. To get bored. To build something, break something, and figure out how to fix it without a parent rushing in to help.

In our conversation with Michael Gibson, he called this "rewilding" the American child.

We're building a generation that is dependent on institutions for their goals and identity. The antidote isn't a better school.

It's a wilder childhood.

# Bulk Brainstorm: Multiple Frameworks

This section applies a wide variety of frameworks to generate a high volume of creative options for each clip.

---

## >> Concept 1: The Unsolvable Problem

**Post 1 (Framework: Welsh - "People don't fail because...")**

People don't fail to innovate because they lack expertise.

They fail because they're trapped by it.

There's a famous story of a Berkeley grad student who solved one of the biggest unsolved problems in statistics simply because he mistook it for a homework assignment.

He didn't know it was "impossible."

Less reverence for the status quo.
More naive audacity.

Better breakthroughs.

#OpenEd #Innovation #Mindset

---

**Post 2 (Framework: Swipe File - "Myth vs. Truth")**

What most people get wrong about innovation:

MYTH: Breakthroughs come from seasoned experts.
TRUTH: They often come from outsiders who don't know the rules.

MYTH: You need years of experience to solve hard problems.
TRUTH: You often just need a fresh perspective and a willingness to try.

MYTH: Knowing a problem is "unsolvable" is an advantage.
TRUTH: It's the biggest barrier to solving it.

Stop waiting to be an expert. Start solving.

#OpenEd #Mindset #FirstPrinciples

---

**Post 3 (Framework: Swipe File - "I'm Not Impressed By")**

I'm not impressed by your credentials.
I'm not impressed by your years of experience.
I'm not impressed by your list of publications.

I'm impressed when you solve a problem everyone else called "impossible."

Like the student who solved a legendary statistics problem because he thought it was homework.

That's the mindset that changes the world.

#OpenEd #Genius #Innovation

---

**Post 4 (Framework: Welsh - "The Real Flex")**

The real flex isn't knowing all the answers.

It's being willing to tackle a question when you don't even know if there is one.

#OpenEd #Curiosity #Mindset

---

**Post 5 (Framework: Swipe File - "Agree or Disagree")**

The greatest innovations come from outsiders.

Agree or disagree?

I think about the Berkeley grad student who solved an "unsolvable" problem because he didn't know any better.

His ignorance was his greatest asset.

It makes me think the more we become "experts," the more we build our own cages.

What do you think?

#OpenEd #Innovation #Expertise

**Post 6 (Framework: Swipe File - "The Quote Post")**

"If he had known the problem was supposed to be unsolvable, maybe he never would have attempted it."

- Michael Gibson, on the story of statistician George Dantzig

This is one of the most powerful arguments for encouraging naive curiosity I've ever heard.

It's a reminder that sometimes, the biggest obstacle is our own certainty.

## >> Concept 2: The Startup is the Real School

**Post 7 (Framework: Swipe File - "What Success Actually Requires")**

What building a real business ACTUALLY requires (that business school won't teach you):

• Confronting your own flaws, daily.
• Making decisions with incomplete information.
• Learning to sell, build, and lead, simultaneously.
• Developing a tolerance for high-stakes ambiguity.
• Having conversations that terrify you.
• Getting back up after you get punched in the mouth.

One path trains you to be a good student.
The other forges you into a capable person.

#OpenEd #Entrepreneurship #LearnByDoing

---

**Post 8 (Framework: Welsh - "How to increase your...")**

How to increase your real-world capability:

Build more.
Confront reality more.
Have hard conversations more.
Risk failure more.

Capability often comes from doing things school is designed to protect you from.

#OpenEd #Startups #Education

---

**Post 9 (Framework: Swipe File - "Which Would You Rather")**

Which would you rather have?

A) An MBA from a top-tier university.
B) The lessons from a startup you ran for 2 years that failed.

I know which one Michael Gibson would choose.

He says the startup is the ultimate project of self-knowledge, and that the lessons learned make it more valuable than business school, win or lose.

Which do you choose, and why?

#OpenEd #Education #MBA #Startups

---

**Post 10 (Framework: Welsh - "Most people don't want...")**

Most people don't want to learn.

They want to be credentialed.

True learning means confronting your weaknesses, making high-stakes decisions, and facing the urgency of a real-world environment.

If you can handle that, you'll love building a startup.

#OpenEd #LearnByDoing #Entrepreneurship

---

**Post 11 (Framework: Swipe File - "The Contrarian Post")**

Everyone thinks you need a business degree to succeed in business.

They're wrong.

You need to build something.

You need to sell something.

You need to face the brutal feedback of the market.

As Michael Gibson says, a startup will teach you more about yourself than any classroom ever could.

#OpenEd #Startups #Contrarian

---

**Post 12 (Framework: Welsh - "I've noticed a pattern...")**

I've noticed a pattern:

The most effective founders I know didn't go to business school.

They just started building.

It's almost as if the real education isn't in the classroom, but in the arena.

#OpenEd #Founder #Education

---

**Post 13 (Framework: Swipe File - "Behind the Scenes")**

Behind the scenes of a "successful" founder:

• Countless uncomfortable conversations.
• Daily confrontation with their own weaknesses.
• Decisions made with 40% of the needed information.
• The constant stress of a high-stakes environment.
• The humility learned from market feedback.

As Michael Gibson says, the startup is a project of self-knowledge.

The outcome is almost secondary to the growth.

## >> Concept 3: We Must Rewild the American Child

**Post 14 (Framework: Welsh - "The real flex isn't...")**

The real flex as a parent isn't getting your kid into an elite school.

It's raising a kid who doesn't need one.

#OpenEd #Parenting #Rewild

---

**Post 15 (Framework: Welsh - "Most people don't want...")**

Most people don't want their kids to be capable.

They want their kids to be safe.

True capability means learning to manage risk, navigating uncertainty on your own, and developing a mind of your own outside of an institution.

If you can handle that, you'll love rewilding your child.

#OpenEd #Parenting #FreeRangeKids

---

**Post 16 (Framework: Swipe File - "The 'Personal Story' Post")**

Think about the first time you were allowed to do something truly on your own.

Ride your bike to a friend's house across town.
Go to the store by yourself.
Build a fort in the woods.

That feeling of freedom and responsibility is where real capability is born.

But we're engineering it out of childhood.

As Michael Gibson says, we've created a "brittle dependence" on institutions. The antidote?

We must rewild the American child.

#OpenEd #Rewild #Childhood

---

**Post 17 (Framework: Welsh - "I've noticed a pattern...")**

I've noticed a pattern:

The most interesting, resilient, and independent young adults I meet were all under-supervised as children.

It's almost as if the freedom to get bored, explore, and make small mistakes is the best preparation for a complex world.

It's time to rewild.

#OpenEd #Parenting #Childhood

---

**Post 18 (Framework: Swipe File - "The Problem/Solution Post")**

THE PROBLEM:
We're raising a generation with a "brittle dependence" on institutions. By scheduling every hour and supervising every move, we're robbing them of the chance to develop real-world skills.

THE SOLUTION:
Rewild them. Give them back their freedom. Let them manage risk, pursue their own curiosity, and learn to navigate the world on their own terms.

It's not about a better school. It's about a wilder childhood.

#OpenEd #Rewilding #Parenting

---

**Post 19 (Framework: Swipe File - "What if I told you...")**

What if I told you the safest thing you can do for your child is to let them do more dangerous things?

Not life-threatening things.

But things where the outcome is uncertain and they have to rely on themselves.

As Michael Gibson puts it, you can't learn to ski black diamonds if you're not allowed on the bunny slope until you're 22.

It's time to let our kids practice for adulthood.

#OpenEd #Parenting #Risk

---

**Post 20 (Framework: Welsh - "Every big [CHANGE]...")**

Every capable adult I know started the same way — they were given freedom.

The unsupervised moments you're trying to prevent...
They aren't dangers.
They're training grounds.
