# The Genius We Engineer Away

*Why our obsession with credentials is systematically destroying the very thing we claim to cultivate*

There's a story that should haunt every parent in America.

It's 1939, and a graduate student at UC Berkeley rushes into his statistics class, late as usual. The professor has already finished his lecture and left two problems on the blackboard. The student assumes they're homework assignments, copies them down, and heads home to work on them.

They weren't homework. They were two of the most famous unsolved problems in the field of statistics—problems that had stumped the greatest minds for decades.

The student didn't know that. So he solved them both.

His name was George Dantzig, and he later said that if he had known the problems were supposed to be unsolvable, he probably never would have attempted them.

The man who shared that story on our podcast wasn't just a talking head. He's Michael Gibson, a venture capitalist who has built a career making a very specific, very contrarian bet.

Gibson runs the 1517 Fund, which provides grants and investments to young, brilliant minds who have chosen to build things *outside* of traditional university structures. The fund's name comes from the year Martin Luther posted his 95 Theses—a nod to challenging established institutions. And the results speak for themselves: 1517 has a better track record than Y Combinator at finding founders of unicorn companies.

Consider Dylan Field, who dropped out of Brown University to build Figma. The design software company recently went public in a deal that valued it at over $20 billion. Field was 19 when he started the company. If he had stayed in school, graduated, maybe gotten an MBA, he would have been 26 or 27 before he even started building. In the fast-moving world of technology, those years matter. They might have been the difference between creating the next generation of design tools and arriving too late to a market already dominated by others.

In other words, Michael doesn't just tell the story of George Dantzig; his fund, 1517, actively searches for the next one. He is betting his career on the idea that genius flourishes best in the wild, outside the very institutions we've built to certify it.

And talking to Michael, it crystallized a question that should haunt every parent in America: Are we systematically "educating" the genius out of our children by teaching them all the reasons something is "impossible" before they ever get a chance to try?

I think we are. And I think we're doing it with the best of intentions.

We live in what Michael calls a culture of "brittle dependence"—a system designed to create experts who know all the reasons something *can't* be done. We teach our children to color inside the lines, to follow the rubric, to wait for permission. We tell them that the path to success is clear: good grades, good college, good job. We've turned education into a risk-mitigation strategy instead of a curiosity-cultivation system.

But here's the problem: breakthrough thinking doesn't come from knowing all the rules. It comes from not knowing them—or, more precisely, from being willing to ignore them.

The greatest innovations in history have come from outsiders, from people who didn't know they were supposed to fail. The Wright brothers weren't aeronautical engineers. Steve Jobs wasn't a computer scientist. Sara Blakely cut the feet off her pantyhose and built Spanx into a billion-dollar company without any fashion or business training.

They succeeded not despite their ignorance, but because of it.

I see the opposite happening everywhere I look.

I see the high school student who won't start a project without a perfect rubric, who has been so conditioned to follow instructions that the idea of creating something from scratch paralyzes them.

I see the college student who chooses a "safe" major over a genuine passion because they've been taught that the goal is employability, not capability.

I see the parent who schedules every hour of their child's day, leaving no room for the unsupervised exploration where real problems are found and solved.

We've created a generation that is incredibly good at being students and incredibly bad at being pioneers.

And the window is closing. Michael talks about this a lot—the narrow window young people have to build real capability. The years between 15 and 25 are when the brain is most plastic, when risk tolerance is highest, when the cost of failure is lowest. But we're telling our kids to spend those years in classrooms, accumulating credentials instead of building things.

By the time they graduate, they're 22, 23, maybe 26 if they get an advanced degree. They're deep in debt, risk-averse, and conditioned to wait for someone else to tell them what to do next. The window for naive audacity has closed.

This isn't just about startups or technology. It's about the fundamental question of how we develop human potential. Are we raising children who can think for themselves, or are we raising children who are very good at thinking the way they've been taught to think?

The antidote isn't to abandon education entirely. It's to rewild it.

Michael uses that word deliberately—"rewild." Just as we've learned that ecosystems need wildness to thrive, minds need intellectual wilderness to develop their full potential.

This means giving children unsolved problems without telling them they're hard. It means letting them build things without instructions. It means celebrating the brilliant question over the correct answer.

It means teaching them that "I don't know" isn't a failure—it's the beginning of discovery.

Practically, this looks like encouraging what I call "productive ignorance." Instead of rushing to give our children all the answers, we need to give them better questions. Instead of protecting them from failure, we need to teach them how to fail forward.

We need to stop asking, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" and start asking, "What problem do you want to solve?"

We need to stop measuring success by the prestige of the institution and start measuring it by the audacity of the attempt.

Here's what I've learned from watching Michael's work at 1517, from talking to young founders, from seeing what happens when we give brilliant minds the freedom to be brilliantly wrong: Our job as parents and educators isn't to pave the road for our children. It's to give them the tools to navigate the wilderness.

Our goal shouldn't be to raise a child who knows all the answers. It should be to raise a child who isn't afraid to ask the questions everyone else has given up on.

Because somewhere out there, there's another George Dantzig walking into a classroom late, looking at an "impossible" problem on the blackboard, and thinking, "This looks like homework."

The question is: Will we have taught them that it's impossible? Or will we have given them the beautiful, dangerous gift of not knowing any better?

The future belongs to the latter. The question is whether we're brave enough to let them find it.
