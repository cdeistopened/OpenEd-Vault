## Analysis & Top Recommendations

After generating the full list, here are the titles that strike the best balance between being attention-grabbing and accurately reflecting the article's nuanced, powerful argument. They are grouped by the core emotional hook they leverage.

### Category 1: Counter-Intuitive & Intriguing (Best Overall)

These titles are the strongest because they create immediate curiosity and hint at a powerful, non-obvious truth, which is the core of the article.

*   **Top Pick:** `This is Why 99% of People Don't Raise a Genius!`
    *   **Why it works:** It uses the powerful "99%" framework to create a sense of a hidden, widely-missed secret. It speaks directly to the parental anxiety of not wanting to fail their child. It perfectly frames the article's premise that our common methods are wrong.

*   **Runner Up:** `The College Degree That's Secretly Killing Innovation`
    *   **Why it works:** It's provocative and contrarian. It takes a sacred cow (a college degree) and frames it as a villain. This aligns perfectly with the OpenEd narrative and Michael Gibson's thesis.

*   **Honorable Mention:** `How To RAISE A GENIUS! Without Forcing Them Into an Elite School`
    *   **Why it works:** It offers a clear promise (raise a genius) while simultaneously refuting a common, stressful assumption (must get into an elite school). It's aspirational and reassuring at the same time.

### Category 2: Provocative & Bold

These titles are designed to stop the scroll with a strong, almost aggressive claim. They work well for a Bari Weiss-style journalistic piece.

*   **Top Pick:** `How Elite Colleges SCAM You (and how to beat them)`
    *   **Why it works:** The word "SCAM" is incredibly powerful and grabs attention. It positions the article as an exposé that provides a solution, which is highly valuable to the reader.

*   **Runner Up:** `The REALITY of a College Degree in 2025`
    *   **Why it works:** It creates a sense of urgency and timeliness. "REALITY" implies that most people are living in a fantasy, and this article contains the hard truth. It's less aggressive than "scam" but still very effective.

### Category 3: Story-Driven & Human

These titles focus on the narrative element, hinting at the powerful parables within the article.

*   **Top Pick:** `They Said He Couldn’t Build a Unicorn… But He Dropped Out and Did It Anyway!`
    *   **Why it works:** It's a classic underdog story in a single line. It perfectly encapsulates the journey of founders like Dylan Field and the spirit of the 1517 Fund.

*   **Runner Up:** `What Happens to Geniuses That Never Go To College?`
    *   **Why it works:** It poses a genuinely interesting question that the reader will want to know the answer to. It's less aggressive but highly curiosity-driven, making it a strong contender.
