# OpenEd Weekly: The Genius of Being Late

### **A Note from Charlie**

Today we share a conversation with Michael Gibson, whose work with the Thiel Fellowship paid teens to drop out of college. The results? Several multi-billion dollar companies and a new member of the billionaire dropout club, Figma founder Dylan Field.

Let's get into it.

### **Thought: The Genius of Being Late to Class**

There's a story about a grad student at UC Berkeley that encapsulates how schools intimidate otherwise bright learners.

George Dantzig showed up late to his statistics class one day and saw two problems on the blackboard. Assuming it was homework, he copied them down. He worked on them for days, finally solving one, and turned it in.

He didn't know that the professor had put up two of the most famous *unsolved* problems in the field of statistics.

Michael Gibson relayed this story on the OpenEd podcast as an example of how schools intimidate learners and stifle genius. "If he'd known the problems were supposed to be impossible," Gibson notes, "he probably never would have attempted them."

His story is a jumping-off point for a fascinating conversation about the nature of genius and how to cultivate it. Listen to the full episode here.

### **Trend: Parents Are "Rewilding" Their Kids**

Parents are increasingly rejecting the hyper-scheduled, resume-building childhood in favor of a "rewilding" approach.

This is less about getting back to nature and more about cultivating an *intellectual* wilderness. As Michael Gibson puts it, it’s about creating an environment where children can develop "real capability, not just credentials."

It's a deliberate move away from the structured paths that produce what he calls a "brittle dependence" on institutions. In practice, it means giving kids unsolved problems, letting them get bored, and celebrating the brilliant question over the correct answer.

### **Tool: The Contrarian Fund That Bets on Cool Ideas**

Gibson calls startups the "real school," where the deepest learning happens. His fund, 1517, puts that idea into practice.

With a better track record of picking unicorn founders than Y-Combinator, 1517 operates on a radical principle of permissionless innovation. While most VCs want a 20-page deck, 1517 offers $1,000 grants to anyone with a cool idea—no degree or location required.

It's a tool designed to find the next generation of builders. Apply today.
