Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm your sometimes host Ella and today I'm joined by Kristin and Ginger of the Scola Microschool. I'm so excited to have this conversation and kind of shed light on the micro school side of open education. So what is happening in this world, how Scola was started and founded and what it has done for your community. Welcome to the podcast.

Kristin & Ginger (00:22.822)
Thanks Ella for having us. We appreciate it.

Ela Richmond (00:26.038)
Okay, so just dive straight in. What is your story? Like, how did you even get started with micro schools? Were you an educator ahead of time? Were you a mom? Where did you start?

Kristin & Ginger (00:36.658)
Yeah, good question. Both Ginger and I are moms. We also were educators mostly in a private school conventional classroom. We work together really closely and so I think that matters as part of our story. We knew each other's giftings. We're pretty opposite people who are just really appreciative of the other person's skill set and and learn how to work together that way a lot. I

When we started Scola in 2022, if I'm being really honest, it's probably been a seed that started in my master's program, possibly even a little bit longer than that. I tend to be a creative thinker, engineer, inventor, big picture type of like, let's blow it up and just see what happens type of a personality. And Ginger is

practical and like what's the next step and okay, let's just try to get one thing done today type of thing and so together our skill set was I think really powerful and important in getting school started. I got my master's degree in educational leadership and and that was before I had my two kids. I was a middle school teacher. I loved middle school. I loved

the creativity I got to have in my classroom at my school at the time. And then I think there were kind of two motivations for me. One was my own children. Just seeing how my daughter and my son both were different and probably needed different things from schooling. But then second was obviously teaching through COVID and just knowing that there were some constraints in the conventional classroom that I had always felt

But then those were obviously put under fire in COVID. It was a ridiculously hard, but also very fruitful time to teach. I was the optimist that was like something good can come out of this. And it was just the right time to let the seed of Scola actually kind of start to take root. So we put legs on it and.

Kristin & Ginger (02:59.54)
kind of a framework around it in the fall of 2021 and opened our doors September of 2022. So.

Ela Richmond (03:08.92)
How many students did you start with?

Kristin & Ginger (03:10.994)
Yeah, that's a good question. When we originally started to shape our school, we wanted 24. And that was kind of a big picture question for the two of us. wanted to like, we both really wanted to stay teaching. And so effective teaching was kind of a common big theme for the two of us. And so with effective teaching, you always have to kind of talk about student to teacher ratios, right? And that's a big part of the conversation.

So we thought 24 was the right number to have. We didn't start with that. We started with 16. It grew to 18, then it grew to 23, and now we have, I think we found a good sweet spot. We have between 30 and 35 students, but now there's three teachers involved. So that's kind of where we're.

Ela Richmond (04:00.332)
Wow. And what was that like? Like paint the picture of how it started and I don't know what challenges y'all had to go through. I mean, it seems easy to teach a lot of kids, especially if you're a teacher, but then you get into the weeds of it and I bet there were a lot of challenges that you didn't expect.

Kristin & Ginger (04:18.772)
Ella, that's a great question. I'm just going to go back a little bit. know, Kristen and I teaching together for years, there was a moment before SCOLA was a dream and started in the institution we're at together that I put on a post-it. And I don't even know if Kristen remembers this, I put, Kristen, you need to start a school and I'll come work for you. And so fast forward years later, post COVID and COVID again, this is a correlation was a catalyst for

something different. I am someone who actually does not love change. I really feel comfortable in the knowing, comfortable in what to expect. And after COVID, when I went back into a classroom setting for a few years, there was definitely a shift in me. And I think that I was really exhausted. I think COVID with the technology and all the things that were involved.

just took a lot out of me and going back into the classroom and recognizing, our students have shifted. What our students, our students are not the same when we left to when we're coming back in the classroom. And I think there was just some exhaustion and some burnout. And I wouldn't say burnout. I was close to burnout that I experienced that I'm like, okay, like something needs to change because I still loved teaching. I still loved being in education.

I got my master's in educational leadership and I think I was just, hit this point of like, okay, something's gotta change. I wanna stay in education. And Kristen and I, were working at, I was working at a different institution, but we would meet and we'd go on walks. And that's when Kristen started sharing the idea of Scola with me. And I'm like, that's a great idea for you. Yes, you could totally do this. And slowly but surely it just came to be that I would come alongside and.

help start SCOLA. And it was that exhaustion that led me to the yes, like, okay, something's gotta change. I think this is it. So I just embraced it. We would meet, we were both working full time. So to get SCOLA off the ground, this was probably in like February before SCOLA started, we would meet on Saturdays and we would make a checklist of, would come together and say, okay, what do we need to do?

Kristin & Ginger (06:40.698)
And the first question is, what type of a school are we going to be? Is it going to be private? Is it going to be charter, home school? And then you can kind of talk about that process of researching each of those options. Yeah. So I think at the beginning on our Saturday morning meetings, while working full-time as teachers, we just had to kind of come up with those big questions, right? Like, who do we want to be? What's going to rise to the top?

You realize quickly you can't be all the things. And in fact, like that was actually part of why we were leaving, right? Is the demands of our current situation. was just piling up and there wasn't any meaningful subtraction. So, so we were a little bit like, okay, let's start really with a clean slate. That was way more vulnerable.

than what it sounds like anyone who can just say out loud, let's start with a clean slate. Like you're giving up pieces of your identity. You're giving up pieces of like what you prided yourself in. I even like tear up just thinking about like how much courage it took just to be like, okay, all the things, all the measuring sticks I had about being a good teacher. I'm actually going to lay these down. Now they might be good. We might be willing to pick them back up again, but let's just at least try.

to start with a clean slate, like what's actually important to us. And so it was so nice to have space to let the important things rise to the top. And we knew that we wanted to be outside more often. wanted movement and outside is more than just outside. There's actually a lot of like sub points to that, right? It's kids really connected to their space. It's also part of teacher health.

a lot of movement, just like, just natural, really good things that happen and a human connection point that just felt like we were losing. We really wanted to meet students where they were at. Like we wanted to take the pace pressure off of students. Some students could fly ahead and so,

Kristin & Ginger (08:56.434)
We knew that we had to be able, if we were really gonna make that the value, we couldn't, we had to take words of like gifted, talented, accelerated, behind, ahead, like, and I still catch myself sometimes, those things are really embedded, but meeting students where they're at, like giving them an authentic learning sweet spot. What was that gonna look like? And then,

Third, I think we really wanted a social emotional component. And to us, that means community. Like there is a community, friendship, relationship skills. How do we interact with our neighbor? Like we actually wanna be part of a neighborhood. We want to be out in the community. We want school, we want that like veil of like.

school and community just to mesh a little bit more. We want students to see themselves as part of a community, but that also meant like how do we take care of ourselves as far as like when we're dysregulated or how do we act as part of a group? How do we take care of our relationships? outside meeting students where they're at in relationships, those were the three things that like floated to the top when we first started. And then every choice after that.

Ela Richmond (10:07.394)
Mm-hmm.

Kristin & Ginger (10:19.776)
okay, this sounds super clear and like, sounds like these Saturday meetings were just like, but we're in year four and this is just what retrospect, you know, this is what a little bit of time and, and when you're able to look back and speak so clearly about them, right. But, in the middle of we both, at the just had a commitment to like, let these things be our

Ela Richmond (10:41.772)
Mm-hmm.

Kristin & Ginger (10:50.47)
North Star and making every decision about that. So that led to how many students do we want? That led to what type of organizational structure are we gonna be? So technically we are a nonprofit that serves homeschool families. And right now that is satisfying the law in Minnesota and it may change and we'll learn how to pivot and adjust to that if needed.

Ela Richmond (10:52.78)
Mm-hmm.

Kristin & Ginger (11:17.254)
So we sound like a school, we breathe like a school, have blood and veins like a school, we talk like a school, but technically we are a nonprofit that serves homeschool families. So just even those, those basic decisions, what will our budget look like? What materials will we buy? What will our calendar, daily calendar, daily schedule, you know, a lot of those decisions we made on these Saturday mornings.

Ela Richmond (11:29.665)
Interesting.

Kristin & Ginger (11:45.728)
And, but these three things were always leading the way in that.

Ela Richmond (11:51.384)
That makes sense and it's really fascinating that it started with this, the sentiment question, right? So like, or at least this is what I'm gathering. Like how do we increase and better the sentiment of teachers and students? And it sounds like the idea of learning is really important to you. Were you all ever afraid? Like you said that you let go of all these measuring sticks that you had learned and that you had used as...

Kristin & Ginger (12:05.246)
Yes.

Ela Richmond (12:19.978)
a teacher for so long in traditional school, was it really hard in the beginning to let go of those measuring sticks and be like, okay, but like, what if we let them go outside more often? What if, you know, we structure things differently? What if, like, are we still serving the purpose that we are hoping to serve?

Kristin & Ginger (12:38.696)
Absolutely, I think there was some apprehension on my end. I think part of it, when I think about my apprehension, was having each other. It's like I actually trust between the two of us that what's going to end up happening is actually best for students. And because we've had a friendship, but also research, right? Research backs up.

that play is so important. Research backs up the social emotional regulation in kids that they need to feel safe. They need to be seen. They need to feel connection in order to learn, in order for their giftings and their strengths to actually come to the top, in order to have confidence to be willing to be vulnerable and make mistakes. So I think there was some fear, but all of those other things outweighed the fear.

And also, I think the first time we got paid, I think our first paycheck was like just reassuring both to myself and my husband. It's like, okay, yes, we are getting paid for this also. So that helped. In the first day, I think there was just so much excitement and just knowing that we were stepping into something new for this area that we were creating. And because I have, this is my 26th year of teaching.

So I think going into it, knowing that I've had touch points with pretty much K through eighth grade. So I know where kids need to be. know, when they leave eighth grade, when they leave first grade, kind of the skill academic check, I feel confident in knowing where kids need to be and supporting them wherever they're at to get to where they need to be. So there was this level of confidence and excitement that outweighed the fear.

And that first day, kinda, mean, part of me wishes we would have just recorded just for our sake. Like, I don't know if we'd share it with anyone because we really did. We did not, we're like, okay, let's start with just, let's start with bare bones, bare bones. And what does it look like to really see students and see kids and build a program around where students are at and what they need.

Kristin & Ginger (14:58.888)
So we a lot of the structure we typically have in the classroom. We're like, OK, let's start without it. And slowly but surely we started adding components of a typical classroom. So if you come in, you know, a typical day at school or morning, you'll have three different small groups. And within those small groups, you'll see components of like a typical classroom, except kids are working independently and you have multi age working on all different things. But you still see that structure that

you know, typical classrooms have.

Ela Richmond (15:32.066)
That's so fascinating. Have you also seen like a sentiment change in your students or like how would you explain because you said this is your fourth year doing Scola. Like what is the reaction been by students going through this new type of learning or like this more flexible type of learning.

Kristin & Ginger (15:49.62)
Well, I think we have two types of students. You have students that have been in different institutions that come to Scola, and you have students that have been here since kindergarten that actually Scola is their only framework for education. So I think there's definitely our kids who have been in other institutions. Just like there had to be some undoing for us, there is this undoing process. Do you want to talk Yeah.

And it's interesting, think our admissions process really just tries to honor that, that it's going to take some time. It's going to take some time to shed the old in order to try on and see the values of the new thing. I gave myself some time. I probably should have given myself some more time. It was interesting. And I wish I could quote who this came from. But I think early on,

Both of us listened to a lot of podcasts, you know, like we were trying to like fill our backpack with all this inspiration to get the courage to, you know, do this and just try. And, and like what Ginger said, like the research and people cheering us on, just the personal investments we had from friends and colleagues. And anytime we would share what we were doing, I don't think there was a single person that was like, well that's.

that's weird. know, like everyone was like, yeah. But I think what was interesting is when we were starting to get students, we were giving ourselves time. We heard this quote of, it's going to take for however many years you're in a system, it's going to take that many months to actually shed everything off before you can rebuild it back up, right?

So I was coming out with 16 years or 18 years of teaching. So I needed to give myself 18 months, right? So that was more than, that's like two years of school of like really kind of undoing these things. And then just knowing when we go through admissions, again, I think the unique group here is people who start in Scola and that's all they know. Like this is what they know of school. So they're gonna walk into a school building, maybe to go visit a,

Kristin & Ginger (18:10.228)
play or a band concert or just for like their community sports team practice and like that's going to feel weird. know so but then we have we have students coming from more of a homeschool situation and this is actually more structured than what they're used to so they have a different learning curve than students coming from a conventional classroom. And kind of a shift in.

where the pressure points are or where the yeah, where all the measuring sticks went is usually kind of what the hard part is.

Ela Richmond (18:51.518)
Is there a sentiment difference between the students you used to teach in like a traditional school versus scola or like, yeah, like what, what is the difference? Cause I mean, I'm just curious, like all the research does say that play is so important and that flexibility is so important and meeting students where they're at is so important. But like, when you do that, have y'all been able to see like what it looks like in the classroom setting?

Kristin & Ginger (19:18.492)
Absolutely. And I think when it comes to that measuring stick, I think as educators, we've always had the philosophy of like seeing the whole child and valuing like academics as part of that. But there's also, you know, athletic ability, social, emotional, being being good at relationships, all of these things that make us humans. But in typical, you know, classical education institutions, it really is academics that gets

the majority of like focus and you know that's what you're seeing as a classroom teacher. So I think in this space, yes obviously we are a school and academics is important, but kids are confident because when they come into this space, because we've like shed, which has taken some time, we've shed and we've understand okay this is important but actually.

who you are as an image bearer of God is actually most important. And this is how we're gonna see each other. And I think that when kids learn that and they start to see each other in their giftings and the way that they're wired and unique, there's just this confidence that they're able to come into a space and learn and be vulnerable and be able to make mistakes.

in ways that I don't feel like as an educator I could tap into to quite the same degree when I have 26 students in one classroom that I have these measuring sticks that I'm being evaluated on if I don't get them from point A to point B. So the pressure for our students is off, hopefully, and it takes some time for them to get there. And also the pressure for us is off.

to fully see students. And I think something that looks a little different, we have progress reports, but we don't do letter grades. So even in middle school, there's not letter grades. Now there is, we are looking at grade level, where should students be at, where they kind of fall for their grade level. And then we have a narrative side. And the narrative side gets into social, gets into play. And the narrative I would say is most important because we're small.

Kristin & Ginger (21:36.648)
We get to really see students and really know students and come alongside students in a way that I just, I've never had the ability to do in a typical classroom setting. And that correlates then with getting to know the families. Like families are our number one, especially as homeschool families, mom and dad, they're actually in the driver's seat. So we partner with families. It is a partnership.

And in real time, because we're small, in real time, if there's a question or if there's something that comes up, like I can give mom and dad a call or a quick text, hey, this is happening. How was your morning? So in real time, to have this understanding of exactly what's going on socially, emotionally with a child, the value, I cannot overemphasize the value of that component.

When it comes to actually then going into academics, some, like academics is not always easy. Like our students will face some challenging moments when it comes to that threshold of learning something new, right? There is this grit that's required when learning something new. And I think our students are, they're able to tap into that grit because these other things have been checked.

that are actually more important. And I think in a classroom, I don't know, typical classroom, yes, those boxes are being checked for some students, but not all. And students, they have a good way of hiding that sometimes where they look like they have it all together. And then you are looking at work or you're doing some assessment and you recognize that the connections are not being made. So.

Ela Richmond (23:12.814)
Mm.

Kristin & Ginger (23:27.442)
being able to meet those needs in real time has just been amazing. And I'll let you talk about the play and outside component a little bit. Yeah, I think that... go ahead.

Ela Richmond (23:38.402)
Before, really quickly, before we get into that, I kind of want to dive into just the education piece. So I'll go back to the play because that's so fascinating. And I know that a lot of our families are really interested in play. They have y'all read Peter Gray? Probably so. So one thing that I want to touch on before we hop over there is has the way that Scola is

Kristin & Ginger (23:49.118)
Sure. Yep.

Ela Richmond (24:08.684)
I guess structured and the structure versus non-structure comparatively to like a traditional education approach. Has that changed the way that students and parents think about education too in your school? Like have you had those conversations with, for example, like a family that came from a traditional school or a student that came from a traditional school, has it changed their relationship with education and learning?

Kristin & Ginger (24:32.744)
Yeah, that's really interesting. mean, I think. So much so many families, mine included at one point the relationship with school was actually about the outcome in the grades. Right, that's actually where most everyone teachers, learners, parents. Everyone was kind of prioritizing that everyone was trying not to. I think there were there was huge efforts to like.

It's not about the grade. It's not, you know, but like the constraints were so the current was so strong that no matter how hard you tried, it still was so much time, so much money, so much emphasis put on the grade. So, so I just think we're still probably trying to find the right words of what shifts and how we can describe families relationships.

to education when that's actually not the main point, right? So outcomes will happen, but when you put more time and more investment in the process and in the learning, there's just a different posture towards outcomes. And there's just a different posture towards what learning can look like, right? And then I also think, yeah, go ahead.

Ela Richmond (25:56.578)
Well, I find that fascinating because it's like, it's like in every aspect of our lives, we understand that that's true, right? In something as simple as like working out in something as simple as like our, our marital relationships and like our love relationships. Like we understand that everything, everything hits the road and everything like becomes true in a moment. Right? So like the habit of choosing your husband, the habit of right. Showing up to the gym, like all of that matters so much more than let's say like a physique.

or like a wait or like whatever it is, like it will come. But it's funny because from a school perspective, like we all just focus on the outcome as opposed to how can we nurture the moment? How can we like put into the moment as much as possible? Because it is unreasonable to assume that if we put all of this into the moment and we do that consistently for say like five plus years that

Kristin & Ginger (26:31.091)
this.

Kristin & Ginger (26:40.372)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (26:54.744)
the outcome won't be good.

Kristin & Ginger (26:56.596)
I mean, Ella, now you're getting into a philosophy podcast here, right? Like, I mean, this is, don't, I'm not the expert in this area cause I teach middle school, but, like the, telos or the, or the, like the main component of why we educate has shifted. Right. And it has, and we all kind of see the historical benefit of that. And now I, I, I don't want to get too deep into that because I want

I want everyone to have access to that, right? And that might mean that we have to shift some things or create schools that we want as much people to have access for. And I think that's where our dream is too, right? Like we love Scola, we love what's being created. And we do, get frustrated with, but how could every kid have opportunity to this, right? We also see some of the limitations in what we've built that

we care about our kids in the Twin Cities. We care about our kids in our city. so we get frustrated sometimes even with the limitations of that. just add to that, just tapping a little bit on access. And I think our heart, our desire is that every kid has access to a meaningful education where they are taught by healthy educators.

and they themselves, their needs are being met and they're learning, right? And thankfully in the Twin Cities, we have access to lots of different choices. There are thriving public schools. There are great charter schools that have been well established. There are wonderful private schools. There are, you know, micro schools that are popping up. But again, it is limited as far as being a tuition driven school.

that not everybody has access to it. So I think that access is really important. We do not have a solution to that at all, but we are thankful to live in the Twin Cities where there are options as far as open enrollment and even online options for families. And I think one thing that's so important to us, and even it ties back into your previous question of how does this change people's posture,

Kristin & Ginger (29:18.302)
How does this change actually like parents approach to education? I think like when we speak about teacher health, our families have started really caring about teacher health. and we talk about that a lot. So we talk about like our school is better when we stay healthy and when we stay effective. And here's actually practically what we mean by that. and then encouraging people, you know, some of our families have,

students in more than one school, they actually have the opportunity to kind of pick the school model that fits their kid and they might be at a couple different ones. And so helping them even like, how can you help the health of teachers in other schools? Like it really comes down to that effective teaching, effective, healthy teachers really do make a significant, significant, I cannot overestimate. I wish there was a...

a significant impact in the education of your neighborhood, of your city, effective teachers are really amazing. And the reach of an effective teacher can go a long, long, long way, farther than just the classroom that they work in. so even like shifting some of the posture of

Ela Richmond (30:29.134)
true.

Ela Richmond (30:36.012)
Yeah, that's so true.

Kristin & Ginger (30:41.132)
We are we are pro education, so we are not. We actually do not plan to be in competition with anyone in our city. We want more healthy options. We want more sustainable schools. We want more healthy teachers and we're doing our little micro part here, but as much as we can be in relationship with school districts and keep that a positive relationship, learn from them.

connect with them, how can we help with resources, how can we help actually this whole thing to grow, not just us be in this competitive market. That doesn't actually make any sense on our part.

Ela Richmond (31:22.958)
I fully agree. That's the whole concept of open education that we are such champions for. is every student needs something a little bit different. How do you find exactly what a student needs to thrive and succeed? And how do we increase options for families all over the nation and beyond? I'm curious though, you mentioned that like, right?

There are some families in your school that actually, or maybe it wasn't in your school, but there are some families that you know of that do lots of different models of education all at once. What does that look like? And then also, how would you, as both parents and teachers, recommend that people find the thing or the school model or the approach that works for their kids specifically?

Kristin & Ginger (32:09.854)
Good question. Well, let's the first question about how do parents do it in different models. There is a cost. These parents are keeping track of different calendars. They're keeping track of different, you know, and so there is a frazzled approach to some of the parents. We try to support them as best as we can. But but I really do think that they are.

these parents are less concerned. They are leading in the posture of being less concerned with an outcome and more concerned about the wellbeing, the learning, the growth of their kid. Do you want to say anything more about that parent group? No, I think, yeah. But they're frazzled, right? It's a sacrifice, keeping track of different start times, different end times, but they have some flexibility in their schedule.

to be able to make it work. And sometimes they add grandma or aunt or whoever to help with pickup. But it really is the privilege of being able to see each child in their family as individuals and recognize, right, this kid is striving in this institution, but this kid is not. What are some other options and can we make it work as a family? Yeah. And then I think like in talking with parents, like how to pick the right

model. There's I mean, there's so many, there's actually a lot of things that add up to that. convenience is a really strong factor. And we had even some really good school years, even though that was like our top value for a year was we just needed to pick the convenient option. My kids were okay. And there were things that we supplemented or did different, you know, because of that. I do think

And again, I think this ties into a previous question. Your kids motivation, your students really tapping into how are they motivated? What gets them motivated? And again, we have a variety of students here. One thing that has been really cool and very beneficial, but has taken time is student motivation in my previous classrooms were really dependent on me.

Kristin & Ginger (34:31.984)
in the way that we have structured school a lot and also let some of these priorities rise to the top, it has shifted the motivation onto students a lot more. That students still need us, they need an on-ramp, they need us to do the direct instruction for new things, the check-ins, the feedback. But there are many times, Ginger and I, it happens several times a week where...

Our students all of sudden, there's like 32 different things going on in this room. And we just kind of like stare at each other. And like we go fill up our coffee. And, and you can just feel, I don't know, we bask in it actually is what happens. Cause this is like the teacher's dream. This is where we're actually being needed at the right amount. This is us doing our job in the way we love doing our job.

Ela Richmond (35:16.943)
my goodness.

Kristin & Ginger (35:26.084)
And it's this level of student independence, student motivation, student, they have the right resources, the tools, and they get to drive it, right? Now those moments don't last the whole day. So please know that we can go fill up our cup of coffee before we have to like attend to something. But it really is a lot more like gardening in a way. It's a lot more, it's a tending job, right?

more than kind of like push through or drive the train type of job. Yeah, for sure. And going back to, you know, what would we say to parents who are trying to pick the right fit space for their child and their learning? You know, when you first start that process, when we meet kindergarten, going into kindergarten with parents, I think we like to...

Please like just put them at ease. I think sometimes there's this pressure Like I have to get it right if I don't get it right like it's gonna go on sequence Yes, so especially for kindergarten parents just putting that pressure off and Like saying okay, like here's here's what you can expect at scola If you're looking when you're looking at institutions like trying to talk to administrator trying to get physically in the

building and I would suggest if you if you can make it happen during a typical school day you really can get a sense of what's the culture right what are what are you seeing what are you feeling as a parent can you see your child in the hallways can you see your child in this classroom so I recommend parents if they can get in during the school day for a tour and really kind of trusting their gut and what they're feeling

seeing and what they're feeling. When it comes to standardized tests and you know you see these schools ranked by test, I recommend like looking at that but that should not be the driving factor for deciding on a school. There's so many things behind the scene that goes on when these you know whatever test is given to measure a particular student at a particular time.

Kristin & Ginger (37:45.584)
in the day at a particular time, you know, when they're going through their curriculum. So again, if you want to look at that, use that, you can, but I would put that like kind of lower on the list when it comes to looking at possible schools.

Ela Richmond (38:02.53)
That's interesting. think all of the things that you said made a lot of sense. I do wonder too about the student motivation thing. how much of student, I know there's a ton of research on this and people don't have the answer, but I'd be curious to hear your take as a teacher and somebody that works with students a lot and also as a mom who's seen your own students.

There's like natural student motivation. Like some students are just naturally gifted and they naturally gravitate toward certain topics. But then there's like motivation by osmosis almost where it's like a student is around other students who care about X or a student is around a family member that they really look up to who cares about X or Y. How do you, especially early on from a teaching perspective and a parent perspective,

How do you help your kid to foster those motivations?

Kristin & Ginger (39:00.84)
I think Ginger's so good at this, so I've learned a lot from her, just even about how to ask kids questions of what they're proud of, right? And so, I love telling kids I'm proud of them. And so I still do, it's not like I cut that out of my life. But there is something about specific praise, really helping kids feel internally,

proud and a lot of this honestly comes underneath teaching kids about emotions, teaching kids about their own, the way that they feel, even feeling frustrated, like going through some of the more difficult feelings and having them aware and acknowledging those things actually is all a part of this, right? So that social emotional piece actually plays a huge part in motivation because

students have to recognize what proud even feels like and not proud because someone else told me that this was good, but like, I feel proud. I feel really good about this, right? Even though there might not be a grade attached, there's not any type of recognition that I'm not relying on those types of things, right? And so I even think like what types of questions to ask kids, guiding them in some of their freedom. like,

Ela Richmond (40:03.288)
Hmm.

Kristin & Ginger (40:26.846)
I don't know what to do or what do I do next or so I don't know maybe Ginger you want to go into like your practical questions. you know my mind goes to just that teaching kids that intrinsic motivation right and I think it's not about them making me proud it's actually about them feeling accomplished and proud for the work that they've done. So I think you know in

thinking about my small group as kids are working, maybe they're working on math. And within 20 minutes, there might be a kid that finishes like 10 problems, right? And there might be a kid that finishes one. And really setting up a culture where, whether it's one or 10, you get to feel proud of your accomplishments. So recognizing in that moment that kiddo who might've just finished one problem, but he focused, he stuck with it. And just recognizing like,

noticing that, hey, such and such, does that make you feel? Like, look at what you just on your own. And I think there's also this piece of working in multi age, where they get to work with one another, they get to bring it out in each other and recognize, again, it takes some time, but recognize, we're not in a hurry. There actually isn't one student that is getting the gold star today.

because we all are working at different levels. And I think working in multi-age, they get to come alongside of each other, really learn how to coach, not just give an answer, but what does it look like to share how you got the answer? What are some strategies you used? It's really, really special. And I can just, you know, I just start smiling because I can just picture that kid that comes up to me. They're so excited.

because they did X, Y, Z and just turning that around with a big smile on my face. How does that make you feel? I feel so excited. Look what I did. Why don't you go share that with your, you know, your teammate at your table. And it does take some intentional like reframing of it. The teacher is not the center. They're not doing this for me, but what does it look like to do it for establishing the habit, for the process.

Kristin & Ginger (42:47.422)
for the learning, for reaching that goal, feeling that feeling. So that once again, when they try something new tomorrow, they kind of remember what that felt like and they're able to gain the confidence and have that when they feel like quitting, like, okay, you got to that yesterday, let's keep on going. Yeah.

Ela Richmond (43:08.044)
That is huge. Hold on one second. I just want to like shed light on that for a second, like and highlight. It is so easy as both a parent and a homeschool parent and also a teacher and also anybody that is really excited and really cares about the success of a child to be the person that they turn to and show their success. And they're like, mom, be so happy. But

It is really, really important for that not to be the end of it, for it to be, I am so happy for you, you should also be happy for you. And like creating that line between this is not just about pleasing me, this is about doing something that is just like inherently really good. Like you just did something that was awesome. And reminding them that it is not just about the pat on the back that you're getting, but it is also about the result that they are getting for themselves.

Kristin & Ginger (43:38.536)
late.

Kristin & Ginger (44:03.666)
Exactly.

Ela Richmond (44:04.11)
I've never heard that one before, but I think like it's a subtle thing, but it is so important.

Kristin & Ginger (44:11.176)
Yeah, well, it's the adult paycheck world too, right? Like, we do this for the paycheck and we also do this because of like the good work that's done in me and also that I can do for other people. There's actually a lot of research on motivation that we're, here's kind of my thought when Ginger was talking.

There is a book out there, I think it's called The Disengaged Teen, and they actually have really good words on the different motivations that each person taps into. And to be honest, I'm still so new. We're probably more the labs. We're actually hands-on, experiencing all these things. We may not have all the scientific words on what we're seeing, but you really can start to see that motivation

kids go in and out of different types of motivations too, right? and you, when you know a student, when you are known and when you belong and when you have a teacher or a guide or a person who's tending your environment to help you, like, there's just a lot of space. There's a lot of chances to take risks and grow. And I think that's what's so,

nice about having some like narrative reporting, not just grades or numbers attached to things is like, this is the character development that people talk about, right? Is how I use my motivation, how I use my passion to accomplish some things and not everything I like, right? Like there are just some things that these are really good skills to learn. This is also just

good for my brain, like I'm experiencing brain health and brain growth from doing some of these things. it just is, think motivation is one of those topics where it is a vulnerable place for students. Many of them have learned how to hide or to cope or to, or, you know.

Kristin & Ginger (46:24.136)
to only be motivated by the thing, right? The prize or the bribe or, and I have been the prize and bribing teacher, so I'm not exempt from that in any way. But to start to see that shift is something that I think we love writing about in these like reports out to parents, because it's actually, that's the type of character and just even.

really helpful knowledge that parents want as they try to help guide their kid in passions and in and even in some places of growth.

Ela Richmond (47:02.638)
I absolutely love that. So I wanted to ask you a question about play, right? It's interesting that we were talking about the effects of like the schooling model, the type of education, the way that you approach a kid. Interestingly, like,

as adults, we all recognize that being in a hurry is not great, right? And we've talked about the focus on outcome, especially in a normal school setting. When kids play, right? And when they are outside and when they're doing all of these things, it feels as an onlooker, they're not being productive. Like, how could they be filling their time differently, right? And like as...

Kristin & Ginger (47:50.356)
Right.

Ela Richmond (47:56.79)
As adults, we even ask ourselves that question, right? It's like all of these leisure times that we spend on a walk or just having fun with friends. like, well, what else could I be doing in this time? And that is always how our mind evaluates how to choose what to do next and how to say yes to something and how to say no to something. Why do y'all say yes to play for kids? What is in play that actually makes it like, well, it's not

quote unquote productive, actually is very, very useful for children.

Kristin & Ginger (48:31.838)
I would love for you to start because observing play, again, both of us have our masters and maybe someday we'll go on because there's so much research here. And in the observation of play, there's actually some categories that come on up. Yeah, OK. So again, we just want to honor that there's real scientists and researchers who probably have language around this. And we just haven't found their book yet. So we don't claim to.

We probably have all of this like data and observations from students and don't quite know all of the language. But, again, this was a vulnerable shift for both Ginger and I, because as a, as a conventional teacher, you are taught to be so like efficiency drives the system and play just doesn't, it's not efficient. Well, and you also in.

Again, the shedding off is like if I took my kids outside for an extra recess, like, gosh, like I just felt like I'd be judged. Like my kids are not working enough. even just the shedding of- Yeah. such a, yeah. Earning and deserving. There's such a, there's such a currency that's like, you know, required in play. And that's just not honoring that plays actually the heavy hitter when it comes to skills, right?

And I think Peter Gray says it like this is the job of children. Like play is the job of kids. okay, so we were, we on average, we do about three hours outside. Now we're also Minnesotan. And so there's, have like four distinct seasons. And so sometimes three hours is really difficult. Just the weather doesn't kind of shape up to that. But

Ela Richmond (50:14.306)
Wow. Bubble.

Kristin & Ginger (50:24.786)
And then probably at different ages, that three hours outside just looks different. So we will hold classes. I take on our fifth through eighth grade-ish students, 10 through 12 year olds, 10 through 14 year olds. So we do classes out there. We will hike. So there will be different seasons where we will structure some of that outside time, but then also we wanna honor that unstructured outside.

is important. We also care about safety. We care about liability and these types of things. So we spend a lot of time at the beginning of school just addressing and giving kids like freedom, but also like them knowing their risks and that type of stuff. Anyway, we were sitting outside and our job changed when we made this a priority because recess duty, I've done recess duty and I know.

I know where my eyes are, know what my job is, you know, but like this just felt different and it probably was subtle enough where I actually am, watching students and all of these skills emerge. I'm actually not checking out or thinking about my next lesson or just trying to manage conflict all the time. Like my job opens up a little bit more to really watching students, listening to them talk.

Not jumping into conflict right away, but like seeing when to get involved in those types of things. Anyway, it was in one of my times outside as a researcher. And I remember there was, there were like pockets of groups of kids around different things and they were, they were all doing, they were all fully engaged, like 100 % engagement. And I just kind of noticed the projects they were doing. So,

I came up in four, kind of in four different categories. So there definitely was the imagination group where they would use the, know, they would be playing store. They would be playing city. They would have these walnuts to use as their currency and their economy. There was a realtor and there was a, know, but this could also get into like a lot of times the stories that we're reading the books, like it's the book report getting played out, you know, in these types of settings too. So

Kristin & Ginger (52:47.956)
There's there's the first category is just imagination. And then the second category is just the like the competitive structured games. Usually the games that have rules attached to it. This would be the hide and seek the football of bat, you know, and those types of things. And they just feel more organized, right? They feel not as loose ended. The third one, which is so interesting is like civil engineering.

digging the holes, gathering the branches. there was- Making a path of water in a dam and using rocks and sticks and seeing which way the water is going to go. Yeah. There was one time we have a couple of great like wooded areas and before we knew it, every dead branch, and we're not even on our property, we're in a city park. And so every dead branch.

Ela Richmond (53:19.765)
Interesting.

Kristin & Ginger (53:47.793)
in the entire woods was collected and gathered in a place. And so I had to call the city office being like, okay, I don't even know if you wanted this project done, you know, but like we gathered all the dead sticks for you if you wanted to come pick, someone has to come pick these up because now they're in the way of the playground, you know. So we called it civil work and engineering. And, and then the fourth one is simply just social.

There is just the hangout, the talking, the telling jokes, the bantering back and forth, you know. So we actually have really used these four categories to be helpful in helping students see where their time management is, where their skill set is, where their communication, kind of some of those executive functioning.

And then also what's interesting is when we talk about kids, and this is now kind of turned part of our, we don't really have staff meetings. What happens is Ginger and I are outside, we're getting the fresh air that we need. We stand almost like back to back. And so one teacher is facing one way and one is facing the other way. And we have the time, we have the space to actually like name every kid we see and just make observations about them.

And again, just like what you were saying about habits building over time, this has been, this is what you dreamt about in teacher meetings where you could actually talk about students. You could actually talk about how you see them growing, what you see them happening. Okay, I'm a little concerned. It feels like maybe anxiety is really present here or they're just in conflict a lot with this type of person. But also in there you could,

we could make observations of what category of play do they like to go in the most, which ones actually feel the most challenging. Like we have some students, they are just begging that people play an organized game with them. And they beg us sometimes like, could you just start a capture the flag, you know, or a kickball game, right? They want the rules, they want the teams, they want a winner, they want a loser. And that's actually where they feel comfortable. But

Kristin & Ginger (56:08.786)
challenging them to join the imaginary group and like, well, there's this really cool like walnut currency game going on in the woods. And seeing how that like stretches them and grows them a little bit. So I think that's where these four categories have been really helpful to us because they really help us see where students prefer.

and also just some of the skills that are needed in a few of these categories to play. So we actually, present this to our parents. We talk about it. We post this on Instagram, just like this is what, if we were to write a book, this would probably be an easy topic for us to just get started of just the categories of play that we have seen shape up here. And then also the skills that come from it. And I think it also gives an opportunity for students to like think about, okay,

what do I want to engage in? What do I want to do during this time? And as we're out there, as we're watching, like we notice, you know, we might notice a student off by themselves. We'll give it a little time to see if they join, but after a while, we might just go over there and say, hey, I noticed that you're spending time by yourself. Can you tell me about that? Is this a choice? Like, would you, do you just need some quiet alone time? If that's the case, that is okay.

Or is there something that you would like to join? Is there a game that you see going on that you would like to join? Would you like some help in joining that game? So I think a piece that happens in small, again, is really getting to know students as individuals and getting to know them and how they're wired and helping them start to understand their natural tendencies and how they're wired. That is actually completely okay.

if you want to be by yourself right now and just spend some time alone. But if you'd like some help in joining a group or if there's some sort of, you know, personal or relationship conflict that is like, you don't feel invited, let's go ahead and talk about that. And let's go ahead and work through that in real time. Versus in other settings after recess, some days would probably take a half an hour as a classroom teacher trying to get to the bottom of all the social things that

Kristin & Ginger (58:27.694)
during that time that again in real time we're able to help students gain the skills so that they're able to work through it and sometimes they need help from an adult and sometimes they don't sometimes they're like I think that I can I would like to do this on on my own crate I'm gonna I'm gonna walk with you but why don't you go ahead and talk with that other student again it's that real time as I'm going into year four

that I really think has made so much difference. And I know we talk about play, but that being outside, being outside the benefit to me personally, to get outside in nature, no matter the weather, even on a cloudy day, to be able to get outside, to breathe in some fresh air for our students and for us as educators, has just been amazing on my own, just mental.

emotional health, like I just feel just more at peace when I have touch points where I'm outside. to be able to give our students that. And there, I think this setting, they probably won't recognize the benefits, whether they spend a year here, or, you know, all nine years, I don't think they'll recognize the benefits that they're receiving in this place until they're, they're older.

Ela Richmond (59:53.794)
this. So those are y'all's categories of play, right? How do you...

Kristin & Ginger (59:57.481)
Yes. I think so. Yeah. I mean, we don't want to credit, but yes, it came from us. We didn't find it in a book or anything.

Ela Richmond (01:00:06.456)
how do you actively use that to shape the way that you approach students? now that you all have this framework and this ability to say categorize the way that students naturally just lean towards certain roles and opportunities, what do you do with that?

Kristin & Ginger (01:00:25.842)
Yeah, I mean, I think we we talk about it a lot. So just even like in our outside staff meeting, right? Like facing the right direction. Some I really like to take video and snapshots and part of it. I mean, obviously putting it as a marketing tool, just even getting other people to have an expanded view of what school could look like a reimagined school day so.

We do post a lot of this stuff and actually we use these categories as kind of a teaching moment for parents and other people. But I think internally it really has helped us us know how can we help a student grow or kind of know a student better if that makes sense. so going back to your original question, doesn't this sound really productive, right?

play and this amount of time outside. Um, and again, we kind of have, I think we came down to most of our old recess times in our former workplaces were 15 to 20 minutes. Honestly, some of these categories don't even show up until you're outside for 40 minutes. And then, and so like there's, there's even kind of a time timing science behind this. If we want these four categories to show up.

Ela Richmond (01:01:41.579)
Interesting.

Kristin & Ginger (01:01:50.127)
at minimum an hour. And then what's even better is if you can add another hour, then you get to help kids and watch kids through the transition out of one thing and into another thing. And so that's usually at like, at like an hour and a half or two hours. And so, so part of this Ella maybe is our, we built this so that we could feel productive. Like we could like check the productive question.

I don't think that's all it. mean, this is fascinating and this is what we'd sit through professional developments about how important this is for the brain and just neurologically what's happening here. But I think we use those four categories to help just us build our schedule, keep track of our community, really help know where kids can grow and also where they feel the most comfortable, where we can celebrate them.

At the end of each day we do an I appreciate session. And just giving kids enough time for like some leaders to pop up and then another idea pop, you know, like idea generation and kids moving from one element of play into another. It gives them a chance to actually like see the giftings and other people. And now it brings up plenty of conflict too, so please don't think that we're conflict free. But even that even like.

That amount of time helps us in real time, just like what Ginger said, it hits part of our relationship goal because we can really teach kids what it is to manage conflict and go through those types of things.

Ela Richmond (01:03:29.44)
Super fascinating. I have two more questions for you. They should be quick-ish. this is like the perfect note to wrap it up on. First question is like a very practical question. So most children have a slight tendency to over-watch screens, right? Like that is very, very, very common today. It's common because...

screens are high dopamine and because, you know, as a kid, you don't necessarily have the ability to regulate yourself and it's fun. You just kind of like watching what you like watching and you you have your interests right in front of you. But because kids are trapped in their screens, it's really, really hard to get that 45 plus minutes of, okay, I'm bored. I'm bored. I'm bored. What do I do? What do I do? You know what I mean? Like that time is so good for a kid to really figure it out, but like,

For example, I know that sometimes homeschool families will have their kids go outside for 25 minutes, right? Or like 30 minutes. But here y'all are saying that you don't really get to the point where you're discovering these things about your kid until it's quite a bit after that time. How do you practically, how would you recommend to a parent or a family to even instill this as a habit?

Okay, 45 plus minutes, an hour and a half of just like, we're going outside. Did you, whenever y'all started Scola, have any like pushback from kids of like, oh, well I'm bored or like, oh, can I do something else or how did y'all handle that as teachers?

Kristin & Ginger (01:05:05.416)
or anything else.

Kristin & Ginger (01:05:11.004)
Yeah, I think first I'll just take the question on as a parent. I think if you're trying to grow a child's stamina is think about where you're at. You don't you don't go from zero to 50, right? So think about where you're at and just make a goal of all right, typically we get outside 10 minutes a day. Let's make a goal today of 20 and then build from there. So just building on where you're already at.

I also think both as parents and educators, like I've gotten really comfortable even this summer with my son, I've gotten comfortable with I'm bored. Actually, that's okay. The best stuff comes from boredom. Here's a few ideas, know, coming up with a list of ideas, helping them out. But at the same time, it probably is now my son's 15, very limited screens, like he's not on screens during the day at all. Probably takes about five, 10 minutes.

And then what does he have out? has his Legos out and he's building something. He has this super creative car that he came up with on his own or he's out on his bike or he's taking his fishing pole to the lake, which I guarantee you if actually screens were an option for him, he probably wouldn't be doing those things. So I've been okay. And I, as a parent, I do not have it all figured out, but I've been okay. I, he'll tell me he's bored. I'm like, okay.

Yeah, can be like validating your feeling. That can be a real feeling. And then setting up, know, as an educator, we didn't start out with three hours a day outside. also like kids came in, they had to grow their stamina. We had to grow our ability to feel comfortable and trust the research and that this actually is really good for kids. And then as we walk, walk through it, as we observed.

Now we're like, my goodness, the research is right. Like we have validation as educators that this is really important to our students and our students are growing and becoming more confident as a direct result of this play. We, we have tech even in Scola too, right? Like we will have math games, even we'll have some brainless games too. So it's not even that they all have to be academic.

Kristin & Ginger (01:07:33.426)
And we have some carved out times. think that's what's helpful is actually having some time carved out. had, they know when it's coming, they know that even when they're in there, they're going to enjoy it. There's a start, there's a stop. So like we even do stuff where like every Thursday it's la this is how we end the day is laptop time, you know, and we'll put some boundaries around what that happens. But I think honoring that, that screens are here probably to stay. And also there's some, you know, there's some skills to get in that too, but.

yeah, building up the stamina. then also we, we had some, some interesting supplies that are just helpful. I think, getting some of those supplies, if you wanted to do some more outside time, you don't have to get stuff right away because I think if we were to purchase stuff right away before really experiencing this, we wouldn't have gotten the right stuff. So like hold off just a little bit and just see like when this play comes up.

Like art, do you need to buy the nice shovel? Cause maybe digging holes really is the thing or all of our jump rope. We buy jump ropes and then they're rarely used for jump roping. They're used for slingshots. They're used for measuring. You know, so, so just even interesting, a lot of natural materials. man, do our kids know how to collect sticks and make things out of sticks and,

And so just even as a adult being aware if you want to increase the outside time, like just knowing that there are some materials that really do aid and help with play, but being willing to wait and see what shapes up. And then there are, there are just some kids that will, they will increase their stamina faster if they just have people to do it with, right? There are some, some of our kids who could play alone outdoors just fine, but.

for a family who we want to encourage, like pair up with another family and just bring them to a creek, bring them to a climbing place or something and get those kids some time outside.

Ela Richmond (01:09:42.626)
This is so fascinating. The second question that I had for you alongside with this, let me see.

Ela Richmond (01:09:54.518)
I forget. Well, I had another question about this whole theory that you had on play. I find it so fascinating. So my last question for you all is, do students shift between different types of play? then also, when it comes to aligning the types of play with also the next thing that they could be interested, possibly.

Are you all putting things in front of them too or like telling parents, hey, your kid has this like natural tendency to do this really cool thing. You should introduce them to one, two, three, four, five, whatever. Do you all do that?

Kristin & Ginger (01:10:39.655)
Yeah, think I think many times we do that. This is kind of the good starting point of talking about the whole child is we're really trying to tell parents and most of them already know this right, but a lot of times I think they want to know what sticks in a group of people. What sticks kind of without them? A lot of leadership kind of conversations come out or there are just some students where.

Ela Richmond (01:10:47.821)
Mm-hmm.

Kristin & Ginger (01:11:06.065)
They would rather have something planned for them and they just follow along and that's okay too, right? And so, talking to parents just about how we see the growth in that, right? A strong leader, maybe taking a side job and not sabotaging or taking over the project is real growth. Like that's actually a really important life skill that we wanted to communicate to the parents. We also end the year and we call them huddle awards.

So we've just created this list of different characteristics that we see in kiddos. So like a huddle ward might be project manager. So we think about the kiddo that kind of like this has kind of come to the surface. So each year we end the year and play is a huge place where we get the data and obviously letting know families and kids. This is not all we see, but this year and here specifically how we've seen it throughout the school day.

Ela Richmond (01:12:03.438)
That's so cool. Okay, I remembered my last question. Last question, I promise, this is it. Y'all are so fascinating, by the way, and I absolutely love your approach to educating. I think it is so rare to find teachers that are coming up with theories while they're on the job. Like you're here, you're watching students, you're learning from them, you're like, okay, hold on a second, that's really interesting that this is happening. And then you're kind of like extrapolating all of these ideas and thoughts.

You're trying to become better teachers by it. And I absolutely love that approach. I also think it's so cool that through your micro school, because it is yours, you get to take this and create the structure around it. So you get to say, okay, here are the things that we're witnessing. Here's the things that we've seen, a pattern that we've seen. We're actually gonna take this and implement it and see if this actually sticks. I think that's so awesome. The last question that I'll share with you and give to you is when it comes to gaps.

Ginger, you're talking about the fact that when it comes to a student who is alone for a second, sometimes y'all will go over to them and say, hey, like, do you actually want to be alone? Do you want to play with anybody? Like, what is actually happening here? It sounds like y'all have done a very, very, very good job of building trust. So like your students seem to, because you come to them and you ask and like you actually care, it seems like

they're more likely to tell you things pretty quickly. But a lot of parents have wondered the question of like, okay, well, how much should I be stepping in as opposed to just like giving them the space to figure it out? How do y'all determine when to step in and when to give them the space to figure it out?

Kristin & Ginger (01:13:51.122)
That's such a good question, and it really comes from knowing the student and knowing what skills they have and what skills are growing, right? So it can be the same age child, but there's one student that just kind of understands how to confront another, how to acknowledge and express their feelings, but also then give the other student a chance to say their feelings right and come up with a compromise.

and there are other students that just need some help. And it really, don't know how else to explain it Ella, but it comes from knowing the student. And then also that trust starts with the families, right? I think when we interview families about the possibility of enrollment in admissions, we understand there has to, in this style of learning, there has to be a level of trust that's established with families. And it's okay.

if families aren't feeling that from us or want something different, like we actually aren't offended by that. We wanna honor that in that family. so I think that trust that you're talking about is the foundation and it starts with our families being able to trust us, to trust our opinion. That doesn't mean that they're going to agree with everything we say or we see, but we have this relationship where we can say,

and report what we're seeing and they get to speak into it too. So the trust starts with the parents, with the families, and then it takes time to build it with students, but students can see past when you want, as a teacher, when you want to just get onto the next thing that you're asking to put a bandaid on it, students see right past that. And guess what? That bandaid doesn't last. That bandaid is going to be torn off and show up as maybe a behavior that's disruptive.

when it comes time to more, comes time more of an academic setting. So I think because we know that, because of our experience, and because we understand like nothing happens that's going to be sustainable and lasting and worth without that trust. And I think we're coming, teaching is so formation.

Kristin & Ginger (01:16:08.531)
So I think we use that word and we are a faith-based school, but I think even a friend who might be not coming from the same posture would probably agree with us that there's such forming and shaping in a school setting, no matter what the model. And so formation takes time, formation takes a lot of care, formation takes seeing and...

We're going to be shaped and formed whether we're intentional about it or not. and that's just how powerful classroom settings can be. And so I think we take that seriously and we make sure we tell parents like, this is what parents are feeling too, right? Like their kid will go through formation and shaping in this school experience. so, just telling them what's important to us.

I think also just being veteran teachers, right? And that we are healthy. This is why I think teacher health is so important is because when we're healthy, we're actually gonna approach the formation of students and we're gonna see them as people. We're gonna see them as whole people, people we care about. have patience and care and trust for your family and good communication around that. So.

I just, that formation word is important to us and is kind of the, want to be really honest with parents and let them know that they can be honest with us too. And so that's why I think we put out there in front of everybody, these are, this is what's important to us. We're not gonna be good at all of the things, but these are the things that are gonna be really intentional.

This was an incredible episode. I'm beyond fascinated by Elza Prej to play. I'm so happy for Minnesotan families that they get to go to your school. And for those that have just found it to be amazing, so happy for them. If any of our listeners are from Minnesota, they can check you out. We'll leave all of your description links and everything below. Is there anything else that you want to leave our listeners off with?

Kristin & Ginger (01:18:26.491)
I would just say if there's any other educators out there that as we're talking or as you've listened to podcasts, you're starting to get just like this idea of like, well, what if, could I? We would love to hear from you. We actually have just a model school. So other educators reach out to us and just are curious about how just more how we did this and.

what maybe they could do. So I would just encourage them to reach out to us. We'd love to chat with them.

Ela Richmond (01:18:59.672)
I love it. Okay, we'll leave all of your links in the description. If anybody wants to reach out, they definitely can. If anybody wants to look into your school, they definitely can. This was, again, beyond fascinating. And yeah, I hope to hear from you all soon. Thank you all so much for coming on the episode.

Kristin & Ginger (01:19:03.763)
It's great.

Kristin & Ginger (01:19:15.015)
Thank you, Ellen.
