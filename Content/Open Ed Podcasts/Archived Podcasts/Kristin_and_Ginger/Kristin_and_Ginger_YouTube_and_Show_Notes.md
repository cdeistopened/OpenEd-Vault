### Final Cold Open: The Undoing Process

**Kristin:** It's going to take for however many years you're in a system, it's going to take that many months to actually shed everything off before you can rebuild it back up, right? So I was coming out with 18 years of teaching. I needed to give myself 18 months.

(Swoosh)

**Kristin:** As a conventional teacher, you are taught to be so like, efficiency drives the system. And play just doesn't—it's not efficient. If I took my kids outside for an extra recess, gosh, I just felt like I'd be judged. Like, my kids are not working enough.

(Swoosh)

**Kristin:** There's such a currency that's required in play. And that's just not honoring that play is actually the heavy hitter when it comes to skills. Play is the job of kids.

## Show Notes

### The Hardest Part of Leaving Traditional School

After years in conventional classrooms, teachers Kristin and Ginger felt the burnout creeping in. The system's relentless focus on grades, efficiency, and "measuring sticks" was crushing their love for teaching. So they took a leap and built their dream school from scratch.

In this conversation, they share the vulnerable story of starting Scola Microschool—a place built on three pillars: being outside, meeting kids where they are, and fostering deep community. They also reveal their groundbreaking "Four Categories of Play," a framework that turns unstructured time into a powerful tool for understanding child development.

This episode is a must-listen for parents and educators who feel like there has to be a better way. It’s a story about the courage to let go of old systems and the magic that happens when you do.
