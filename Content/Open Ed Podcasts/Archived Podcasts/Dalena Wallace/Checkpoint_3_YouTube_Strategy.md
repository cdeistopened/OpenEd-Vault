## YOUTUBE DESCRIPTION

Therapists say their #1 clients are homeschool moms. Dalena Wallace understands why - and she's found a better way.

After 13 years of homeschooling six kids, Dalena admits she's "not gifted at teaching." But instead of burning out, she built something different: a hybrid approach that brings tutors, co-ops, and community into her kids' education. In this episode, she shares why letting go of the "super mom" expectation changed everything - and how other homeschool families can do the same.

## COLD OPEN SCRIPT

```
DALENA: I've even talked to therapists who have said, number one clients
are homeschooling moms.

<Swoosh cut>

DALENA: I tell people I really, unfortunately I'm not gifted at teaching.
Like I just don't feel like it's something that I do really well.

DALENA: After 13 years of homeschooling, I definitely, even before 13
years, I mean, five, six years into it, I was experiencing some burnout.

DALENA: I know that I do Monday's well and I do Friday's well. So I can
start something strong and I can end it strong, but that in the week,
my goodness, that's like really hard sometimes.

DALENA: I almost gave up on homeschooling. I thought, I don't think
I can do this.

## APPROVED SOCIAL CLIPS

### Clip 1: "I'm Not Gifted at Teaching"
**Duration:** ~1:15 | **On-Screen Hook:** She homeschools 6 kids. She's bad at teaching.

```
DALENA: I tell people I really, unfortunately I'm not gifted at teaching.
Like I just don't feel like it's something that I do really well.

DALENA: With having six kids, every kid is different. You know, what I
thought was working really well for my older two, turns out like my
third and fourth came along and it was just not working at all for them.

DALENA: But that's really what's driven me to seek help and to seek
support and to reach out to others and find those tutors and start
co-op classes so that other families can learn alongside my family
and my kids.

DALENA: My top suggestions would be people. Find the people around you
who can teach your kids something. Don't think it has to be a certified
teacher because there are people, members in the community who want to
teach a skill.

DALENA: Letting go of that expectation that I as the homeschool mom
have to be doing everything myself.

### Clip 2: "Weepy Wednesday"
**Duration:** ~1:10 | **On-Screen Hook:** By Wednesday, I was done.

```
DALENA: I called it my Weepy Wednesdays. I could start the week strong,
you know, and Monday is great. Tuesday's okay. But by the time Wednesday
hit, it was just like, this is so hard. And I still have two more days
of the week that I have to go.

DALENA: That idea of being the super mom who has to not only feed and
clothe and bathe their kids and put them to bed and keep them all on
track and get them to where they need to be. But then to also do the
academics during the mornings was like, my goodness, this is exhausting.

DALENA: So I just really started small by inviting a friend to come and
we would take turns teaching different subjects. One of us would be with
the younger kids while the other one was teaching the older kids their
geography lesson in the room next door.

DALENA: It doesn't have to be on you. You can let go of an academic
subject and find someone who's really skilled in that and give yourself
a little break there.

### Clip 3: "Pulled Her Out After 6 Weeks"
**Duration:** ~1:05 | **On-Screen Hook:** We pulled her out after 6 weeks.

```
DALENA: We actually sent our third daughter to a private school at the
beginning of this school year. But it was just a quarter, so it was
like six weeks into it, and I just knew that was not working.

DALENA: She really hated the long days every day, five days a week. It
was so exhausting for her to wake up at 6.30 to leave by like 7.15 and
then she'd go to school until 3.30. Then she'd stay for basketball or
volleyball practice. She wasn't getting home until 6.30 and it was just
too much.

DALENA: And so we recognized that right away and we were not afraid to
pull her out when we realized this was not a good fit for her.

DALENA: It really has been trial and error. Just listening to our kids
and picking up on are they thriving? Is this working well for them or
would a different situation be what they need?

DALENA: Things can shift and look different year after year, and
sometimes even within the same school year.

### Clip 4: "Therapists' #1 Clients"
**Duration:** ~1:00 | **On-Screen Hook:** Therapists' #1 clients? Homeschool moms.

```
DALENA: I've even talked to therapists who have said, number one clients
are homeschooling moms.

DALENA: It's very, very common for us to feel a lot of pressure and to
feel a lot of responsibility and the weight of all of it being on our
shoulders.

DALENA: After 13 years of homeschooling, I definitely, even before 13
years, I mean, five, six years into it, I was experiencing some burnout.
I almost gave up on homeschooling. I thought, I don't think I can do this.

DALENA: We need to offer grace, we need to offer space, tools and
resources that are gonna come alongside them and support them in this
work and let them know that they're not alone. They don't have to do
it alone.

### Clip 5: "Find the People, Not the Curriculum"
**Duration:** ~1:00 | **On-Screen Hook:** Stop looking for the perfect curriculum.

```
DALENA: My top suggestions would be people. Find the people around you
who can teach your kids something and who have some space in the day.

DALENA: I have used really good curriculum, but honestly, as I'm talking
about it, it's like, we don't use that anymore. And it's because it was
just maybe a little bit too labor intensive on me.

DALENA: Don't think it has to be a certified teacher because there are
people, members in the community who want to teach a skill.

DALENA: We have hired homeschool graduates who understand what the
homeschool day looks like and who are interested in teaching some day.
We're giving them this experience.

DALENA: Find the people who can teach the classes and help me by grading
them and assigning them, raising the bar, challenging my kids.
