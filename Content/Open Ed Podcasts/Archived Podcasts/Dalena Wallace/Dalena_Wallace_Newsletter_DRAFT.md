Greetings Eddies!

Yesterday we dropped our belated homeschool holiday gift guide - but we forgot the most important thing.

The OpenEd Store is officially live.

This isn't a revenue play. All gear is sold at cost because we'd rather see you repping OpenEd than padding our margins. Use code **DROP** for 20% off your first order at [store.opened.co](https://store.opened.co).

Now go tell people to grab their gear. And then let's talk about a homeschool mom who stopped teaching her kids.

Let's dive in.

## THE MOM WHO QUIT TEACHING

Dalena Wallace has homeschooled six kids for 13 years. "I'm not gifted at teaching," she admits. "I just don't feel like it's something that I do really well."

Most homeschool moms feel pressure to become great teachers. Dalena did the opposite - she admitted her weakness and built around it. Tutors on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Co-op on Wednesdays. Online curriculum that grades itself. She kept the days she's good at (Mondays and Fridays) and handed off the rest.

"I'm curating it thoughtfully, prayerfully, and intentionally based on our family's needs."

The best homeschool mom isn't the one who does it all. She's the one who builds the village that does it better.

## KANSAS SCHOOLS ARE CLOSING. CHURCHES ARE OPENING.

Kansas public schools lost 5,000 students in five years. Wichita alone closed six schools last year - with four more coming.

Families are moving into a growing ecosystem of hybrid homeschools, micro schools, and co-ops. Dalena runs [WISE](https://wisetogether.org/) - a network connecting these schools across Wichita. Her vision for what comes next is simple.

"My dream for the future is that there's a school in every neighborhood, just like there's a church in every neighborhood."

Churches already have the classrooms. They have playgrounds. They have gyms. Most of it sits empty Monday through Friday. The infrastructure for the next education already exists. Someone just needs to unlock the doors.

## HYBRID HOMESCHOOL TOOLKIT

After 13 years of hybrid homeschooling, Dalena has one filter for curriculum: "Does it grade itself?"

Her picks: [Teaching Textbooks](https://www.teachingtextbooks.com/) for math - kids log in, watch the lesson, do the problems. Mom checks progress online but never grades papers. [Veritas Press](https://veritaspress.com/) for classical history - great for high schoolers, didn't click for middle school. [The Good and the Beautiful](https://www.goodandbeautiful.com/) is gorgeous but parent-intensive. She couldn't keep up with six kids.

Her biggest recommendation isn't actually curriculum. It's the village. Retired teachers who miss working with kids. Homeschool graduates who want experience. Neighbors who can teach sewing or baking. The curriculum industry wants you to believe the right workbook solves your problems. Dalena learned otherwise.

Good curriculum that requires all your time isn't actually good curriculum.

## THE ONLY KIND OF EDUCATION

"Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is." — Isaac Asimov

When we treat kids as future self-teachers, we give them choice, tools, and trust now - so they leave home knowing how to learn anything they need.

That's all for today!
