## OPENING LETTER: SWAGSTORE LAUNCH

### Option A: Direct Announcement

Greetings Eddies!

Yesterday we dropped our belated homeschool holiday gift guide - but we forgot the most important thing.

The OpenEd Store is officially live.

This isn't a revenue play. All gear is sold at cost because we'd rather see you repping OpenEd than padding our margins. Use code **DROP** for 20% off your first order at [store.opened.co](https://store.opened.co).

Now go tell people to grab their gear. And then let's talk about a homeschool mom who stopped teaching her kids.

Let's dive in.

### Option B: Story Pivot

Greetings Eddies!

Quick confession: we've been keeping a secret.

While you were browsing our holiday gift guide, we were quietly stocking shelves at [store.opened.co](https://store.opened.co). The OpenEd Store is now live - hoodies, tees, all the gear you've been asking for.

Here's the thing: we're selling everything at cost. No markup. Just cool swag for people who believe education should be opened up. Use code **DROP** for 20% off your first order.

Now - speaking of opening things up - let's talk about a homeschool mom who stopped teaching and started curating.

Let's dive in.

---

### Option C: Community-Forward

Greetings Eddies!

Big news from the OpenEd family: the store is officially open.

[store.opened.co](https://store.opened.co) is live with hoodies, tees, and gear for everyone who believes in opening up education. Everything's sold at cost - we're not trying to make money, we just want to see you wearing the mission. Use code **DROP** for 20% off.

Alright, enough commerce. Let's talk about a Kansas mom who homeschooled six kids for 13 years - and finally admitted she's bad at teaching.

Let's dive in.

**Recommended:** Option A - Direct and confident. Gets to the point without being cute.

---

## SEGMENT 1: "I'M NOT GIFTED AT TEACHING" (THOUGHT)

**Source:** Dalena Wallace Podcast
**Type:** THOUGHT (Contrarian take, educational philosophy)

### Angle Options

1. **The Permission Angle:** A 13-year homeschool veteran's confession frees other moms to admit what they already know - they don't have to be good at teaching to give their kids a great education.

2. **The Strategy Angle:** Knowing your weakness isn't failure - it's the first step to building something better. Dalena designed around her limits instead of fighting them.

3. **The Industry Critique:** The homeschool curriculum industry wants you to believe the right workbook will solve your problems. Dalena spent 13 years learning otherwise.

4. **The Reframe:** She's not "outsourcing" - she's curating thoughtfully, prayerfully, and intentionally.

**Recommended:** Option 1 (Permission) - Most emotionally resonant. Opens with confession, lands on relief.

### Structure: Hook / Substance / Insight

**Hook:** Dalena Wallace has homeschooled six kids for 13 years. Her confession? "I'm not gifted at teaching."

**Substance:** Most homeschool moms feel pressure to become great teachers. Dalena did the opposite - she admitted her weakness and built around it. Tutors on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Co-op on Wednesdays. Online curriculum that grades itself. She kept the days she's good at (Mondays and Fridays) and outsourced the rest.

**Insight:** The best homeschool mom isn't the one who does it all. She's the one who builds the village that does it better.

**Key Quote:** "I'm curating it thoughtfully, prayerfully, and intentionally based on our family's needs."

## SEGMENT 2: HYBRID HOMESCHOOLING IS RISING (TREND)

**Source:** Dalena Wallace Podcast + Kansas School Data
**Type:** TREND (Current development, data)

### Angle Options

1. **The Data Story:** Kansas public schools lost 5,000 students in five years. Wichita closed six schools last year. Four more coming. Something's replacing them - and it's not what you'd expect.

2. **The Movement:** Post-COVID, teachers started their own schools. Parents formed pods. What seemed like emergency measures became permanent alternatives. Now there's a whole network of hybrid and micro schools in Kansas.

3. **The Church Opportunity:** Churches have classrooms, playgrounds, and gyms sitting empty Monday through Friday. Dalena sees them as the future of neighborhood-scale education.

4. **The Consolidation Problem:** When districts close schools, kindergartners end up on two-hour bus rides. The centralization that's supposed to save money is crushing families.

**Recommended:** Option 1 (Data Story) into Option 3 (Church Opportunity) - Data creates urgency; church vision offers hope.

### Structure: Hook / Substance / Insight

**Hook:** Kansas public schools lost 5,000 students in five years. Wichita alone closed six schools last year - with four more coming.

**Substance:** Where are families going? Into a growing ecosystem of hybrid homeschools, micro schools, and co-ops. Dalena Wallace runs [WISE](https://wisetogether.org/) - a network connecting these schools across Wichita. Her dream: a school in every neighborhood, just like there's a church in every neighborhood. Churches already have the classrooms and playgrounds. They're just sitting empty during the week.

**Insight:** The infrastructure for the next education already exists. Someone just needs to unlock the doors.

**Key Quote:** "My dream for the future is that there's a school in every neighborhood, just like there's a church in every neighborhood."

## SEGMENT 3: CURRICULUM THAT DOES THE WORK (TOOL)

**Source:** Dalena Wallace Podcast
**Type:** TOOL (Practical resources)

### Angle Options

1. **The "Self-Grading" Filter:** Dalena's criteria for curriculum: Does it grade itself? Does it assign itself? Can I check progress without sitting next to them? If not, she moves on.

2. **The Curriculum Picks:** Teaching Textbooks (math), Veritas Press (history), The Good and the Beautiful (beautiful but too intensive). Real reviews from a mom who's tried them all.

3. **The "Find the People" Framework:** Her actual top recommendation isn't curriculum - it's people. Retired teachers. Homeschool graduates. Neighbors who can teach home ec. The village.

4. **The Network Tools:** [WISE](https://wisetogether.org/) for finding micro schools. [HERO](https://heartlandhero.org/) for Christian school founders. [Vela Education Fund](https://velaedfund.org/) for grants.

**Recommended:** Option 2 (Curriculum Picks) + Option 3 (Find the People) - Gives concrete tools while reinforcing the Thought angle.

### Structure: Hook / Substance / Insight

**Hook:** After 13 years of homeschooling, Dalena Wallace has one filter for curriculum: "Does it grade itself?"

**Substance:** Her picks: [Teaching Textbooks](https://www.teachingtextbooks.com/) for math (kids log in, watch the lesson, do the problems - mom checks progress online but never grades papers). [Veritas Press](https://veritaspress.com/) for classical history (great for high schoolers, didn't click for middle school). [The Good and the Beautiful](https://www.goodandbeautiful.com/) is gorgeous but parent-intensive - she couldn't keep up with six kids.

But her real recommendation? "Find the people." Retired teachers. Homeschool graduates who want experience. Neighbors who can teach sewing or baking. The curriculum industry wants you to believe the right workbook solves your problems. Dalena learned otherwise.

**Insight:** Good curriculum that requires all your time isn't actually good curriculum - not for a family like hers.

## SEGMENT 4: ASIMOV ON SELF-EDUCATION (BONUS)

**Type:** Quote/Image
**Visual:** Isaac Asimov quote card

### Quote
> "Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is."
> — Isaac Asimov

### Caption
When we treat kids as future self-teachers, we give them choice, tools, and trust now - so they leave home knowing how to learn anything they need.

## ORTHOGONALITY CHECK

- [x] **THOUGHT** (confession/philosophy) and **TREND** (data/movement) are distinct
- [x] **TOOL** directly supports THOUGHT without repeating it
- [x] Aligns with OpenEd beliefs (educational freedom, family wholeness, authentic development)
- [x] Would Sarah forward this? (Yes - validation + practical action + shared burden)
- [x] Opening letter does NOT spoil segments (teases "stopped teaching," doesn't explain)

---

## KEYWORD OPTIMIZATION NOTE

For the **blog post revision**, we should:
1. Add "hybrid homeschooling" to the H1 or H2
2. Include the phrase naturally 3-5 times throughout
3. Potential new title: "How One Mom Built a Hybrid Homeschool for 6 Kids (Without Teaching Them)"
4. Add a section explicitly about "What is hybrid homeschooling?" for SEO

## QUESTIONS FOR APPROVAL

1. **Opening Letter:** Which option (A, B, or C)?
2. **Subject Line:** Any standouts from the 10?
3. **THOUGHT angle:** Permission (recommended) or different approach?
4. **TREND angle:** Data + Church vision, or focus on one?
5. **TOOL:** Include all three curriculum picks, or focus on "Find the People" as the main recommendation?
6. **Asimov caption:** Good as written, or want variations?
