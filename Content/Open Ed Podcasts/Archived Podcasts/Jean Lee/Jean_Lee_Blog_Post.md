# How to Homeschool Year-Round (Without Burnout)

When you hear "year-round homeschooling," you probably picture a drill sergeant parent who hates fun. Why would anyone choose to do school in July?

Jean Lee, a neuroscientist and founder of the "Academy of Chaos," argues that year-round schooling isn't about doing *more* work. It’s the secret to doing *less* stress.

Her philosophy is simple but radical: If you spread the work out, you never have to rush. And if you never have to rush, you can afford to stop.

"That picture you see on Instagram of a beautiful family sitting and reading a book only lasted for three minutes," Jean told me. "Then the baby started crawling away. Real homeschooling is messy. It’s chaos."

Jean’s system is designed to tame that chaos. By keeping a gentle rhythm 12 months a year, she eliminates the panic of "falling behind"—and actually ends up with more time off than a traditional school schedule.

Here is her tactical guide to making year-round homeschooling work.

## The Strategy: Plan Once, Execute All Year

Jean’s system relies on a single weekend of high-intensity planning. She uses a digital tool called [Homeschool Planet](https://homeschoolplanet.com/) to map out every single lesson for the entire year.

"I tried paper calendars, but there was too much erasing," Jean told me. "Homeschool Planet allows me to lay out our lessons for the entire year in one weekend."

This sounds rigid, but the math reveals the freedom.

"If we do one math lesson every weekday, we finish by early April," she explains. "We don't account for all the extra days traditional classrooms take off. You have way more time than you realize."

By mapping it all out upfront, she eliminates the daily decision fatigue of "what should we do today?" The plan is there. The only job is to execute. And because the kids have their own logins, they can see the finish line too.

## The Payoff: Guilt-Free Snow Days

The primary cause of homeschool burnout is the constant pressure of the clock. If you take a day off in October, you worry about paying for it in June.

Because Jean knows she’s finishing in April (even with a year-round pace), she has a massive buffer of time. This allows for what I call the "Pause Button."

"It snowed in Indiana this week," Jean said. "I checked the schedule, saw we were fine, and said, 'We're not doing school today. We're going outside.'"

This applies to smaller moments too. When her daughter found a pocketful of June berries or a cool insect, they stopped everything to investigate.

"That is the beauty," Jean says. "It’s messy, it’s chaos, but the beauty exists in those pauses."

You can’t pause for magic if you’re panicked about math. Structure buys you the freedom to be spontaneous.

## Why "Deschooling" Breaks Backfire

This year-round rhythm solves another major burnout trigger: the "restart" battle.

Many homeschoolers advocate for "deschooling"—taking long breaks to reset after leaving public school or during summer. Jean argues this often leads to inertia.

"If you take too long of a break, it's a nightmare to get them back on track," she warns. "Everybody's fighting and screaming, and nobody wants to do the grammar."

By keeping a "gentle rhythm" year-round—even if it’s just 20 minutes of math on a holiday week—she avoids the friction of restarting a cold engine. Burnout often comes from the *transition* back to work, not the work itself.

## Efficiency Hack: Curriculum vs. Workbooks

Finally, to make year-round schooling sustainable, the work has to be efficient. Jean sees too many parents burning out because they are overseeing endless "practice" without actual instruction.

"Parents bring me their materials and say, 'It's a battle every day,'" Jean says. "But what they bring me are workbooks. Workbooks do not have lessons. They are just practice problems."

You cannot hand a child a workbook and expect them to teach themselves algebra. True curriculum provides instruction. It moves faster because the child actually learns the concept.

By choosing high-quality curriculum over busy-work workbooks, Jean’s kids can finish their "school" day in a fraction of the time, leaving the rest of the day for sports, piano, or June berries.

Year-round homeschooling isn't a grind. It's a pacing strategy. It turns education from a sprint into a hike—one where you have plenty of time to stop and look at the view.
