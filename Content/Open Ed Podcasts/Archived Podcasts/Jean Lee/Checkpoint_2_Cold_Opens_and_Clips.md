# Checkpoint 2 – Cold Open & Social Clips (Jean Lee)

## Selected Big Idea
**Flexible structure beats recreating school at home.** Jean shows that consistent expectations + fluid days keep twice-exceptional kids regulated better than long deschooling breaks or rigid bell schedules.

---

## Cold Open
- **Duration:** ~00:32 (00:19:41 – 00:21:13)
- **On-Screen Text Hook:** `Skip Deschooling?`
- **Clip Sequence (verbatim)**
  1. **00:19:41 – Jean:** "I love this topic because Deschooling is spoken about a fair amount. And I am not a fan of deschooling. Here's why I'm not an advocate. Here's why."
  2. **00:19:52 – Jean:** "I know that kids function better when they're on a schedule and have clear expectations. They feel safer knowing what their boundaries are and where they should be going and what they should be doing."
  3. **00:20:12 – Jean:** "If you take too long of a break, it's a nightmare to get them back on track. Everybody's fighting and screaming and nobody wants to go back to doing grammar and math and sit down and do the work."
  4. **00:20:46 – Jean:** "Going into what I often see as deschooling means they're chilling at home. There's a lot of video games, there's a lot of playtime. And if you suddenly say, alright, let's snap back into it and get going on this essay writing today, they're not with you. They're not gonna go along."
  5. **00:21:07 – Jean:** "So I don't typically recommend deschooling. Um, it can easily run into no schooling." *(cut before she explains her daily structure to tease main episode)*

- **Passes Quality Gates:** Stranger hook (contrarian claim), Itch (parents fearing burnout), Stakes (losing momentum), Tease (we cut before she reveals her alternative structure), Emotion (empathetic voice + vivid “fighting and screaming” line).

- **Design Notes:** Start on Jean full-frame, add animated lower-third `Skip Deschooling?` (Inter Bold, uppercase, OpenEd teal #15B3C9 background). Hard cut between clips with subtle whoosh. Burned-in captions centered, white text with charcoal shadow.

### Alternate Options (for review)

#### Option B – \"I Never Planned to Homeschool\"\n- **Duration:** ~00:27 (00:00:32 – 00:01:15)\n- **On-Screen Hook:** `From “That’s Weird”` \n- **Clip Sequence**\n  1. **00:00:32 – Jean:** \"I did not always want to homeschool. Like everyone, COVID changed my family's lives as well, and my kids came home.\"\n  2. **00:00:47 – Jean:** \"We started in traditional classroom, public school, but there were some challenges that I was aware of. I have three very unique learners...\"\n  3. **00:00:59 – Jean:** \"If you would've asked me almost a decade ago, Jean, would you be a homeschool mom? I would've said, no. That's weird.\"\n  4. **00:01:08 – Jean:** \"And I am so thankful now that I'm able to participate as a parent and be such a champion of school choice and alternative learning methods.\" *(Cut before she transitions into the next question to keep mystery about what changed.)*\n- **Why it works:** Relatable \"I never thought I'd be here\" hook with unresolved question (what made her change?).\n- **Design Cue:** Slow push-in on Jean; hook text bottom center in Inter Bold uppercase.

#### Option C – \"The First Homeschool Friend\"\n- **Duration:** ~00:30 (00:01:38 – 00:02:25)\n- **On-Screen Hook:** `Everyone Finds Jean`\n- **Clip Sequence**\n  1. **00:01:38 – Jean:** \"It was literally schools closed and we all came home. So it was immediate for us. But interestingly enough, I see this happen everywhere I go.\"\n  2. **00:01:52 – Jean:** \"It doesn't matter if we're at soccer, if we are at ballet, if we are sitting on a park bench... I talk to hundreds and hundreds of families every week and conversations are always similar.\"\n  3. **00:02:08 – Jean:** \"Hey, is that your kid over there? Yeah, that's mine. She's seven and we're homeschool family. Do you homeschool?\"\n  4. **00:02:15 – Jean:** \"One of the coolest things about being in that space is I love being family's first homeschool friend.\" *(Cut before she explains how those conversations continue.)*\n- **Why it works:** Sets Jean up as the quiet authority everyone seeks out; leaves audience curious about the advice she gives next.\n- **Design Cue:** Use quick cuts with subtle ambient crowd B-roll (if available) to enhance setting; maintain clean captions.

## Social Clips

### Clip 1 – "Deschooling becomes no schooling"
- **Duration:** 01:18 (00:19:41 – 00:20:59)
- **On-Screen Text Hook:** `Stop The Reset`
- **Platforms:** IG Reels, TikTok, YouTube Shorts (parents & homeschool-curious audiences love contrarian advice)
- **Use Case:** Myth-busting clip to post the week before episode launch; hook parents scrolling for planning tips.
- **Transcript (verbatim)**
  > **Jean:** "I love this topic because Deschooling is spoken about a fair amount. And I am not a fan of deschooling. Here's why I'm not an advocate. Here's why. I know that kids function better when they're on a schedule and have clear expectations. They feel safer knowing what their boundaries are and where they should be going and what they should be doing. They, they don't have the the social emotional ability to manage their own details when they're young and they need guidance. Um, so what I found is, and it it's deschooling, but also if you take too long of a break, it's a nightmare to get them back on track. Everybody's fighting and screaming and nobody wants to go back to doing grammar and math and sit down and do the work. It becomes a battle."
  > 
  > **Jean:** "And so I've had this discussion with many, many parents who agree that even taking short breaks is not worth the battle. So we may, if it's a holiday break, do a lighter load. We may just do grammar and then math one day, but we never stop. We rarely take a, a long break."
- **Design Specs:**
  - Opening text animation left-aligned `STOP THE RESET` (Inter ExtraBold 84px, white text over OpenEd teal bar).
  - Caption style: All-caps speaker tag `JEAN:` in amber (#F6A01B), body text white, 4px drop shadow.
  - B-roll suggestion: cutaway to planner, kids checking boxes, or Jean gesturing while speaking.

### Clip 2 – "Year-round doesn’t mean rigid"
- **Duration:** 01:24 (00:17:05 – 00:18:29)
- **On-Screen Text Hook:** `Structure + Snow Days`
- **Platforms:** YouTube Shorts (education), LinkedIn (working-parent credibility), Facebook (homeschool groups)
- **Use Case:** Show how Jean blends advance planning with spontaneous days off—great for promo email or blog embed.
- **Transcript (verbatim)**
  > **Jean:** "I can see our math curriculum. If we do one lesson every weekday, just five days a week, no extra time scheduling and holidays and vacation breaks, we're still gonna get done at the beginning of April. So one thing that we don't account for is all of the extra time and days that traditional classroom's taking off."
  > 
  > **Jean:** "When you come from that space, you, you don't have a visual of your schedule there. You just think they're going so many days and they must be doing so much. But in reality, you're going more quickly because you have a single student. You have way more days than you realize."
  > 
  > **Jean:** "And we actually go year round. My kids go year round. We just end one level and go on to the next. But it's snowed in Indiana this week. So we had a great snow day and I said, we're not doing school today. We're all going outside all day. And we did, and it was fantastic. And we had a blast. And we just came right back to it the next day. Was that time wasted or lost? No. Are we behind in any way? No."
  > 
  > **Jean:** "We also, if we travel, we'll take it on the plane. If we're driving on a Saturday, we drove to Florida several times in the last year. It's an 18 hour drive. That's a great amount of time to get all those math and grammar lessons done. So it's really, really flexible on top of the time gained with each other. You have way more time for learning than you even realize."
- **Design Specs:**
  - Hook appears in top-right corner `STRUCTURE + SNOW DAYS` (Inter Bold, uppercase, white text over charcoal pill).
  - Lower-third B-roll: quick cuts of snow play, car travel, workbook closeups.
  - Captions aligned center, OpenEd slate background at 80% opacity.

### Clip 3 – "Flexible days, beautiful pauses"
- **Duration:** 01:26 (00:37:37 – 00:39:33)
- **On-Screen Text Hook:** `Plan, Then Pause`
- **Platforms:** Instagram Reels (emotional storytelling), TikTok (lifestyle), YouTube Shorts (parent inspiration)
- **Use Case:** End-of-week feel-good clip reminding audience of the payoff of Jean’s approach; pairs with newsletter CTA.
- **Transcript (verbatim)**
  > **Jean:** "Let me tell you what the beautiful looks like for me. The beautiful looks like for me when we wake up in the morning. And we get to just have a gentle breakfast together. We don't have to hurry up, get your backpack, get dressed. The bus is coming. Ah, we don't have that. We get to casually eat breakfast. Enjoy that time together and talk about. Hey, what did you like about this weekend? Or this is the schedule for this week, or this is what's coming up."
  > 
  > **Jean:** "It's also when I pick up my daughter from forest school and she gets home and she unloads her pockets and she has a pocket full of June berries that she wants to share because she snacked on 'em and she thought they were amazing, so she brought some for everyone else. It's seeing my kids enjoy nature 'cause we can go to a park and run around and they play in the mud and it's a hot mess. It's okay because we have time to do that. We can go home."
  > 
  > **Jean:** "It's sitting and writing essays together, things that are really hard if you have a reluctant writer, but you can peacefully sit next to each other and take as long as you need to do that, and we can go sit outside in a swing and do it together. That's the beauty in homeschooling. It's messy, it's chaos. It's not that picture that we think it is. But the beauty exists and it's amazing."
- **Design Specs:**
  - Use soft teal gradient overlay, subtle bokeh background to emphasize warmth.
  - Hook text fades in at :02, bottom center `PLAN, THEN PAUSE` (Inter SemiBold, white, light drop shadow).
  - Add quick B-roll overlays (slow breakfast table, hands holding berries, kids writing outside) if available; otherwise punch-in zooms on Jean for visual interest.
