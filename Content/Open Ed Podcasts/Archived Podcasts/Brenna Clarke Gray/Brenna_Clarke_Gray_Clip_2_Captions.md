**Brenna Clarke Gray:** My eight-year-old loves mythology from anywhere in the world. Stacks of books, mythology podcasts, facts about mythology. ~~That came from boredom, particularly during pandemic closure. He was three or four, just starting to read.~~

But I've also noticed that my kid doesn't want to do a school project about mythology just because he loves it. Nothing kills intrinsic motivation like assigning grades to it. Everybody who's good at a craft, then opens an Etsy store and hates that craft. As soon as you impose external standards on something you loved for its own sake, that kills motivation for a lot of us.

*Hard for education systems though—do a project on this thing you love, now you hate it and I killed it.*
