# Brenna Clarke Gray — YouTube & Show Notes

## Cold Open (Primary Launch)

**OPTION 1 - Colin & Samir Fast-Paced (Recommended)**

Brenna Clarke Gray: "Nothing kills that intrinsic motivation like assigning grades to it."

Ela Richmond: "That's interesting."

Brenna Clarke Gray: "Everybody who is really good at a craft and then they open an Etsy store and then they hate that craft. As soon as you impose external standards and expectations on that thing that you just loved for the love of it. ~~not for everybody, but I think for a lot of us~~ that kind of kills what makes us want to keep learning about it."

## YouTube Description

Teaching is relational work. When we turn what a child naturally loves into a graded assignment, we destroy the very motivation that made it beautiful in the first place.

Join Brenna Clarke Gray, an educator and researcher who studies how technology and systems shape learning, as she explains why grading something your child loves might be the quickest way to kill their intrinsic motivation.

**Key Insights:**
• The difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation
• Why external standards destroy what kids naturally love
• How the "Etsy effect" applies to education
• What parents and teachers can do instead

**Topics Covered:**
- Teaching and learning as relational work
- Intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation
- How systems and external pressure harm curiosity
• Universal Design for Learning
- Boredom as fuel for lifelong learning
- Technology's role in family culture and learning

## Guest Bio

**Brenna Clarke Gray** (she/her) is a critical educational technologist, practitioner/researcher, and theorist working on ethical, accessible, and care-informed use of digital tools in education. She holds a PhD in English literature and spent nine years as a college instructor teaching Canadian literature and creative writing before transitioning to faculty support and research.

At Thompson Rivers University in British Columbia, Brenna studies how universities procure and implement technology—examining the gap between what we know helps learning and what systems actually support. Her work challenges the assumption that more technology equals better education.

Beyond her academic work, Brenna hosts the podcast **Community of Praxis**, a series of conversations about big ideas in education. The podcast invites a more care-centered, student-focused approach to teaching and learning while acknowledging real structural limitations like time, funding, and precarity.

She is also the mother of an eight-year-old mythology enthusiast and a one-year-old, and has strong opinions about protecting childhood, limiting data harvesting, and teaching kids to think critically about technology rather than simply using it.

## Show Notes Summary

This episode explores the fundamental gap between how we think education should work and how current systems actually operate. Brenna Clarke Gray, an educator with 9+ years of classroom experience and ongoing research on educational technology, sits down to discuss:

**Why Information Transfer Isn't Learning**
The core issue: we've confused information delivery with actual learning. Real learning is relational—it requires a human connection between teacher and student, not just the transfer of facts.

**The Measurement Problem**
Schools measure what's easy to measure (attendance, test scores, compliance) rather than what actually matters (understanding, growth, connection). This creates a system optimized for measuring the wrong things.

**The Content Overload Trap**
Teachers, especially passionate ones, often overload students with information. The pandemic briefly showed us that students actually learn MORE when given LESS content and more time to work with it—but we abandoned that lesson.

**The Intrinsic Motivation Paradox**
The moment you assign a grade to something a child loves, you've transformed it from intrinsic motivation (learning for its own sake) to extrinsic motivation (learning for the grade). This often kills the child's desire to keep learning that subject.

**Boredom as a Feature, Not a Bug**
Creating space for boredom—unstructured time where kids can pursue their own interests—leads to genuine, self-directed learning. Her eight-year-old's encyclopedic knowledge of mythology came from pandemic boredom and unstructured reading time, not from any formal curriculum.

**Technology as a Tool, Not a Solution**
Brenna is skeptical of tech-first solutions in education. Her home prioritizes books over screens, not because technology is bad, but because intentional choices about technology lead to better family culture and learning outcomes.

## Audience Value Proposition

This episode is for:
- **Parents** concerned about protecting their children's natural curiosity and love of learning
- **Teachers** frustrated with systems that prioritize testing over understanding
- **Educators** questioning whether external measures (grades, tests, compliance metrics) are helping or harming learning
- **Anyone** interested in the gap between what we know helps learning and what education systems actually support

**Why listen:** Brenna articulates what many educators feel but can't always say—that current systems often undermine rather than support real learning. She provides specific examples (the Etsy effect, the pandemic lesson, her son's mythology obsession) that resonate with listeners' own experiences while offering a deeper framework for understanding why these systems exist and what we might do differently.
