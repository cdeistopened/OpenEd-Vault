## 00:00 - From FBI Aspirations to a Classroom Calling
*Dave Hoffman thought he was headed to Quantico. Nine agents and one failed interview later, he walked into a Spanish classroom instead.*

**Ela Richmond:** Welcome back to the Open Ed Podcast. I'm your sometimes host, Ela, and today I'm joined by Dave Hoffman. Dave, give us the origin story. How did you find yourself in education?

**Dave Hoffman:** I studied Spanish and communications because I was convinced I wanted to be an FBI agent. I made it all the way to the final panel interview with nine agents, and I didn't pass. They told me I'd have to wait a year to reapply, so I suddenly had this "What now?" moment with a Spanish degree in hand. I figured I'd teach while I waited—and I never went back to the bureau. I started subbing in Salt Lake City, then we moved to Southern California so I could launch a full-time teaching career.

## 01:45 - Falling for the Rhythm of Teaching
*He insists teaching felt like getting paid to do the thing he loved most.*

**Ela Richmond:** And you stayed. Why did the classroom keep you?

**Dave Hoffman:** I flat-out loved it. Being with kids, trading jokes, watching them get the language—it was addictive. I couldn't believe I got paid to do it. Sure, I'd drag myself home emotionally exhausted some days, but I was done by 3:30 or 4:00. In Southern California that meant I could jump straight into the pool and reset. I coached basketball and water polo, ran peer tutoring, did hospital-homebound instruction—if the school offered a program, I probably said yes. I thrived on the variety.

## 03:40 - Charter Schools and the Spark of Educational Choice
*His curiosity about alternative models came from parenting, not policy papers.*

**Ela Richmond:** You’ve worked in public, charter, and private settings. What pulled you across those different models?

**Dave Hoffman:** I grew up in traditional public school and assumed that was the only model. When my kids were young, we started to see new options pop up—charters, hybrids, microschools. My wife and I realized we could tailor an education to each child. That flipped a switch. We enrolled our kids part time, sometimes full time, sometimes not at all, depending on the season. I even led a charter where I taught seventh- through twelfth-grade boys in one room—many of them at risk or even homeless in Southern California. Just watching those kids show up in uniform every day was powerful. The range of possibilities hooked me.

## 05:45 - Why the Hoffmans Went All-In on Homeschooling
*Kindergarten changed their daughter—and not in a way they liked.*

**Ela Richmond:** Most families I meet stumble into homeschooling because something breaks. You were early adopters. What made you jump in?

**Dave Hoffman:** Our oldest started kindergarten at a charter run by friends. Within weeks her personality shifted—she got aloof, sassy, not herself. We shadowed the class and realized there was nothing happening in kindergarten that we couldn't do at home. Her two little sisters missed her terribly. So we brought her home. First grade? Same story. We leaned into it and joined co-ops that supported us. That experience convinced us education wasn't about bells, hall passes, and worksheets. It's about doing meaningful things that stick. From there we read books, went to conferences, and slowly became the biggest unschoolers you can imagine—while I was still heading into a building full of bells and policies every day.

## 08:20 - Rebel Administrator, Unschool Dad
*He kept disrupting the system from the inside even while opting out at home.*

**Ela Richmond:** If I were a fellow teacher, I'd be baffled: you're running a conventional school but doing a totally different thing with your own kids. Why live in both worlds?

**Dave Hoffman:** Two reasons. First, I knew I could still have a real impact inside the system. My classroom looked nothing like the other Spanish rooms. Kids wanted to be there. Parents wrote years later to tell me some small thing I did changed their kid's trajectory. That mattered. Second, at home, no one gave me grief. Homeschooling was becoming semi-respectable, and frankly, teachers and administrators homeschool at higher rates than the general public. We know the constraints from the inside. I saw the rules up close, but I also knew I could bend them in my classroom—and build something radically different at home.

## 10:50 - The Hardest Part of Wearing the Principal Badge
*Administration offered reach—and a nonstop stream of crises.*

**Ela Richmond:** At some point you moved into administration. What were you trying to change from that seat?

**Dave Hoffman:** Honestly, part of it was practical. I had six kids and a spouse at home; administration paid more. But I also figured I could influence an entire campus instead of 150 students a year. The trade-off was brutal. Half my time was discipline or damage control. Parents came in hot because someone felt mistreated. Teachers would melt down in my office. I had the police on speed dial at supposedly "good" leadership charters. We dealt with theft, drugs, affairs between staff members—you name it. I fired a teacher who pawned school laptops, another who hacked the state reporting system to change grades. The soap opera never stopped. The bright spots were assemblies, dances, the moments I actually spent with kids learning. But administration is heavy work.

## 16:30 - Making School Choice Work for Everyone
*He believes competition—not compliance—will save public schools.*

**Ela Richmond:** Given all that, where do you want public schools to go from here?

**Dave Hoffman:** Choice is already reshaping everything, and that's a good thing. Education Savings Accounts and vouchers are forcing every school—public, charter, private—to become the place families actually want to choose. Once schools operate in a competitive environment instead of a monopoly, innovation follows. Better programs emerge, teachers are happier, and administrators feel less like hall monitors. It's like running a burger stand next to McDonald's: if your burgers are bad, you go out of business. Closing a school isn't a tragedy; it's feedback that pushes everyone else to raise their game.

**Ela Richmond:** Critics say when you introduce choice, the most privileged families leave and everyone else loses. How do you answer that?

**Dave Hoffman:** It's limited thinking. In every school I led, at least 20 percent of our students were on IEPs or 504s—exactly like the neighborhood schools. We took whoever came; legally we can't turn them away. ESAs are leveling the financial playing field. For decades I paid taxes into a system I never used because we homeschooled. Now those dollars can follow kids to pods, private schools, microschools—whatever fits. Charter options are wildly diverse: teen mom programs, STEM labs, leadership academies, schools for deaf or autistic students. Choice is not about "skimming the cream." It's about acknowledging that families have different needs and letting them pursue them.

## 24:40 - Designing a Patchwork Education Across States
*If there was a learning opportunity, the Hoffmans probably tried it.*

**Ela Richmond:** I've noticed families are starting to treat education like a menu. How did you design that for your own kids, especially since you moved so often?

**Dave Hoffman:** We were proactive. We'd Google local co-ops, walk into homeschool supply stores, ask around at conferences. Once you're in that network, one contact leads to 100. Because we homeschooled, we could turn life into a field trip. We moved from California to Colorado Springs to Utah to other states just to see the country. I'd fly out in the summer, interview at three or four districts, and get multiple offers. Sometimes we had five acres and a farmhouse. Sometimes we lived downtown. All of it counted as education.

Our oldest daughter only attended the local high school for two hours a day, but she was still homecoming queen. She toured with a choir, competed in pageants, and took Open Ed-supported debate and mock trial. One son did welding through a district ALC. Another took college math after finding a curriculum that clicked. We mixed and matched everything—public school electives, co-ops, sports, private lessons. If something stopped working, we quit. If something lit them up, we doubled down.

## 33:30 - Raising Self-Directed, Resilient Adults
*Unschooling demanded trust—and produced confident kids who all out-earn their dad.*

**Ela Richmond:** A lot of parents fear the unpredictability of homeschooling. You embraced it. How?

**Dave Hoffman:** My wife is pure Pippi Longstocking—she'd live in a tent and travel the world if I let her. I was the structured one. Over time I saw that when you force kids, they rebel. So we ditched anything that smelled like school. We let them follow passions and taught them to solve problems. Not one of my kids used the same math program in high school. They all read on their own timeline—usually around seven or eight—and then never stopped. Sunday school teachers would hand us phonics packets and we'd smile and say, "We're good." Today my kids devour books and self-teach constantly.

They're also confident. They've bet on themselves, taken weird paths, and now they all make more money than I do—even with my bachelor's, credential, and master's. Some work construction, some model, some run creative businesses. College wasn't necessary for them, and they knew it because they were already doing meaningful work as teenagers. Our job was to give them room to run, let them fail, and be there when they needed a sounding board.

## 40:30 - Inside BYU Independent Study and the Resources Families Need
*Now he's helping other families customize learning with structure when they want it.*

**Ela Richmond:** Fast-forward to today. You're partnering with OpenEd through BYU Independent Study. What should families know about what you offer?

**Dave Hoffman:** BYU Independent Study has more than 215 courses for middle and high schoolers. Every core subject is there, plus 100-plus electives: career and technical tracks, entrepreneurship, nine different languages, even niche PE classes like cycling or swimming. What's new is our KSA design—Knowledge, Skills, Attributes. In a biology course, for example, students still learn the standards-aligned content, but they also practice a skill like critical thinking and explore an attribute like resilience. If they go deeper, they can earn micro-credential badges they later use on resumes or scholarship applications. It's a holistic approach rather than "read the chapter, take the quiz."

Because we're accredited, families earn transcripts that transfer anywhere. BYU carries weight; people know the name whether they've seen our sports teams or BYUtv. And we're flexible. Students get a full year to finish, which homeschoolers appreciate. We even issue scholarships and exceptions when it makes sense. The other day I got approval for a 14-year-old foster student to take psychology so they can envision college before they age out of the system. That's the kind of "plane full of yes" culture we're trying to build.

We also coach families on navigating state laws. Some states are wide open, some are restrictive, and the rules change with every legislative session. Our advice is always the same: get connected. Walk into a local homeschool resource center, show up at park day, attend a conference. One introduction leads to dozens of opportunities. Choice is easier when you know who’s already doing what you’re dreaming about.

**Ela Richmond:** Dave, this has been such an energizing conversation. Thanks for sharing how you’ve lived in both worlds.

**Dave Hoffman:** Thanks for having me. The art of parenting is knowing when to let your kids go. If we can give families tools to do that with confidence, we’ve done our job.
