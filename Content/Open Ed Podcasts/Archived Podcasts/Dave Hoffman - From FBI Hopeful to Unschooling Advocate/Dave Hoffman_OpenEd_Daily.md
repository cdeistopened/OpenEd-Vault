# Stop Freaking Out About Learning Gaps

Why a principal-turned-unschool dad says gaps are normal. PLUS: The BYU Independent Study menu for homeschoolers.

Greetings!

Dave Hoffman spent decades running public and charter schools—and quietly homeschooling his six kids. Our latest episode unpacked the cognitive dissonance. Today’s Thought–Trend–Tool pulls one lesson from that conversation you can apply this week.

Let's dive in.

# Everyone Has Gaps—Teach Problem-Solving

“Everybody has gaps. The question is, can they learn and can they solve problems?” That was Dave Hoffman's calm reply every time a parent worried their homeschooled child would miss something essential. Remember: this is coming from the guy who ran the school. Hoffman’s own son struggled with algebra worksheets, then grew up to run laser-leveled excavation crews that rely on math every minute. The difference wasn’t a flawless transcript. It was confidence earned by doing real work.

If your kid is learning outside the conveyor belt, you’re going to field questions about benchmarks. Resist the reflex to explain away every non-standard timeline. Instead, track the harder-to-measure victories: the debate your daughter moderated, the budget your son drafted for his landscaping gig, the hours your neurodivergent tween poured into comic world-building. Those reps build the problem-solving muscle Hoffman swears is harder to teach once kids learn to wait for instructions.

# Parents Rewriting the Report Card

Hoffman’s “gaps are normal” mantra lands in a broader trend: parents reclaiming how progress is measured. “We just kept asking, ‘What do you want to try next?’” he told me, describing a homeschool transcript that looked more like a startup portfolio—water polo with the local high school, welding through the district ALC, debate and mock trial via OpenEd. Choice programs (Utah Fits All, Arizona’s ESA, Florida’s PEP) are accelerating that mix-and-match mindset by letting families fund micro-schools, co-ops, and online courses that don’t issue tidy quarterly grades.

Even inside districts, the movement is leaking in. Hoffman admits he still breaks policy to waive prerequisites or award scholarships when a kid proves mastery another way. Administrators saying yes to evidence that lives outside a GPA signals the report card is officially up for negotiation. Expect more of that as alternative transcripts (Mastery Transcript Consortium, My Tech High’s competency badges) and digital portfolios become the common language between parents, community colleges, and employers.

**Clip to pull:** “What Do You Want to Try Next?” (28:40-29:35) — Dave walks through the patchwork transcript he built for his kids, a perfect montage for illustrating this trend.

# BYU Independent Study’s KSA Course Library

Still want structure without surrendering flexibility? Hoffman now heads outreach for BYU Independent Study, which just partnered with OpenEd. Their pitch: 215 middle and high school courses built around KSA—Knowledge, Skills, Attributes. Students cover the state-aligned content, but each class also trains a skill (critical thinking, digital storytelling, data fluency) and an attribute (resilience, curiosity, collaboration). Finish the optional mastery track and your kid earns a micro-credential badge to stash in a portfolio.

The catalog spans Algebra 1 to Entrepreneurship, nine foreign languages, even niche PE like cycling. Courses run on your schedule with a full year to complete, and families can cherry-pick a single credit without enrolling in the full program. Translation: if you’re designing a homeschool plan around interests but want transcripts that transfer, BYU IS gives you a tool set that matches Hoffman’s philosophy—teach kids to solve real problems, document the growth, and stop obsessing over the perfect pace chart.

That's all for today!
