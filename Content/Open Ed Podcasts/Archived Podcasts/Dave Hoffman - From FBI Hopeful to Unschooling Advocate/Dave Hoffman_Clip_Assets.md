# Dave Hoffman — Final Clip Assets

## Clip 1: "Stop Obsessing Over Learning Gaps"
- **Segments:** 33:20-34:45 (Polished transcript)
- **Hook:** A principal-turned-unschool dad demolishes the fear of "gaps" and proves problem-solving beats perfect curricula.
- **Story Arc:** Fear of gaps → Real-world proof (son’s career) → Core philosophy → Credibility (all kids out-earn him)
- **Edited Transcript:**
  - **Dave Hoffman:** People, especially teachers, would worry. They'd say a homeschooled kid has "gaps" in their learning. ~~But who says algebra has to come before geometry?~~ My son wasn't great at textbook math, but now he does laser-leveled excavation—calculating things that actually matter. If you teach kids to solve problems, you don't have to worry about the textbook learning. ~~Because they'll figure out what they need to learn.~~ I work with grown adults who can't think past, "What do you want me to do on this?" None of my kids have gone to college. They all make more money than I do—and they're happy.

## Clip 2: "Say Yes, Then Figure It Out"
- **Segments:** 38:20-39:35 (Polished transcript)
- **Hook:** Dave shares how he breaks policy to open doors for families—and why more administrators should do the same.
- **Story Arc:** Big institution limits → Personal choice to bend rules → Foster student example → Call for leaders to prioritize kids
- **Edited Transcript:**
  - **Dave Hoffman:** ~~I fight that at my work all the time.~~ I work for a big institution—BYU—and because we're big, we're not always agile or creative. We have set policies, and I buck them all the time on behalf of the customer. Just yesterday I gave a 14-year-old a scholarship for a university course. That's against policy. But she's a foster kid about to age out. If she can take college classes now, she'll see she's smart enough to keep going. So I broke the policy, got her the scholarship, and she's starting psychology this year. I did the exact same thing in public school. I'd bust through the fences. If you can show it's better for kids, a lot of leaders will say, "Let's try it."
