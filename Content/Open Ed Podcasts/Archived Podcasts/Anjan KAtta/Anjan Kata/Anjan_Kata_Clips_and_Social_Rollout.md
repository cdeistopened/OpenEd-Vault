### Full Verbatim Transcript with Edits

**Charlie:** ~~But you use the term dysregulate. I think that is a big word in the neurodiversity, ADHD, PTSD world—all these cognitive issues that people have. A lot of them either stem from or result in dysregulation.~~ What ~~in your research~~ is the connection between the screens ~~that we use~~ and ~~some of those underlying symptoms? What's~~ the root cause?

**Anjan:** ~~Right. My first impression was it's just these algorithms. They're so addicting. It's the fact that you can open 300 tabs and you get 20 links. It's only the software that's the problem. To be totally frank, even upstream of that, I thought the problem was myself. I don't have enough willpower. I don't have enough discipline. I'm not good enough. I think that's a very honest experience of computers today—you blame yourself for not being good enough because of the way you used it.~~

~~Then you sort of realize, wait a minute, the software here is a huge perpetrator. These things are diabolically designed to be as addicting as possible. That is dramatically different than early computers. That's even dramatically different than computers 20 years ago. But the next layer that really opened me up—and that's where Daylight comes from—is~~ I didn't quite appreciate how much the screen, the light of a computer, the appearance of a computer actually deeply plays a role in ~~the way it's~~ dysregulating. ~~What I learned is:~~

Number one, ~~the~~ blue light ~~from computers~~.  

Number two, this thing called flicker.  

Number three, ~~it's~~ brightness mismatched to the rest of the environment.  

Number four, ~~the~~ oversaturated colors and high contrast ~~that a computer has~~.  

And number five, it keeps us indoors—you can't ~~really~~ use it outside.

All five of these go together and ~~really~~ contribute to dysregulating you at a vagal and nervous system level, ~~at a breathing level, at blink rates, and to your point, the associated mood tone, cognitive tone that comes from the hypertrophy of the eyes, your dopamine system, your melatonin and circadian system, and all the metabolic processes that come out of that.~~ Basically, your body gets put on high alert, high arousal, high stimulation when you're on a computer. 

The simplest tagline ~~to describe it would be~~: your computer is trying its best ~~job~~ to simulate a Vegas casino ~~in terms of its light environment~~. The Vegas casino blocks out all the natural light. They have incredibly bright lights. It's a ton of blue light. It's all flashing and flickering and it's all extremely over-saturated. They do that because they have figured out to a science~~—~~this is how you put a ~~human in a~~ nervous system ~~and physiological state~~ to be most susceptible to getting stuck into these dopamine loops, ~~most stuck into these consumptive stimming loops. That's essentially in a smaller way what our computer is doing to us.~~

~~One small example that I find so illustrative is when we feel more tense when we use a computer. There's a phenomenon called screen apnea. There is sleep apnea—that's the common one, which is while you sleep, you don't breathe. There's a whole host of problems in your life that comes from that. Well, some researchers realized there is the equivalent of that for screens and they call it screen apnea. Basically because you have sympathetic over-regulation and not enough parasympathetic, and this deer in the headlights response you get with the light of a computer, when you're on a computer, the screen apnea phenomenon is: one, you breathe less—you literally take less breaths per minute. And number two, your tidal volume is less, meaning you actually breathe shallower. The combination of these two is you're dysregulated. You're a bit more anxious. I could go on, but there's a litany of ways that computers physiologically actually put us in a place that makes us dysregulated for the rest of our day, but also then more susceptible to the dopamine slot machines that are the YouTubes and TikToks and the feeds. It's a vicious cycle that builds on top of each other. So I was like, we have to start with light. That same Vegas casino slot machine on the side of a beautiful river, you're in Northern California, the Yuba River or something—it's not as addicting. There is something about the design of the entire light environment that plays a role. That's why we wanted to reinvent the screen of a computer to really get at the heart of the way the computer uses light to affect us.~~

**Charlie:** ~~Well,~~ I'm just going to ~~briefly just~~ show~~—~~this is my Daylight. ~~I was an early adopter. I was super excited to get my hands on one. And it was one of these things where the ad—it shows first of all,~~ you can just see this ~~for people watching~~. It's like a Kindle~~. It's just like a Kindle, but it's perfectly responsive. It's fast. So I think one way to look at it is basically like a faster, more responsive Kindle. But another way is really~~—it's a replacement for your laptop or your desktop.

Your kid's Chromebook was literally designed using Vegas casino psychology.

Blue light ✓
Flicker ✓
Brightness mismatch ✓
Oversaturated colors ✓

All five create the same physiological state that makes gambling addictive.

No wonder they melt down after screen time.

It's not behavior. It's biology.

#### LinkedIn (Professional/Solution Focus):
**Option 1** - Using "People don't fail..." template:
```
People don't struggle with screen time because they lack discipline.

They struggle because modern devices use five physiological mechanisms to dysregulate the nervous system:

• Blue light disrupts circadian rhythms
• Flicker creates subtle stress responses  
• Brightness mismatch forces constant adaptation
• Oversaturated colors overstimulate dopamine
• Indoor-only design disconnects us from natural regulation

The solution isn't willpower. It's better technology.

Anjan Kata (Daylight Computer founder) spent 6 years solving what field experts said was impossible: E-Ink screens fast enough to replace traditional displays.

For families homeschooling or choosing alternative education paths, this matters. Educational technology should enhance learning, not dysregulate the learner.

- **Duration**: 95-110 seconds
- **Story Arc**: Universal parent pain → Hidden mechanism → Scientific proof → Reframe the problem
- **Best Platforms**: Facebook Groups, Instagram (empathy-focused), Parent Communities

### Full Verbatim Transcript with Edits

**Charlie:** ~~I think probably there are no consumers who are more concerned about screens than parents with their kids. You hear all this talk about the zombified kid after being on an iPad for an hour. In some cases, they might not even become—zombie is the wrong analogy, because they're overstimulated. And when you take the object away from them, maybe they kind of look like a zombie when they're glued into it, but then they're dysregulated, right?~~

**Anjan:** They're a monster.

**Charlie:** ~~So their whole system—exactly,~~ they're keyed up and it's not good. ~~The handful of times I've made the mistake of letting my kids who are three and six—the ones we've used the iPad on occasion, just watching Daniel Tiger or whatever—I definitely don't want that to be the default of how they interact with devices.~~

**Anjan:** ~~One small example that I find so illustrative is when we feel more tense when we use a computer.~~ There's ~~a~~ phenomenon called screen apnea. ~~There is sleep apnea—that's the common one, which is while you sleep, you don't breathe. There's a whole host of problems in your life that comes from that. Well, some researchers realized there is the equivalent of that for screens and they call it screen apnea. Basically because you have sympathetic over-regulation and not enough parasympathetic, and this deer in the headlights response you get with the light of a computer, when you're on a computer, the screen apnea phenomenon is:~~ ~~one,~~ you breathe less—you literally take less breaths per minute.

It's a vicious cycle that builds on top of each other.~~

**Anjan:** ~~[Earlier in the conversation]~~ I was so dysregulated. My circadian rhythms are ~~so~~ toast. I am so disembodied. ~~I don't remember what I'm reading. The next day, I don't even know what I learned. I'm not able to articulate it because my brain and nervous system is frazzled. So I learned I'm basically just pretending.~~

### Platform-Specific Captions

#### Instagram/Facebook (Maximum Empathy):
**Option 1** (Personal Story):
```
I used to blame myself when my kids turned into monsters after iPad time.

Turns out, I was blaming the wrong thing.

There's something called "screen apnea"—just like sleep apnea, but for screens.

When kids are on devices, they:
• Breathe less frequently
• Take shallower breaths
• Enter low-level fight-or-flight

They're not being difficult.
Their nervous system is literally dysregulated.

This changes everything about how I think about educational technology.

```

**Option 2** (Scientific Angle):
```
"Screen apnea" is stealing your child's breath.

And you probably have it too.

Here's what's happening:
→ Less breaths per minute
→ Shallower breathing (lower tidal volume)
→ Chronic low-level anxiety
→ Nervous system dysregulation

That post-screen meltdown? It's not behavioral. It's physiological.

Former ADHD kid who struggled with this explains the science (and the solution) → [LINK]
```

**Option 3** (Reframe):
```
What if your kid isn't "addicted" to screens?

What if their device is just really good at hijacking their breathing?

Screen apnea is real.
The meltdowns make sense.
And there's finally a better option.

```

#### LinkedIn:
**Using "Every big change..." template**:
```
Every big parenting shift in my approach started the same way—

I was blaming my kids for something that wasn't their fault.

Screen tantrums? I thought it was about limits and discipline.

Screen apnea? I'd never heard of it.

But here's what I learned from Anjan Kata (Daylight Computer founder):

When kids are on screens, their nervous system gets dysregulated through measurable physiological mechanisms:
• Reduced breathing frequency
• Decreased tidal volume (shallower breaths)
• Chronic sympathetic nervous system activation

They're not being difficult. They're literally in a subtle fight-or-flight state.

For parents choosing alternative education paths—especially those integrating technology—this science matters.

The question isn't "screen time yes or no."
It's "which screens, and how do they affect the whole child?"

"Screen apnea" is the parenting concept you've never heard of but desperately need to understand.

## CLIP 3: "The Least Computer Possible"

### Clip Details
- **Primary On-Screen Text**: "Unlimited Screen Time (Because It's Actually Healthy)"
- **Duration**: 100-120 seconds
- **Story Arc**: False binary → Philosophy → Real parent testimony → The paradox resolved
- **Best Platforms**: LinkedIn, YouTube Shorts, Email (solution-focused)

### Full Verbatim Transcript with Edits

**Anjan:** ~~I think the high level thing to share here also is not to say that because we've made a healthier screen, we've made a healthier computer—that's not the important part. The important part is actually just being outside, being in the dirt, having your hands on physical things, playing with other kids, playing with other people. That to me is the real sauce. The reason we exist is because~~ it's unrealistic ~~and probably not in the best interests of your child's development~~ to be a Luddite, to completely get away ~~with~~ from technology. So the point of Daylight is ~~almost like~~ the least computer possible and you do what you need to and you put it away and you go outside and ~~you put your hands in the dirt and~~ you play with other ~~people~~ kids. ~~That's the high level of how we think about this.~~ 

~~There are aspects of technology that are either hard to get rid of because school has them or they're actually useful like an audiobook or a Spotify or it's~~ actually a very powerful way to ~~stimulate your own kids'~~ learning ~~and thinking and curiosity and expression—~~some of the adaptive learning apps ~~that you're talking about~~. People know about Khan Academy, but there's ~~new~~ things like Reading.com and Mentava and Alpha Schools~~, and Timeback, which for all intents and purposes are sort of 80% book, 20% teacher, and the teacher is sort of embedded in it. So it's personalized to you or in the same way a tutor is like, "okay, that's too difficult for you, let's do this. Okay, you didn't quite get that, let me do that."~~

~~Basically, instead of needing a tutor to be there, the actual quote unquote textbook has that. That's inherently digital. The hope is Daylight gives you a safe, healthy, clean way to be able to access these things. I love the promise here is not like, "oh, my kid's gonna be a million times smarter." That may be directionally also true. It's~~ instead of ~~now~~ four hours and ~~more~~ tantrums ~~and more difficulty to have the kid be engaged or do it~~, it gets done in an hour or 45 minutes and they're engaged ~~and now there's more time. Now you don't have all these negative associations and emotions around learning or reading or this~~. 

~~Frankly, I think this idea that we need YouTube and games is the only way to keep kids engaged—I don't think it's true.~~ It's like sugary candy. If that's all that's there, they're going to pick it every time over hummus and carrots. But if hummus and carrots are there, they objectively taste good if your senses haven't been ruined by the other things. ~~So we came up with Daylight Kids and basically has kids software, it's blocked from the internet and distracting apps. It's just got books and drawing and stories and learning apps. It's just the good parts of the digital world. The goal here is to just allow a little bit of digital into your life without it taking over.~~

**Anjan:** ~~I love the way~~ one of our customers said ~~it. They're like,~~ "~~my kid loves the Daylight because when they previously~~ ~~had~~ an iPad, ~~they~~ were only allowed 45 minutes of screen time a week. And I give them unlimited screen time with the Daylight." It turns out ~~there's something called Brilliant.org, which is sort of an educational game type thing. It turns out that's~~ more interesting than picking on your sister, but less interesting than your backyard. ~~And that is what Daylight is for. So I would say it allows you to have the engaging aspects of a computer without it being bad for you. For parents, the way I would think about it is~~ Daylight is a guilt-free or healthier iPad.

### Platform-Specific Captions

**Option 1** (Paradox Hook):
```
"I give my kids UNLIMITED screen time."

Before you judge—hear me out.

One mom went from 45 minutes/week on an iPad to unlimited time on a Daylight computer.

Why?

Because not all screens are created equal.

The "Vegas casino" screens → Limited, dysregulating
The paper-like E-Ink screens → Unlimited, actually healthy

Her kids' reality:
"More interesting than picking on your sister, but less interesting than your backyard."

That's the sweet spot.

**Option 2** (False Binary):
```
You're trapped in a false choice:

Option A: Be a Luddite (no technology)
Option B: Accept dysregulation (standard devices)

There's a third way.

Anjan Kata calls it "the least computer possible."

Technology that:
✓ Replaces 4 hours of tantrums with 45 minutes of focus
✓ Gets the learning done without the crash
✓ Creates no negative associations with reading

One parent's testimony: "I give them unlimited screen time now. Because it's actually healthy."

The future of homeschool tech → [LINK]
```

**Option 3** (Lifestyle Framing):
```
The real goal isn't more screen time.

It's:
→ Hands in dirt
→ Playing with other kids
→ Being outside

But kids need SOME technology for school.

So what if there was a device that:
• Gets the academic work done faster (45 min vs. 4 hours)
• Doesn't dysregulate them
• Doesn't create negative emotions around learning

"The least computer possible."

That's the philosophy.

Full convo with the founder → [LINK]
```

#### LinkedIn:
**Option 1** - Using "What if..." template:
```
What if the good screen was simpler than you thought?

E-Ink display (paper-like, no blue light)
Fast enough to replace Chromebooks
Kids request what they want to learn
Parents approve or deny
No tantrums, more outdoor time

That's it.

We make educational technology complicated, but the best version is surprisingly simple.

Anjan Kata (Daylight Computer) is proving that you don't have to choose between being a Luddite and accepting dysregulation.

For families designing personalized education: this changes what's possible.

One parent's testimony: "I went from 45 minutes per week (iPad) to unlimited screen time (Daylight). My kids love it, and I don't feel guilty."

The paradigm shift → OpenEd Podcast with @anjankataday

```

**Option 2** - Using "Stop trying to be extraordinary..." template:
```
Stop trying to find the perfect educational technology.

Use ordinary apps.
On an extraordinary screen.
With consistent boundaries.

This is how families actually create healthy tech habits.

Anjan Kata's philosophy: "The least computer possible."

Not Luddism.
Not unlimited iPads.
Something better: Technology that gets the learning done, then gets out of the way.

Real parent result:
"Instead of 4 hours and tantrums, it gets done in 45 minutes and they're engaged. Now there's more time for everything else."

For parents pioneering alternative education paths—this matters.

**Option 3** - Using "I've noticed a pattern..." template:
```
I've noticed a pattern:

The happiest homeschool families aren't trying to eliminate technology entirely.

They're obsessively focused on finding technology that enhances learning without hijacking the nervous system.

Anjan Kata (Daylight Computer founder) breaks it down:

"The least computer possible" means:
→ Adaptive learning apps (valuable)
→ E-Ink display (no dysregulation)
→ 45 focused minutes instead of 4 distracted hours
→ More time outside, hands in dirt, playing with others

One mom's testimony: "I give them unlimited screen time now—because with this screen, it's actually healthy."

**Body**:
```
I just had one of those conversations that changes how you think about educational technology forever.

Anjan Kata dropped out of high school, struggled with ADHD, and spent 6 years solving what experts said was impossible.

He built a computer screen that doesn't destroy your nervous system.

In our conversation, he breaks down:

• The 5 ways screens dysregulate kids (it's not just "blue light")
• Why "screen apnea" explains the post-iPad meltdowns
• How being a naive outsider is sometimes your biggest advantage
• The "least computer possible" philosophy for families

If you're trying to figure out how to integrate technology into your homeschool without the guilt—this one's essential.

### Email 2: Deep Dive (2-3 days later)
**Subject**: "The screen apnea phenomenon (you probably have it too)"

**Body**:
```
Quick follow-up to our Anjan Kata episode—

One concept keeps coming up in the replies: "screen apnea."

Here's what's happening:

When you're on a screen, you literally breathe less.
→ Fewer breaths per minute
→ Shallower breathing (reduced tidal volume)
→ Chronic low-level fight-or-flight

Your kid's post-screen meltdown? Not behavioral. Physiological.

That changes everything about limits, discipline, and what "healthy screen time" even means.

I break down the full science with Anjan in this clip → [LINK TO CLIP 2]

Or watch the full episode → [LINK]

P.S. One mom in our community switched her kids to a Daylight computer and went from "45 minutes per week" to "unlimited screen time" because the dysregulation disappeared. More on that in the episode.
