# Anjan Kata - Checkpoint 1: Creative Analysis & Proposal

## Core Message & Hooks

### Big Ideas (3-5 Provocative Takeaways)

1. **Computers are Vegas casinos designed to dysregulate your nervous system** - Blue light, flicker, oversaturation, and brightness create the same physiological state that makes gambling addictive. Your kid's Chromebook is literally simulating a slot machine environment.

2. **"Screen apnea" is stealing your child's breath** - Just like sleep apnea, screens cause us to breathe less frequently and more shallowly, creating chronic low-level anxiety and dysregulation that most parents mistake for poor behavior.

3. **The fraud of digital learning: reading more but remembering nothing** - When you fetishize the mind while destroying the body's regulation, you're not actually getting smarter—you're pretending. True learning requires your entire nervous system to be calm.

4. **Innovation comes from naive outsiders, not field experts** - The E-Ink breakthrough that everyone said was impossible for 30 years happened because someone didn't know it was supposed to be a "graveyard field." Parents are the naive outsiders education needs.

5. **The hippie ideal vs. the dystopian reality** - Early computing pioneers envisioned computers as tools for human expansion and potential. Modern computing has become the exact opposite: dissociation, mechanization, and dehumanization.

### Key Questions Answered

1. **Why does my kid turn into a monster after iPad time?** The screen isn't just capturing their attention—it's physiologically dysregulating their nervous system through blue light, flicker, and overstimulation. They're not being difficult; they're in fight-or-flight mode.

2. **Can my kid use technology without the harm?** Yes—through E-Ink technology that mimics paper while remaining fully functional. Anjan's company created the first fast-enough E-Ink screen to replace Chromebooks and iPads without the physiological damage.

3. **Is my child actually learning more with all this screen time?** Probably not. The dysregulation from screens often prevents real retention and comprehension. More screen time ≠ more learning when the nervous system is frazzled.

4. **What's the alternative to being a complete Luddite?** "The least computer possible"—devices that do what's needed for school and enrichment, then get put away so kids can go outside, get their hands in dirt, and play with others.

5. **How do I know if educational technology is actually worth it?** If it replaces 4 hours of tantrums and disengagement with 45 minutes of focused learning, followed by more time for real-world play, you're moving in the right direction.

### Cold Open Candidate 1: "The Vegas Casino in Your Hands"

**Concept**: Expose how computers physiologically mimic gambling environments

**Edited Transcript** (with strikethroughs showing cuts):

```
ANJAN: ~~What I learned is the blue light, number one, from computers, this thing called flicker, which I could explain in a second from computers, it's sort of, it's brightness mismatched the rest of the environment, that's number third, and number four is the oversaturated colors and high contrast that a computer has, all go together, and number five would be, it keeps us indoors, sort of the, you can't really use it outside. All five of these really contribute to~~ Your computer is trying its best job to simulate a Vegas casino in terms of its light environment. ~~Yeah, the~~ Vegas casino blocks out all the natural light. They have incredibly bright lights. It's a ton of blue light. It's all flashing and flickering and it's all extremely over-saturated.

~~And they do that because~~ They have figured out to a science this is how you put ~~this human in their~~ a nervous system and physiological state ~~to be~~ most susceptible to getting stuck into these dopamine loops, most stuck into these consumptive stimming loops. ~~And so~~ That's essentially ~~in a smaller way~~ what our computer is doing to us.

CHARLIE: ~~Well, I'm just going to briefly just show this is my Daylight. I was an early adopter, so I think I got in maybe in the second or third round that you guys are shipping these. And I was super excited to get my hands on one. And it was one of these things where the ad and maybe I'll show a clip of the ad. I'll edit it in later. You know, it shows. First of all, you can just see this for the people watching.~~ It's ~~just~~ like a Kindle~~. It's just like a Kindle, but it's perfectly responsive. It's fast. and so I think, you know, one way to look at it is basically like a faster, more responsive Kindle. But another way is really like,~~ it's a replacement for your laptop or your desktop. ~~I could have a whole separate conversation about the combination of the new dictation tools to totally kind of change the way that, that, we interact with computers, less of this, you know, hunched over typing locked in and a more expansive state where you're maybe you're using the stylus a little bit.~~

### Cold Open Candidate 2: "Screen Apnea"

**Concept**: Introduce the surprising phenomenon of how screens literally steal our breath

**Edited Transcript**:

```
ANJAN: ~~When we feel more tense when we use a computer, one of the reasons why is~~ There's a phenomena called screen apnea. ~~And so there is sleep apnea. That's the common one, which is while you sleep, you don't breathe. And there's a whole host of problems in your life that comes from that. Well, some researchers realized there is sort of the equivalent of that for screens and they call it screen apnea. And basically because you have sympathetic over-regulation and not enough parasympathetic, and this sort of deer in the headlights response you get with the light of a computer,~~ When you're on a computer, ~~the screen apnea phenomenon is~~ one, you breathe less, you literally take less breaths per minute, and ~~number two,~~ your tidal volume is less, meaning you actually breathe shallower.

~~And the combination of these two is~~ You're dysregulated. You're ~~a bit more~~ anxious. ~~And so I could go on, but there's a litany of ways that computers physiologically actually put us in a place that that makes us dysregulated for the rest of our day, but also then more susceptible to the dopamine slot machines that are the YouTubes and TikToks and the feeds.~~

~~And so it's a vicious cycle that builds on top of each other. And so I was like,~~ We have to start with light.
```

### Cold Open Candidate 3: "The Fraud of Digital Learning"

**Concept**: Challenge the assumption that more screen time = more learning

**Edited Transcript**:

```
ANJAN: ~~I found you could find books online for free and articles and Wikipedia, and the books around me were never as limitless as what I could find online. I just tried to consume as much information as possible. I would read and read and read for hours.~~

~~I was just going more and more into my head, more and more into consuming, into information, trying to get smarter, trying to get smarter. And I think that is actually a reflection of what computers are and what computers try to be, which is they're just about, they're completely heady. They're disembodied you. And their promise is like, you're gonna be way smarter. Hey, you're gonna be able to think better thoughts. And I think~~

~~The thing I faced in my personal life is,~~ My God, ~~this is,~~ I'm ~~a, like, this is~~ fraudulent. ~~In the sense like,~~ I'm reading more, I'm trying to get smarter, but I'm so dysregulated. My circadian rhythms are ~~so~~ toast. I am ~~so~~ disembodied. I don't remember what I'm reading. The next day, I don't even know what I learned.

~~I'm not able to articulate it because my brain and nervous system is frazzled. And so I learned~~ I'm basically just pretending. ~~Because~~ When you ~~so~~ fetishize the mind and getting smarter and learning and you don't take care of all of your being, it's ~~sort of~~ fake.

CHARLIE: The library of Alexandria times 10 ~~or times 100, but~~ the limiting factor ~~on what allows us to absorb it~~ is ~~not the amount of information or even the interface that we use to interact with it. It's~~ literally the screen.

```
CHARLIE: ~~Yeah, I mean, the I heard recently someone described the Internet as like it's the the library of Alexandria times 10 or times 100, but~~ The limiting factor ~~on what allows us to absorb it~~ is ~~not the amount of information or even the interface that we use to interact with it. It's~~ literally the screen. ~~And I've had that experience, too. I was on screens a lot growing up, you know, video games, computers that remember the first. Macintosh that was the one with kind of the swivels, the screen on the swivel. I'm sure I was just glued to that thing for hours. And my eyesight started to deteriorate around my sophomore year of high school. I started to have to strain to be able to see the whiteboard in the classroom. And for the next six or seven, maybe 10 years, my eyesight just kept getting worse and worse. and, and I realized that it was because then even when I started to wear glasses to correct, no one ever told me don't wear your full~~

~~fully correcting glasses while you're looking at your screen. And so that kind of that myopia progressive deterioration it's also I think mirrored in what you're describing with the hyper compression into this head space. There was a term Marshall McLuhan used to describe modernity. It's talking about like the hypertrophy of the eye and you have literally where your eye muscles get locked.~~

~~locked in on, on closeup. And that's basically what nearsightedness is. But we also have it at kind of a mental level where like we abstract ourselves into the machine almost, at least that's, that's sort of how I look at it. But~~ You use the term dysregulate. ~~And I think that is a big word in the, in the sort of, you know, neurodiversity, ADHD, PTSD, all these, you know, cognitive issues that people have. A lot of them either kind of stem from or result in dysregulation.~~ What ~~in your research~~ is the connection between the screens ~~that we use~~ and ~~some of those underlying symptoms? What's kind of~~ the root cause?

ANJAN: ~~Right. My first impression was like, it's just these algorithms. They're so addicting. It's the fact that you can open 300 tabs and you get 20 links. It's only the software that's the problem. To be totally frank, even upstream of that, I thought the problem was myself. I don't have enough willpower. I don't have enough discipline. I'm not good enough. And so once I got over beating myself up, which I think is a very honest experience of computers today, is you blame yourself for not being good enough because of the way you used it.~~

~~And then you sort of realize, wait a minute, the software here is a huge perpetrator. These things are diabolically designed to be as addicting as possible. That is dramatically different than early computers. That's even dramatically different than computers 20 years ago. But~~ The next layer ~~that really opened me up, and that's where daylight comes from that energy of, my God, this is where we have to start,~~ is I didn't ~~quite~~ appreciate how much ~~this screen. The light of a computer, the appearance of a computer actually deeply plays a role in the way it's dysregulating. And what I learned is~~ the blue light, ~~number one,~~ from computers, ~~this thing called~~ flicker, ~~which I could explain in a second from computers, it's sort of,~~ ~~it's~~ brightness mismatched ~~the rest of~~ the ~~environment, that's number third, and number four is the~~ oversaturated colors and high contrast ~~that a computer has, all~~

~~go together, and number five would be,~~ ~~it~~ keeps us indoors~~, sort of the,~~ you can't ~~really~~ use it outside. All five of these ~~really contribute to dysregulating you at a vagal and nervous system level, at a breathing, like literal, like breathing and tidal volume level, at blink rates, and to your point, the associated,~~

~~mood tone, cognitive tone that comes from, like you're saying, the hypertrophy of the eyes, your dopamine system, your melatonin and circadian system, and all the metabolic processes that come out of that. That's a lot, but it's a fancy way of saying,~~ ~~basically,~~ Your body gets put on high alert, high arousal, high stimulation when you're on a computer. ~~And so, some simple ways to describe what this is is,~~

~~Because of the combination of all these things,~~ The simplest ~~tagline to describe it would be basically~~ your computer is trying its best ~~job~~ to simulate a Vegas casino ~~in terms of its light environment~~. ~~Yeah, the~~ Vegas casino blocks out all the natural light. They have incredibly bright lights. It's a ton of blue light. It's all flashing and flickering and it's all extremely over ~~saturated.~~

~~And they do that because~~ They have figured out to a science this is how you put ~~this human in their~~ ~~nervous system and physiological state to be~~ most susceptible to getting stuck into these dopamine loops, ~~most stuck into these consumptive stimming loops.~~ ~~And so that's essentially in a smaller way what our computer is doing to us.~~

CHARLIE: ~~Well, I'm just going to briefly just show this is my daylight. I was an early adopter, so I think I got in maybe in the second or third round that you guys are shipping these.

### Clip 2: "The Beginner's Mind That Cracked The Impossible Problem"

**Story Arc**:
- **Setup**: Field experts said E-Ink would never be fast enough (30-year "graveyard")
- **Tension**: Naive outsider didn't know it was impossible, connected disparate dots
- **Resolution**: Sometimes being the "average" person who doesn't know better is your superpower

**Segments**: [16:24-18:52]

**Full Edited Transcript**:

```
CHARLIE: ~~I mean, talk a little more about that. You just told the short version of it, but like~~ As a learning process, you're connecting the dots between ~~these~~ different fields. ~~This wasn't like some sort of, the information, the~~ The knowledge hadn't been synthesized into any single source. You had to connect the dots. ~~Like how were you in the position to, or~~ How did you ~~put yourself in the position to~~ connect those dots? ~~Just as like a microcosm of how innovation happens.~~

ANJAN: ~~And I think there's such a good lesson in this. I'm so glad you asked this question. There's such a good lesson for, I think, the wider world here that~~ There's ~~so many~~ innovations ~~that we all would just say we obviously want~~ that are ~~just like~~ waiting there ~~for, because of structural reasons. And I'll explain what I mean is~~ ~~I think~~ The entire reason I was able to come up with this is because I was not in the field.

~~Because~~ I was completely new and completely naive ~~to this. I think that's the entire reason I was able to do it. Why? It's because~~ Everybody else in the field who believed in ~~these sort of, call it~~ paper-like computer screens, the best they could do is what came in the Kindle. ~~And believe it or not, that was invented in the 90s. It even starts earlier in the 70s if you go all the way back. And~~ All the people who believed in it ~~basically just~~ ran out of juice. ~~Like they've~~ ~~persisted for five years, they persisted for 10 years, but after 15, they're like, I can't do this anymore. So the entire, like when you go talk to the key professors, when you talk to the companies, they all just went, they all had the right idea, but they were too early and it just took too long to create a lot of these underlying material science process technologies, lithography, etching, gel polymers, dichroic dyes, I could go on. And so.~~

~~It was like~~ Everybody in this field ~~is like,~~ ~~this is a graveyard.~~ This is a dead end ~~for, for 20 years. Everybody's saying, has been saying it's three years away and look, nothing has ever worked out.~~ ~~And so of course I had to get really lucky, but when I started to look, I did it with open eyes.~~ I didn't know ~~that~~ this has been a graveyard of a field. ~~And some of the key breakthroughs happened, you know, in like 2008 in 2012.~~

~~in 2015, in 2018. It's sort of interesting that it's so proportional almost. And it's like the people who tried in 2010, they didn't have those other breakthroughs. The people who tried in 2014, the people who tried in 2003. And so~~ I ~~just~~ showed up and ~~finally,~~ after ~~like~~ 30 years, enough of the underlying technologies had ~~matured enough. And because~~ ~~I was not a professor in one particular field, I wasn't working for Apple in one display division,~~ I was willing to look ~~at a~~ ~~much broader, I was not a specialist, much broader set of things. And so~~ ~~one of the crucial papers was not even from displays. It was used in other optoelectronic applications and I brought it together. And so I think that~~ ~~combination of being~~ Naive enough to look widely, ~~to not be jaded when everybody else is like, this is dead. I guess sometimes it takes an outsider or~~ a beginner's mind ~~allowed me to sort of~~

~~put this all together and be like,~~ ~~this works on paper? And~~ Every expert I'd ~~be like,~~ ~~they're like, no, no, no, no, there's no way this works. They couldn't ever say specifically. And~~ I'd give them my math and ~~I'd say like, here are so many photons, this is how they diffuse, this is the angles.~~ ~~Can you prove my math's wrong? And~~ They ~~go, nah, but~~ ~~it's not gonna work. And whatever my personality type is, I'm like, oh, you haven't told me that's wrong. So I kept going and going and going and going.~~

~~The Japanese professor was generous enough to take me under his wing and provided his lab to create the first prototypes. And so Japan was where we did this. And~~ It turns out it ~~sort of~~ worked. ~~And so it just told tells me~~ How many other fields are ~~there~~ where if a beginner came in ~~I was curious,~~ ~~it did take me two years of deeply studying, being part of it, going to every conference, reading the textbooks. I didn't have to put my work in, but I'm like,~~ ~~how many other fields are out there that if somebody came in was curious,~~ In two years, you can go to the edge of human innovation. I was ~~the~~ average, and by the end of it, no one else has come up with this. ~~And so I think that's very empowering for how many other things.~~

CHARLIE: ~~So that gives me so many directions I want to go in for one. I mean,~~ We hear this story all the time. ~~It's kind of like a version of the hero's journey in a way, but~~ It's ~~like~~ the story of entrepreneurship, rebel academics, people that~~, you know,~~ crack the problem that's eluded the field for a long time. ~~And the common thread seems to be they had that mindset of either, you know,~~ Not knowing ~~that~~ it was impossible or not taking that as a final answer from the people ~~who are supposedly the experts in the field.~~

~~An entrepreneur seems to be like, you have to be the ultimate auto-didact. Like you have to be able to dive into so many different fields.~~

- **Tension**: Kids need some technology for school/enrichment, but current options harm them
- **Resolution**: "Guilt-free iPad" that enables unlimited screen time because it's actually healthy

**Segments**: [24:56-27:30]

**Full Edited Transcript**:

```
ANJAN: ~~I think the the high level thing to share here also is not to say that because we've made a healthier screen, we've made a healthier computer, like that's the important part. The important part is actually just~~ Being outside, being in the dirt, having your hands on physical things, ~~like~~ playing with other kids, playing with other people. That ~~to me~~ is the real sauce. ~~The reason we exist is because~~ It's unrealistic and probably not in the best interests of your child's development to be a Luddite, to completely get away ~~with~~ technology. ~~So~~ The point of ~~daylight~~ Daylight is ~~almost like~~ the least computer possible ~~and~~ You do what you need to and you put it away and you go outside and you ~~put your hands in the dirt and you~~ play with other people. ~~And that's the high level of how we think about this is~~

There are aspects of technology that are either hard to get rid of because school has them or they're ~~actually~~ useful like an audiobook or ~~a~~ Spotify or it's ~~actually~~ a ~~very~~ powerful way to stimulate your ~~own~~ kids ~~learning and~~ thinking and curiosity and expression~~—some of the adaptive learning apps that you're talking about. People know about Khan Academy, but there's new things like Reading.com and Mentava and Alpha Schools and Timeback, which for all intents and purposes are sort of 80% book, 20% teacher, and the teacher is sort of embedded in it. So it's personalized to you or in the same way a tutor sort of is like, okay, that's too difficult for you, let's do this. Okay, you didn't quite get that, let me do that.~~

~~Basically, instead of needing a tutor to be there, the actual quote unquote textbook has that. And so that's inherently digital. And so~~ The hope is Daylight gives you a safe, healthy, clean way to ~~be able to~~ access these things. ~~And I love the promise here is not like, "oh, my kid's gonna be a million times smarter." That may be directionally also true.~~ It's instead of ~~now~~ four hours and ~~more~~ tantrums and ~~more~~ difficulty to have the kid ~~be~~ engaged~~or do it,~~ it gets done in an hour or 45 minutes and they're engaged and now there's more time. ~~And~~ Now you don't have ~~all~~ these negative associations and emotions around learning or reading~~or this.~~

~~Frankly, I think this idea that we need YouTube and games is the only way to sort of keep kids engaged. I don't think it's true.~~ It's like sugary candy. If that's all that's there, they're going to pick it every time over hummus and carrots. But if hummus and carrots are there, they ~~objectively~~ taste good if your senses haven't been ruined by ~~the other things. And so~~

We came up with Daylight Kids and ~~basically has kids software, it's~~ blocked from the internet and distracting apps. It's ~~just got like~~ books and drawing and stories and learning apps. It's ~~just~~ ~~sort of~~ the good parts of the digital world. ~~And the goal here is to just allow a little bit of digital into your life without it taking over.~~

CHARLIE: ~~Right. My last question, your last direction I want to go is sort of thinking about the future and different futures that could evolve. We've all seen Apple Vision Pro and add a lot of fanfare at first. I feel like there's some sense in which most people still kind of recoil at the idea of full on virtual reality. It's still a little too like dystopian. And whenever I put those things on, I just immediately get motion sick. It's really bad. I want to run in the other direction. I sort of wonder, you know, they just released the iPhone 17 and it's basically the same iPhone, just a little bit slimmer, a little bit shinier. And that seems to be like Apple's only trick these days is just, you know, thinner and shiny. Right. Right. I wonder if Steve Jobs might've been more on this bandwagon. Like if the technology had existed, if he'd be designing, you know, a beautiful full desktop, I mean, I mean like your whole desktop is a surface is a computable surface that you can write on and draw on and you know and I think I heard you talk in another interview a little bit about that as sort of the big picture vision. Can you speak to that a little bit and sort of you know, how could this? I don't know. Maybe how could it be integrated into the classroom or what are some futures that you see with where we're to go with computers?~~

~~ANJAN: I think regardless of what future you map out, one of the key question for human society is what is a wise relationship to technology look like?~~

~~I think it's as simple as that. And the point of daylight is what's the best wisdoms we can bring together of what makes a thriving human? And it turns out you can't have any discussion if you don't have health. You can have everything in the world, but if your health's not there. And you start going up the stack. You can have everything in the world, but if your nervous system is shot, you won't be able to enjoy it. And so if we can start with the principles of what's the stack that allows a whole human that can then thrive, then the goal is of computers or this is, okay, what are the different capacities a human has that we can take advantage of? One of them is to be spatial, right? And so now we're making basically a fat piece of paper with the tablet. That's always the way I relate to what a tablet is. It's a fat magical piece of paper. But to your point, why can't whiteboards, why can't our desks, why can't other things be calm, feel analog, so be part of our house or interior design, not be impinging on our attention or nervous system. But when you want to sort of be like, okay, what's my plan for the week? Or like, what's the habits streak I'm on? Or what's this like physiotherapy thing I want to be doing? Maybe you've seen these skylight calendars and things like that. It's nice to potentially have these computational surfaces. And so in lieu of not having them, this is my place. You can see I try to do the analog equivalent of it. I would not recommend this. This is a little bit like conspiracy theory. It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia style. But I think this is sort of our vision is how do we have computers that magically disappear into your environment, but give you magic back? I think of Tom Riddle's diary in Harry Potter as the most inspiring example of what technology can be, which is for all intents and purposes, or the newspapers, you're a serious black shouting on it or the Marauder's Map, but for all intents and purposes, they feel analog, but they're magical. They can react to you. They have their intelligence. They can help you. And to me, that's where I want computers to go, where it's not about computers. It's about magical objects and surfaces we have in our world. And none of that matters if it's not respectful of your attention, your nervous system, your health. And so, in the short term, it'll look like potentially us making a healthy phone, a desktop monitor with a daylight screen. But further than that, I think it'd be really cool. We're talking about the long-term here to make a, like you said, computational surfaces.~~

CHARLIE: ~~It's a feature I'm very excited for and hope that I'll be able to remain an early adopter. It's the only piece of technology that I feel good about bringing into my bedroom and even into my bed for bedtime reading. I often will just switch it on to airplane mode and put it under my pillowcase. Actually, I love how the case that it came in, you guys send a little, it's like a little pillowcase around the computer. And I feel like if I would ever go camping, I'd just use that as my pillow. I know that there's more exciting things coming and a feature that I'm most excited about that I saw you demoing on your Twitter the other day is this little yellow button here on the side. Can you tell me more about why you installed this button before it had a function?~~

~~ANJAN: I'm so glad you asked. I feel like, yeah, there's sort of two main form factors of computers are like, I need to do real work and you need to like sit on your laptop or desktop and be hunched over and your shoulders hurt and you're clicking and clacking away and it's not necessarily the best environment for you, but it's where you have to be or you're on your phone. But then, your pinky is crooked and you're holding something and it's small. And so it's felt like. You know, these are the two main ways we've been able to do things with computers. And I've always felt like the key part of a tablet is it's sort of like holding a book or a legal pad. It's very, as you're saying, lean back. It's a little more expansive. You can be on a couch. You can be on the grass. You can be in a picnic table. It allows you to be in a far greater variety of environments, especially this guy where you can see it outside. But you previously couldn't do serious work on a tablet because, you know, tablet keyboard is hard. But what really changes this is voice. Because if a computer can understand you and you can just speak into it to type and dictate and ask it to change things and hey bold this and justify that here I'm going to dictate this you know part of what I'm doing then this actually becomes a serious computer. There's this is no longer a huge disadvantage to you at your desktop with a clickety clack keyboard. And so the point of that button on the side is regardless of where you are in the operating system. We want it to make it super, super easy. We call it the walkie talkie button for you to be able to just talk and dictate into the thing. And so our hope is this sort of creates a new dimension of lean back computing that allows you to still be, to do the stuff you really have to do for school or work or whatever.~~

~~CHARLIE: Yeah, I mean, I'm a big fan of the voice dictation already just on my on my desktop. Once I need to start to exercise the muscle of using the daylight as my my primary device. And I feel like there's kind of a learning curve with all these things you have to know. I feel like I'm sort of like the old person who's adapting to a smartphone or something after years of only using word processing on a on a desktop. But it's the possibilities, I think, for for kids education, getting the academic stuff done in a shorter amount of time, but then also just being able to let your imagination run wild and to do your own deep research into the things you're interested in, to be able to be reading and click that button and ask a question about what's on the screen and have it fill in with that context. This is the future of computing, I'm certain of that. And I think you guys are doing a lot of good by trying to. Reclaim the soul of the original Silicon Valley ideas that that sort of freewheeling creativity.~~ Anything else ~~I know Daylight Kids is ramping up and I want our families to know that that you know Daylight computers would be reimbursable with their technology allowance. So if your kid is dysregulated being in front of the computer too much, this is something that is worth a try and the divide, know, it's under a thousand or~~ What ~~kind of~~ the price point~~.~~

~~ANJAN: 729 with our kids bundle.~~

~~CHARLIE: Fantastic. any kind of closing comments or things that you wish, know, speak to the kid in the audience or the child of the parent who's listening, who might be someone like you growing up. Like speak to that child right now.~~

ANJAN: I love the way one of our customers said it. ~~They're like,~~ ~~my kid loves the daylight because when they previously had an iPad, they were only allowed 45 minutes of screen time a week. And~~ I give them unlimited screen time with the ~~daylight~~ Daylight. ~~And it turns out like, you know, being able to, there's something called brilliant.org, which is like sort of like an educational game type thing. It turns out that's more interesting than picking on your sister, but less interesting than your backyard. And like that is what Daylight is for. So I would say is it sort of~~ ~~allows you to have the engaging aspects of a computer without it being bad for you. And for parents, the way I would think about it is~~ Daylight is ~~sort of~~ a guilt-free or healthier iPad. ~~So you can think about it as replacing an iPad, or if you don't want to give your four-year-old an iPad, here is like, you know, sort of a middle ground rather than giving them nothing, or an eight-year-old who's really getting into reading, Daylight is a really great tool for that.~~

~~And then the other use case is this holidays, we're launching a keyboard case. And so you can sort of use daylight as a Chromebook replacement. So for schoolwork and all the things where you're forced to use a Chromebook, our hope is here's a way for that to be a a lot more healthy. And so sort of an iPad replacement and a Chromebook replacement, and a lot of people use it as their secondary device as well. So it's sort of weekends and nights and mornings.~~

~~It's a daylight. No other device is allowed into the bedroom except the daylight. And then for their normal day, they can use their Windows or Mac, but whenever it's something more flexible, they're able to read something on a daylight, read the newspaper, listen to Spotify, connect it to their speakers or whatever it is. Yeah,~~ Our hope is ~~a lot more~~ kids ~~can~~ not ~~be so~~ dysregulated by computers and not have to be ~~totally~~ Luddites.

## Summary for Review

**Proposed Direction**: Position Anjan as the "reformed screen addict" who solved the unsolvable problem through naive curiosity and is now offering parents a way out of the impossible choice between Luddism and dysregulation.

**Core Angles**:
1. **Science/Fear** - Expose the Vegas casino mechanisms in everyday devices
2. **Innovation/Hope** - Show that "impossible" problems can be cracked by outsiders
3. **Practical Solution** - Offer the guilt-free alternative parents desperately want

**Target Audience Pain Points Hit**:
- "My kid turns into a monster after screen time" ✓
- "I'm scared of technology but can't avoid it" ✓
- "I don't know if educational technology is actually helping" ✓
- "I feel alone in wanting healthier tech for my family" ✓

**Brand Alignment**: Strong fit with OpenEd's mission of empowering parents as educational designers who blend the best of all approaches without being trapped by any single system.
