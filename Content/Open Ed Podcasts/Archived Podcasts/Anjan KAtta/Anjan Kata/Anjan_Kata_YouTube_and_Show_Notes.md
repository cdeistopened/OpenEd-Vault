## EPISODE DESCRIPTION

Your kid isn't "addicted" to screens by accident. Their devices were engineered using the same psychological tricks as Vegas slot machines—and it's doing real damage to their nervous system.

Anjan Kata dropped out of high school, struggled with ADHD and screen addiction, then spent 6 years solving what experts said was impossible: making a computer screen that doesn't destroy your health. In this conversation, we break down exactly how modern screens dysregulate kids (hint: it's not just "blue light"), why the education technology we're giving our children might be making them worse at learning, and what the alternative actually looks like.

**Key Insights:**
- The 5 mechanisms screens use to hijack your nervous system (the Vegas casino effect)
- Why "screen apnea" is making your kid anxious (and you probably have it too)
- How reading more on screens can actually mean learning less
- The "least computer possible" philosophy for families
- Why naive outsiders solve impossible problems (and what that means for parents redesigning education)

**About Anjan Kata:**
Founder of Daylight Computer, creator of the first fast E-Ink screen that can replace traditional laptops and tablets. Former ADHD kid who turned his sensitivity to screens into a solution for millions of families.
