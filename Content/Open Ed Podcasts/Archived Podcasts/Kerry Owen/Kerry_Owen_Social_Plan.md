## Ela’s Personal LinkedIn Post (Pirate-Wires tone)
- **Framework:** “What success actually requires” / personal reflection.
- **Copy:**
  > Last week, Kerry Owen reminded me what “education” actually requires.  
  >  
  > • Saying yes to a dream (twice) even when it doesn’t fit the lesson plan.  
  > • Clearing a Wednesday so your kids can run a Salvation Army lunch.  
  > • Logging those hours in a service journal instead of chasing another test score.  
  > • Letting your 22-year-old hand his tips to a stranger—and never brag about it.  
  > • Building a charity (Reach Out Today) because the dream won’t let you sleep.  
  >  
  > The result? Colleges see character. Kids see themselves as leaders. Communities see families who show up.  
  >  
  > Give Kerry’s story a listen. It’s the best case study I know for “open education.”  
  >  
  > 🎧 Podcast link in the comments.  
  > #OpenEd #Homeschool #LeadershipDevelopment #ServiceLearning #ParentingWithPurpose
