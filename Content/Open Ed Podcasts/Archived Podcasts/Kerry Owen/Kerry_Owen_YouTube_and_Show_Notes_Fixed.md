## Final Cold Open Transcript

**Cold Open: The Dreams That Changed Everything**

> **Ela**: What kind of experiences were they? Like, what did you dream about?
>
> **Kerry**: In this dream, I saw thousands and thousands of children in front of me that were going hungry. And it was really upsetting because I had no idea how difficult that was for these children living with that food insecurity and it just was very upsetting and when I woke up I was like, I need to do something about this.
>
> When I had a second dream where I saw the same children again, I felt this guilt. I felt this guilt that I hadn't done anything about it and that these children were still going hungry. And it was really that second dream that spurred me on.
