## Clip: "Some Kids Throw Bottles, Others Give Tips"

**Hook**: Shows the stark difference between kids raised with purpose vs. without - creates immediate contrast and demonstrates parenting impact

**Complete Edited Transcript**:
> **Kerry:** There was ~~a story I actually wrote in another book,~~ an experience that I had where I saw this homeless man and I was at an intersection and then from the other direction there was a car with these young ~~20 year old young~~ men who wound down their windows and they started throwing their soda bottles and cans at this homeless man. And it was just very ~~, it was,~~ I couldn't do anything about it and it was a very emotional experience and came home and just was crying about it to my kids. 
>
> And I said, if you were ever to do anything like that~~, like~~ would be awful ~~if their mums could have seen their sons doing that you know I'm sure they would have been just mortified~~ and so my son who was able to drive picked up his keys and went off looking for that homeless man because he wanted to do something to help him.
>
> ~~So for example~~ One of my sons was working at this car wash place and he was given some tips and some friends of ours saw my son giving those tips to a homeless man and my son never mentioned a word of it.
