## Clip #1: "We Think They Need Us, But We Actually Need Them"

**Hook**: Service is as much about the giver's transformation as the receiver's benefit

**Edited Transcript**:
> **Ela Richmond:** ~~Yeah,~~ I love this. I heard a quote ~~one point~~ and it definitely resonated with me because it aligned with everything that I've ever experienced. ~~Like~~ Anytime that you serve other people, ~~anytime that, know, something that's like quite dear to my heart is actually like older people. Like there's a lot of older people that feel overlooked and like they don't matter as much anymore because they can't offer the world as much. And there's lots of underserved communities, people that are just overlooked and not given enough. But~~ I heard this quote once and it was like, we think that they need us, but we actually need them. And it speaks to ~~like~~ the peace of our hearts and ~~like~~ our souls and our minds that are fulfilled in a way by doing things for other people.
>
> ~~the experiences that you have, the moments that you have, like with your son whenever he goes there. like, he doesn't even know what he needs, but then he experiences this beautiful thing and it like, it speaks to a part of him that he didn't even know that, you know, he needed speaking to, which I think is so beautiful. You said before we started, no, no, go for it.~~
>
> **Kerry:** ~~Well,~~ I was just going to say the book, The Gift of Charity, is exactly touching on that point because I ~~kind of~~ had this epiphany at the end of my journey with Feed the Need in New Zealand ~~was~~ that, my goodness, this wasn't just a gift for the receiver, this was also a gift for the giver and this has just been such a privilege and I can get emotional about it, I always do because I ~~realise~~ realize that~~. you know,~~ having all these interactions with all these different children and learning about different cultures and, you know, having all this love for the people that we served has just ~~been, has just~~ enriched my life and I'll never forget them and I'll always be grateful for those experiences. ~~So yeah, you're right.~~

## Clip #2: "All That Work for Just That?"

**Hook**: Kids are always watching and learning from our efforts, even when we think they're not paying attention

**Edited Transcript**:
> **Kerry:** ~~Yeah, and it's been great because even our daughter, not for this podcast, but like for other things, like I might be having like a radio interview and so on. And I'll say to my daughter, OK, just ask me some questions. Let me practice. And she'll be asking me these questions. And she was just like, Mom, I don't think you should give that answer. I think you need to. So it's been quite funny because she's been my little critic. And but it's great because like she'll give me advice and thoughts and because our family know about everything it's like great you know having a perspective from her age you know is great and~~ Even ~~like~~ with this book that we wrote it's taken years and so when it was published my youngest boy said all of that typing resulted in that small book.
>
> So he'd known ~~like, well,~~ he's doing schoolwork, I'm ~~talking away and stuff and having meetings with Lisa~~ typing and having meetings~~. And he was thinking all that work was, I literally, this is the book~~. And he was just like, all that work for just that? ~~And so that was kind of funny. So yeah, my kids all know everything. They know everything. They know about the books. They know about any like, when I go out and do talks or speeches.~~

## Clip #3: "I Felt This Guilt That I Hadn't Done Anything"

**Hook**: The guilt of inaction when you know you're called to help

**Edited Transcript**:
> **Kerry:** ~~So my first dream, so I had three young children of my own at the time, so I was busy, I was doing stuff, but I would always pray that I'd be able to help people and get opportunities to help people. But I never expected this dream. So in this dream,~~ I saw thousands and thousands of children in front of me that were going hungry. And it was really upsetting ~~in my dream~~ because I had no idea ~~how difficult that was for these children living with that food insecurity and it just was very upsetting and~~ when I woke up I was like, I need to do something about this. But then ~~the daylight comes and you're like, well, it was just a dream. And Kerry, you don't even know many people here. You've not long lived here, you know, what do think you can do about it? So I guess kind of like your, I guess insecurities of like, am I able to do this? Am I good enough to be able to do this? All those sort of questions come into your mind. But then~~ when I had a second dream where I saw the same children again, I felt this guilt. I felt this guilt that I hadn't done anything about it and that these children were still going hungry.

## Clip #4: "They Were the Ones Leading These Business Leaders"

**Hook**: Service work transforms the "unwanted" into leaders

**Edited Transcript**:
> **Kerry:** ~~And we ended up doing a youth engagement programme where~~ These kids that had been kicked out of school, we employed in the kitchens while we were making food for those children going without. And it was amazing. It was amazing to see these youth who often themselves had gone hungry. And it was just incredible because they actually felt they were part of something. They were part of something big. They were solving something in their community.
>
> And ~~here they were, you know, cooking this food, learning how to cook food en masse and being able to, you know, be involved.~~ We were in the kitchens with mayors and leaders of the land and, ~~you~~ business leaders. And these were ~~these, you know,~~ youth that had ~~kind of~~ been brushed off to the side, almost like forgotten because they were ~~like~~ a waste of space~~almost~~. And then here they were being valued. They were the ones leading these business leaders how to ~~go about cooking this food and assembling them and taking them into the schools~~.

> **Kerry:** ~~I do know that my oldest,~~ One of my ~~second oldest~~ son~~, he's 22 and I would sometimes like,~~ he would sometimes say, I don't want to come. And I'm like, well, I need you to come. I need you to help carry this food into this apartment ~~or whatever~~. And this one time he was really ~~like~~ saying, I really don't want to come. And I said, well, I need you. And so he was ~~kind of~~ grumpy in the car ~~and this was a few years back~~. And then we got there and this ~~this~~ young mother with lots of little children were there and they just adored him. ~~Like~~ They were just ~~like~~ clambering all over him. They wanted to play ~~colouring~~ coloring with him~~, you know,~~ and we came out of there and I said, ~~you know,~~ they loved you. And he was like, I know.
