## Clip #1: "We Think They Need Us, But We Actually Need Them"

**Hook**: Service is as much about the giver's transformation as the receiver's benefit

**Edited Transcript**:
> **Ela Richmond:** I love this. I heard this quote once and it was like, we think that they need us, but we actually need them. And it speaks to the peace of our hearts and our souls and our minds that are fulfilled in a way by doing things for other people.
>
> **Kerry:** I was just going to say the book, The Gift of Charity, is exactly touching on that point because I had this epiphany at the end of my journey with Feed the Need in New Zealand that, my goodness, this wasn't just a gift for the receiver, this was also a gift for the giver and this has just been such a privilege and I can get emotional about it, I always do because I realize that having all these interactions with all these different children and learning about different cultures and, you know, having all this love for the people that we served has just enriched my life and I'll never forget them and I'll always be grateful for those experiences.

## Clip #3: "I Felt This Guilt That I Hadn't Done Anything"

**Hook**: The guilt of inaction when you know you're called to help

**Edited Transcript**:
> **Kerry:** I saw thousands and thousands of children in front of me that were going hungry. And it was really upsetting because I had no idea when I woke up I was like, I need to do something about this. But then when I had a second dream where I saw the same children again, I felt this guilt. I felt this guilt that I hadn't done anything about it and that these children were still going hungry.

## Clip #4: "They Were the Ones Leading These Business Leaders"

**Hook**: Service work transforms the "unwanted" into leaders

**Edited Transcript**:
> **Kerry:** These kids that had been kicked out of school, we employed in the kitchens while we were making food for those children going without. And it was amazing. It was amazing to see these youth who often themselves had gone hungry. And it was just incredible because they actually felt they were part of something. They were part of something big. They were solving something in their community.
>
> And we were in the kitchens with mayors and leaders of the land and business leaders. And these were youth that had been brushed off to the side, almost like forgotten because they were a waste of space. And then here they were being valued. They were the ones leading these business leaders.

**Edited Transcript**:
> **Kerry:** One of my sons he would sometimes say, I don't want to come. And I'm like, well, I need you to come. I need you to help carry this food into this apartment. And this one time he was really saying, I really don't want to come. And I said, well, I need you. And so he was grumpy in the car. And then we got there and this young mother with lots of little children were there and they just adored him. They were just clambering all over him.
