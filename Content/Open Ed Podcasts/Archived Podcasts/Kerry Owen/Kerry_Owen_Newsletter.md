# Raising kids who lead with compassion
*Preview: Kerry Owen saw the same dream twice—thousands of hungry kids—and built a charity instead of hitting snooze. PLUS: Why service hours are the new transcript.*

Greetings!

Kerry Owen had a dream about thousands of hungry children. Then she had it again. Instead of shrugging it off, she launched [Reach Out Today](https://www.reachouttoday.org), fed families across two continents, and raised kids who hand their tips to homeless neighbors. Today’s episode is the field guide for parents who feel nudged to do more than carpool.

Let’s dive in.

**THOUGHT:** Dreams Are Instructions  
**TREND:** Service Is the New Curriculum  
**TOOL:** Reach Out Today Kit Blueprint

## Dreams Are Instructions
Kerry’s origin story isn’t a five-year plan; it’s a recurring dream. Twice she saw “thousands and thousands” of hungry kids. The second time came with guilt—because she hadn’t acted. That jolt sent her from stay-at-home mom to the founder of Reach Out Today, a charity that now coordinates meals, hygiene kits, and emergency housing support throughout Utah.

The best part? The kids came along. Her 22-year-old son quietly gave his car-wash tips to a homeless man. Another son who insisted he “really didn’t want to come” to a refugee outreach walked out saying, “Actually, that was pretty fun.” Kerry’s thesis is simple: when you treat dreams like assignments, your children learn that education serves life, not the other way around.

## Service Is the New Curriculum
Families are restructuring their weeks to make room for mission work, and colleges are paying attention. Programs inside the [Mastery Transcript Consortium](https://mastery.org) and partners like BYU Pathway now ask for evidence of contribution—project logs, leadership stories, hours invested—because they signal grit and empathy better than GPA spreadsheets. Kerry’s “walk in their shoes” school visits and youth-led Salvation Army partnerships are exactly the kind of artifacts that stand out in an admissions stack or employer interview.

Flexible schooling makes this possible. Online classes in the morning, meal distribution in the afternoon, reflection journals at night—that’s a transcript with a heartbeat. Call it character-as-curriculum, and it beats another semester of test prep.

## Reach Out Today Kit Blueprint
Ready to follow Kerry’s lead? Start here:

- **Study the need**: Reach out to a local shelter or refugee agency and ask what they run out of first.
- **Build the kit**: Follow Kerry’s ready-to-serve checklist—shelf-stable meals, hygiene essentials, handwritten notes—and assemble as a family.
- **Log the impact**: Track hours, roles, and outcomes in a family service portfolio. Six months later you’ll have a body of work that dwarfs another trophy.
- **Share the story**: Give your kids the mic. Post updates on the [Reach Out Today Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ReachOutTodayUtah) or tag their active [Instagram feed](https://www.instagram.com/reachouttodayutah/) so the community sees youth leadership in action.
