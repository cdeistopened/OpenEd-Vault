> "How do I feel confident? It's as simple as the story you tell yourself. So if you are telling yourself that you're inadequate, you'll never be smart about this, like you can never figure it out, you're not going to feel very good. Because whatever story you tell yourself, your brain releases chemicals and creates a physical sensation in your body. So the story you tell yourself creates how you feel. And so it's even interesting. If you've ever had a conversation with your kids or your spouse or somebody close to that, you're like, they didn't know how frustrated I was, and I just think, oh, wow. Are you a wizard? Like everybody can tell when you're really angry or frustrated. Like if I came on this call and I was like, Ugh, I hate talking about homeschooling. Like I cannot fake it. So I come on these calls and I'm excited and I wanna help everybody. And so when I'm talking about these things, you can see like I'm higher energy and it's super fun and it's exciting, but if I was like feeling dread about being here, my body language would be slumped. Like, I don't know. Who cares, right? Like you just can't fake those feelings that drive your actions."

This isn't cutesy stuff that I can do. And I go, friend, you can learn it right then and there with them. We have the internet, we have smart phones, and we have Alexas and Google Homes and all the other things. And now with Chat GPT, with one of my big kids with math, if we're doing a math lesson and he'll be like, 'But why? But why is this?' You can grab your phone and take a picture of it into AI and say, 'Explain this answer to me like I'm stupid,' or 'like you would to a third grader.'"
