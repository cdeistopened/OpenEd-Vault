## The Confidence Problem

Confidence feels amazing, doesn't it?

When you're confident, your shoulders are back. You feel alive, intelligent, and in your zone. You know what you're doing.

But here's the thing: **Most parents who want to homeschool feel anything but confident.**

They're anxious. Overwhelmed. Scared they'll fail their kids.

I get it. I've been there. When I started homeschooling 18 years ago, I had five kids under six and zero confidence. Now I have seven kids, five homeschool graduates, and I coach other parents through this exact journey.

The good news? **Confidence isn't something you're born with—it's something you create.**

## Why We Feel So Unconfident

Confidence gets blocked by two main things: **anxiety and fear.**

Anxiety is just generalized fear. It's that feeling of "so many things could go wrong" without being able to pinpoint exactly what you're afraid of.

Here's what I've learned: **When you can name your fears, you can beat them.**

Think of your fears like dragons on your pathway to creating the most amazing homeschool ever. You want to take them off one by one, just like a to-do list.

But when we stay in anxiety, we don't make a plan. We stay stuck because it feels like too much.

**The solution? Start naming what you're actually afraid of.**

## The 4 Biggest Homeschooling Fears (And How to Beat Them)

### Fear #1: "What if I'm not good at it?"

*"I actually have proof I'm not very good at it."*

**The truth:** You're supposed to be bad at first.

I love what Brené Brown calls "your freaking first time." When little kids try something new, we expect them to be bad at it and find it adorable. But as adults, we think we should be good immediately.

**My advice:** Plan on being bad at it.

If you go back to my old podcast episodes, they're really bad. My old Instagram posts? Terrible. My homeschool 18 years ago? A hot mess.

That's how you get good—through practice and repetition.

**The fix:** Give yourself permission to be a beginner.

### Fear #2: "What if I fail my kids?"

*"I'm taking on this responsibility. What if I mess up?"*

**The truth:** You're probably already doing better than you think.

When you enroll your kids in public school, you can wash your hands of it if a teacher fails them. But now you're taking on this responsibility directly.

**My question:** What does "failing your kids" actually look like to you?

Unless you're locking them in a basement and beating them (which you're not), you're probably not failing them.

I once built an entire city of London with my kids, spent all morning on it, then lit it on fire to show them the Great Fire of London. They were bawling. "Why would you do this? We worked so hard!"

I thought it was a great demonstration. They thought I was terrible.

**The point:** You'll have lesson plans that go bad. You'll homeschool from your bed some days. But you keep trying. That's not failing—that's learning.

### Fear #3: "What if my kids fight all the time?"

*"I don't know what to do when they're constantly arguing."*

**The truth:** Fighting is a skill they're still learning.

When a little kid is learning to walk, we cheer them on even when they fall. When your kids are fighting, it's the same thing—they just don't know those skills yet.

You're not failing because they're fighting. You're going to keep figuring this out so you can have a harmonious home.

**The fix:** Get help. Read parenting books. Study different approaches. Work on connection first.

### Fear #4: "I don't think I'm smart enough"

*"I don't even know what an adverb is. I had to Google it."*

**The truth:** You don't have to be smart enough anymore.

We have the internet. Smartphones. Alexa. Google. And now ChatGPT.

With one of my big kids and math, if he says "But why is this?" I can grab my phone, take a picture of the problem, and say "Explain this like I'm stupid" to AI.

I don't have some big fancy degree. I got married young and started having babies quick. I just learned right there with them.

**The beauty:** There was actually something fun about learning these things for the first time alongside my kids.

## How to Actually Feel Confident

Here's the secret: **Confidence is just the story you tell yourself.**

If you're telling yourself "I'm inadequate, I'll never be smart about this, I can never figure it out," you're not going to feel very good.

But if you tell yourself "I know I can do this," you'll feel confident.

**Here's how it works:**

1. **The story you tell yourself** creates how you feel
2. **How you feel** drives your actions  
3. **Your actions** give you results

**Examples:**

**Story:** "I don't know what I'm doing"
**Feeling:** Afraid
**Action:** Avoid, check out, procrastinate
**Result:** You don't figure anything out

**Story:** "I know I can do this"
**Feeling:** Confident
**Action:** Research, try things, make mistakes
**Result:** You figure it out

**Quick confidence hack:** Roll your shoulders back and open your chest. There's something about that posture that releases dopamine and helps you feel confident.

## The Secret Weapon: Know What You Value

Here's one simple thing that will transform your homeschool: **Find what you value.**

I value adventure. If there's not an adventure on the horizon, if there's not something fun in our homeschool, then homeschool feels off to me. It's not very fun anymore.

**When you know what you value, it guides your decisions about:**
- Curriculum
- Activities  
- Schedules
- Priorities

**Some examples:**
- If you value family time, you might skip extracurricular activities
- If you value experiences, you might do all the extracurricular activities
- If you value travel, you might figure out how to world school

**Why this matters:**
- It reduces overwhelm from comparison
- It helps you prioritize what truly matters
- It creates a family culture that reflects what's important to you
- It brings more joy and less guilt

**Questions to find your values:**
1. What do you want your kids to remember most about their childhood?
2. What skills or character traits matter more to you than grades?
3. What brings your family the most joy together?
4. When do you feel most peaceful and connected in your homeschool?

## Your Next Steps

**Start here:**

1. **Name your fears.** Write down exactly what you're afraid of. Then make a plan to tackle them one by one.

2. **Change your story.** Instead of "I don't know what I'm doing," try "I don't know what I'm doing yet, and that's okay."

3. **Find what you value.** Ask yourself those four questions above. Let your answers guide your decisions.

4. **Plan on being bad at it.** Give yourself permission to be a beginner.

5. **Use the tools available.** The internet, AI, your phone—they're all there to help you learn alongside your kids.

**Remember:** You don't have to be perfect. You just have to keep trying.

Homeschooling is really fun. We laugh a lot. We do a lot of silly stuff. And when you approach it with confidence (even fake confidence at first), you'll find that joy too.
