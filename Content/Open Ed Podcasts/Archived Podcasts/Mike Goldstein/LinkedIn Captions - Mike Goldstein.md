### 1. OpenEd Brand: Framework 18 - The "What Most People Get Wrong About" Post

> What most people get wrong about helping "average" students:
>
> MYTH: The traditional classroom model serves all kids equally well.
> TRUTH: Many "average" kids are quietly bored and underserved by one-size-fits-all approaches.
>
> MYTH: Solving learning gaps requires massive, top-down reforms.
> TRUTH: Sometimes, the most effective solutions are creative, intensive, and hyper-focused.
>
> Our recent podcast with Mike Goldstein reveals how his charter school built a dorm with 42 full-time tutors to address this exact challenge, doubling student learning in a year. When we optimize for the extremes, we often fail the middle.

### 2. OpenEd Brand: Framework 44 - The "PRO TIP" Post

> PRO TIP: If you want to dramatically accelerate student learning, don't just add more classes. Think "high-dosage tutoring."
>
> Mike Goldstein, founder of a groundbreaking charter school, literally built a dorm on top of his school for 42 full-time tutors. Why? Because research by economists like Roland Fryer confirms that intensive, one-on-one support can double or even triple what students learn in a year.
>
> It's a reminder that sometimes the most effective solutions are the most direct, even if they seem unconventional.

### 3. OpenEd Brand: Framework 95 - The Sports Analogy

> In basketball, you don't just run general drills to improve a player's free throws. You isolate the shot, repeat it hundreds of times, and provide immediate, specific feedback.
>
> Same idea in education, especially for kids in the middle.
>
> Mike Goldstein realized this when his school's project-based learning wasn't closing skill gaps for their students. His solution? He brought 42 full-time tutors into a dorm built right above the school. This "dorm solution" provided targeted, high-dosage, one-on-one instruction.
>
> The result, backed by research from Harvard economist Roland Fryer? Unprecedented learning gains. It’s about precision, not just participation.

### 4. OpenEd Brand: Framework 31 - The "10 Ideas" Post (modified to focus on one big idea)

> Do you struggle with finding truly *innovative* solutions in education? This one's for you.
>
> Here's ONE big idea for helping students, especially those stuck in the "average" lane:
>
> **The Dorm Solution**: Imagine building a live-in tutor program *inside* your school. That's what Mike Goldstein did. He converted a floor of his school into a dorm for 42 recent college grads who spent all day delivering one-on-one tutoring. It created a massive capacity for individualized attention.
>
> If you're looking to move beyond the status quo and deliver real impact, sometimes you have to invent the solution yourself.

### 5. OpenEd Brand: Framework 24 - The "Study Summary" Post

> According to Harvard economist Roland Fryer's research, high-dosage tutoring can literally *double or triple* what students learn in a year.
>
> This isn't just theory. Mike Goldstein put this into practice by creating a "dorm solution"—housing 42 tutors directly within his school to provide consistent, personalized support. The University of Chicago's Education Lab has also shown similar models can close achievement gaps in math.
>
> The data is clear: individualized attention, delivered consistently, is a game-changer.

### 1. Ela's Personal: Framework 19 - The "Behind the Scenes" Post

> Behind the scenes of my interview with Mike Goldstein, I learned something truly wild about education innovation.
>
> We often talk about "scaling" solutions, but Mike's story is a masterclass in how sometimes you need to go *deep* before you go wide. His school literally built a dorm on site for 42 tutors!
>
> It made me reflect on how much unseen effort and radical thinking goes into truly effective education. What "behind-the-scenes" effort has surprised you in your field?

### 2. Ela's Personal: Framework 13 - The "Movie Script" Post (modified to podcast dialogue)

> **ME:** "...So you found that every student has very different gaps, and one-on-one support allows for more comprehensive education."
>
> **MIKE:** "Even where kids have the same gap—let’s say fractions—some don’t even know what a fraction is... it’s easier for our tutor to help us one at a time instead of concurrently. That’s the advantage of one-on-one instruction versus even a small group of five kids who roughly have the same academic shortcoming."
>
> This snippet from my conversation with Mike Goldstein perfectly captures *why* his "dorm solution" (42 live-in tutors!) was so revolutionary. It's about meeting each kid exactly where they are.
>
> What are your thoughts on personalized learning vs. group instruction?

### 3. Ela's Personal: Framework 46 - "I thought I'd be ________ Post"

> I used to think the biggest challenges in education required grand, sweeping policy changes to help *all* kids.
>
> Then I interviewed Mike Goldstein, and he told me about building a dorm *inside* his charter school for 42 full-time tutors.
>
> What I've learned is that sometimes, the most profound impact comes from intensely focused, even "boutique," solutions that truly meet individual student needs. It's about solving *the* problem, not just *a* problem.

### 4. Ela's Personal: Framework 60 - The "Values" Post

> One of my core values, especially through my work with OpenEd, is a deep belief in individual potential. But how do we truly unlock it for *every* child, not just the extremes?
>
> My recent conversation with Mike Goldstein reinforced this. His commitment to ensuring *every single kid* at his school received the personalized support they needed led to an incredibly innovative (and somewhat wild!) solution: building a literal dorm for 42 full-time tutors.
>
> It's a testament to how far genuine care and a focus on individual flourishing can take you. What values drive your work?

### 5. Ela's Personal: Framework 27 - The "Doing The Unexpected" Post

> Recently, I was reminded that truly transformative solutions often come from doing the completely unexpected.
>
> During my interview with Mike Goldstein, he shared how his charter school needed massive tutoring capacity. Instead of lamenting teacher shortages or pushing for another generalized program, he decided to build a *dorm* above the school and house 42 full-time tutors!
>
> It's a reminder that when traditional approaches fail, sometimes the most "irrational" idea is actually the most brilliant. Don't be afraid to think outside the box.
