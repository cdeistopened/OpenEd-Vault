Title: "We Built a Dorm Above the School"
Timestamps: 09:54–11:10 (edited for brevity)

Transcript (guest-only, edited quotes):
- Mike: "We realized we needed tons of tutors… so we built a dorm on the top floor of the school. Fourteen triples. Forty-two full-time tutors. They lived upstairs—at 8 a.m. they’d come downstairs and tutor all day. Year one? Two hundred fifty recent grads applied for forty spots."

## Clips (full transcripts with strikethrough for edited-out parts)

### Clip 1: "1:1 Tutoring Beats PBL"
Timestamps: 03:56–04:59
On-Screen Text: "The fastest way to close learning gaps: 1:1 tutoring"

Transcript:
- Mike: "We were trying different things. We were trying to integrate project-based learning into the school. That wasn't really going that well, but what did start to go well was giving kids a lot of one-on-one tutoring. ~~So we started to change the school. It was always heavy on building relationships, and then getting kids to try really hard. That was always at the core.~~ But from a curriculum point of view, we started dialing back on the project-based learning and dialing up on a lot of math and English one-on-one tutoring to help these ninth graders and tenth graders catch up on stuff they'd nominally been taught in grades three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Like, what's a fraction? How do you add them? How do you multiply them? And what's an adverb—stuff like that. There was a lot of filling in what they didn't know when they arrived at age fourteen to the school. And that was really much better done with tutors one-on-one than it was with a classroom of twenty kids."

### Clip 2: "When Scaling Kills Authenticity (Advisory)"
Timestamps: 17:14–18:28
On-Screen Text: "Why district ‘innovation’ flops in real classrooms"

Transcript:
- Mike: "There's this idea in high schools: we need more connectivity between the adults and the kids. Let's create small group advisory. ~~So this word advisory caught traction and~~ it's like every teacher, here's your seven kids. You're going to meet with them every morning for fifteen minutes. ~~And in a couple schools where they really pioneered this, they became like a little family.~~ But when you see it scaled… it's like the math teacher's like, 'Alright, principal told me to do something dumb called advisory. Hey kids, ~~here's what's gonna happen. If I'm forced to, I'll nominally teach you a curriculum, but I don't care if you really do your homework for other classes. I'll just kind of go through the motions of it.~~ and we're not really held accountable for advisory… look, I'd rather just get ready for my period one geometry class. And you guys—~~I'm sure you have stuff to do or chat you wanna do with your friends or whatever you wanna do, prep for a quiz that's coming up later today.~~ you do you, I'll do me.' ~~during advisory periods.~~ That's the dumb first fifteen minutes. We could easily cut that from the schedule."

### Clip 3: "Beyond Vibes: Randomized Control Trials"
Timestamps: 13:28–14:50
On-Screen Text: "We actually tested it (RCTs)"

Transcript:
- Mike: "I've been lucky—often joined by economists who love to run randomized control trials. ~~So these are social scientists that are really good at answering this question.~~ In a charter school, if we have fifty new kids, there might have been five hundred who applied, and we randomly drew them out of a hat. A Harvard–MIT economist can take all those names and track how all of these kids do over the next five, ten, fifteen years—the ones randomly assigned to our school or tutoring, and everybody else. ~~And so the question of impact and causal impact at a very nerdy level, I've really loved the kind of working like, so that's been one question.~~ I want causal impact, not vibes."

### Clip 4: "Five Experts, Five Diagnoses"
Timestamps: 36:50–38:02
On-Screen Text: "Five experts. Five different answers. Now what?"

Transcript:
- Mike: "If somebody sees a kid who's struggling, they could see five different experts ~~in air quotes~~ and get five different stories: 'You need therapy.' 'You need medication.' 'You're ADHD.' 'You're on the spectrum.' 'You need this, you need that.' They're all over the place diagnostically and on possible fixes or accommodations. That's not good. ~~It's just our sector is not really that strong in precision.~~ What parents usually have to do—which is very hard—is use their social networks to find people who are unusually good at helping that type of problem. ~~And it shouldn't be that hard.~~"

### Clip 5: "$30,000 Per Student—Put It In Parents’ Hands"
Timestamps: 52:54–53:53
On-Screen Text: "What if parents controlled the $30,000?"

Transcript:
- Mike: "In a school district like Boston, ~~where I am,~~ they spend like thirty thousand dollars per kid per year. ~~on the public school system here.~~ If those parents had thirty thousand of actual cash per year, and they spent eighteen thousand to send the kid to the Catholic school, and twelve thousand to help the kid find hobbies, or if the kid has mental health issues—get them a good therapist, or whatever you need—that could be really cool. ~~I hope we move more in that direction.~~ It's not perfect, and sometimes the lack of oversight can be problematic, but on average I think a lot more kids would end up thriving."
