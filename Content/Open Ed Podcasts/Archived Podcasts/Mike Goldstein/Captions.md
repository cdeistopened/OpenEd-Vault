## Clip: The Dorm Solution

### Transcript:
**Mike:** Remember the first problem I had to solve: we have a small number of kids and they all benefit when they get one-on-one. I just need to invent a way for us to have a lot more capacity, but it's only for one tiny school. When we bought the building, it was a three-story building. The original plan was to rent out the top floor to help pay the mortgage. When we realized we needed tons and tons of tutors, we came up with this crazy plan. We would build it out as a dorm. Imagine like a college dorm. We'd build 14 triples for three kids with bunk beds. We'd recruit 42 full-time tutors, Teach for America style. They're gonna come to us for one year, they won't have to pay for housing, they're gonna live in a triple on the top floor of the school. Every day at 8:00 AM these 42 22-year-olds will come downstairs and all they'll do all day is tutor our students.
**Ela:** That's definitely great entrepreneurship. You're not thinking about the problem the same way—"we need more teachers"—it's like, "well, actually there's this subset of the population that would love an opportunity to live in this area or take a gap year or see if teaching is right for them." What was that like building that out?
**Mike:** There's a Harvard case study about this particular thing. I was like, "Hey, I have this crazy idea, but here's why I think legally it would work, here's why financially it could work." Luckily we had really good people on the board, including some donors who put money against it. We were able to raise charitable money to pay for the build-out of this empty floor. We recruited and the first year we got maybe 250 people to apply for these 40 full-time tutoring slots. These were all recent college grads. Today I'm having dinner with one of these people—Laura was one of our first 40 tutors. She had just graduated from Princeton, didn't know if she wanted to be a teacher, liked the idea of a year of public service, didn't mind eating macaroni and cheese for a year. She was super capable and went on to have a great career in education. A lot of people like that were just so passionate and wanted to give. What they liked about the job: "I think I'm good with one or two kids at a time. I don't know if I'm good with 25 kids at a time." It became an on-ramp for a lot of people to get into education, and other people were like, "This is my year, I did it, I loved it, now I'm going to med school."
