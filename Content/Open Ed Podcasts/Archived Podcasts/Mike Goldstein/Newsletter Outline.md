## THOUGHT: The Dorm of Tutors

**Core Story**: Mike Goldstein's charter school needed tons of tutors but couldn't afford them. So they built a dorm on the top floor of the school building—14 triples, 42 full-time tutors living upstairs. Every morning at 8am, they'd come downstairs and tutor all day. Year one: 250 recent college grads applied for 40 spots.

**Key Insight**: Sometimes the most obvious solution is the most unconventional. Instead of trying to find more money or more qualified teachers, they created a system that solved multiple problems at once—housing for recent grads, affordable tutoring for kids, and a pipeline for future educators.

**Voice**: "Look, when you need 42 tutors and you're running a tiny charter school, you get creative. Or you fail. Mike Goldstein chose creative."

## TREND: When Scaling Kills Authenticity

**Core Story**: The advisory period example—when it was pioneered, it created real connection between teachers and students. But when districts scaled it, it became "the dumb first 15 minutes" that teachers and students both wanted to cut.

**Key Insight**: Good ideas die when they get imposed top-down. The people who created the original advisory system cared deeply about it. The teachers forced to implement it district-wide? They're just going through the motions.

**Voice**: "Here's what happens when you scale a good idea: the boss says 'everyone do X,' teachers half-ass it, and kids get 'the dumb first 15 minutes' they'd happily cut from the schedule."

## TOOL: The $30,000 Question

**Core Story**: Boston spends about $30,000 per student per year. What if parents had that cash? Spend $18k on school, $12k on therapy, hobbies, tutors, whatever the kid needs.

**Key Insight**: The money is already there. The question is who controls it. Most parents would make better decisions about their child's education than bureaucrats.

**Voice**: "Boston spends $30k per kid. If parents had that cash—$18k for school, $12k for whatever the kid actually needs—more kids would thrive. It's not perfect, but it's better than the current system."
