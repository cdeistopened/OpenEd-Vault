Greetings!

Today we offer a TL;DR version of our podcast conversation with charter school founder Mike Goldstein—a story in three acts that challenges ideas even alternative education proponents often miss. Who is the system actually failing? How does project-based learning stack up against old-fashioned one-on-one tutoring? And what happens when good educational ideas get scaled by districts that don't understand them?

### 💡 There Is No Average Student

Mike Goldstein identified a specific group of students being failed by traditional high schools.

Not the gifted students. Not those visibly struggling to keep up.

It's the students in the middle—those neither headed to elite universities nor obviously failing—who fall through the cracks of standardized education.

Here's the cruel irony: our school systems are designed around the myth of the "average student." Standardized curricula, grade-level expectations, one-size-fits-all approaches—all built on the assumption that there's some mathematical middle where most kids naturally belong.

But there is no average student. Every so-called "average" academic performer likely excels in something that, if nurtured, could propel them toward a fulfilling education and career. The kid who's "just okay" at math might be a natural storyteller, a gifted mechanic, or have an intuitive understanding of how ecosystems work.

Standardized schooling doesn't serve average students—it creates them. It takes unique individuals with distinct strengths and forces them into educational limbo where they're neither challenged nor supported. They simply exist, just... getting by.

These students don't struggle enough to trigger intervention, yet they aren't thriving either. Meanwhile, schools optimize for the extremes—supporting high achievers and obvious strugglers—while the vast middle receives a mediocre education designed for a student who doesn't actually exist.

Every student deserves better than being averaged into obscurity. (Read more about [finding your child's superpower](https://opened.co/blog/finding-your-childs-superpower).)

### 📊 The Tutoring Revolution

Mike's charter school tried project-based learning. It wasn't working. What did work? One-on-one tutoring for foundational skills.

But here's the problem: tutoring is expensive. How do you get enough tutors to actually make a difference?

Mike came up with a wild solution. When they bought their three-story building, the original plan was to rent out the top floor to help pay the mortgage. Instead, Mike built it out as a college dorm with 14 triple rooms and bunk beds.

Then he recruited 42 recent college grads to live there for a year. Teach for America style. They wouldn't have to pay for housing, and every day at 8:00 AM these 22-year-olds would come downstairs and spend their entire day tutoring students one-on-one.

"We got maybe 250 people to apply for these 40 full-time tutoring slots," Mike says. These were Princeton grads who didn't know if they wanted to be teachers but liked the idea of a year of public service.

Give me a very short 2-6 word thumbnail title for this episode. 
Sometimes the most obvious solutions—like having enough adults who actually care—require the most creative implementation.

### 🔨 Savvy Learning

Alright, we know high-dosage tutoring works. But what kid wants to sit through an hour-long session?

Savvy Learning takes a different approach: 25-minute sessions, four days per week, with a research-backed approach for reading and math. (Oh, did we mention that it's available as a vendor to OpenEd families in our marketplace?).

Think of it like athletic training. The best athletes don't train constantly. They sprint, rest, and repeat.

It's the exact approach Mike identified: targeted, frequent, one-on-one support for the specific skills kids are missing.

Try it. See if your kid loves it.
