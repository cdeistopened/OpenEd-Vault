### Option 1: The Humble & Hungry

Super cool to be featured on the OpenEd podcast. Thanks to Isaac for the chat.

They ask which candidate you'd hire. I was definitely Candidate B haha.

No degree, no fancy internship. Just a lot of cold outreach and a belief that showing what you can do is better than a piece of paper.

Crazy to see it all laid out like this.

If you're young and hungry, go build stuff and show people. It works.

### Option 2: The Storytime Reflection

Wild.

A few months ago I was just a guy maxing out my LinkedIn connection requests and trying to learn from people in sales.

Now I'm on a podcast talking about it.

Huge thanks to the OpenEd team for having me on. It was awesome to share the story.

The biggest lesson is in that clip: people want to help you more than you think. You just have to reach out.

Go connect with people.

### Option 3: The Punchy Take

Honored to be featured here.

The Candidate A vs Candidate B question is real.

I'm betting on Candidate B every time.

It's not about the resume, it's about the hustle and the proof.

Appreciate you having me on, Isaac!

Check out the full episode if you want the whole story.
