### Draft 1: The Hiring Rant

I am so tired of hearing hiring managers complain that they can't find good talent.

Then I get on a call with a kid like Kade Hinkle.

He's 18. No degree. But he's hungry.

Instead of waiting for permission, he built a portfolio of work showing exactly how he could solve problems for the companies he wanted to work for. He used sales tactics to get in front of decision-makers.

He did the work before he got the job.

And yet, how many companies would have filtered him out instantly? No degree? Trash.

This is corporate laziness. It's easier to screen for credentials than it is to look for proof. It's safer to hire the person with the "right" resume than the one with the right drive.

Stop complaining about a talent shortage when you're filtering out the most ambitious people.

Start looking for builders. Start looking for people who create their own opportunities.

We featured Kade on the OpenEd podcast because his story is the antidote to the lazy hiring process. Link in comments. Listen to it.

### Draft 2: The A/B Test Deconstruction

Let's be brutally honest about hiring.

**Candidate A:** 4-year degree, 3.5 GPA, decent internship.
**Candidate B:** No degree, ran a business, built a custom portfolio for you, and cold-emailed your VP of Sales.

Every founder I know *says* they'd hire Candidate B in a heartbeat.

But their own company's hiring process is built to find and hire Candidate A.

It's maddening.

When I see companies pass on a Candidate B, I'm actually offended. It's a slap in the face to every person who built their career on grit instead of grades. It signals that you value paperwork over proof.

It tells me your company is more interested in mitigating risk than in creating value.

We just featured the real-life Candidate B, Kade Hinkle, on our podcast. He's a testament to what's possible when you stop asking for permission and just start doing.

Listen to his story, then go fix your hiring process. Link in comments.
