Greetings!

Today we're talking about a story that feels like it shouldn't be possible. An 18-year-old with no degree and no connections just landed a full-time job in tech sales.

How? By breaking the one rule everyone tells you to follow.

He never submitted a resume.

Let's dive in.

# The Resume is a Confession

Let's be honest: the resume is a document of surrender. It's a confession that you have no better way to prove your value than a formatted list of places you've been and things you've complied with.

It's a relic from a time when information was scarce and employers had nothing else to go on. Today, it's a joke. Everyone hates writing them, hiring managers hate reading them, and they predict future success about as well as a horoscope.

Kade Hinkle didn't write a resume. He created proof. He understood that the game isn't to *list* your skills; it's to *demonstrate* them. Sending a resume signals you're willing to stand in line. Submitting a portfolio of work shows you don't need a line at all.


# The "Proof-of-Work" Portfolio

The quiet revolution happening right now isn't in AI or crypto. It's the shift from credentials to proof. Developers have GitHub. Designers have Behance. And now, everyone else is catching on.

The "proof-of-work" portfolio is simple: it's a collection of tangible evidence that you can do the job. For Kade, that meant building a full prospecting plan for his target company *before* he even had an interview. He showed them how he would make them money.

This isn't just for kids with no experience. It's for anyone who wants to stop being judged on keywords and start being judged on competence. The trend is clear: the people getting hired aren't the ones with the best resumes, but the ones with the most compelling proof.


# Gamma.app

So, how do you build a portfolio that doesn't look like a messy Google Doc? You could use Canva or Notion, but if you really want to stand out, there's Gamma.

Gamma.app lets you create beautiful, interactive presentations that feel more like a webpage than a slide deck. You can embed videos, GIFs, and even other websites. It's the perfect tool for building a "proof-of-work" portfolio that looks like you hired a design agency.

Imagine sending a hiring manager a single link that opens a polished, professional walkthrough of your 90-day plan. While everyone else is attaching a PDF, you're delivering an experience. It's not a fair fight, and that's the point.

That's all for today!
