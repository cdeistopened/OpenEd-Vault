### Post 1: The Contrarian Take

**Framework:** #3 The "Contrarian Video" Post (adapted for text)

**Post:**

Who says you need a college degree to land a great job in tech?

Meet Kade Hinkle. He's 18.

He just landed a full-time B2B SaaS sales job.

He hasn't even *started* college.

In fact, he might not go at all.

Kade built a portfolio of real-world projects, treated his job search like a sales prospecting campaign, and proved his value before he was ever hired.

We just released a podcast episode where he breaks down his exact, replicable process.

Link in comments. This one is a must-listen for ambitious teens and skeptical hiring managers.

### Post 2: The "Agree or Disagree" Post

**Framework:** #1 The "Agree or Disagree" Post

**Post:**

Hiring for drive and resourcefulness is smarter than hiring for credentials.

Agree or disagree?

I just interviewed an 18-year-old who landed a tech sales job that most college grads are fighting for.

He didn't have a degree. He didn't have prior industry experience.

What he had was proof.

He built a portfolio of spec work, identified companies he wanted to work for, and used cold outreach to get in front of hiring managers.

He treated finding a job *like* a job.

Is a 4-year degree a true signal of capability, or is it time we prioritize demonstrated skill and hunger?

Curious to hear your thoughts.

(And if you want to hear his full story, link to the podcast is in the comments).

### Post 3: The "Myth vs. Truth" Post

**Framework:** #18 The "Myth vs. Truth" Post

**Post:**

What most people get wrong about landing a great first job:

MYTH: You need a college degree to get your foot in the door.
TRUTH: You need a portfolio of proof that you can solve a business's problem.

MYTH: Your resume is the most important asset.
TRUTH: Your ability to network and create opportunities is your most important asset.

MYTH: Wait for companies to post job openings.
TRUTH: Proactively reach out to the companies you want to work for.

I just spoke with 18-year-old Kade Hinkle, who embodies all of these truths. He landed a B2B SaaS sales job before he even graduated high school by ignoring the myths.

We documented his entire strategy in our latest podcast episode.

### Post 4: The "What Impresses Me" Post

**Framework:** #10 The "What Impresses Me" Post

**Post:**

I'm not impressed by your GPA.
I'm not impressed by the name of your university.
I'm not impressed by your list of extracurriculars.

I'm impressed when you build something.
I'm impressed when you treat your career like a business.
I'm impressed when you create your own opportunities instead of waiting for them.

Kade Hinkle is an 18-year-old who impresses me.

He turned his landscaping business into a case study, used sales tactics to land interviews, and started his career before most of his peers even finished their freshman orientation.

This is what the future of talent looks like.

Listen to his story on the OpenEd podcast. Link in comments.

### Post 5: The "What Success Actually Requires" Post

**Framework:** #20 The "What Success Actually Requires" Post

**Post:**

What landing a competitive job ACTUALLY requires (that they don't teach you in college):

- Treating your job search like a sales funnel.
- Building a "portfolio of proof" instead of just a resume.
- Cold emailing decision-makers, not just HR portals.
- Demonstrating your skills, not just listing them.
- Asking for the job, not just for an interview.

18-year-old Kade Hinkle did all of this to land a B2B SaaS sales role.

His story is a masterclass in modern job hunting.

Listen to the full breakdown on our new podcast episode. Link in the comments.

### Post 6: The "Quote" Post

**Framework:** #12 The "Quote" Post

**Post:**

"I looked at the job description not as a list of requirements I had to meet, but as a list of problems I had to prove I could solve."

- Kade Hinkle, 18-year-old B2B SaaS Sales Rep

This mindset shift is everything.

It's the difference between being a passive applicant and a proactive problem-solver.

We unpacked Kade's entire journey on the latest OpenEd podcast episode. If you're feeling stuck in your job search, this is for you.

### Post 7: The "Behind the Scenes" Post

**Framework:** #19 The "Behind the Scenes" Post

**Post:**

Behind the scenes of an 18-year-old landing a B2B SaaS sales job:

- 50+ personalized cold emails sent to VPs of Sales.
- A custom "prospecting video" for his top target company.
- A portfolio showcasing how he'd approach their sales process.
- Countless hours studying the company's products and customers.
- Turning his high school landscaping business into a sales case study.
- Zero applications submitted through online portals.

People see the "overnight success" of a teenager landing a great job. They don't see the strategic, hard work.

Kade Hinkle's story is a blueprint for anyone who wants to break into a competitive field.

Hear how he did it on the OpenEd podcast. Link in comments.

### Post 8: The "Relatable Struggle" Post

**Framework:** #4 The "Relatable Struggle" Post

**Post:**

Feeling like your resume is going into a black hole?

You're not alone.

The traditional job application process is broken.

But what if you could bypass it entirely?

I just interviewed 18-year-old Kade Hinkle, who did exactly that. He never filled out a single online application. Instead, he created his own opportunities.

His story is a powerful reminder that the best way to get a job is to prove you can already do it.

If you're tired of the resume black hole, you need to hear this episode.

### Post 10: The "Movie Script" Post

**Framework:** #13 The "Movie Script" Post

**Post:**

Hiring Manager 1: "He looks promising, but no degree. It's too risky."

Hiring Manager 2: "Did you see his portfolio? He's already built a 30-day plan for our lowest-performing sales territory."

Hiring Manager 1: "But what about a formal education? What if he's missing fundamentals?"

Hiring Manager 2: "He taught himself how to run a business and used cold outreach to get this meeting. He's missing nothing."

This is a conversation happening in offices everywhere.

Skills are starting to speak louder than credentials.

We just interviewed the guy who inspired this script: 18-year-old Kade Hinkle. He chose proof over pedigree.

His story is a glimpse into the future of hiring.
