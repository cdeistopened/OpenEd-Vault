# Why Your ADHD Kid "Won't Listen"—It's Not What You Think

**Ela Richmond**
*OpenEd Daily*

Picture this: A parent standing in the kitchen, trying to finish one math lesson before lunch. Their child has been staring at the same problem for ten minutes. Frustration builds on both sides. Finally, the parent raises their voice: "Just focus! Why won't you listen to me?"

The child looks up. Silent. Defiant, the parent thinks.

What if the child literally can't hear them?

[Dr. Amy Moore](https://www.thebrainymoms.com/) is a cognitive psychologist and host of the Brainy Moms podcast. She's also the Psychology and Research Director for LearningRx. But her expertise runs deeper than credentials. Diagnosed with ADHD in college after failing out twice, she understands the struggling kid from the inside out.

What she told me changed how I think about these kitchen-table battles:

**"You're yelling at them and it looks like they're ignoring you. Honestly, they're struggling to hear the words that you're saying when you're yelling, because they're in fight or flight."**

## When Parents Yell, Kids' Brains Shut Down

Dr. Moore explained [auditory exclusion](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6043156/)—a neurological phenomenon where the brain under stress can't process language. When a parent raises their voice, the child's amygdala sets off an alarm. Danger. Crisis. The prefrontal cortex—responsible for reasoning, thinking, planning—gets hijacked.

"Intelligently designed to only be able to hear low frequency sounds like that tiger rustling in the bush behind us, not mom's voice yelling at us."

When it looks like a kid is ignoring you, they're in neurological shutdown. Their ears can't process words. They're not refusing to listen—they're unable to hear.

## We've Been Fixing the Wrong Problem

ADHD stands for "Attention Deficit." So when kids struggle, parents try to fix their focus.

Dr. Moore and her team studied more than 5,000 children and adults with ADHD. They found something shocking: **attention was NOT the weakest cognitive skill.**

"Working memory, long-term memory, and processing speed all fell below the 38th percentile. We have this tendency to go, my kid has ADHD, let me fix his attention and focus, when attention and focus was not the real issue."

We've been solving the wrong problem.

Working memory and processing speed aren't only for learning. [They're critical for emotion regulation](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8242304/). When a child is frustrated and stressed, they need strong working memory to hold potential options in mind—and strong processing speed to access those options quickly. Without it, they stay dysregulated.

The very skills we ignore are the ones that would help kids regulate their emotions and behavior.

## The Real Intervention: Parent Regulation

Dr. Moore talked about mirror neurons—"smart cells in our brains" that make emotions contagious.

"My emotions as a mom are contagious to my child. The easiest way to illustrate that is when someone yawns and you yawn back, that's a mirror neuron kicking in."

When parents are dysregulated, kids become dysregulated. When parents yell, kids shut down. [Research on mirror neurons](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3510904/) shows this emotional contagion is strongest between people in close relationships—like parent and child.

"We cannot access grace when we're emotionally dysregulated. We have to learn how to regulate our own emotions first so that we can help our child co-regulate theirs."

The primary intervention isn't medication or therapy for the child. It's the parent learning to regulate first.

Lower your voice. Soften your facial expression. Relax your posture. Remove excess noise and light. Dr. Moore calls it "lowering the temperature on the fire."

Then get curious. Ask: "I'm noticing this seems hard for you. I wonder what we could do to make it easier."

Invite them into problem-solving. Give them power and control. Build "relational equity"—the sense that you're on their side.

## Why Homeschoolers Can Remediate, Not Accommodate

Dr. Moore's youngest son couldn't spell his own name in fifth grade. Low self-esteem, constant bullying, crushing inadequacy.

Instead of accommodating his struggles—extra time, front-row seating—she remediated the underlying cognitive skills. She put him through 36 weeks of cognitive training and reading remediation at LearningRx.

By ninth grade, he was earning A's in college-level English. He became a competitive rock climber and elite musician. Now he's a music performance major in college.

"We had to make his bucket so big that it built resilience to that ADHD diagnosis."

Traditional schools accommodate. Extra time on tests. Preferential seating. But accommodations don't fix the problem. Dr. Moore says extra time on assignments *lowers* motivation.

"Why accommodate when we can remediate? The brain is malleable. We are not stuck with the cognitive cards we've been dealt."

Homeschoolers can do something different. Without classroom constraints, you can address the underlying cognitive weaknesses—working memory, processing speed, long-term memory. You can remediate, not accommodate.

## What Homeschooling Parents Should Know

**Start with sleep.** Tired children cannot regulate emotions. The brain's [glymphatic system](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6689036/) washes away toxins during sleep and consolidates memories. Without restorative sleep, nothing else works.

**Address sensory needs.** Most ADHD kids are either sensory seekers (running laps at 8 p.m.) or sensory avoiders (can't stand scratchy pajamas). Match the environment to the need—swings for seekers, soft quiet spaces for avoiders.

**Focus on real cognitive weaknesses.** If your child has a formal diagnosis, you have a neuropsych report showing subtest scores. Look at working memory, processing speed, and long-term memory—not attention.

**Build islands of competence.** Neuropsychologist Robert Brooks says "Kids with ADHD swim in oceans of inadequacy." Find what they love and do well. Nurture those passions. Make the bucket big enough that the struggle seems small.

**Regulate yourself first.** Emotions are contagious. Before you can co-regulate a child, you need to regulate yourself.

Dr. Moore's team found that cognitive training delivered over Zoom is as effective as in-person training. Parents can access these interventions from their dining room table without disrupting their homeschool day.
