## Core Message & Hooks

### Big Ideas (5)

1. **ADHD Isn't About Attention—It's About Working Memory**: Research on 5,000+ ADHD brains shows working memory, long-term memory, and processing speed fall below the 38th percentile. Attention is average.

2. **What Looks Like Defiance Is Literally a Neurological Shutdown**: When kids say "no," their amygdala has hijacked their prefrontal cortex. They can't think. It's not willful rebellion.

3. **Yelling Activates Auditory Exclusion**: When you yell, your kid's ears literally can't process language because they're in fight-or-flight. They're not ignoring you—they neurologically can't hear you.

4. **Emotions Are Contagious Through Mirror Neurons**: Your dysregulation becomes your child's dysregulation. Parent regulation is THE intervention.

5. **Remediate, Don't Accommodate**: The homeschool advantage is real—fix the underlying cognitive skill instead of making accommodations that lower motivation.

## The Cold Open - THREE VARIATIONS

### VARIATION 1: "The Defiance Myth" (Personal → Misconception → Mechanism)

**Clip 1** (P2 - 02:59.706) | **Dr. Amy Moore** | ~5 seconds
"So I was a struggling student, right? So I was smart, so I did well, but I spent more time in the hallway than in the classroom in middle school because I talked too much or I was constantly distracted or I was distracting the class. And I was diagnosed with ADHD in college."

**Clip 2** (R1 - 03:29.442) | **Ela Richmond** | ~1 second
"Wow."

**Clip 3** (C3 - 93) | **Dr. Amy Moore** | ~3 seconds
"What we think is defiance is typically not. It's because it's too hard and I'm frustrated, and I don't know how to communicate that to you."

**Clip 4** (M2 - 12:32.406) | **Dr. Amy Moore** | ~4 seconds
"You're yelling at them and it looks like they're ignoring you. Honestly, they're struggling to hear the words that you're saying when you're yelling, because they're in fight or flight."

**Clip 5** (S1 - 40:33.708) | **Dr. Amy Moore** | ~2 seconds
"Why accommodate when we can remediate, right?"

**ESTIMATED TOTAL: ~15 seconds** (Could add one more clip to reach 20)

**STORY:** She had ADHD → but parents think defiance is willfulness → actually it's neurological → yelling backfires → better solution exists (cuts before answering what)

### VARIATION 2: "We've Been Looking at the Wrong Thing" (Research-Forward)

**Clip 1** (P1 - 02:59.706) | **Dr. Amy Moore** | ~3 seconds
"So I was a struggling student, right? So I was smart, so I did well, but I spent more time in the hallway than in the classroom in middle school because I talked too much or I was constantly distracted."

**Clip 2** (R4 - 10:23.127) | **Ela Richmond** | ~1 second
"Interesting."

**Clip 3** (C1 - 07:15.084) | **Dr. Amy Moore** | ~4 seconds
"We have this tendency to put 'my kid can't focus' or 'my kid can't pay attention.' And the reality is our brain shifts attention four times a second."

**Clip 4** (B1 - 41:34.784) | **Dr. Amy Moore** | ~4 seconds
"Attention was not the weakest cognitive skill. Working memory, long-term memory, and processing speed all fell below the 38th percentile in more than 5,000 children and adults with ADHD."

**Clip 5** (CL3 - 42:00.716) | **Dr. Amy Moore** | ~2 seconds
"And so we have this tendency to go, my kid has ADHD, let me fix his attention and focus, when attention and focus was not [CUT]"

**ESTIMATED TOTAL: ~16 seconds**

**STORY:** Personal ADHD → but parents focus on attention → research shows that's wrong → we've been fixing the wrong thing (cliffhanger: what should we fix?)

### VARIATION 3: "Parent Regulation Is the Game-Changer" (Emotion-Focused)

**Clip 1** (P4 - 03:29.63) | **Dr. Amy Moore** | ~5 seconds
"I was medicated and then I did really well through college and grad school and got my life back on track. But as I was working with children and families, I thought we can't miss these things."

**Clip 2** (R7 - 12:45.25) | **Ela Richmond** | ~1 second
"Interesting."

**Clip 3** (C4 - 17:14.046) | **Dr. Amy Moore** | ~3 seconds
"Just because you think you turned out okay because you had a parent who yelled at you to make you behave doesn't mean that that's going to work for your child."

**Clip 4** (M4 - 18:12.566) | **Dr. Amy Moore** | ~2 seconds
"Emotions are contagious. We have these smart cells in our brains called mirror neurons."

**Clip 5** (M5 - 18:12.566) | **Dr. Amy Moore** | ~3 seconds
"So that means my emotions as a mom are contagious to my child. The easiest way to illustrate that is when someone yawns and you yawn back, that's a mirror neuron kicking in."

**ESTIMATED TOTAL: ~17 seconds**

**STORY:** She got help through medication → but realized parents need to do something different → yelling doesn't work → because emotions are contagious → mirror neurons

## Feedback

Which variation tells the strongest story?

1. **Variation 1** - Focuses on the defiance misconception + neuroscience mechanism
2. **Variation 2** - Focuses on the research bomb (we've been looking at the wrong thing)
3. **Variation 3** - Focuses on parental emotion regulation being THE intervention

All use only verified verbatim clips. Should we:
- Pick one and refine it?
- Try a fourth variation mixing different clips?
- Combine elements from multiple variations?
- Extend any of these to 20-25 seconds?
