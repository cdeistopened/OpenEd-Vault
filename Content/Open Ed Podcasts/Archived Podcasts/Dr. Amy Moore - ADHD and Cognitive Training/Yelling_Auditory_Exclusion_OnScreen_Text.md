## Alternative: Simplified 3-Text Version (30-second clip)

For shorter clips or faster-paced editing:

**Text 1 (0-3s):** "They're not ignoring you"
**Text 2 (3-8s):** "They literally can't hear you"
**Text 3 (8-15s):** "It's called auditory exclusion"

**Why this works:**
- Faster pace keeps attention
- Core message still clear
- Less text = more focus on speaker
- Works for TikTok's shorter attention span

## Visual Design Recommendations

### Text Styling:
- **Font:** Bold, sans-serif (Arial, Helvetica, or similar)
- **Size:** Large enough to read on phone (minimum 48pt)
- **Color:** High contrast (white text on dark background, or vice versa)
- **Position:** Center or upper third of screen
- **Animation:** Fade in/out, or slide up (not distracting)

### Background:
- **Option A:** Blurred video background (speaker visible but text readable)
- **Option B:** Solid dark background with speaker in corner
- **Option C:** Split screen (speaker on left, text on right)

### Emphasis Techniques:
- **Bold keywords:** "literally can't hear"
- **Color highlights:** Red for "fight or flight"
- **Size variation:** Larger for main hook, smaller for details
- **Icons:** Can add brain icon or ear icon (sparingly)

## Quality Checks

- [x] McDonald's Test passed (accessible language)
- [x] Topic clear in first 3 seconds (ADHD, yelling, hearing)
- [x] On-screen text reinforces (not competes with) audio
- [x] Creates emotional hook (addresses parent guilt)
- [x] Provides scientific credibility (auditory exclusion)
- [x] Ends with clear takeaway (neuroscience, not defiance)
- [x] Shareable moment (parents will tag others)

---

## Final Recommendation

**Use Option 1** with the full 6-text sequence for maximum impact. The progression from contradiction → insight → science → reframe creates a complete narrative arc that will:
- Stop the scroll immediately
- Educate parents
- Remove guilt
- Drive shares and comments

**For shorter clips (30 seconds):** Use the simplified 3-text version focusing on the core message.
