## PERSONAL VULNERABILITY (Her Story)

**P1** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (02:59.706) | ~3 seconds
"So I was a struggling student, right? So I was smart, so I did well, but I spent more time in the hallway than in the classroom in middle school because I talked too much or I was constantly distracted."

**P2** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (02:59.706) | ~5 seconds
"So I was a struggling student, right? So I was smart, so I did well, but I spent more time in the hallway than in the classroom in middle school because I talked too much or I was constantly distracted or I was distracting the class. And I was diagnosed with ADHD in college."

**P3** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (03:29.63) | ~3 seconds
"And that was after I had failed out of college twice. And not because I couldn't do the work, but because I wouldn't go to class or I would sleep through class or I didn't like something or it was too hard."

**P4** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (03:29.63) | ~5 seconds
"I was medicated and then I did really well through college and grad school and got my life back on track. But as I was working with children and families, I thought we can't miss these things."

"Wow."

**R2** | **Ela Richmond** (04:27.556) | ~1 second
"Hmm."

**R3** | **Ela Richmond** (04:55.256) | ~2 seconds
"That is wild and makes so much sense actually that it was more so your experience."

**R4** | **Ela Richmond** (10:23.127) | ~1 second
"Interesting."

**R5** | **Ela Richmond** (10:32.052) | ~2 seconds

**R6** | **Ela Richmond** (12:07.64) | ~1 second
"Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm."

## THE CONTRADICTION (What We Think vs. Reality)

**C1** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (07:15.084) | ~4 seconds
"We have this tendency to put 'my kid can't focus' or 'my kid can't pay attention.' And the reality is our brain shifts attention four times a second."

**C2** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (08:10.766) | ~4 seconds
"The problem with an ADHD brain is that we can't tell the difference between a minor inconvenience and a crisis. And so everything is important to the ADHD brain."

**C3** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (93) | ~3 seconds
"What we think is defiance is typically not. It's because it's too hard and I'm frustrated, and I don't know how to communicate that to you."

**C4** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (17:14.046) | ~3 seconds
"Just because you think you turned out okay because you had a parent who yelled at you to make you behave doesn't mean that that's going to work for your child."

## THE MECHANISM (Neuroscience - Why Things Happen)

**M1** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (09:08.19) | ~3 seconds
"The amygdala hijacks our prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for reasoning and thinking and planning and execution. And then we can't think or learn."

**M2** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (12:32.406) | ~4 seconds
"You're yelling at them and it looks like they're ignoring you. Honestly, they're struggling to hear the words that you're saying when you're yelling, because they're in fight or flight."

**M3** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (12:32.406) | ~3 seconds
"intelligently designed to only be able to hear low frequency sounds like that tiger rustling in the bush behind us, not mom's voice yelling at us."

**M4** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (18:12.566) | ~2 seconds
"Emotions are contagious. We have these smart cells in our brains called mirror neurons."

**M5** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (18:12.566) | ~2 seconds
"So that means my emotions as a mom are contagious to my child. The easiest way to illustrate that is when someone yawns and you yawn back, that's a mirror neuron kicking in."

## THE RESEARCH BOMB (What's Actually True)

**B1** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (41:34.784) | ~4 seconds
"Attention was not the weakest cognitive skill. Working memory, long-term memory, and processing speed all fell below the 38th percentile in more than 5,000 children and adults with ADHD."

**B2** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (42:00.716) | ~4 seconds
"We have this tendency to go, my kid has ADHD, let me fix his attention and focus, when attention and focus was not the real issue."

**B3** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (41:01.534) | ~3 seconds
"We looked at attention and reasoning and processing speed and working memory, long-term memory, visual and auditory processing. And we plotted them on a graph and what we found was that attention was not the weakest cognitive skill."

## THE SOLUTION HINT (Before the Cut)

**S1** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (40:33.708) | ~3 seconds
"Why accommodate when we can remediate, right? That is my mindset."

**S2** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (40:33.708) | ~4 seconds
"And as a cognitive psychologist, I understand that the brain is malleable, right? We are not stuck with the cognitive cards we've been dealt. We can remediate weak cognitive skills."

**S3** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (35:17.43) | ~3 seconds
"If you think of it as existing in this bucket, right, our job as parents is to make that bucket as big as possible so that that struggle seems small."

**S4** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (37:43.852) | ~2 seconds
"So we had to make his bucket so big that it built resilience to that ADHD diagnosis."

## EMOTIONAL/POWERFUL MOMENTS

**E1** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (37) | ~2 seconds
"I was really drawn to the struggling kids. I was drawn to those children with ADHD who everyone else was frustrated with, but I got it."

**E2** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (37:14.798) | ~2 seconds
"He got an A in English 101 and 102 at the community college as a ninth grader. Couldn't spell his own name as a fifth grader."

**E3** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (21:33.038) | ~2 seconds
"my gosh, that is why my child is struggling. They aren't doing this to me. Right. They're struggling and it's my job as a loving parent to help."

## POTENTIAL CLIFFHANGERS (Cut mid-thought)

**CL1** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (42:00.716) | ~2 seconds
"So we're missing the boat on... [CUT]"

**CL2** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (40:33.708) | ~2 seconds
"We can remediate weak cognitive skills. We are not stuck with the cognitive cards we've been dealt. We can [CUT after "can"]"

**CL3** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (41:34.784) | ~2 seconds
"And so we have this tendency to go, my kid has ADHD, let me fix his attention and focus, when attention and focus was not [CUT]"

**CL4** | **Dr. Amy Moore** (12:59.2) | ~2 seconds
"Either strengthens the connection with our child or weakens the connection with our child. So yelling at our child is going to [CUT]"

## NOTES FOR COMBINATIONS

**Strong pairs:**
- P2 (personal ADHD diagnosis) + R1 (Wow) = vulnerability + validation
- C3 (defiance misconception) + M2 (why yelling doesn't work) = problem + mechanism
- B1 (research finding) + CL3 (but attention isn't...) = bomb + cliffhanger
- S1 (remediate not accommodate) + any cliffhanger = solution hint + mystery

**Storytelling flows:**
1. Vulnerability → Reaction → Contradiction → Mechanism → Cliffhanger
2. Mechanism → Contradiction → Research bomb → Solution hint → Cliffhanger
3. Personal → Research → Solution (skip some steps for tightness)
