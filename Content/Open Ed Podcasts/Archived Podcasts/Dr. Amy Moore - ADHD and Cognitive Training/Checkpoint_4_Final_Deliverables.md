## BLOG POST OVERVIEW

**Angle Selected**: The auditory exclusion + mirror neurons revelation

**Why this angle?**
- Most counterintuitive (parents think kids are ignoring them)
- Most actionable (parent regulation is THE intervention)
- Backed by neuroscience research
- Directly addresses homeschool parent frustration

**Structure**:
1. **Opening** (250 words): Relatable scenario → Guest intro → Core insight
2. **Section 1** (250 words): Auditory exclusion explained
3. **Section 2** (250 words): Real cognitive weaknesses (not attention)
4. **Section 3** (200 words): Mirror neurons and parent regulation
5. **Section 4** (250 words): Homeschool advantage (remediate vs. accommodate)
6. **Section 5** (200 words): Actionable takeaways
7. **Closing** (100 words): Guest bio and resources

**Hyperlinks Integrated** (4 total):
- Auditory exclusion research (NIH)
- Memory and emotion regulation (NIH)
- Mirror neurons (NIH)
- Glymphatic system and sleep (NIH)

**SEO Headers**:
- "When You Yell, Their Brain Shuts Down"
- "The Real Problem Isn't Attention—It's Memory and Processing Speed"
- "The Intervention You Haven't Considered: Your Own Nervous System"
- "Why Homeschoolers Have a Huge Advantage"
- "What This Means for Your Family"
