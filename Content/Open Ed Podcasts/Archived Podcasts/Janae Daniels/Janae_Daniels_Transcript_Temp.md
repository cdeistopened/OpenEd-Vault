Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm your sometimes host Ella. And today I'm joined by Janaye Daniels. Janaye has a very fascinating story that I think many of you might relate to. She pulled her kids just before high school. So very different than the normal homeschool family. She didn't pull her kids early. It was a later decision. And so she talks about how it was so scary for her to do that.

She came from the public school world. She was a K through 12 licensed teacher and Yeah, we're gonna dive right into her story. So Janae first off What even happened like how do you get to the point where you were like in? About to enter high school in public school and all of a sudden you decide despite the fact that I'm entirely afraid of this despite the fact that I've Never thought that I was gonna go down this path. This is what we're doing

Janae Daniels (00:52.595)
Yeah, so that's, it was not intentional. I have to be honest, we are COVID converts. And my, when, so my oldest two kids graduated from public school. I had no intention on ever homeschooling as a matter of fact, as a former public middle school teacher, I actually was against homeschooling because I believed all of the propaganda and the rumors about homeschoolers. I had known.

one homeschooler or two homeschoolers in high school. And I thought that they were kind of weird and their families were weird. And so I thought that that was all homeschooling was. And so when I became a teacher, I'm like, I would never homeschool my kids. So it was never, ever, ever in a million years on my radar. And then COVID hit and it was fine.

The end of the school year in 2020 was okay. I felt bad for the teachers because I knew that they were struggling trying to do online classes that they were not set up to do. And they had their kids at home. I remember one of my kids' teachers was in the middle of her lesson with my child. And then all of a sudden you hear screaming in the background like, mom, mom, that's happened. And then a child comes running in front of the computer and...

And she's like, I'm sorry, just a minute kids. And I felt for her because she was doing the best she could. I, anyway, she was a great teacher. They were all great teachers. And, but as the summer approach, as the summer was going on, I ran into my kids' principal at Target, my middle school kids' principal. And I was like, so school's supposed to start in like less than a month. What's going on?

And he was like, no idea. We haven't gotten any directives and we don't know what's gonna happen. So I was like, okay. And so one day, and I am a religious person, so I need to share that right away. One day I was sitting in church, was a couple of weeks later, week and a half, two weeks later, and this thought came into my head. I want you to homeschool the kids. And I remember thinking,

Janae Daniels (03:14.957)
hard no. And then the thought came again. It's taken a pandemic. I want you to homeschool the kids. And I'm like, and like I said, I'm a religious person. believe that there were some divine intervention there. So I went home that day and I called everyone I know who homeschooled at the time, or who homeschooled, all three of them, and was like, okay, what is homeschooling like and what do do?

Ela Richmond (03:17.294)
You

Janae Daniels (03:43.86)
And I cried most of the afternoon, but the thought wouldn't go away. And so I went to my husband that day and I was like, what if we homeschooled the kids? Because I got this feeling and this thought and it's not going away and it's heavy on my heart. And he's like, I always thought it would be great, but I figured you didn't want to. I'm like, really? And he's like, yeah, I mean, we could try it. And if it doesn't work out, just put them back in. I'm like, oh, I mean, that's not a lie. We could do that.

And he's like, plus you talk to Mr. Romero and he doesn't know what's going to happen. The school district hasn't decided. So they said it might be hybrid. It might not. And so literally, uh, the next day was a Monday. I researched how do you homeschool in state of Colorado, which is where I'm at. And Tuesday I submitted my notice of intent. was shaking as I submitted it to the school district. went in person, they had their masks on and they like opened the door and I'm like, we're going to homeschool. And they're like, thank you. And just shut the door. And I was like,

Wait, is that all? Like I was expecting. I don't know what I was expecting, like pushback or something, but that was it. And then we started homeschooling. I made a plan. I bought curriculums. And we started doing it a few months. It was a month and a half. No, not even a month and a half. A month later, we had our first day, which I can tell about in a minute because it was a disaster.

Ela Richmond (05:10.99)
Okay, I'm so excited to hear that. Before we hop into that, what did the calls look like with your friends? Like what did they tell you? What were the things that you were like, hmm, that's interesting, or I don't know if I want that. And then like, despite this internal confusion and pushback, like what was the thing that initially made you say, okay, you know, we're just gonna do it? Was it just like the...

conviction that this is the right path, like even though I don't know what I'm doing or I don't know where I'm going.

Janae Daniels (05:42.92)
I think there's a few things. To answer that question first, even though I didn't know what I was doing, I couldn't shake that call. since leaving the school system, I've heard a lot of parents use that term, like I feel this call that I need to homeschool. For me, that was the biggest factor. If I hadn't had that impression, I probably wouldn't have ever pulled the kids.

So that for me was it, it was that like, I have to do this, this is the right thing, even though I don't know what I'm doing, even though I'm gonna do it wrong, even though, what if I screw up my kids, right? I had to honor what was on my heart because I found that my mama's heart is never wrong. Like that mom intuition is never ever wrong. And so I'm like, okay, I'm gonna listen to that mama's intuition.

When I called different people, I would ask you like, why did you start homeschooling? And the answer was always like, well, we just thought it would be great. We thought it might be a good thing. We didn't intend to, but why not? And then the follow-up was like, why do you keep homeschooling? Because they all said, it's hard. And there are days that are really hard. And our house is messy a lot. And sometimes you don't have a lot of time on your own. And it's OK.

But they all would say the same thing. But I can't trade the relationship with my kids. Like that has become paramount. The relationship that we have is really close. I've loved watching that this is other things that I've said. They blossom and they learn and they watch them learn as their parent instead of being told what they're learning by teachers is really beautiful. And so to experience that we wouldn't go back. Some of them had become disillusioned with

government institutions and one of them and was like, yeah, I would never, I don't trust the government with a lot of things. So why would I trust them with my children? And by the way, the government schools aren't doing too great right now. You know, the illiteracy rate is super high. The bullying rate is high. There's a lot of garbage that is being taught. Why would I put my kids in that situation? So those were some of the things that parents shared with me. My friends shared with me. The biggest thing though that struck

Janae Daniels (08:10.565)
me was that all of them, without exception, said the relationship with my kids is so much better than I ever dreamed it could be. And if we hadn't started homeschooling, that would not be the case. And that was like, OK. Which is interesting because that led me into learning about attachment psychology.

and studying the work of Dr. Gordon Neufeld and Gabor Matej, who wrote the book, Hold On To Your Kids. If you're not familiar with attachment psychology, there's a thing called peer versus parent orientation. And what that is is who does the child go to for nurturing? This was a new concept that I had never heard about, but I learned about it because of the homeschooling world.

And I always thought that it was totally normal for teenagers just to be rebellious. that, I mean, and my older two were. And I mean, they're good kids, but like our relationship was not great when they left the house. And we tried. And so as I'm reading and learning about peer versus parent orientation and attachment, and I learned that, historically up until the last 80 years,

parents were who children would go to for emotional nourishing, not their peers, that this is a recent phenomenon, like it blew my mind. so for me, as I delved into attachment psychology and peer versus parent orientation and realizing, kids historically were not always rebellious, like that's a new phenomenon.

And our school system has played into that because they're separated from their parents for so long, from such a young age, 16,000 hours throughout their lifetime, throughout their formative years. That blew me away. And I was like, okay, the relationship, my kids will be attached to me. They will be oriented to me. That's the natural order of things. So I just went off on a little tangent there.

Ela Richmond (10:29.228)
No, I think that's so fascinating. I asked a homeschool kid actually, I think she's like 12, 13, what her favorite thing about homeschooling is and what her favorite thing about being homeschooling, homeschooled is she was homeschooled for her whole life. And she actually told me that she's watched a lot of her friends. So she plays club volleyball and she...

Janae Daniels (10:55.827)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (10:57.87)
watched a lot of her friends and it has watched how her friends and their parents interact with each other and how they don't have as close of a relationship with their kids as she does with her mom and her parents and her family. And she was like, she's like, honestly, the thing that I love most is how much time we spend together because I see all these kids and like, and she's even aware of this as a 12 year old.

Janae Daniels (11:03.923)
Mm-hmm.

Janae Daniels (11:23.507)
Yeah. Wow.

Ela Richmond (11:23.554)
just watching all of her friends and the ways that they interact with their parents and the ways that they talk to them and trust them and how they're influenced by them. And she was just like, they don't really spend that much time together. They don't know each other well. They haven't developed their relationships a ton. And I think it's become something that we just kind of accept. the world is busy. Your parents, they're there as much as they possibly can be. like,

Janae Daniels (11:43.313)
Right. Right.

Ela Richmond (11:50.368)
and mom's the one that is making you dinner and mom's the one that's tucking you into bed at night. Mom's the one that is you doing all these things, right? But like, there's this aspect of like, as you were saying, that kids don't fully understand that mom is away or like that dad is away for these purposes. Like they don't fully understand. They just know whenever mom's there, mom's not there, right? And so I think that's really fascinating to me, this like,

Janae Daniels (12:10.099)
Mm-hmm.

Janae Daniels (12:15.282)
right.

Ela Richmond (12:19.246)
this question of how important is it to just be present? Like it's not even necessarily that you need to be the one that's like talking to them 24 seven or like even homeschoolers, there's a variety of ways that people homeschool, right? So like you could do like online classes and you can do all these maybe co-ops and like you can bring in a ton of different things, but what is the proximity?

Janae Daniels (12:35.762)
Right, right.

Ela Richmond (12:46.798)
And is there a lot of just lag time? I'm absolutely the closest with my dad, period, hands down. But it's because he and I spent about four hours in the car every single weekend together, traveling between things all the time. And so we would just talk. Whenever you are together, over time, just kind of builds trust. It just kind of creates a familiarity. What is your thought on why do you think that this has become so

Janae Daniels (12:53.167)
Mm-hmm. Right.

Ela Richmond (13:15.234)
Just normal, I guess, for people not to be together often.

Janae Daniels (13:20.207)
Well, and this is something that they talk about in the book that we do see. So I used to love the public school system. And I say school system, not public education, because I believe every child has a right to be educated, right? But school, public school is not the same thing. And the nefarious nature, I'm sure that there was some altruistic.

Ela Richmond (13:35.811)
Mm-hmm.

Janae Daniels (13:47.472)
motivation for some people behind it, but the more that I have delved into the history of the education system with Horace Mann, with John Dewey, with John D. Rockefeller, with Andrew Carnegie, with the sociologists who took over at the turn of the century, and some of the very Marxist ideas that were embedded into the system. And then we see a big shift in the 1940s and a push to separate

children from their parents. shoot, I don't have it in front of me, but there is a quote, and I think it was Cuberly who talks about like that they, Cuberly was the Dean of the Stanford School for Education. essentially the gist of the quote, because I don't have it in front of me, I didn't plan on bringing it, but was that,

that the more that they can separate the kids from the parents, the more that the kids will rely more and more on the government and the government would have more power in the child's life. So there was a very nefarious intentionality to separate children from their parents. And it used to be one room school houses only went up through eighth grade. And then some kids might go to high school and some might not. My husband's grandmother, who's 102,

decided to go to high school. And she talks about the one room schoolhouse that she went to and all of her siblings would go. And then they would have to travel when they decided that high school was a thing. They had to travel and be separated to go to a high school. And that was done intentionally. And the hours being pushed longer and longer school days, that was done very, very intentionally to separate the parents from the children because they knew, they had an understanding

that they could get the children dependent on the school, on the government. And so for as much as I used to not be a conspiracy theorist about some things, but I'm like, my gosh, it's all here in black and white and we can research it, we can look at it, we can read it. And so I've gone down those rabbit holes for the last five years of what happened? Why did this happen? And it was done intentionally.

Janae Daniels (16:12.881)
And that's not to say that just because a child goes to public school that they can't have a parent-oriented relationship and a good relationship with their parents. They absolutely can. And I have a lot of friends whose children are intensely close to them and they are absolutely parent-oriented. It's just a lot tougher because of that separation for so many hours. And as parents, we get the worst hours of the day when our kids are in public school. We get when they first wake up and we're rushing and we get...

when they're tired and they've come home after a long day and then they have to do homework and then they go to bed. Or they go to sports and then they go to bed. Or they go to piano lessons and they go to bed. We don't get their best hours, which are usually mornings for children. Like mid-morning, early afternoon, those are the best hours for kids. We don't get those. But as a homeschool mom, I do get that. Can I share a little story, a little experience that I had? that be okay?

Ela Richmond (17:09.688)
Yeah.

Janae Daniels (17:11.823)
I, as I was learning all about attachment and orientation, my kids enrichment program, which is like a once a week homeschool program, had a fall festival. And this is a few years ago. I think we had been homeschooling for three years when this festival happened. And there, one of the rooms that they were doing, the teenage girls were hosting line, teaching line dances.

And so my daughter was like, mom, let's do this. And she was like 15 at the time. And I was like, okay. And so I go in this room and all the girls are like, mom, mom, you stand next to me, mom. And we did these line dances and not one of those girls was ashamed of their mom. Not one of them was like, walk behind me 10 paces. my gosh, mom, you're so embarrassing. Not one.

And so we spent the hour doing line dances and we were all laughing as moms and daughters and other kids that were learning line dances and other parents. But I was really dumbfounded. I'm like, this is not normal. Now I understand it's normal for historically that would be considered normal. But for today's standards, it's not typical because we are so used to kids being oriented to their friends as opposed to their parents. So then a couple of weeks later,

We had some friends over for dinner and they have a bunch of kids our kids age. They used to go to school with them, but they don't anymore. They went to church with us and they had a teenage daughter, roughly the same age as my teenage daughter. And the mom was like, I'm so sorry. She didn't come. I said, no worries, no worries. And she's like, she won't talk to me. And she just starts to cry.

And she's like, she wants nothing to do with me. All she cares about is being with her friends. And she says that what I think is stupid. But I guess it's just normal teenage behavior, right? Now, I've learned all of this stuff, spent all this time studying attachment psychology. And again, I'm not an attachment psychologist, but I got some ideas of how things are working by this point. And so I handed her the book. like, you need to read this book.

Janae Daniels (19:29.969)
and you can get your daughter's heart back. Because the truth is, as Dr. Neufeld says, we cannot parent children whose heart we don't have. So she read the book and took to heart the things that we can do as parents to get their hearts back. And really, she worked so hard over the next couple of years working on that relationship. Of course, her kids continue to stay in public school.

or most of them, one of them they pulled, but continues to stay in public school. And I'm happy to report that she was like, I worked so hard and now I have my daughter's heart. Like she turns to me when she needs something. I am the compass by which she goes by. And that's one of the principles of a strong parent attached child is that we are their compass. So when we say you are smart and you are kind,

They believe us because we become their compass point, which is, like I said, historically, that's how it should be. Developmentally, that's how it should be, is we are their compass point. So I went off on a tangent there. There you go.

Ela Richmond (20:36.686)
No, I absolutely love this. This is so beautiful and it aligns with everything that I've learned so far. I'm going to repeat the quote that you said. We cannot parent children whose heart we do not have. Like that is so powerful. So you have a very unique experience because you started homeschooling once your kids were in high school. When

Janae Daniels (21:05.383)
They're about to go into high school, yes.

Ela Richmond (21:06.582)
Okay, so when you began, did you have your children's heart or like what was set the scene? Like what was your family experience like and then how did that develop?

Janae Daniels (21:10.119)
Mm-hmm.

Janae Daniels (21:14.224)
Okay.

Janae Daniels (21:18.003)
So it was tough. oldest two, it was a rough ride with our oldest two. And thankfully, now that I've learned how to get hearts back, that's something that we've been able to work on with the oldest two. And it's never too late, even with adult kids, just for those who are listening. But for the next four, I absolutely had the heart of my four-year-old at the time. And I had the heart of my eight-year-old at the time.

but I could see that I was losing the heart of my 12 and 13 year olds. They were wanting to spend more and more time with their friends. I actually felt like COVID was a beautiful blessing. I didn't realize what we were doing was actually homeschooling during that last semester of 2020 because we were cooking together and we were reading together. And I thought we were just having fun family time.

So, but when we started homeschooling, I could see I was getting their hearts back. Again, I didn't know at the time that's what was going on because I hadn't delved in, but I could see that our relationship was changing and I didn't understand why, but I liked it. But to set the stage of our first week of homeschooling specifically, I was still in a very public school teacher mindset. Okay, we're gonna have, I have to cover all of the subjects every day, all of the time.

I need to make sure that they're in the books, that they, I've got all the textbooks. I spent an obscene amount of money on curriculums that I ended up not using most of them. We didn't de-school if for those that are new to homeschooling or new to the homeschooling world, that's an actual thing. It's the process of adjustment, moving into homeschooling. We didn't do that. I didn't know about it, but I had planned a very structured day.

with all these curriculums to hit all of, to hit everything. And I was scared to death because I was not a math teacher, I was not a science teacher, but I figured I could figure it out or I would outsource if I needed to, or, you know, like, but I'd make sure that they hit all of the things all the time. So the first day comes and I'm so excited because I was ready, I thought. And I had the schedule typed out in great detail.

Janae Daniels (23:38.436)
And so we started and by the, we're an hour in and everyone was in tears, including me. I mean, we're talking, there was a mutiny. My 13 year old son at the time was like, we're going back to school. Just put us back. And I'm like, yeah, I'm going to tomorrow. This is awful. You know, cause I would try to wrangle them and I tried to teach them as a teacher, but I'm their mom. And so they were like, it was just, I mean, conflict. And so,

It was about an hour, hour and a half in, we're all crying, the kids are mad, I'm yelling, I've got snot all over, because I've been crying so hard, and there's a knock at the door, and I had totally forgot that the piano tuner was coming to tune the piano. So I go upstairs, and I'm like, I'm gonna let him in, and you guys start reading your lesson. Oh my gosh, know, like, it's in there, just read it, you know, and so I go upstairs and I...

opened the door and I was like, here, piano tuner, here is the piano. And he's like, thank you. like, I will be downstairs with my children, homeschooling, because we're homeschoolers, but maybe not till tomorrow. That might change. So I go back downstairs and the kids are just sitting there. They're not wanting to do anything. They're anyway, so one by one, they make their way upstairs until I'm left completely alone in the basement by myself.

And I finally go upstairs to see what is going on, because it's really quiet. And lo and behold, they are surrounding the piano tuner, totally, all four of them, totally mesmerized, totally enthralled. And he like takes a tuning fork and he's like, ding. You see the sound frequencies are da-da-da-da-da-da. And they're like.

And then he's like, and if I play and the mallet hits the string, da da da da, and the geometry behind the octaves, da da da da, and I'm sitting there dumbfounded because then my kids are asking thoughtful, deep questions. And I'm like, where did that come from? And part of me was like, oh no, you need to get downstairs and learn stuff. I am supposed to teach you and you're gonna be learning stuff.

Janae Daniels (25:59.508)
because I have the books and we need to learn stuff in the books. And then the other part of me went, what beauty is happening here? And so I sat there and I kid you not Ella for two hours, they watched him tune the piano and he loved the audience. know, he was having a great time. He's explaining everything and he plays for them and they're asking all these questions for two hours. He had their complete and full attention.

Ela Richmond (26:17.323)
Huh?

Janae Daniels (26:29.005)
And I was like, okay, I need to rethink what homeschooling looks like and I need to rethink education. And so I decided that we were gonna do school. put away all of the curriculums except for the math, reading and writing. That was it. Everything else I put away and I had all the subjects and then some. I even had composer study, which anyway.

Ela Richmond (26:36.439)
Hmm.

Janae Daniels (26:57.457)
I put that away and then I just decided, okay, for the next several months, we're just gonna focus on reading, writing, math, and then we're gonna read aloud together, and we're gonna spend a lot of time in nature, and I'm just gonna try to just relax things and try to figure out what I believe about education, because that was a major shift for me. Like that singular moment was a major shift of what could and should education actually look like. So over the next several months,

My kids had so much free time, because it took us like an hour to get through reading, writing, and math. And they would zip through it. My almost high schooler was like, mom, I am able to get done in a few minutes what it would take my class weeks to get through. This is amazing. And so what ended up happening is my son picks up a guitar. His brother had left his guitar and starts watching YouTube videos and learns how to play the guitar really well. And I'm like, what? What in the world?

And my eight-year-old starts to the piano. Now he had had piano lessons, but we stopped because the piano teacher, he wouldn't practice. And so he learns like, he learned Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, third movement from watching YouTube. And then his piano teacher saw him at church and was like, how did you learn that? And he's like, from YouTube. She's like, and your form is correct. my gosh. My daughter starts reading and reading and reading, and she starts devouring every book she can get her hands on.

And I see this love of learning come back, which I had watched kind of disappear. They would dread like, I've got to do my homework. I've got to do this. I've got to go to school. Well, now they're like, I've got to work on this thing, or I'm looking up this on YouTube, or I'm doing this. So several months goes by. It's about March. We started in August. And my daughter, noticed she'll come down, and we have quite an extensive little library at home. And she's.

She's reading all these books about World War II. And I had purchased some for Christmas for her, like that was her gift, was all these historical fiction books. So she's devouring them. And she picked up the Diary of Anne Frank, which is not historical fiction. as she's reading it, she comes downstairs and she's sobbing. And I'm like, what's going on? And she's like, she was real, Mom. This happened and she was real.

Janae Daniels (29:20.817)
And I'm kind of nervous, mom, because I was watching that people are being censored. That's what the Nazis did. And so she's starting to make real world connections that I did not help her with. I'm not that smart, right? And I'm like, what in the world? So then we go to church and she's talking to a girl who she had gone to public school with at church. And the girl says to her, she said, my gosh, have you read the diary of Anne Frank? And the girl said,

my gosh, we just finished reading that for school. It was so boring. And my daughter here who's been emotionally affected by this book is like, you didn't realize she was like, she was real. Like she was alive. Like she's a real person. And the girl was like, yeah, but I didn't find it that interesting. I thought Wings of Fire was much more interesting. My daughter was like, that's a fantasy book. She's like, yeah, but it's super.

Anyway, it was a lot more interesting. thought the dire vamping was super boring. So my daughter comes home and she's like, mom, where is the humanity? And she recognized that she was learning humanity. She recognized that she was learning all these things. And by this time, we had started moving into more of an unschooling model than what we had started with, which was a very school at home model where it's, we're gonna do all the subjects and.

And so now we are eclectic unschoolers at this point. So that was our experience. It was very, very painful. But my perspective of education started to shift so drastically that I started asking myself, like, why do they have to take Algebra 2? Like, I've never used that. Why do they have to take it? Or do they even have to take it? And do they actually need to take biology? Could they learn the basics in biology? And is there a better way?

So it grossly shifted how we did school. By freshman and sophomore years for my daughter and my son, they started concurrent enrollment. I was really worried because the limited writing that we had done, thought, well, how are they gonna pass these classes? They both took English composition one and two as a freshman and a sophomore. They made the president's list. They had the highest grades in the class. My daughter said, I realized as long as I just jump through the hoops that the teacher tells me to jump through,

Janae Daniels (31:40.85)
I get an A. I mean, I may not learn anything, but I get an A. And I was like, I mean, that's not a lie. My son's second semester, he was taking a business class and the class ended and he said, I liked the class well enough, but mom, why would I take business advice from a professor who's never run a business? I live with entrepreneurial parents. In our neighborhood, there's a lot of entrepreneurs and I interview them all the time. I already make money on my own.

if I need it and he does, like he's an entrepreneur. And why would I continue with people who give me theory but no practical experience? So as here they are, know, 13 and 14 saying these things or 14, sorry, 14 and 15 saying these things, like, I mean, they're not, it's not wrong. And so that shifted how we did high school. And now we became more child focused.

We did still have to follow state standards as far as like, are the homeschooling standards? And we did the bare minimum for some of the stuff. I'm like, well, you have to have science. So here, we'll do this for science and call it good. And we counted it, but they have spent hours and hours focusing on their pursuits. And then there was things that I was like, you need to know the constitution. There's things that I feel like you need to know.

And so we've spent time, sometimes we'll take classes, sometimes they don't. My now 18 year old who just graduated, spent several months with a YouTuber who has 4 million subscribers and brought him on as an intern and he learned everything from film editing to producing. The YouTuber said, listen, I need you to reach out to NASA and write a proposal to NASA, we wanna do this video.

you are going to be our liaison with NASA. We also want to do this. I need you to secure this and this and this. Call internationally. He gave him a credit card and said, here, use this at your discretion when you need to make purchase orders or whatever. And at the time, he was like 16. And he's like, I learned more in those months than I learned in a semester of my business class. Because it was hands on, it was real. I learned to write a proposal.

Janae Daniels (34:02.673)
I learned to do all of these things. He has since been approached by some personal development companies who have said, listen, we would love to have you come on. And he's debating now. He'll be gone for the next two years doing service as a missionary. But then when he comes home, he's already been told, like, hey, keep in contact with us. You have a job if you want to. And he said, in two years,

I may change my mind, but I'm keeping my doors open. And so here I was so worried, like, my gosh, I'm gonna screw them up. And I don't know what I'm doing for high school. And I don't know anything about math and all the things. They figure things out and they move forward. He never finished algebra two. And yet when he tested for the college, he tested out of it, but he's never taken it.

He finished algebra. never, I don't think took geometry, but again, tested out of it. He's taken business math. He's taken personal finances. He's taken stuff that he felt and that we also felt as parents that he would need. He's learned to do taxes and yet he's still sought after for work and he is 18. So anyway, so things shifted for me. Whereas once I was...

high school has to look like this. Now it's no, it can, there's more than one road that will lead to Rome. And there are better ways to educate, to get a real education than just going and doing what we are told to do. And by the way, who decided, who decided that in fourth grade kids have to learn the ecosystem? Who decided that every child needs to take geometry as freshmen? Who decided that?

Ela Richmond (35:35.79)
Hmm.

Janae Daniels (35:53.466)
Somebody did but that doesn't make it right for every single person. So I just want off you I'm on I'm getting off my soapbox right now

Ela Richmond (35:59.438)
No, that like this is so perfect. lots, so many thoughts. I'm going to take this in two different directions. My first direction is, all the way back to this concept and this, this idea of, okay, how do I homeschool my high schoolers? It sounds like the, the reason that high school is so scary is because we have all these expectations that we put on ourselves about where they need to go and what they need to do. And also all these expectations on ourselves as parents, like what

Janae Daniels (36:20.605)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (36:29.394)
what am I gonna do about this extremely complex topic? It sounds like you outsourced for the things that you did not know and you were very comfortable doing that. And it also sounds like you just were really, really critical about whether or not they actually needed it and wanted it. And so I really like that approach. For high school, high school does not have to be daunting if it's, okay, I don't have to be the expert, let me find experts number one and number two.

Janae Daniels (36:52.723)
Mm-mm.

Ela Richmond (36:57.804)
Well, do they actually need it? Like, yes, you know, in every single high school, you usually learn these, you know, five subjects. Well, let's be critical about this. Like, is this related to where they want to go? Is this something that's necessary for them to be a really good, well-rounded human? If the answer is no, and these are just kind of like very niche topics, like, well, maybe let's rethink how we do this. Yeah. What is your thought on that? And then I'll take this in an entirely different direction afterwards.

Janae Daniels (37:25.405)
Well, I think a lot of it depends on like what Stephen Covey says, begin with the end in mind. Like what is the end goal for your family, for your children? Like what are the most important lessons? And this is what I would ask myself. What are the most important lessons that my kids have to know by the time they leave the house? Well, they need to know how to read, they need to know how to write, and they need to know math up into a certain point, right? They need to know how to do percents. They need to know basic, basic, basic.

Ela Richmond (37:30.318)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (37:50.67)
Mm-hmm.

Janae Daniels (37:54.842)
geometry and algebra. They need to, I don't care if they ever learned the intercept formula. don't, I don't. Now, if a child's really geared mathematically and they love it, I have my 13 year old is finishing geometry. He's already finished algebra and geometry. He, and he's almost done with geometry and he because he loves math, but going back to begin with the end in mind, like what is my end goal for them?

Is it college? It might be. So we need to make sure that we have the doors open so that if they do want to apply to a university that they can. Again, lots of roads lead to Rome. And so I've seen, I interviewed a guy just yesterday who is a former Harvard professor who was a high school dropout, ended up going to a college that accepted everybody.

Ela Richmond (38:33.516)
Mm-hmm.

Yes, okay.

Janae Daniels (38:49.999)
ends up graduating with honors, the top honor student at the college and goes to Harvard for his PhD, right? Society would say by all standards, he was gonna be a failure and yet he found a different road. So if we go and go, okay, what's our end goal? Maybe the child is really, really loves the trades. Like how do we prepare them and what do we need to do for them to be in the trades? My 13 year old.

actually informed us that he wants to be a plumber because after doing research with AI, he realized that's a job that AI cannot take over anytime soon. So he said, I've decided I don't want to go to college. I want to be a plumber. Well, today he is in his construction academy class learning the trades. And by the time he graduates, he will have certified enough that he can jump into an apprenticeship with plumbing. And so

If we look at that as parents go, what is our end goal? I want them to be good people. I want them to know, I want them to still love learning. I want them to know how to read, how to communicate via written word effectively. I need to know that how they need to know how to do math or taxes, right? We use our end goal as the, gives us the pathway that we end up taking, if that makes sense. Like the end goal becomes

Ela Richmond (40:07.522)
Mm-hmm.

Janae Daniels (40:10.705)
the driving light, that guiding light of how we're gonna do things. And so as I realized, like my daughter, totally not mathematically minded, she can do math to a certain point, right? And she does it fine, but she's more driven to the arts and she's more driven to design. And so we do ficusum flips once a summer and she's heavily involved in the flips. We're doing one right now that's about to go on the market. And she's been heavily involved in the design work of that flip and in helping with it.

And so as you're designing your high schoolers path, you have to look at what are their strengths, what are they interested in, and then what are your end goals as a family and as parents? And then you go from there. And it doesn't have to look like the public school system at all. It doesn't.

Ela Richmond (41:02.112)
I love this. and I love the emphasis on what are the doors you want to keep open? like I was talking to my youngest brother and he's trying to make all these decisions about his life and where he's going. And he was, he was trying to decide where he was going next. And there was this really easy option in front of him and there was a harder option in front of him, but the easy option would have locked him into about five years of, of a contract. And I was like, I was like, you are 18 years old.

Janae Daniels (41:27.591)
Hmm.

Ela Richmond (41:31.724)
I was like, right now, something very, very important for you to value is actually freedom and flexibility. And you need to really consider heavily what that means for you to be locked into a long-term contract. You do not know where you're going in the next year. You don't even know what the next three years are gonna look like for your life. So really ask yourself before you close doors for yourself, what doors you wanna keep open. And I think that's exactly what you're saying.

Janae Daniels (41:45.991)
Hmm, that's wise.

Ela Richmond (42:00.244)
in this high school period, it's more about opening doors than anything else. It's like, okay, what can we create a path for? And as you progress, as you decide what you like and what you don't like, as you get deeper into things, whether it's like an internship or an apprenticeship, and you recognize that there are particularities about yourself. Like you really like this thing, but you really don't like this thing. The more doors that are open, the more opportunities you have to

Janae Daniels (42:05.053)
Right.

Ela Richmond (42:30.382)
course correct even just a little bit. Yeah, so that totally resonated with me. For the rest of the conversation, I want to steer this, I guess, topic that we're talking about, which is young adults and high schoolers and homeschooling more toward actually family culture, because it sounds like you and your family have a very unique culture. I've experienced the...

Janae Daniels (42:48.947)
you

Ela Richmond (42:59.958)
the difficulty of families getting their high schoolers bought in. Like your high schooler will sit there, they'll do some stuff, but they're not bought in to laying out this plan for even being a plumber or laying out this plan for, or even just committing to like, I'm gonna make a plan to get all these skills to work for this YouTuber to do these. Most kids are not doing that.

Janae Daniels (43:05.511)
Mm-hmm.

Janae Daniels (43:28.147)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (43:28.652)
And then even further back, you were mentioning that like at the beginning of your homeschooling, your kids were just picking up their guitar and they were just picking up the piano. Do you have no technology in your house? I mean, you said you have YouTube, but like, how do you like steer them toward this?

Janae Daniels (43:44.214)
okay, so this is a really good question. And I actually talk with a lot of young adults in college about finding what their interests are and how do they pursue that? Because I think that there's a dilemma in that the young adults today are really floundering, going, I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm just spending this money in college and I don't know if this is what I wanna do with my life. So it's a problem. So.

Ela Richmond (44:04.616)
Mm-hmm.

Janae Daniels (44:11.545)
We are not an anti-technology family. I do have to put limits on video games with my kids. My older son, my 18 year old son, he'll play video games, but he's not that interested in them. My 13 year old, I do put boundaries on them. Like, listen, listen, you cannot play any until three o'clock if your basic schoolwork is done, if your chores are done because

Ela Richmond (44:17.358)
Mm-hmm.

Janae Daniels (44:40.847)
I talk to them about technology as like, we either are creators or we are consumers. And we don't want to be, it's okay to consume sometimes, but if we are consuming all the time, we're not providing value to the rest of the world and we're not fulfilling the measure of our creation. And so we need to be, we are meant to be creators in the Bible. The very first thing it says is in the beginning, God created. And so I talked to my kids about that. Like you need to create something.

And it's important that they do something every day where they are in the creative process in some way, whether that's using technology and doing computer animation or making bread. My 13 year old's really into sourdough right now, made a starter. He's been selling five loaves a day. He said by the end of the year, he'll have $10,000 because he's selling them $10 a loaf. So in the beginning for us, my kids did a lot of sitting around getting bored.

And I was really panicky at the beginning, because I'm like, all they're doing is literally sitting here. Because I was like,

Ela Richmond (45:44.899)
Were they watching shows on their iPad or like, were like, they were just.

Janae Daniels (45:47.556)
No, I was like, no, no, I was like, no, we're not going to do any technology until three o'clock. Once you've got your basic stuff done, three o'clock is that's the magic hour for our family. And you can't play it for the rest of your life. Like I put limits and so they would get really bored because they couldn't do anything. And boredom I learned leads to brilliance. And so as they're so bored,

with nothing to do, that's when my daughter started to read. They were so bored that my, the time, eight year old said, mom, can I look up something on YouTube for the piano? Because I want, there's a song that my cousin played that I want to play. And I said, fine, that's fine. You could look it up as long as it's for being a creator and not consuming. My now 18 year old got so bored,

that he's like, I think I want to try to play the guitar because I have nothing else to do, right? And I think we have overbooked our kids so much that we've robbed them of the gift of boredom because that's where genius happens is when they are so bored, they have to figure out what to do. The other thing that boredom gives them is time to reflect and really, really think about things.

And my 18 year old has told me that many, many times. He said, mom, I realized what I liked and didn't like during the hours where I had time to just think. And I see my public school friends who have not had that opportunity because they're in everything. And they are just like going through the motions, but there's not that time to reflect and think, oh, I love this or oh, I love that, but I don't love this. They're so...

One day he snuck into a public school, which the school district came out and said, no, no homeschool. Like nobody can come to the school unless you go to school here. Totally went in. They didn't stop him. He went to a physics class, sat there with his friend at physics, took the class. He was like, I want to experience high school for a day. So he went, it was the second time he actually had done it. He went to a different high school all day and nobody noticed that he was even there. Cause he just went to the classes and sat there. But after the physics class, he said, mom, I...

Janae Daniels (48:14.065)
I sat there and I was listening to the teacher and I was looking at the faces of the kids and they were trying to concentrate and they were, I talked to my friend and he's worried about this class and then the next class and then he's worried about the next class. He said, they don't have any time to think because they're worried about what other people are thinking and they have to conform to their thoughts and their ideas. And he's like, you have blessed me with the gift to think. So I think that's the, if I could tell,

any parent, anything, like simplify your schedule, simplify your kids' schedules and give them time to think and reflect. And yeah, at the beginning, they're gonna be bored and they're gonna complain a lot for months. They will complain for months and think that they're dying. But a shift happens eventually where they start to pick things up and go, I think this and I think that. And I think I wanna try.

Ela Richmond (48:54.562)
Bye.

Janae Daniels (49:10.333)
growing a garden or I think I want to try this. Or they, you know, I do let the kids explore some on YouTube and, they're like, I really want to learn how to make a dirt ball. Don't ask that happened. And, and he did make a dirt ball. but, but, but we don't give them, we overbook them. And if we could just slow things down and give even our young adults time to think, not push college right away, let them have a gap year.

to really think about like, what do I believe? What do I love? What do I want to learn about? What am I good at? We have robbed them of that. And if we could give that gift back, that will be for their benefit as well as ours. Because when we get old, know, someone's gotta take care of us.

Ela Richmond (49:54.51)
I know. I love this. What is the culture that you and your husband embody? So like, what do y'all prioritize? What is the example that your kids have? You said that y'all flip things. You said that y'all are pretty entrepreneurial. Is it like y'all are always creating and thinking? And so like, that's what your kids are exposed to. Because I find that the pace that a family sets like inside of their family culture is actually quite important.

Janae Daniels (50:25.203)
Yeah, so it's interesting because as we've done our homeschooling journey, it has shifted things for us as well. My husband used to run a large real estate brokerage, was a franchisee, and he has since really slowed down, runs his own very, very, very tiny team. So we went from having all these employees and all these agents to, I think what I really, really want is

it to be small where I can spend more time with my family. Right. So that shift absolutely happened because we were in the thick of like, be busy, be busy, be busy. I was working, hiring and hiring for multiple companies. ran my own hiring small business hiring company. So I was hiring all over the United States and I, as during the homeschooling journey, I realized, wow, I really hate hiring a lot. Why do I keep doing this? You know,

Ela Richmond (50:56.6)
Yeah.

Janae Daniels (51:22.987)
And then I ended up podcasting. And so our kids, as we've homeschooled them, they've watched us go through a transformation where we're like, what things are most important to us? Well, spending time as a family, for one. My husband used to be a workaholic and him realizing I need to slow down and I need to spend more time with the kids and I need to spend more quality time with you. And...

I need to take time for myself too, because he wasn't. I mean, he was working seven days a week. He'd try to take Sundays off, but in real estate that doesn't really happen. And now like going, I don't need to have this gargantuan real estate brokerage. Like this is somebody else's dream. This is not my dream. And so for us, we have transformed over the last five years and really, really slowed things down.

Are we still busy? Yeah, I mean, we're still busy and we still drive kids to their different enrichment programs. They each have an enrichment program they go to and sometimes they take classes, sometimes they don't. I cut out sports a lot. Like my kids will take tennis lessons or golf lessons. the spring, my son, my 13 year old might run track, but I realized like, why am I...

spreading myself thin, running these kids all these different places. If they're really, really interested in it, yeah, then it's worthwhile. But if I'm just putting it in, putting them in soccer, just to put them in soccer, because everyone else does, because they need to be on a team sport, wait, what? So it's made us rethink what's important for our family and what is not important. Soccer, not important for our family, and it used to be. T-ball, also not important. All my kids were in that for a long time. And I learned, I learned.

that we have to slow down and we have to slow way, way, way, way down. that has been, that's paramount as far as our family culture goes is like, okay, what's the most important things? We do expect our kids to work hard and do their chores and contribute to the family. My son, Joshua, I'm like, I need you to take your siblings here and here and here. And he's like, okay, like there's not a lot of pushback because he's like, I'm part of the family, I need help.

Ela Richmond (53:33.879)
Hmm.

Janae Daniels (53:42.196)
So we do push that, if you're gonna do work, you're gonna work hard and you're gonna put your name on it or don't do it at all. So that's become important for our family. But I think the biggest thing for us is like, we as parents have to slow down and the things that we thought were important are actually not that important. Like being a workaholic, that is gonna give you a heart attack. So I don't know if that answered the question, but that's what we've.

Ela Richmond (54:10.988)
So it sounds like there's this emphasis on like creating, but not pursuing things for either pride or like some other reason like greed or like these things that you want or like the world will tell you, you want this bigger house, you want this bigger title, you want to be able to look at your friends and say like, I have all these things. And it sounds like for you and your husband especially, like y'all have gained a lot of clarity, so you do your podcast because

Janae Daniels (54:11.784)
learned.

Ela Richmond (54:40.972)
you're creating in a way that is mission aligned. And it sounds like for him, he's doing things that make him excited and like motivate him and get him creating, but not to the extent that it is compromising on a different value. And it's interesting that you say all that because you said that you're not moving that fast, but to everybody else that's listening, probably you're moving so quickly. Like, you know, your son's doing this awesome internship with this awesome person. You're

other son is prep preparing for his future, your daughter also and like, you know, it sounds like you'll have a lot going on. but it sounds like it is, it is very.

Janae Daniels (55:19.795)
It's intentional.

Ela Richmond (55:20.627)
Yeah, thoughtful, thought out.

Janae Daniels (55:22.631)
Mm-hmm. Right, yeah, so as I mentioned before, we tried to eliminate the unessential. Have you ever read the book Essentialism by Greg McEwen? Yeah, he and I worked together in college. So yeah, kind of crazy. Hi, Greg. That book resonated with me. It took my husband a long time to come around to that book. But...

Ela Richmond (55:33.344)
Mm-hmm, I actually met him once.

Really?

Janae Daniels (55:51.332)
there is truth to this minimalist essential principle. And I'm not a minimalist, by the way. If you look at my house, you'd be like, I'm trying to be, but I'm not even close to it at all. You look at my house and you're like, yeah, you are not a minimalist. But I think the, I don't know, our values just changed. And so for other people, yeah, it might seem like we go fast.

Ela Richmond (56:04.856)
here.

Janae Daniels (56:20.903)
but it's actually not, it's not that fast. We just focus on fewer things as opposed to being a jack of all trades and a master of none. We focus on just a few things instead of everything. Fitness has been really important to my husband. That was one thing that shifted too. In the last two years, I've lost a hundred pounds. It's taken me two years to do it. My husband has lost, I think 30 pounds and started strength training. Our value shifted.

Ela Richmond (56:41.359)
Wow.

Janae Daniels (56:49.617)
we realized, we need to focus more on family. We need to focus more on our health so that we're around longer as our parents' health is not good. And so we just do less, but we try to do it well. Do less, but do it well and slow it down.

Ela Richmond (57:04.843)
Wow. Yeah, I think that like, I am consistently convicted by this. I just need to kind of put it into practice because it's really hard whenever you have all these inputs and distractions. And that's probably another symptom of the consumerism mindset is like, okay, if I'm always watching something or listening to something or having all these inputs, like I'm being influenced and like just...

making sure that the things that you're being influenced by are really good and aligned with your values is important. But I think essentialism and just like, what do we need? What do we value? Like, are we living in accordance with that? kids are very, yeah, yeah. And kids are very attuned to like, are you in integrists? Like, are you living with integrity? Right? And like, I always remember like whenever I was really young,

Janae Daniels (57:36.531)
Yes.

Janae Daniels (57:44.039)
Yeah. And what do we want?

Ela Richmond (58:00.526)
I could see people who said things and did something different. And so I think having that that inside of your family where everybody's very very aware of what it looks like and what it means and I think one of the best gifts that you can give your kids is Show them what good looks like While they are young so that they have an appetite for it when they are older right and like when when they get older it is inevitable that

Janae Daniels (58:23.603)
That's beautiful. Yeah.

Ela Richmond (58:27.81)
they will stray at some points or like they'll do something else. They'll make choices that you might not have chosen for them in the first place. But like when you have built an appetite for something that is so full and good and you've shown them what it looks like, I think it is much, much, much easier for them to be able to name things. So like when things are going wrong, this is not full. This is not good. This is not my ideal.

And also if you've given them those skills to fix it, which it sounds like you'll have just because they have seen you go on these journeys, they know what to do next. And I think that's so beautiful.

Janae Daniels (59:05.511)
Thank you. And they've watched us flounder too. Like they've watched what not to do as we've screwed up in different ways. And they watched my husband being a workaholic and working all the time and knew that they didn't want that. And they also see now a dad that is more present. And so I wish I could say it, cause it sounds like, we are so great, but it's been a really hard journey and they've watched the good, the bad and the ugly, you know? And now they get to...

Ela Richmond (59:25.336)
Huh?

Janae Daniels (59:33.437)
to see most of the good. Because there's still stuff that we're like, ugh, we are failing at these things. But we're always working on it.

Ela Richmond (59:41.634)
I have two rapid-fire questions for you, but before I get to them, one note on that is I think you'd probably agree with this, but it seems like it is harder to lie to yourself about where you're at and about the parts of your life that are not ideal when you're around your kids always, because let's say that you are a workaholic, like you see it influencing your kids a lot more. Let's say that you're not being patient, or let's say that

Janae Daniels (01:00:04.082)
Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (01:00:10.104)
Like you have these vices inside of yourself. The more that you expose yourself to your kids, the more like you're constantly confronted by them. And so it's like, it's like really easy as a parent to like want to avoid that. But also it is so good to be able to see this mirror of like, wait, like I need to, I need to fix that.

Janae Daniels (01:00:16.413)
Mm-hmm.

Janae Daniels (01:00:28.155)
Yeah, I think it's painful, but it's true. Homeschooling will bring out the worst in you. It also brings out the best, but it will bring out the worst. And so, and you are exactly right. Like there, puts a mirror up to you because you're always with the kids and they, my kids have learned to call me out on stuff, which I don't love, but it's good. It's good for me. And they've also become really opinionated. So there's that, but it's true that.

It causes you to, you can't lie. They see it all. And I think that goes for not just homeschooling parents, just any parents in general. Like our kids, they show us our ugly, but they also show us our beautiful.

Ela Richmond (01:01:11.694)
I love it. All right, my two rapid fire questions. Number one, what is the best resource tool approach that you have learned for subjects that you don't know how to teach yourself that you're not an expert in?

Janae Daniels (01:01:26.291)
I look for alternatives, whether that is going to YouTube or going to like Open Ed because we've utilized Open Ed over the years or realizing, oh, we could do a college, they could do a college class or there's a co-op class that could teach that. Or in a case where I, my kids want to learn French and I found a homeschool lady who was a French tutor who was reasonably priced. And so I'm like, well, I don't speak French and they don't want to do it on YouTube. So we hired a French tutor for.

six months and they loved it. So you just have to get resourceful. look around, I can't say that there's just one place. mean, if you're learning something basic like, I learned how to change the air filter on the car, YouTube is great. But if you need something more extensive like, I wanna learn deeper about American history, well then maybe I look at a university like Hillsdale College or other universities that offer free courses or sometimes paid courses to families.

and then utilize those things. There's a lot of free stuff out there, by the way, from universities that teach online classes that anyone could go to, or places like OpenEd where, yeah, there's all sorts of things that they offer, and I don't have to teach that. Somebody else can. I can just reinforce the learning and talk to them about it, which is great.

Ela Richmond (01:02:47.03)
I love that second question. What is your best advice for homeschool families starting the journey later? Like they didn't expect that they were going to be doing this similar to you. Their kids are older and it's possible that maybe their hearts are not aligned to their parents.

Janae Daniels (01:03:03.429)
My best advice would be that if you're starting to homeschool your teenagers, the very first thing that you have to focus on is the relationship. And that has to come before everything else. That has to come about before you worrying whether or not they finish their physics or whether or not you're worried about them getting into college. You have to focus on getting their heart back. And it is a long process and it's a painful process as a parent. And there's a lot of rejection.

But once you've got that relationship intact, the ability to help them navigate the future is so much easier. I would say it becomes a possibility because if you don't have their heart, I mean, just their future will be, you will not be in it. And so that's the number one thing. And I tell parents that that I talk to a lot that are thinking about homeschooling, like you focus on that relationship first.

Everything else is second to the relationship. And once you've got that strong relationship, then worry about what you're gonna do. If you're gonna do curriculums or if you're gonna be unschoolers or if you're gonna do college or concurrent enrollment or whatever, but get the relationship intact first. And then the second thing is to let them go through the de-schooling process. They don't have as much time, but a lot of the kids that I see the teenagers coming out of the system are exhausted. They're not getting enough sleep. They're emotional wrecks.

And so help them de-school and gain their humanity back and their confidence back and help them work if there's been trauma because of the system, help them work through the trauma, which all goes back into focus on that relationship. So that's what I would say.
