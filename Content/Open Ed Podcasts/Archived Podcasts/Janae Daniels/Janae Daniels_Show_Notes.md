# Janae Daniels: Show Notes

## My First Day of Homeschool Was a Complete Disaster

Janae Daniels, a former public school teacher who was once firmly against homeschooling, shares the incredible story of how a divine prompting and a disastrous first day led her to completely rethink education. She explains why the parent-child relationship must come before academics, how boredom can unlock a child's genius, and what it really takes to homeschool teenagers successfully.
