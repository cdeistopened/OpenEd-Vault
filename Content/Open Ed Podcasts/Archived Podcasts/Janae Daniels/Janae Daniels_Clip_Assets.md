## Clip 2: The Gift of Boredom

*   **Edited Transcript:**
    > **Janae Daniels:** In the beginning, my kids did a lot of sitting around getting bored. And I was really panicky. But boredom leads to brilliance. When they were so bored with nothing to do, that's when my daughter started to read, and my son picked up the guitar. We've overbooked our kids and robbed them of the gift of boredom because that's where genius happens. It also gives them time to reflect. My 18-year-old told me, "Mom, I realized what I liked and didn't like during the hours where I had time to just think. You have blessed me with the gift to think."

She's like, "She wants nothing to do with me. All she cares about is being with her friends. And she says that what I think is stupid. But I guess it's just normal teenage behavior, right?" 
    > 
    > Now, I've learned all of this stuff... and so I handed her the book. I'm like, "You need to read this book and you can get your daughter's heart back." Because the truth is, as Dr. Neufeld says, we cannot parent children whose heart we don't have. She read the book... and I'm happy to report that she was like, "I worked so hard and now I have my daughter's heart. She turns to me when she needs something.
