# Teenage Rebellion is a Myth

And we have the receipts to prove it. PLUS: The high school credential that matters less than ever.

Greetings!

Today we’re diving into our conversation with Janae Daniels, a former public school teacher who stumbled into one of the biggest lies we tell ourselves about raising kids. It turns out “normal teenage behavior” isn’t normal at all. It’s a choice.

Let's dive in.

**THOUGHT**: Teenage Rebellion is a Choice (Yours)
**TREND**: The Useless Credential
**TOOL**: The Attachment Bible

# Teenage Rebellion is a Choice (Yours)

Everyone knows “normal teenage behavior” is a disaster. The eye-rolling, the slammed doors, the obsession with friends over family. We pretend it’s a rite of passage, something to be endured. It’s not. It’s a symptom of a broken attachment model we’ve accepted for generations. We’re shocked when our kids don’t want to be around us, but we’ve spent 16,000 hours outsourcing their upbringing to an institution designed to do exactly that. Of course they’re peer-oriented. We trained them to be. The good news? As Janae discovered, you can get their hearts back. It just requires admitting the “normal” we’ve settled for is anything but.

# The Useless Credential

Janae Daniels’ son has job offers waiting for him. He learned film editing and how to write proposals to NASA while interning for a YouTuber with 4 million subscribers—learning more in a few months than in a semester of college. But society is still panicked that he never finished Algebra 2.

This is, of course, completely insane. The credentialism that props up the traditional high school path is crumbling while the system obsesses over seat time and test scores. The real world is rewarding verifiable skills and demonstrated initiative. The story of Janae’s son isn’t an outlier; it’s a preview.

# The Attachment Bible

So if the parent-child relationship is the foundation, how do you fix it? You start with the source code. The book *Hold On to Your Kids* by Gordon Neufeld and Gabor Maté is less of a parenting guide and more of an operating manual for the human heart. It’s the book Janae handed to her crying friend whose daughter wanted nothing to do with her. It explains, in terrifyingly clear detail, why our kids are turning to their peers for guidance and how to win them back. It’s not easy reading—it’ll put a mirror up to your own parenting—but it’s the essential tool for any parent who refuses to accept a broken relationship as “normal.”

That's all for today!
