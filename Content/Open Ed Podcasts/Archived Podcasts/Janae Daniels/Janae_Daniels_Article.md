# Teenage Rebellion is a Myth (And We Have the Receipts)

*By Ela Richmond*

We have accepted a cultural script that says teenagers will inevitably pull away from their parents. The eye-rolling, the slammed doors, the obsession with friends—it’s just a phase to be endured. But what if that script is wrong? What if teenage rebellion isn’t a biological certainty, but a symptom of a broken system? This is the provocative question at the heart of Janae Daniels’ story, and her answer is a gut punch: “We cannot parent children whose heart we don’t have.”

Janae is not the person you’d expect to deliver this message. She’s not a lifelong, crunchy homeschooler. She was a K-12 licensed public school teacher, a fierce advocate for the system, and now hosts the popular podcast and YouTube channel, [*School to Homeschool*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-g2A33G_3g-eS9A4L6Lw-A). “I believed all the propaganda,” she says. “I knew a couple of homeschoolers in high school and thought they were weird. It was never on my radar.”

Then came COVID. And then, a few weeks later, a moment in church that she can only describe as divine intervention.

“This thought came into my head,” she recalled. “‘I want you to homeschool the kids.’ I thought, ‘hard no.’ Then it came again: ‘It’s taken a pandemic. I want you to homeschool the kids.’”

She went home, cried, and called the three homeschoolers she knew. The next day, shaking, she submitted her notice of intent to the school district. A month later, she held her first day of homeschool for her four children, including a 12- and 13-year-old on the cusp of high school.

It was, in her words, a complete disaster.

“I was still in a public school teacher mindset,” she said. “I had a detailed schedule, tons of expensive curriculums. An hour in, everyone was in tears, including me. My 13-year-old son said, ‘We’re going back to school. Just put us back.’ I was ready to agree.”

And then, a knock at the door. It was the piano tuner.

As Janae let him in, her kids staged a mutiny, abandoning their color-coded schedules and fleeing to the living room. Defeated, Janae followed, expecting to find them glued to a screen. Instead, she found all four of them surrounding the piano tuner, “totally mesmerized, totally enthralled,” as he explained sound frequencies and the geometry of octaves. For two hours, they peppered him with thoughtful, deep questions.

That’s when it hit her. This was learning. Not the forced, sterile compliance she had been trying to replicate, but a genuine fire of curiosity sparked by a real-world expert. “I realized I needed to rethink education,” she said.

## The Attachment Bible

That rethinking led her to the work of Dr. Gordon Neufeld and Gabor Maté, and their seminal book, [*Hold On to Your Kids: Why Parents Need to Matter More Than Peers*](https://www.amazon.com/Hold-Your-Kids-Parents-Matter/dp/0375760288). It was here she found the intellectual framework for what she was feeling intuitively: the modern family structure was broken.

The book’s central thesis is a radical one: for the first time in human history, children are turning to their peers, not their parents, for guidance, identity, and connection. Neufeld calls this “peer-orientation,” and he argues it’s the root cause of everything from bullying and gang culture to the epidemic of teenage anxiety and depression.

Janae breaks it down point by point:

1. **The Natural Order is Parent-Led.** Historically, children were raised in a “village” of multi-generational attachments, with parents and other caring adults as their primary compass point. This is how culture, values, and identity were passed down.

2. **The School System Broke the Model.** The industrial school model, Janae learned, intentionally severed this connection. By separating children from their families for some 16,000 hours during their most formative years, the system created a vacuum. “The more they can separate kids from parents,” she says, citing early school reformers, “the more kids will rely on the government.”

3. **Peers Filled the Void.** Nature abhors a vacuum. With parents largely absent, children turned to the only other people available: each other. The problem, Neufeld argues, is that peers are developmentally incapable of providing the unconditional love, safety, and guidance a child needs. Peer attachment is inherently insecure, based on conformity and performance.

4. **The Result is a Generation Adrift.** A peer-oriented child is a child looking to other lost children for directions. This, Janae realized, was the source of the “normal” teenage behavior she saw everywhere. It wasn’t rebellion; it was a desperate search for belonging in the wrong place.

“It blew me away,” Janae says. “I realized my kids could be attached to me; that’s the natural order.”

## The Gift of Boredom

Armed with this new framework, Janae threw out the curriculum. She kept the basics—math, reading, and writing—and for the next several months, she gave her kids something radical: time. Time to be bored.

At first, she panicked. But then, the magic happened. Her son, once consumed by video games, picked up a guitar and taught himself to play from YouTube. Her eight-year-old learned Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata the same way. Her daughter, who had grown to hate reading in school, started devouring books.

This newfound freedom didn't just reignite their curiosity; it began to subtly mend the parent-child connection that the school schedule had frayed. The gift of time was, in fact, the beginning of getting their hearts back.

## Hacking High School

But what about the future? What about college? What about Algebra 2?

Janae’s story offers a powerful answer to that fear. As her kids entered their high school years, they “hacked” their education. Her son, the one who taught himself guitar, interned with a YouTuber who has 4 million subscribers. At 16, he was writing proposals to NASA and being trusted with a company credit card. “He said he learned more in those months than in a semester of his business class,” Janae said. He now has job offers waiting for him. And Algebra 2? He never finished it. But when it came time for college placement, he tested out of it.

“There’s more than one road to Rome,” Janae says. The goal isn’t to follow a pre-paved path; it’s to figure out which doors you want to keep open for your child and find the most direct way to get there.

Janae’s journey reveals that homeschooling isn’t just about academics; it’s a tool for rebuilding the family. It forced her and her husband to confront their own values, to slow down, and to redefine success. It put a mirror up to their own lives.

It’s a hard path. It requires courage. But as Janae’s story shows, the prize isn’t just a better education. It’s a chance to reclaim something far more fundamental: your child’s heart.

And her story is a chance for the rest of us to realize that the sullen, eye-rolling teenager isn’t a biological inevitability. It’s a symptom. And it’s one we have the power to heal.
