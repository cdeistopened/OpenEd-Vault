# Cold Open for "The #1 Skill That Builds Real Confidence (It's Not What You Think)"

## Cold Open Script

### **Variation 1: The Anxiety Crisis Hook (25 seconds)**

**[COLD OPEN - SINGLE CLIP]**

[00:00:00] **Katie:** "I feel like today we look at our stats on anxiety, Ella, and it just breaks my heart. I just saw that America has fallen off the list of top 20 happiest countries in the world, and it's because of the kids in their teens and twenties—their anxiety is so high that they're not reporting a general sense of happiness and wellbeing. And that's so sad. There's a bunch of reasons, right? People will pin it on screens, social media, et cetera. However, we also know that we've kind of gone through this phase of participation medals and trophies for everything. Unfortunately, when we praise everything, the kids feel that now nothing really matters. When we bubble wrap our kids... it actually makes kids really anxious when people are doing everything for them and when they feel like the world is a very scary place because we have to be kept safe. If you feel like the world is scarier than it actually is, and you feel like you don't really have agency, you don't really have skills to take care of yourself because someone else has always done it for you, you're kind of wandering about the world feeling really anxious because you have no control. And so we've gotta give the kids these skills and this feeling of, 'I can fail. I can burn the biscuits and it's not a huge deal. I could still make better biscuits the next time.' We want our kids to fail when the stakes are really low, before we hand them the car keys and the fully unlocked iPhone..."

### **Variation 2: The Confidence Revelation Hook (20 seconds)**

**[COLD OPEN - SINGLE CLIP]**

[00:00:00] **Ela:** "What is the value of having confidence in life skills for kids?"

[00:00:00] **Katie:** "That was such a pleasant surprise to be honest, because I thought I was just teaching kids to cook for the practical reasons. They'll know how to feed themselves, they'll eat healthier, they can help a little around the house, and that's nice for moms and dads. And then we start working with all these families, right? People are teaching their kids to cook at age three, at age 10. And we'd start hearing stories like, 'Oh, my kid's so proud of themselves. They just feel so confident now.' And I started to realize, I was watching it happen and then later it's been confirmed by a sociologist or a psychologist that I interviewed that we have this one bucket of confidence. When your kids are building skills and competency in the kitchen and that raises their confidence, it actually applies to their academics and their social lives and the way they interact with adults. It's amazing. Pretty quickly within a year I realized, 'Whoa, cooking is more than just food. This is a huge sandbox for teaching kids how to fail, how to really raise those competencies and raise that confidence.'"

### **Variation 3: The Problem-Solution Hook (18 seconds)**

## Cold Open Analysis

### Psychological Hook
This cold open creates a **Problem Identification Hook** by immediately establishing the stakes: America's anxiety crisis among teens and young adults. Katie's emotional delivery ("it just breaks my heart") combined with the shocking statistic creates immediate emotional investment.

### Emotional Escalator
1. **Personal emotion** → "it just breaks my heart"
2. **Societal crisis** → "America has fallen off the list of top 20 happiest countries"
3. **Root cause analysis** → Participation trophies and helicopter parenting
4. **Practical solution** → "We've gotta give the kids these skills"

### The Unfinished Symphony
The cold open ends with a powerful metaphor about teaching kids to use knives and hot stoves before giving them car keys—suggesting the solution but not revealing the specific method. This creates curiosity about how to implement this approach.
