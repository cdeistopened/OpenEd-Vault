"What child is going to have fun learning to read for 60 minutes?"

@savvylearningco's Tony Mickelsen exposed the secret to reading success:

It's not:  
❌ Expensive curricula  
❌ Longer tutoring sessions  
❌ Pushing harder

It's understanding how children actually learn:  
✅ 25 minutes, 4x weekly  
✅ Consistency that builds momentum  
✅ Making it fun enough they want to come back

This "high-dosage" approach is 20X more effective than traditional tutoring.

Your child's reading struggles might not be about ability—they might be about approach.

Tony Mickelsen from Savvy Learning reveals why traditional 60-minute tutoring sessions are setting kids up to fail.

"What child is going to have fun learning to read for 60 minutes? That's tough for me as an adult, let alone for the little kids."

The solution? High-dosage tutoring: 25 minutes, 4 times weekly. Research shows it's 20X more effective because it works WITH children's natural attention spans, not against them.

When kids remain engaged throughout the entire session, every minute becomes productive. Even better: "They are hyped. They are having so much fun that they want to come back for the next session."

66% of American children struggle with reading, and 70% of them never catch up. But what if there was a solution that's 20x more effective than traditional methods?

Tony Mickelsen of @savvy-education-inc explains how their high-dosage tutoring approach transforms reading education through shorter, more frequent sessions that work with—not against—children's natural attention spans.

"What child is going to have fun learning to read for 60 minutes?" Mickelsen asks.

The secret to reading success isn't what most people think. It's not expensive curricula, longer sessions, or pushing harder. It's understanding how children actually learn: shorter, frequent sessions that build momentum and make learning enjoyable.

Parents asking: "Is my child on grade level with reading?"

Better question: "Is my child making consistent progress with reading?"

The grade-level obsession misses what matters most: progress.

If your kindergartener isn't reading yet, that's okay!
If your 8-year-old is behind, that's okay too!

What's important is that they're making consistent, measurable progress.

And if they're not? That's when high-dosage tutoring makes all the difference.

# **LinkedIn Post: The Reading Crisis Solution**

```Plain


The reading crisis no one's talking about (and the 25-minute solution that's changing everything)

📊 ALARMING STATS:
- 66% of American children are behind on reading
- 70% of those children never catch up
- Half of U.S. adults read below a 6th-grade level

But here's what's truly shocking: We've known the solution for years, yet most parents have never heard of it.

The WRONG approach:
Traditional tutoring - 60-minute sessions, once weekly

✅ The RIGHT approach:
High-dosage tutoring - 25-minute sessions, four times weekly

The research is clear: high-dosage tutoring is 20X more effective than traditional approaches. Why?

1️⃣ It works WITH children's attention spans, not against them
2️⃣ It builds momentum through consistent frequency
3️⃣ It keeps sessions short enough to maintain engagement
4️⃣ It creates enthusiasm to continue learning

I recently spoke with Tony Mickelsen, CMO at Savvy Learning (@savvy-education-inc), on the OpenEd podcast about this revolutionary approach.

"What child is going to have fun learning to read for 60 minutes?" Tony asked. "That's tough for me as an adult, let alone for the little kids."

The solution seems obvious in retrospect: shorter, more frequent sessions that match children's natural learning rhythms.

But what's truly revolutionary is that Savvy Learning is bringing this research-backed approach directly to parents. No waiting for school districts to implement it. No bureaucratic delays. Just immediate access to what actually works.

For decades, we've watched reading scores decline while repeating the same ineffective interventions. Isn't it time we tried something different?

If you're a parent concerned about your child's reading progress (or know someone who is), I'd encourage you to check out their free assessment: [link]

🔑 The key insight: What presents as behavior problems is often frustration from reading struggles. Address the reading, and you often solve the behavior.

New Article: "The Reading Crisis No One's Talking About: 5 Myths That Keep Children Struggling"

With 66% of American children behind on reading—and 70% never catching up—we need to examine why traditional interventions continue to fail.

Our latest piece, featuring insights from Tony Mickelsen of @savvy-education-inc, debunks common misconceptions that keep parents from finding effective solutions:

- The belief that some children "just aren't readers"  
    • The assumption that longer sessions equal better results  
    • The harmful link between reading struggles and intelligence  
    • The "wait and see" approach that lets gaps widen  
    • The idea that tutoring is only for severely struggling students

Key takeaway: High-dosage tutoring (shorter, more frequent sessions) proves 20X more effective than traditional approaches. This isn't just a marginal improvement—it's a complete paradigm shift in how we approach reading intervention.

For parents, educators, and anyone concerned about literacy in America, this article offers both sobering statistics and genuine hope.

# **The Reading Crisis No One's Talking About: 5 Myths That Keep Children Struggling**

Around 66% of children in the U.S. are behind on reading. 70% of those never catch up. About half of American adults read below a sixth-grade level.

When Tony Mickelsen, Chief Marketing Officer at Savvy Learning, shared these statistics during a recent OpenEd podcast conversation with host Andrea Fife, they landed like a gut punch. Not because they're new—educational researchers have been tracking this decline for decades—but because our response to this crisis has been so inadequate.

We've been treating a national emergency with band-aids and wishful thinking.

While the education establishment debates policy and curricula, millions of children continue falling behind in this fundamental skill. What's especially troubling is how many misconceptions persist about reading struggles—myths that keep parents from finding effective solutions for their children.

Let's examine the five most harmful myths about reading struggles, and what Tony Mickelsen and the evidence tell us instead.

## **Myth #1: "Some kids just aren't natural readers."**

This common refrain suggests that reading ability is primarily innate—some children are "born readers" while others simply aren't wired that way. This belief often leads to lowered expectations and premature surrender when challenges arise.

**The truth:** Reading is a skill, not an inherent talent. While children learn at different paces, virtually all neurotypical children can become proficient readers with appropriate instruction.

During the podcast, Mickelsen emphasized that Savvy Learning's approach is effective for all types of learners: "No matter whether it's a struggling reader, or it's a homeschool student who, you know, mom is busy with five other kids and can't quite be as consistent as she would like on the reading instruction, or, you know, it's a child who's actually accelerated and needs to be challenged in a way that a public school classroom cannot challenge them."

The key insight is that reading challenges typically stem from inadequate or mismatched instruction, not from some immutable limitation in the child. When we believe a child "just isn't a reader," we may unintentionally communicate lower expectations, provide fewer reading opportunities, or give up on interventions too quickly.

## **Myth #2: "More time in one session equals more learning."**

The conventional tutoring model typically involves hour-long sessions once or twice a week. This approach persists largely because of tradition and logistical convenience for adults, not because it's optimal for children's learning.

**The truth:** Shorter, more frequent sessions work dramatically better than longer, less frequent ones—especially for struggling readers.

Mickelsen was unequivocal on this point: "Our format for high-dose tutoring is four days a week, Monday through Thursday, 25 minutes per day. Well, for children who have short attention spans, this makes a lot more sense because what child is going to have fun while learning to read or do math for 60 minutes? It's really tough. That's tough for me as an adult, let alone for the little kids."

This isn't just theoretical. Mickelsen cited research showing that "high-dose tutoring is 20 times more effective than standard tutoring." The key difference? Breaking down that hour or two of weekly tutoring into shorter, more frequent sessions.

The high-dosage approach ensures that every minute is productive by keeping sessions brief enough to maintain engagement throughout. The more frequent schedule also creates momentum and minimizes forgetting between sessions.

Mickelsen explains the results they observe: "The kids at the end of a session with Savvy, they are hyped. They are having so much fun that they want to come back for the next session."

## **Myth #3: "Reading struggles mean lower intelligence."**

Perhaps the most harmful myth is the implicit (and sometimes explicit) association between reading difficulties and overall intelligence. This false correlation causes unnecessary shame and can permanently damage a child's academic self-concept.

**The truth:** Reading challenges have no correlation with overall intelligence or potential.

When children struggle with this fundamental skill, they often feel inherently deficient in ways that extend far beyond reading itself. What makes this particularly insidious is how reading difficulties tend to mask themselves as other problems.

What presents as behavioral issues or social difficulties often has reading struggles as the root cause. Mickelsen has heard this story repeatedly from parents who find Savvy Learning: "The improvement we've made on reading has improved my relationship with my daughter so much. Because now I'm not nagging her so much about the whole reading thing."

What looked like a behavioral issue or a relationship problem was actually a reading issue all along.

Around fourth grade, education shifts from "learning to read" to "reading to learn." Students who haven't mastered basic literacy by this transition point suddenly find themselves unable to access the curriculum across all subjects.

The crucial insight is that reading difficulties don't indicate lower intelligence—they simply create barriers to demonstrating and developing intelligence through traditional educational pathways.

## **Myth #4: "Tutoring is only for kids who are way behind."**

Many parents view tutoring as a last resort—something to consider only when a child is significantly behind grade level or failing in school.

**The truth:** Reading support benefits children at all levels, from those who are struggling to those who are already on track.

Mickelsen explained that Savvy's high-dosage tutoring works for various situations, not just for children who are significantly behind: "We just meet the child where they're at on their reading or math journey. We assess them, we have years worth of content, and we plug them into the reading or math level where they're at. And from there, the high dosage tutoring thing propels them forward."

The key is providing the right level of support and challenge for each individual child. For students who are behind, appropriate tutoring can help them catch up. For students at grade level, it can help them develop deeper comprehension and greater reading fluency. For advanced readers, it can provide the appropriate level of challenge that might be missing in a regular classroom.

## **Myth #5: "My child will catch up naturally over time."**

Perhaps the most dangerous myth is the belief that reading difficulties will resolve themselves with time and normal development. This "wait and see" approach remains surprisingly common advice, even from some educators.

**The truth:** Without appropriate intervention, reading gaps typically widen rather than narrow over time.

The statistics Mickelsen shared are unequivocal—most children who fall behind in reading never catch up without specific intervention: "66% of children in the US are behind on reading, that 70% of those never catch up, and that about half of adults in the US read below a sixth grade level."

What begins as a small gap in early elementary school can grow into a chasm by middle school as the curriculum shifts from "learning to read" to "reading to learn."

This is why early intervention is so crucial. While it's never too late to improve reading skills, addressing difficulties in the early years is significantly more efficient and effective than remediation in later years.

## **Breaking the Access Barrier**

For decades, evidence-based reading interventions remained largely inaccessible to individual families. High-dosage tutoring existed primarily within institutional settings—if you were lucky enough to attend a school that offered it.

"As far as I know, we are the only online high-dose tutoring option for kids that sells directly to parents," Mickelsen explained. "This type of product is usually only made available to school districts. And through that, it gets to the children."

This institutional gatekeeping created a profound equity issue. Parents who recognized their children's reading struggles had few options beyond the traditional, ineffective tutoring model.

By making high-dosage tutoring directly available to families, Savvy Learning is democratizing access to what actually works. No waiting for school districts to adopt new programs. No navigating bureaucratic approval processes. Just immediate access to evidence-based intervention.

## **The Parental Involvement Factor**

Another critical advantage of direct-to-parent tutoring is the involvement it facilitates. When tutoring happens through schools, parents often remain largely uninformed about the process, content, and progress.

"When you have high-dose tutoring that is happening through school districts, the parents are not completely left out of the loop, [but] largely left out of the loop because it's happening at school," Mickelsen noted.

By contrast, home-based online tutoring enables parents to stay fully informed and engaged. They can observe sessions, communicate directly with tutors, and reinforce concepts between sessions.

This creates what Mickelsen calls "magic"—the perfect conditions for accelerated progress. "I think there's magic that happens when an educator, in this case a tutor, and the student, and the parent or guardian are all working together. They're all thinking in the same direction to help the student make progress."

## **A Crisis With a Solution**

The reading crisis in America is real, severe, and far-reaching. Two-thirds of our children struggle with reading, and most never catch up without targeted intervention. The consequences ripple through their academic careers, social development, emotional well-being, and eventual professional opportunities.

But unlike many societal problems that seem intractable, this one has a clear, evidence-based solution. High-dosage tutoring—providing shorter, more frequent sessions that work with children's developmental needs rather than against them—is provably effective at closing reading gaps.

The barrier has never been knowing what works. The barrier has been accessing what works.

As direct-to-parent services like Savvy Learning continue to expand, that barrier is finally coming down. Parents no longer need to wait for institutional change. They can access research-backed interventions immediately.

"I invite everyone to go to the website and create an account, get that assessment done. It doesn't take a long time," Mickelsen suggests. "Sit down with your child. We will then know where they're at on reading or math."

The 66% statistic is daunting. But it doesn't have to define your child's future.

🍎 Why reading is the foundation of civilization itself

🍎 The hidden method that's 20X more effective than traditional tutoring

🍎 Three tools that actually help kids read better

### 💡 1 THOUGHT

## **READING IS CONNECTED TO EVERYTHING**

"Reading is connected to everything. It's the foundation of civilization."

Andrea Fife made this observation during our recent podcast about the reading crisis, and it cuts to the heart of why 69% of kids struggling with reading is more than an education problem—it's a civilization problem.

When children can't access the written word, it impacts everything: social confidence, future career options, self-esteem, family relationships.

What presents as behavior problems is often reading frustration in disguise. One parent told Savvy Learning: "The improvement we've made on reading has improved my relationship with my daughter so much."

If you can read, you can learn anything. If you can't, every door begins to close.

**[Watch Andrea explain why reading impacts everything →](https://claude.ai/chat/link)**

### 📊 2 TRENDS

**1. THE MICRO-TUTORING SHIFT**

A new approach to reading intervention is gaining ground: high-dosage tutoring with 25-minute sessions, four times weekly. Early research suggests it's significantly more effective than traditional hour-long sessions.

"What child is going to have fun learning to read for 60 minutes?" Tony Mickelsen from Savvy Learning points out. The method works with children's natural attention spans rather than against them.

**2. READING SCORES CONTINUE DECLINE**

The latest [2024 NAEP data](https://ignite-reading.com/insights/naep-reading-test-results/) shows 69% of 4th graders reading below proficiency levels. This continues a troubling trend that predates COVID, suggesting systemic issues with how we teach reading fundamentals.

### 📊 Quick poll: What's your biggest concern about your child's reading?

Reading isn't just a school subject—it's the key that unlocks everything else. Make sure your child has it.

### 💡 THOUGHT

## **THE 60-MINUTE MISTAKE**

"What child is going to have fun learning to read for 60 minutes?"

Tony Mickelsen, CMO of Savvy Learning, dropped this simple question that exposes everything wrong with traditional tutoring.

**[Watch Tony explain the 25-minute solution →](embedded clip)**

Here's the uncomfortable truth: 66% of children in the US are behind on reading. 70% of those never catch up. Half of adults read below a sixth-grade level.

We've been treating this crisis with the same failed approach for decades: hour-long tutoring sessions that exhaust children and produce minimal results.

The solution? Do the opposite.

"High-dose tutoring is 20 times more effective than standard tutoring," Mickelsen explains. The secret: 25-minute sessions, four times weekly.

Children stay engaged. Progress accelerates. "The kids at the end of a session with Savvy, they are hyped. They are having so much fun that they want to come back."

We've been forcing marathons when children need sprints.

### 📊 TREND

## **THE READING CRISIS HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT**

A national crisis is unfolding in classrooms and homes across America, yet most parents don't realize how widespread it is.

The statistics paint a sobering picture:

- 66% of American children are behind on reading
- 70% of those children never catch up
- Half of U.S. adults read below a sixth-grade level

This isn't just an educational challenge—it's a societal emergency that affects everything from career prospects to civic engagement.

What's driving this trend? Several factors converge:

**The COVID learning loss:** Remote learning widened existing gaps, with reading skills suffering the most.

**Outdated intervention methods:** Schools still rely on traditional tutoring models proven ineffective decades ago.

**The fourth-grade cliff:** Around grade 4, education shifts from "learning to read" to "reading to learn." Children who haven't mastered basics by then fall further behind each year.

But there's hope. High-dosage tutoring—shorter, more frequent sessions—is showing 20X better results than traditional approaches. Parents are increasingly bypassing institutional gatekeepers to access evidence-based solutions directly.

That's all for today!

Two-thirds of children struggle with reading. But it doesn't have to be your child.

– Charlie (the OpenEd newsletter guy)

P.S. What looks like a behavior problem is often a reading problem in disguise. One parent told Savvy: "The improvement we've made on reading has improved my relationship with my daughter so much."

**[COLD OPEN - 23:50 to 24:15]**

```Plain
"The research continues to come out. There's a study done recently that shows high dosage tutoring is 20 times more effective than standard tutoring. That's dramatic. And what I can tell you is what I've observed - the kids at the end of a session, they are hyped. They are having so much fun that they want to come back for the next session. And no matter whether it's a struggling reader or a homeschool student whose mom is busy with five other kids..."
```

## **Alternative Strong Options:**

**Statistics Hook [04:45 to 05:15]**

```Plain
"Studies show that around 66% of children in the US are behind on reading, that 70% of those never catch up, and that about half of adults in the US read below a sixth grade level. When I first learned those statistics, it felt like a gut punch. We're talking about what is, in a way, a reading crisis or a literacy crisis in America..."
```

**Universal Truth Hook [17:45 to 18:15]**

```Plain
"Reading is connected to everything. Reading and language connects our world, and the ability to read is the ability to interact, to not just always have to say it out loud. It's just the foundation of civilization - the ability to exchange information via the written world. When you struggle to do that foundational skill that the world is built on, I can't see how it wouldn't impact you socially..."
```

The **first option** (high dosage tutoring) works best because it:

- Starts with surprising research (20x more effective)
- Has emotional payoff (kids are "hyped")
- Applies to multiple audience segments
- Creates curiosity about what this method actually is
- Has natural energy in the delivery
