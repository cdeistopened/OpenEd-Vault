# Baking Up Open Education: How Baketivity Stirs Learning Into Every Kit

Remember when we used to pass notes in class or play make-believe in the backyard? Those were the good old days of childhood learning! But in today's world, kids are finding new ways to learn and have fun. At Baketivity, we're mixing up education with a generous helping of fun, right in your kitchen.

Meet Daniella Park, our head baker at Baketivity. At sixteen, Daniella was struggling with severe dyslexia in a traditional school setting. Fast forward to today, and she's the creative force behind our recipe kits, proving that learning comes in many flavors.

"Baking is like the perfect classroom for your brain," Daniella says. "It ignites all five senses, making learning stick better than any textbook ever could."

So, what's the secret ingredient in our Baketivity boxes? It's not just about measuring flour or cracking eggs. We're baking in math, science, reading, and problem-solving skills with every recipe. And the best part? Kids are having so much fun, they don't even realize they're learning!

But what exactly is open education, and how does it fit into our kitchen classroom? Open education is all about breaking free from the one-size-fits-all approach. It's about giving kids the freedom to learn in ways that work best for them. And that's exactly what we do at Baketivity. Whether your child is a visual learner who loves to watch dough rise, or a hands-on learner who can't wait to get their fingers messy, our kits cater to all learning styles.

Take our monthly subscription boxes, for example. Each one is like a treasure chest of learning opportunities. Pre-measured ingredients mean less fuss and more focus on the fun stuff. And our step-by-step instructions? They're not just about baking – they're building reading comprehension and following directions. When kids measure out 1/3 cup of sugar, they're not just sweetening their cookies – they're getting a tasty lesson in fractions!

But here's the real cherry on top: Baketivity isn't just about following recipes. We encourage kids to experiment, to make mistakes, and to learn from them. Remember when you accidentally used salt instead of sugar in your first batch of cookies? Those are the moments where real learning happens. As Daniella always says, "Now's the time to make mistakes. I'm here to teach you how to troubleshoot." This problem-solving mindset is a key ingredient in open education – and in life!
