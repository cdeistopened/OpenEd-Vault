1. Ask them, **"What do YOU want to learn?"**

Transcript:

So, when a child feels frustrated, oftentimes, not always, it means that they feel like they're being forced into something or trapped or don't have options or don't have a voice. So, step back and, and if I were meeting with that oldest and, and again, depending on their needs and interests, say, you know what, you design your education plan, you tell me what it is you're, you want to learn over the next week or month, and let's see what resources we have to feed that interest.

And not have it be a parent driven education plan, have it be a child driven education, a learner driven experience.

  

1. What if learning wasn’t time-slotted?

Transcript:

you want to let learning be fluid. If they're interested in something for a few minutes, let them dive deep into that. If they want to dive deep into that for 10 hours, let them do it. And postpone what you had planned for something else. Uh, so that you have this idea that, that learning is natural, and it's not a time slotted experience.

It might contradict a little bit, at least do 20 minutes of math, reading English of writing every day. I think those three R's are essential. The other thing then we see with families is after you do reading, writing, arithmetic, and you have recess and break and chores, it's now lunchtime. So get some lunch together.

  

1. The Biggest Fear Every Parent Faces

are my kids going to be fail failures for life? That is every parent's fear. Are my choices, my decisions, my parenting style going to wreck my kids for life. And I, I know that feeling very well of. Are we giving them too much choice? Are we giving them too little choice? Are they going to turn out crazy or weird or dependent or, you know, just not successful?

And you just worried about that as a parent. And so that's the biggest thing is that parents just worry that their children will choose wrong or that the

  

1. More freedom. Less stress. Better learning.

You're not doing your homework. Oh, what do you have to do tomorrow? I have a test tomorrow. Why aren't you studying?

All that conflict is gone when you're in open education mindset, because you do your schooling during the productive hours of the day, and then you have dinner and then you play games at night, you spend time together as a family, like, that's some rich opportunities. You're not all exhausted and fighting over homework at night.

That's. A day in the life of

one of the points that I love that you've made in the past is that there was a point at which you looked at your children and You know, how much time do I have to help them learn, right? And you realize that there was a lot of time in the day for them to learn, and only a third of that was being done in school.

- Ask them, "What do YOU want to learn?"
    
    What if frustration in learning isn’t about laziness—but about **lack of choice?** 🤔
    
    Many kids feel stuck, forced into a system that doesn’t fit them. But what if we flipped the script? Instead of a **parent-driven education plan**, imagine a **child-driven experience**—where kids design their own learning journey.
    
    📚 One question changes everything: **“What do YOU want to learn?”**
    
    By shifting from control to collaboration, we empower kids to take ownership of their education.
    
    Because when children have a say in their learning, they don’t just study. **They thrive.** 🚀

- What if learning wasn’t time-slotted?
    
    What if learning wasn’t about rigid schedules—but about **flow?** 🌊
    
    Some kids explore a topic for five minutes and move on. Others dive deep for **10 hours.** And that’s okay. **Learning is natural, not time-slotted.**
    
    Of course, a little structure helps—20 minutes a day on the essentials: reading, writing, and math. But after that? **Follow their curiosity.**
    
    Because real education isn’t about ticking boxes. It’s about **nurturing a lifelong love of learning.** 🚀

- The Biggest Fear Every Parent Faces
    
    _"Am I failing my kids?"_ 😰
    
    Every parent asks this at some point.
    
    - Am I giving them **too much** freedom?
    - Am I being **too strict**?
    - Will they be **successful**—or struggle?
    
    The truth? **Every parent worries.** But kids don’t need perfect parenting—they need **support, trust, and the space to grow.**
    
    Yes, they’ll make mistakes. Yes, they’ll make choices you don’t love. But that’s how they learn.
    
    You’re not failing them. **You’re guiding them.** And that’s what truly matters. 💛

    _"Did you do your homework?"_
    
    _"You have a test tomorrow—why aren’t you studying?"_
    
    Sound familiar? 😩
    
    Now imagine a life **without** those nightly homework battles. A life where learning happens during the **most productive hours of the day**—so evenings are for **family, games, and connection.**
    
    That’s the power of **open education.** When kids learn in a way that fits their rhythm, stress levels drop, and learning becomes **a natural part of life.**
    
    Because here’s the truth: **Most of a child’s learning happens outside of school hours.** So why not make those hours **work for them—rather than against them?**

## Transcript

Ela Richmond (00:07.874)  
All right, we're rolling. Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm your sometimes host, Ella, and today I'm joined by Matt. Thank you so much for being here. This is a lot of fun. I know that your usual host is Isaac, but this will be a lot of fun.

Matt Bowman (00:08.133)  
shit!

Matt Bowman (00:15.311)  
In the name of Jesus Christ.

Matt Bowman (00:21.734)  
I'm excited to be with you, Ella, today. It's fun working with you.

Ela Richmond (00:24.832)  
Thank you. Okay, so I want to dive into this very awesome conversation by starting with the fact that I've been reading the Open Ed book. So shout out to you and Isaac that is coming out very, very soon, where you'll talk about everything from open education, how to do it, and you really, I guess, sit into the belief that every child is unique.

right, that there is no such thing as standardized learning, that there's no such thing as a standard student. When did you first recognize that as a principal and how have you seen that be so true in your life from then?

Matt Bowman (01:03.828)  
Yes, I've got to go back. My wife was the one that first coined this, the sentence, the phrase in one of our conversations, she said, our children are not standard. In one of a conversation with a state office person talking about standardized education. And that has just rung true for decades now. We have five children of our own. All of them are married now. And so with the 10 adult, you know, children and their spouses together.

Everyone is unique and it's been fun to see from, you know, you asked when did that start? Probably when we had our fifth child and she started growing up and we would see that Amy and I, my wife, we had the same culture and habits and patterns and cadences in our family. And so we thought all five would pretty much be the same because we were raising them the same. And lo and behold,

All five were different. They all had different needs, different interests, different passions, different concerns, different challenges. And Amy and I turned to each other and said, wow, if the five children in the Matt and Amy Bowman home are this different and need something different for their education plan every year, how does one system serve every child the same? And that was really when the light bulbs started going on of

How do we personalize education for every child? It was really just looking at our own five children and realizing they needed each something different for their education option that year. It was really fun.

Ela Richmond (02:43.042)  
incredible and so we're gonna get into a Q &A go into deep into the weeds of open education and how to do it and the questions that parents are asking here in a second but first because I know that people are super excited for this book and this book launch can you give kind of a teaser of what to expect in the book whenever it comes out

Matt Bowman (03:01.822)  
Sure. The key premise again is every child's different and that makes every family and every parent decision different. So it's not a prescriptive roadmap on what everyone should do because there's no answer to that. In fact, it's the opposite. It provides a mindset, a framework that parents can think about and adapt to their own children and their own family's needs. things like helping...

discover what your child is interested in. You know, that's a hard thing to do. Children might be interested in one thing for an hour or a day or a week or a month or a year, and that's okay. It's uncovering, discovering those things that your children are interested in. And we provide some activities and resources in the book that help parents to help their children discover what they're interested in.

We then identify, you know, what are some of the needs that the children have, the family have, the community have, and kind of, and then what resources are available. That's one of my favorite kind of trifecta. Look at the interests of the children. What are the needs of the family and community? And what are the resources available in the family and community? And bring those three together and you can really create something special when all three of those things are aligned.

Ela Richmond (04:21.068)  
I love that. Out of curiosity, is that something that you learned, like that process, like that trifecta, is that something you learned over time or how did you stumble upon that?

Matt Bowman (04:29.876)  
Yeah, definitely learned over time many mistakes and errors along the way trying to figure that out. But it's really, it's a simple principle in, you know, at face value of just look at your, it's a needs resource analysis and trying to figure out what it is that families need to be successful. And you apply that then to children and families. And it really just elevates this idea that let's just start with what we need.

And what are we interested in and what resources do we have to build those things together? And when you apply that to an education mindset, it unlocks so much curiosity and creativity and motivation naturally that you don't have to force learning. Learning becomes natural and authentic and long lasting because it intersects along those needs and interests.

Ela Richmond (05:20.876)  
That's big. I might come back to this if we get through all of our questions, but this is a good segue into our first question. So we traversed the world of Reddit to understand what parents are asking about open education, homeschool education, everything else. And I'm about to throw those at you, Matt, to hear your thoughts and recommendations for parents, because these are questions that a lot of parents inside of OpenEd, outside of OpenEd are asking. So question one, let's do it.

Matt Bowman (05:48.03)  
Okay, let's do it.

Ela Richmond (05:50.586)  
question one is a parent asking, I'm overwhelmed trying to homeschool multiple kids at different levels. Some love it, some hate it. My oldest especially fights me on everything. What can I do?

Matt Bowman (06:06.462)  
First, recognize you're not alone. That's a common emotion of any parent. Again, at Open Ed, we blur the lines of what homeschooling needs from, you know, private, micro, co-ops, homeschool, unschool, hybrid schooling, all that jumbles together really. But if you're trying to do independent homeschooling and you're, it's very normal to feel overwhelmed with multiple children.

have different needs and, and interests, right? Just like we were talking about with every child being unique. So if I were to be chatting with, and I've chatted with parents for 15, 20 years about this topic and a common, a common answer collectively over all those years and all those parents is first step is just take a moment, take a breath, stop for a minute and, and just realize that.

you might need to just scale back a little bit for a time. Just reset a little bit. Maybe if you're overwhelmed, your kids are gonna be feeling overwhelmed. So probably my first suggestion would be take a break. Take a little time where you reduce whatever you're doing by 50%. Just cut in half, whatever you're doing so that you can breathe a little bit. If you're still overwhelmed at 50%,

cut it another 50 % and just get to a point where you don't feel overwhelmed. There's tons of research out there that says digital curriculum, if kids are doing 20 minutes of math, 20 minutes of reading, 20 minutes of writing a day, that's sufficient. So maybe just start with that and insert in between each of those 20 minute blocks a one hour recess. And what I mean by that is, you know,

Ela Richmond (07:52.13)  
Mm.

Matt Bowman (08:03.91)  
Have your nine year old come in and read for read for 20 minutes and go out and play for an hour or go do Legos for an hour or go build something for an hour or go run around the house for an hour. Just become exhausted because the next step then another 20 minutes of math. You need an exhausted body to then have your mind be open to learning math for 20 minutes and then go do it again for an hour and then come back and write for 20 minutes and and.

and then call that a day and go explore the park, go explore a mountain nearby, go explore the city nearby, go explore something out there together, and then come back and say, what did we learn when we were out there together doing stuff? And let that be a learning experience in and of itself. Then once you've done that for a day or three days or a week or a month, then say, you know what, what else can we add to this structure?

Ela Richmond (08:51.851)  
Hmm.

Matt Bowman (09:01.426)  
around the interests of each child. So, you know, this parent mentioned the oldest fights on everything. There's a part in our book where we say, give your child a voice. So when a child feels frustrated, oftentimes, not always, it means that they feel like they're being forced into something or trapped or don't have options or don't have a voice. So step back and if I were meeting with that oldest and again, depending on their needs and interests, say,

You know what? You design your education plan. You tell me what it is you want to learn over the next week or month, and let's see what resources we have to feed that interest and not have it be a parent-driven education plan, have it be a child-driven education, a learner-driven experience. And maybe just couch it in a two-week sprint. Those are other things we talk about in the book is sometimes we get overwhelmed with what's the year-long plan or what are we going to do for life?

Just break it down into two weeks. Hey, Johnny, what do you want to do for the next two weeks? What do you want to learn about? Feed that interest, see where it goes, have Johnny present after two weeks what it is he learned, and then go from there and do another two week sprint or do another one day sprint. Whatever, just don't get overwhelmed by trying to do too much too fast too long and burn everybody out.

And also acknowledge when you give a child a voice, they might choose something that you're not not comfortable with. For example, maybe the oldest wants to go back to their boundary district school and you just have to say, OK, I respect you as a child, as a human. I'm going to say, OK, I'm going to give up my homeschooling passion and desire for that one child who wants to go to their boundary district school or a nearby charter school. It's free.

they find their way, they carpool with friends or take a bus or whatever, then you're acknowledging that child has a voice in their education. And sooner or later that anger, that frustration, that fight is going to be deflated because they're going to be the ones in charge of their own education.

Ela Richmond (11:11.518)  
Interesting. I think as a part of your story, I remember you saying and sharing that there was a point at which all five of your kids were going to a different school.

Matt Bowman (11:20.542)  
Four of the five, yeah, two were going to the same and then the other three were going to different schools. So was four different public schools.

Ela Richmond (11:26.946)  
Oh my goodness. why let them make that decision, right? Why is it so important to allow your kids to have a say in their education? And I guess as a secondary question there, in your experience doing open education and working with open ed parents, what is the hesitation usually whenever it comes to parents doing that and allowing their kids to have that much say?

Matt Bowman (11:51.572)  
So the first part of your question is how do we embrace, given our children a voice, it's recognizing them as a human. And yes, I recognize that under 18, they need some guidance and support and structure. So I'm not saying just let the kid do anything and have no adult guidance in that conversation. But there's definitely a part where you can present one or two, three options.

Let the child choose between those, see what the family can absorb if it's impossible to carpool to four different schools. That's a resource you don't have, so that's not an option on the table. So you present narrow choices if needed to a child to say what feels right for you, what can we do, what are the interests you have there? And the reason is because learning can't be forced. I really believe that lasting learning

Only sinks into a brain or a child when they're they have some sort of interest or agency around that. If it's compelled and forced, it might go in and come out on a test and go out the ear the next day. So it's not going to last. So no matter how much you force and can demonstrate knowledge is being regurgitated on a test, that doesn't mean the child has learned anything. learning comes from opting into the learning experience.

Ela Richmond (13:10.466)  
.

Matt Bowman (13:15.604)  
And that requires a voice and that requires some choice available to a child and really just respect their humaneness to be able to do that. And I think that's a really powerful, a powerful thing. Again, it's not unlimited choice to a eight year old. It's here are some choices that our family can make available to you, which one sounds like something you'd want to try or do and, then be comfortable. You have to figure out the right balance of how long do they need to give it before they give up on it.

and need to switch. That's an impossible thing to say for every child. But there's some flexibility there. If it's absolutely miserable and not working, don't just force it for the principle of you chose it, you have to live with it. Allow for some latitude. We talk in the book about love, limits, and latitude. You gotta have balance of all three of those. You love them, you put some limits, but you also have latitude. It's a nice little trifecta, again, of

how to help children feel like they have some decision making in their life. And that really helps them be successful. So the second part of your question around what do we see parents hesitate around that is really this cultural pressure of, my kids gonna be failures for life? That is every parent's fear. Are my choices, my decisions, my parenting style gonna wreck my kids for life?

And I know that feeling very well of, we giving them too much choice? Are we giving them too little choice? Are they going to turn out crazy or weird or dependent or just not successful? And you just worried about that as a parent. And so that's the biggest thing is that parents just worry that their children will choose wrong or that they'll approve something that they shouldn't have done. And it's easier than just to do the status quo.

because no grandma at Thanksgiving dinner is going to judge you for making that decision if you just send them to the local public school. Like no one's, maybe some will fault you for that, but the majority of culture will just say, well you did what you, what everyone else did. So it was just the child's fault. They turned out, you know, unsuccessful, but you worry about that as a, as a parent. And so if you can get over the critique of others,

Matt Bowman (15:39.76)  
and just let go of that fear of only doing what everyone else is doing and really focusing on your child's needs, your needs as a family, it can unlock opportunities that you never knew were there. Because right now, the default just send them to a boundary district school is changing. We're seeing that in this open education world. People are now saying, actually,

to many of our families in our program, I wish I could do that. And whereas 10 years ago it was, why are you doing that? And that's changing now. And it's like, well, how can you do that? Well, there's some steps you can take and you can take little baby steps to get there. You don't have to go all in all at once. And we could talk about that too, of, you know, back to the overwhelmed conversation, maybe just do part-time homeschooling, send your child.

for half the day or Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Tuesday, Thursday, they're at home or take a week on a week off. Again, schools don't love that model, but you do what's right for your kid, for your family and let them realize that they have flexibility and that can decrease that feeling of being overwhelmed.

Ela Richmond (16:54.486)  
I love that. And I love your emphasis on, you know, the whenever people are looking at all their options and they don't even know that some exist, right? You don't know that you can choose to part time school your kid or that you can see and understand the gaps and then fill them in. Take us back to your home and or the home life of a successful parent that that does educate multiple children at the same time. What does a day in the life look like? Like

Matt Bowman (17:03.828)  
Frank.

Ela Richmond (17:22.976)  
when it's done successfully. Of course, it's not all the same and it looks very different, but if you were to paint it out, and especially for your own family, what did that look like?

Matt Bowman (17:33.854)  
So first of all, I would not declare that we were successful parents, right? We feel like we have some great adult children, but don't want to sound like we think we knew it all and did it all. That's definitely not what Amy nor I feel. We just did our best and our children are who they are. And they're just amazing adults now. We love them. But I don't want to give the impression that we're some experts on the stage dispensing knowledge to others.

Ela Richmond (17:45.047)  
Mm-hmm.

Matt Bowman (18:03.284)  
But what I can say is what I've seen from other parents and families that we've worked with for years is kind of like I was saying before is just start off with what are the needs of the household? And so a lot of families I've chatted with over the years say, know what? There's chores that need to be done as we're all living in this household. And that's part of the education plan is everybody has responsibilities in the home.

We had a job chart that every child had their jobs that they need to do around the house from taking out the garbage, unloading dishwasher, dusting, vacuuming, cleaning the bathrooms. So every household has those needs. So I definitely would just start with that. Is every household has that? Come up with a rotation or a job chart or something that has every child has their responsibility for their, you know, their own bed, their own room.

and other tasks in the house. So that actually is the start of a homeschooling day. Let's get organized. Let's get our chores done. Let's get our activities done. We need to eat. So what's everyone's role with breakfast and lunch and dinner? Have that be part of the conversation. Really, it's not just one person's job to feed everybody.

right, or to clean up after everybody. And so let's have it be a joint family activity that we contribute to the meals. Then, you know, then it's like what help let the child decide what order they want to do things. Some might want to do some math, someone undo some reading early, you know, someone to jump right into their Legos or watch a video clip on something they're interested in. Right. So just allow kind of children to

softly get into some of the things that they're interested in working on. One of the things that traditional schooling does is a 40 minute or a 50 minute bell cycle. That no matter how interested you are in or bored you are with that subject, you either have to stop learning at the bell or you have to wait until the bell to move on. Don't recreate that at home.

Ela Richmond (20:12.138)  
next

Matt Bowman (20:18.44)  
Don't, in my opinion, you want to let learning be fluid. If they're interested in something for a few minutes, let them dive deep into that. If they want to dive deep into that for 10 hours, let them do it and postpone what you had planned for something else. so that you have this idea that the learning is natural and it's not a time slotted experience. again, it might contradict a little bit, at least do 20 minutes of math reading English of writing every day.

I think those three Rs are essential. The other thing then we see with families is after you do reading, writing, arithmetic, and you have recess and break and chores, it's now lunchtime. So get some lunch together. And then what we often see families doing in the afternoon is explore the world. So find opportunities to engage in your community, whether it's neighbors or library or zoos or planetariums or, you know, field trips or go out in nature.

Exploring the after in the afternoon is a great opportunity. And then you're back by two 30 or three when the other kids in the neighborhood are coming home from school. Your schooling is done. Their schooling is done. Let the kids go out and play with friends or go to practice at the city rec, you know, programs or whatever. and then hopefully you're home by, know, you're back together at dinner and you have no homework. That's one of the things that our families love about an open education mindset.

is after dinner is still family time. That is unlike most traditional school settings where the kids after dinner have two hours of homework they gotta go crank on, busy work or harder work or whatever and it creates this tension between the student, the parent, like we live that so many times of fighting over, you're not doing your homework, go, what do you have to do tomorrow? I have a test tomorrow, why aren't you studying? All that conflict.

is gone when you're in open education mindset because you do your schooling during the productive hours of the day and then you have dinner and then you play games at night. You spend time together as a family. Like that's some rich opportunities. You're not all exhausted and fighting over homework at night. that's a day in the life of.

Ela Richmond (22:33.162)  
I love that. And I love your distinction. I don't even think you recognize that you do this anymore, but you use the word schooling very intentionally. One of the points that I love that you've made in the past is that there was a point at which you looked at your children and you were like, you know, how much time do I have to help them learn? Right. And you realize that there was a lot of time in the day for them to learn. And only a third of that was being done in school.

And so it was this question about how can I as a parent continue to take control and or influence them to learn outside of school? Because if that's only happening in one third of the day, there's this great amount of time that you have to teach them values, to teach them how to do chores and how to create order in their life and how to keep themselves occupied. There's no such thing as boredom. Some of my favorite homeschool families,

their kids just find things to do all the time. And so I love that.

Matt Bowman (23:33.684)  
It's really a core principle of the power of boredom that you reference is that sometimes you need to let a child and we do less of that in today's society. Let them get bored enough to then wake up and say, I have nothing I have to do. What do I want to do? And then observe over their shoulder what it is that they're curiously reading or wanting to search about on, you know, online or wherever, you know, is safe for them.

You identify that's where the interest comes is at the point of when they don't have to do something. What do they choose to do? And it's super powerful. And yeah, back to your point on the, on the time, you know, most States are around 180, 190 days is the required minimum. The school public schooling has to be in session that, know, if they're there seven hours, that's really not that much of the year. If, know, if you count summers and holidays and weekends that they're in school.

you know, only third of the year. So what are you as a parent planning, organizing, facilitating, not structuring, meaning leaving open time to explore? That's a lot of time the rest of the year that is, you know, intentional time that you can think about what is your child doing.

Ela Richmond (24:48.066)  
Exactly. All right, I'm going to segue us into our next question. This is another question by a parent. I feel like homeschooling is consuming our entire day. We start at 830 and by 3pm we've barely finished the basics. My six year old constantly gets distracted and my three year old interrupts. How do we make this more manageable?

Matt Bowman (25:09.844)  
I think I'm going to have to say on that one, repeat of what we just talked about on the one who felt overwhelmed, right? It's really the same thing of just, you're trying to go tell 3pm on a structured hour by hour, you're replicating public school at home. That's in my opinion, not the right model to think about. It's give your children options to choose what they do for reading, writing, arithmetic, go explore the world, do lots of play and recess. And in fact,

You know, I have a passion around entrepreneurship. So the one thing I would add to what we talked about in on the last question is in the afternoons, you know, maybe Monday, Wednesday, you go out and explore the world Tuesday, Thursday, do something entrepreneurial, something either in your household where you're selling stuff to the neighbors or in your community or a farmer's market on Saturdays. You're preparing for that. Do something entrepreneurial with your children, with your family on some days of the week.

Ela Richmond (25:52.706)  
Mm.

Matt Bowman (26:09.064)  
There's really something powerful that you can learn from running a business out of your home that you can't learn in any other way. I've looked at every other curriculum and pedagogy and model of learning. There is something unique you can learn from trying to be an entrepreneur. And so that cannot be learned any other way. And so I would say try to incorporate some entrepreneurship thinking into your family plan and,

And definitely don't go from eight to three as a structured, forced learning experience, break it up into small chunks with breaks in between and go explore the world. And again, giving them a voice, lets them have some agency over that. So the interruptions and distractions can be better dealt with. It's not easy. It's not easy, definitely, but it can be dealt with if you just step back and chunk it a little bit differently.

Ela Richmond (27:08.546)  
On the note of entrepreneurship as well, one of our parents in the Open Ed program has really been loving this group called the Children's Entrepreneurial Market. Have you heard of that?

Matt Bowman (27:18.472)  
Yes, yeah, we've participated in that many years.

Ela Richmond (27:20.938)  
Yeah, she, she, she says that it's basically like a farmer's market and her it's all kids, only kids. And basically her kids just learn a lot of things like counting money, creating a product, creating a booth, talking to people, gaining a ton of confidence. And I was talking to somebody the other day and he was saying, he works inside of the company and he was talking about the fact that like, he's worked inside of companies where adults are required to do what these kids are doing. And he's like, he's like, the kids do it better than the adult.

Matt Bowman (27:51.376)  
It's so true. We have an example. I think we included our book or not, but we did an activity at eBay once where we had eBay executives speaking to a crowd of open ed families. Average age was probably 12 of the kids that were attending this eBay meetup we had.

And I had ahead of time invited the eBay executives to come up with a problem that eBay executives were struggling with something at eBay that their management team had on there to to resolve list, right? Every company has those. And so I said, share that with the audience and give 10 minutes to these 10, 12, 13 year olds in the audience to pitch you solutions to that eBay executive challenge. And they're like, okay, we'll do it.

You know, just kind of not thinking much value would come out of it. At the end, after all these kids pitched their solutions to these eBay challenges, the executives were blown away. They said, these are better solutions and better ideas than we've got from our adult management team. Like this is powerful. And it just, it just shows you kids think differently about problems and solutions than adults. And so give them an opportunity to solve major problems and see what

Comes up on the board, you never know.

Ela Richmond (29:15.884)  
I love that. And one of the other things that I've been really focusing on is the idea of integrating kids into your full day, right? It's like, if you treat kids as though they have a mind and a mental capacity and like a spirit of their own, they can transform the way that you live your life too, which is so cool and powerful.

Matt Bowman (29:37.748)  
That's really true. And it's been interesting since, since the pandemic and the increase in remote work, a lot of parents said, I, I would like having my children around and we're able to go do things during the day and it can improve my productivity as a remote worker because like it helps me think through some of the things as we go on a little walk at lunch or whatever to the park. And, and it just, there's just something resetting about conversing with children during the day.

that sometimes our adult brains need.

Ela Richmond (30:09.866)  
Yeah, there's this good example. Have you read the goal? Okay, so it's this business book and in the business book, it's funny because there's this executive, he gets this really, really difficult challenge and he's trying to work through it by himself and then he brings a couple of his other executives onto the challenge and like he can't think through it and so he's really frustrated. He heads home, he's really frustrated and so he's like, whatever, like I'm just gonna ask my kids and his kids give him the solution that he needs because they just ask.

Matt Bowman (30:14.206)  
No.

Ela Richmond (30:38.966)  
they ask him a question that makes him think differently than he was thinking. And it's almost like this principal fundamental back to basics kind of thing. Are you asking the right questions sometimes?

Matt Bowman (30:51.016)  
Well, I need to give a shout out to our kids over the years. We've Amy and I have asked them for advice and thoughts and counsel, and they've given us some really great insights that we wouldn't have gained any other way. So I have a personal experience with that too.

Ela Richmond (31:05.918)  
That's awesome. One note that I wanted to make and ask you about on this question and then I'll move on to the next is this idea of more is more in homeschooling, right? So, right, there's this woman and she's going through this experience where she starts at 8.30, she's going till 3 p.m. and she feels like she hasn't done anything, right? And this idea that you need to have a long list of things that you've checked the box on. Why do you think this is so pervasive and...

How do you let go of that pressure?

Matt Bowman (31:37.416)  
think it's pervasive because that's kind of the nature of society is that we feel like we aren't, none of us are doing enough. should all, you know, our kids joke at times, you know, there's Instagram reels or YouTube videos where it says, you know, I'm up at 4 a.m. and I'm doing more by 8 a.m. than you ever done in your week. You know, that type of mentality is out there that makes us feel like we're never doing enough.

And so the clock's always ticking. Someone down the street, this kid is practicing basketball at 6 a.m. and mine's not. So now my kid's going to be a failure. We just, that's natural human tendency to just compare ourselves to others, to think that we're never doing enough. And, you know, it really is hard to say less is more, step back. Simplicity is the new sophistication.

I think there's some quote around that from Leonardo da Vinci or something, you know, hundreds of years ago that say, you know, that we sometimes forget that simplifying things actually is hard and give yourself credit if you can simplify, because it's easy to feel busy all the time and to feel overwhelmed all the time. That's, that's easy to do because it's, you just keep doing stuff. The hard step is to simplify is to scale back is to

prioritize what's important and shed those things that aren't. That's what really is the quest and it's not easy to do.

Ela Richmond (33:15.038)  
I love that answer. I was reading a book and it was talking about how they was talking about the difference in education in different in different countries. And it was talking about how Americans can can perform well in certain types of tests that measure facts and measure knowledge based on like, what do you know, and that's usually like, widespread. So it's like, how much do you know, and they can they can tell people, you know, what

a certain state is or like they can pull out some sort of anatomical idea, but then whenever it comes to applying these things, they have a really hard time with it. So the critical thinking aspect. And I think that's really, really fascinating that you say that. also it makes sense. Like let's say that you master something and it's very, very simple, but you master it. Maybe you master, let's say the idea to think through Socratic ideas.

what would you do if or like which would you rather? You can almost apply basic common sense to a lot of different factual questions and so that usually is more important than the other and also which one helps you better in your regular life. It's obviously applying rather than just being able to pull out a random trivia fact.

Matt Bowman (34:35.386)  
for sure and that's actually why I love entrepreneurship. It's the ultimate example of applied knowledge and skill. You have to apply it in order to produce a product and service that someone wants to pay money for. That is applied knowledge in its finest.

Ela Richmond (34:51.594)  
I love that point. Okay, our next question. With issues like AI bullying and online exploitation becoming more common in schools, how do homeschool families approach digital safety while still preparing kids for the real world?

Matt Bowman (35:08.424)  
That's one of the hardest questions that all of us are struggling with as parents, as grandparents now, we have four grandkids. What's the right balance between access to tech and safety and yet not missing out on them gaining skills to be successful in a tech-centered world, right? So.

First, acknowledging that that's a really tough question that every adult, every parent, grandparent is actively and currently struggling with. So you're not alone in asking this question, parent. Regarding the answer to how do we do that, how do we strike that balance, first answer is it's different for every child. It's different for every family. It's different for every situation. So recognize that, that what may apply to one child may not.

work or work for the other child. Each child's different. And so you might have a family rule that you can only go on the internet if you're in the room with parents that are also in there. And that may work for one or two children, but for the third, it doesn't. so you need, cause they're in a tablet somewhere else or whatever. And so you need to come up with, again, love limits and latitude. You're, you, you converse with your child.

express your love, wanting them to stay safe, teach them correct principles around don't share personal information, stay away from things that make you feel uncomfortable, that kind of thing. And then have the latitude to say you need to govern yourself at the end of the day. This is, and depending on the age of the child, but you teach them to think about how do I need to keep myself safe?

And then have regular check-ins, conversations. It's really about open lines of communication between you and your children on an hourly or daily or weekly basis of what kind of things have you come across online or on tablets or whatever that have made you wonder if that was appropriate or not. Let's have this conversation and how did it make you feel? What are some of those emotions that you've experienced?

Matt Bowman (37:26.526)  
And just kind of talk through some of those things and, and saying, what, here's some risks that are out there online and here's some, some ways to protect ourselves, both as individuals and as a family unit, so that we keep our, you know, keep our family safe. And so those are joint conversations to have with everybody in the household. And again, as you teach kind of. So open conversation, teach correct principles around safety and privacy.

and then just realize it, it's down to the individual. can't, no parent can police everything. No matter how many closed down apps or locks or filters, like you can do all your best, but then the day you have to have those conversations of this is a, you have to govern yourself, young person.

Ela Richmond (38:18.038)  
Did you do that? Like, did you sit each of your kids down? Did you do it together where you just said, hey, this is the world we live in. This is what you're going to encounter.

Matt Bowman (38:26.696)  
Yep, all the above. We started with trying to do strict filters and locks on everything. And then at end of the day, you look at something like, well, how did that get through the lock? And so then it was like, okay, you can't lock out everything. So then we took the approach of, okay, we just need to have open conversations, acknowledging what's real, talk through it and create that the biggest.

challenges this, you know, imposing shame, creating this feeling like they've done something wrong all the time of, where they visit or what they did on, or they've done too much screen time, whatever it's create, like do whatever you can to minimize that feeling of shame so that you can have open conversations around, Hey, I've made mistakes as adult. You make mistakes as a child. We're not perfect. We just are trying to do our best.

Ela Richmond (39:23.362)  
Mm.

Matt Bowman (39:23.858)  
have an open conversation so that you minimize shaming each other for mistakes that are made. And just embrace that and it can work.

Ela Richmond (39:34.984)  
Yeah, it makes sense and especially the emphasis on minimizing shame. Like your kids don't want to talk to you if they feel like they're going to feel ashamed or if they're going to be put on the spot.

Matt Bowman (39:45.172)  
Yeah, that shuts down communication more than anything.

Ela Richmond (39:50.892)  
So how do you balance that? Like how did you balance that with Amy? Whenever your kids did something wrong and obviously you want to make them know that they did something wrong, but also creating an environment where they weren't so shameful that they'll never come and talk to you again.

Matt Bowman (40:06.896)  
you know, that's a great question. there's 30, our oldest is 32 or something. So it's been 30 years of, of working through all of that. But I would say, you know, the first one question, one, one distinction of question that I remember coming across early on was the difference between a, what question and a why question. And the what question is tell me what happened. Like.

What what occurred just describe what happened instead of why did you do that? Why did you let yourself go there? Why did that you know, why did that happen? The why questions are really hard for any of us to answer. I don't know it. I don't know why I'm not you know, proactively trying to assess my brain cycles, but this is what you know, but if you focus on what happened.

And okay, that happened, you know, and then you discuss, I'm sorry that what happened made you feel that way. What are some things we can do in the future to help you not have to experience that negative emotion or that negative experience? And, know, put your arm around them and say, I'm sorry that happened. You know, we're here for you. We're, you know, let's do this together as we face the world together. Instead of the why questions often make someone feel

You know confused and i don't know why and so it gets defensive and it gets shut down and you both run off to your different rooms. So i like the what what just what happened just describe it. And then talk through it.

Ela Richmond (41:49.388)  
That's a really good tip just because I I think through even some of the things that happened in my own life. And it's like, I can tell you the sequence of events that occurred. can't tell you exactly why I did all the things that I did. But like, if you know the sequence of events and then I start to connect like, I was thinking this because this happened, then it starts to make more sense. And it's like, okay, well, usually people don't do things that just make absolutely no sense at all. So if you can try and track that back and understand it.

then that's obviously a little bit better. All right.

Matt Bowman (42:21.094)  
And you're side by side with them. You're not antagonistic across the table. You want to try to just be side by side. Hey, we're in this together. We're both just trying our best to be safe, to be smart, to be responsible. And it's an everlasting journey that we're on together.

Ela Richmond (42:24.386)  
Thanks

Ela Richmond (42:44.992)  
Yeah. All right. And our final and last question for today is going to be, I've been a stay at home mom for five years and our paychecks aren't stretching like they used to. How do single income homeschool families make it work financially?

Matt Bowman (43:02.58)  
That's a really great question. There is definitely a financial impact when a family chooses to adopt an open education mindset. Again, because the free public school option is an option that families often take and because of its financial impact on the family. single income families are very prevalent. So, first of all, again, you're not alone.

There's lots of people who have made decisions like yours to be a single income household. That's what our family did. I had the out of the home job. Amy had the in the home job. And we made decisions because of that. We wanted to thoughtfully and proactively have her be at home with the children. And I went out to outside work. When it comes to costs of

providing a high quality open education to each child that's personalized to their needs and interests and personalities and desires and passions, that can cost some things. And so at the end of the day, budgeting is around trying to figure out, it's really that needs and interests and resource analysis that we talked about that's a chapter in our book. When you get to the resources section,

You begin to identify you start with free water free resources that can help my child's needs address my child's needs and interests right and so you start with free and then you start moving down the cost level of what's low cost what's a little more expensive what's then really expensive and you kind of look at that that sliding scale from free to expensive.

And you map those resources that you have in your family to what your needs and interests are of your children. And sometimes the most expensive resources are just not an option. And so you have to accept that and say, you know what? I wish I could, you know, have a private tutor that took them on every, you know, to every state capital to have them travel and see the world. Right? So you, you can't always do one really expensive option, even if your child wants to go.

Matt Bowman (45:26.248)  
see every, you know, NBA stadium in the country, because that's their interests, right? So you have to balance that with needs and resources in the family. So again, start with free. So if we start with free, there's an amazing amount of free resources available to families that have zero cost to them. Both online, I mean, even just Sol Con, one of the world's greatest contributors to

to open and free education, Khan Academy has every subject of every grade level of everything that's available and the, you know, that a kid would want to know. And it comes now with a free tutoring with Khanmigo, right? So with their, with their really well done, I think AI tutor that is built around the curriculum of Khan Academy.

Every child in the world can have free access to any curriculum and a tutor that they want. So if you just start with that as free, then you can start say, okay, my public library also has free resources, books and videos and, on, you know, audio books and, resources that I can get free from the library. So that's another free, you can also then move into lots of free online curriculum.

There's just there's a lot of stuff out there beyond Khan Academy. Then you move down to okay, some of it has a fee. So look for things that are very, you affordable, even like a Duolingo is very affordable. So you can start adding foreign language to your to your repertoire at a very low cost. And then there's subscriptions around reading aids or many of these programs that we have in in our open ed platform.

that we've partnered with have so many rich resources at such an affordable price for families that a family on a single income household absolutely can access world-class curriculum online or books in the library or books at Costco or Amazon for affordable prices to be able to feed your child's needs and interests on their education plan. And then just make a decision as a family

Matt Bowman (47:45.364)  
What are, you know, what priorities are we going to make or give up for the next layer of fee based resource? You know, we really want to go to the zoo and it costs $20 for a, for a family to go or 30 or 40. Are we going to budget our ourselves and save up for it to go to the zoo in June? And we're going to all contribute. We're going to maybe do some entrepreneurial things and sell, you know, cupcakes in the neighborhood to raise enough money to go to the zoo. Like.

Ela Richmond (48:14.818)  
Mm.

Matt Bowman (48:14.888)  
There's so many opportunities. That's why I also love entrepreneurship. It can self-fund educational activities. You can use that money you're making from selling bread to go to the zoo as a family that you might not have been able to afford otherwise. So then you just start chipping away at those things that cost money and there's ways to do it and you can do it very successfully.

Ela Richmond (48:22.274)  
That's big.

Ela Richmond (48:36.386)  
That's a great answer and I'm very excited for people to start reading the book whenever it comes out. I think there will be a lot of very, very just practical things like this in there. And I mean, closing thoughts, this has been awesome. I have loved hearing all of your thoughts on all of these questions. And yeah, this has been great. Thank you.

Matt Bowman (48:43.892)  
Ha

Matt Bowman (49:00.51)  
Thanks, Al. It's been great to be with you today.
