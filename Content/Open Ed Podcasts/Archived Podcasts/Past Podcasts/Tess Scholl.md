## Give yourself some grace

_This can be turned into a social text post or graphic on linkedin or instagram. I also see a newsletter segment about why you should take it easy on yourself. Specifically “the hindsight bias”._

  

  

## **Your Best "In The Moment" Is Enough**

_"When we look back, was it our best? No, but did we try to do the best in those moments? Yes."_

Homeschool mom Tess Scholl nails something we all need to hear: The difference between "best possible" and "best in the moment" matters.

You're making hundreds of micro-decisions every day. Perfect isn't possible. But genuine effort, made consistently with love? That transforms lives.

💡 THOUGHT  
The Hindsight Trap: Why Homeschool Parents Need More Self-Compassion  
Ever look back at yesterday's lesson and think, "I should have done that differently"? That's hindsight bias talking - our brain's sneaky way of making past decisions seem obvious when they weren't.  
Here's the truth: You're making dozens of micro-decisions every day in real-time. While reflection helps us grow, harsh self-judgment doesn't. As one homeschool mom recently shared in our podcast: "When we look back, was it our best? No, but did we try to do the best in those moments? Yes."  
This hits at something deeper: The difference between "best possible" and "best in the moment." You're not just teaching math and reading - you're juggling energy levels, emotional needs, unexpected interruptions, and real-world constraints.  
Give yourself the same grace you'd offer another parent. Because the reality is, perfect homeschooling doesn't exist. But genuine effort, made consistently with love? That's what transforms lives.

Self-compassion is the secret weapon of successful homeschoolers.

A powerful insight from homeschool mom Tess Scholl: We often beat ourselves up looking back at our decisions, but in each micro-moment, we truly do our best with what we have.

The key is giving yourself permission to be okay with that.

This mindset shift is fundamental to success, not just in homeschooling, but in life:

Instead of spiraling into guilt about not being or doing enough, acknowledge that you made the best choice possible in that moment.

But self-compassion alone isn't enough. Community becomes the multiplier.

As your children age and face different challenges, having a supportive network becomes crucial. The beauty is how it works both ways - parents initially seek community for their kids, but end up finding deep connections themselves.

Tess discovered this firsthand. Her community blossomed after becoming a parent, finding like-minded people who helped both her and her children thrive.

The takeaway:  
Success in homeschooling (and life) isn't about perfection. It's about being kind to yourself in the moments that matter and surrounding yourself with people who get it.

Remember: Your best in the moment is enough. And you don't have to do it alone.

# Empower Yourself with Self-Compassion

Tess Scholl: [00:00:00] Being kind to yourself and giving yourself grace and not going into the guilt spiral of not being enough and doing enough.

Um, I think to remind ourselves that ~we~ often truly do the best In the, like, in the micro moments that we have. So like, sure. When we look back, was it our best? No, but did we try to do the best in those moments? Yes. And I think that truly, um, reminding yourself that you did the best in the moments and then giving yourself permission to like, be okay with that, I think is fundamental to being successful.

in life and as a homeschooler, right? Like being like, okay, that didn't go well, but I

Ela Richmond: Mm hmm.

Tess Scholl: the best in the moments that I had. ~And then I would say the big, a really good tip, which I hope most people are doing is just finding community because You know, I can only imagine how detailed, um, and complicated homeschooling is going to get when I'm homeschooling, um, my kids as they age and go through their different, um, challenges in their own lives.~

~And so I know that community is going to be really important and finding the community that, that makes me and my family thrive. It~

Ela Richmond: ~Yeah.~

Tess Scholl: ~it's from a place of, you know, like love.~

Ela Richmond: ~I'm curious, are you more interested in community for yourself or for your kids or both? Because I feel like what's interesting is I see so many parents connecting, um, but initially the question is like, how do I find community for my kids and then the parents also find community, which is really cool.~

~Mm~

Tess Scholl: ~Yeah, so I have always been, my favorite thing is forming community and, and, and learning about people. Um, I mean, I'll tell you my whole life story and like the first time I meet you and I, and I want to know about people truly like what makes them tick and who they are as a person. And, um, And so that's incredibly important for me, and I do have a community, like I have some amazing friends, and that developed more when I had kids.~

~And, um, and I became a parent, I found people that I connected with, and that's only blossomed as my kids have gotten older.~

When we don't listen to our kids, we create adults who don't believe they're worthy of having opinions.

@TessScholl breaks down why giving children a voice is crucial for their development into confident adults. She shares insights from her own upbringing and current parenting approach.

We dive deep into:

- How ignoring children's voices impacts their adult self-worth
- Building foundational self-confidence in kids
- Why many adults struggle to answer "what do you want?"
- Strategies to help children feel heard
- The connection between childhood listening and adult self-awareness
- Creating a framework for authentic self-expression
- Breaking the cycle of prescribed life paths

This is a must-listen for parents who want to raise confident, self-aware children who trust their own voice.

The hidden cost of not listening to our children goes far beyond their childhood years.

When we dismiss our kids' voices, we create adults who don't believe they're worthy of having opinions or setting boundaries.

Think about it:

Every time we brush off a child's thoughts or feelings, we're sending a message that their voice doesn't matter.

This compounds over time, creating adults who struggle with the simple question: "What do you want?"

As Tess Scholl points out, establishing this foundation of self-worth in childhood is crucial. It translates into self-confidence and self-awareness later in life.

The key isn't just listening - it's teaching kids that they deserve to be heard. And when they aren't heard, giving them the tools to advocate for themselves.

Many adults today follow prescribed paths because it's easier than answering the fundamental question of what they truly want. They lack the confidence to trust their own desires.

The good news?

We can break this cycle by:

- Creating space for children's voices
- Validating their opinions
- Teaching them advocacy skills
- Showing them their thoughts have value

The foundation of self-worth we build in childhood becomes the confidence adults carry through life.

Remember: Every interaction with a child is either building or diminishing their sense of self-worth. Choose wisely.

Your children's future relationship with their own voice depends on how you treat it today.

# The Impact of Not Listening to Kids

Tess Scholl: ~I think there's such a, there's not a surge. It's just our awareness of anxiety and, uh, different ways of being in the world. Um, but ~[00:00:00] when we don't like really hear our kids, I think something gets squashed down. And we become adults that don't believe we're valued and that we're ~ ~worthy of having our own opinions and saying no.

~And it's, I don't know, it's just like, ~this foundation that if you don't provide, you know, everything we do has consequences whether they're positive or negative, but I just really want to create a foundation that they, they feel like they have a voice. ~ ~They're worthy of that voice. And that people will listen.

And if people don't listen, they have strategies to still be heard. Um, so I think honestly, like, it's about that foundation. ~And I, I can only hope that what I'm doing works. You know, I think that my parents did a very good job of, I have a twin sister and I have a brother. And I think we all, really do have like this foundational level of truly like self worth, which translates into self~

Ela Richmond: ~Mm~

Tess Scholl: ~confidence and self awareness and, and like an understanding of who we are in the world.~

~So I'm trying to keep that~

~~Ela Richmond: ~Yeah, I think, I think that's understated. Um, this, this confidence in self, right? Like, the confidence that I can have an opinion and I can have a thought and I can share my thought. And like, um, it's funny that you mentioned this because I've been reflecting a lot on just my own journey personally, like, into adulthood and beyond and just kind of thinking through.~~~

~~~One of the things that have been the most challenging in my life, and one of them, honestly, and even looking at so many of my friends as well, who are all adults, um, is the confidence when you ask the question, what do you want? confidence in the answer that comes after. And like, it's so interesting to me because, If you go down a path that's already prescribed for you, it's easy.~~~

~~~You don't have to answer that question.~~~

1/8 Why kids shouldn't be sitting still in classrooms...

A THREAD on the importance of natural childhood development and why our education system needs a serious rethink.

2/8 Here's the truth: Kids aren't meant to sit still and be quiet.  
They're supposed to:  
• Get dirty  
• Explore freely  
• Discover the world  
• Learn through movement  
Nature designed them this way for a reason.

3/8 We're seeing a massive shift in education right now.  
Micro schools  
Alternative learning  
Homeschooling options  
But 5 years ago? The choice was binary: public school or home school.  
That's it.

4/8 The real problem?  
We're killing natural curiosity by forcing kids into standardized boxes too early.

Think about it:  
When was the last time you saw a kid truly lost in discovery, without adult intervention?

5/8 What we're missing in modern education:  
• Creating with hands  
• Physical exploration  
• Natural discovery  
• Adventure  
• Joy of learning  
These aren't "extras" - they're fundamental to human development.

6/8 Our ancestors learned through:  
• Direct experience  
• Physical interaction  
• Natural consequences  
• Real-world exploration

Not by sitting at desks for 8 hours.

7/8 The most valuable learning happens when kids are:  
• Getting messy  
• Taking risks  
• Testing boundaries  
• Following curiosity  
Not when they're memorizing worksheets.

8/8 Key takeaway:  
Let kids be kids.  
There's plenty of time for structure later.  
But childhood? That window of pure discovery and joy?  
That's precious and irreplaceable.

Don't waste it behind a desk.

Kids aren't meant to sit still - they're meant to get dirty and discover the world.

That's what drove Tess Scholl to choose an alternative education path for her children. She wanted them to be kids for as long as possible.

"Kids aren't supposed to sit down and be still," she says emotionally. "They're supposed to be dirty, honestly just discover the world for themselves."

Five years ago, the choices seemed limited - either public school or homeschool. But now, with the rise of micro schools and alternative education options, parents have more ways to foster natural childhood development.

For Tess, this mission was deeply personal. Her own upbringing emphasized the importance of being a kid - creating with your hands, fostering joy, and maintaining that passion for discovery and adventure.

"I felt like I would be lost if I didn't do something about it," she explains.

The modern education system often rushes children through their most formative years. But perhaps what they need most is time - time to explore, time to create, and time to simply be kids.

This approach isn't just about education - it's about preserving the natural wonder and curiosity that makes childhood special.

When we give children the freedom to get dirty, to explore, and to discover the world on their own terms, we're not just letting them be kids - we're letting them become who they're meant to be.

# Why Kids Should Be Dirty and Discover the World!

Tess Scholl: ~I was really, really wanted my kids to be kids. That was really important for me, uh, for as long as possible. I get emotional talking about it, but, um, you know, ~[00:00:00] kids aren't supposed to sit down and be still. ~Um, ~they're supposed to be dirty. ~like,~ honestly, just discover the world, ~ ~um, for themselves.

~And ~I think I just wanted them to have more time to do that. So, um, ~you~ know, there's such a big movement right now for micro schools and, like, alternatives to education, which OpenEd is just really able to, um, help foster. And so, I, but it, you know, I felt like it was either public school or homeschool. ~ ~It just wasn't even, what is it, four or five years ago, there just wasn't that much choice.

So initially I think it was just help them be kids as long as I could.

Ela Richmond: ~Why~

Tess Scholl: ~So that's what we did.~

Ela Richmond: ~you? Yeah.~

Tess Scholl: ~Sorry.~

Ela Richmond: ~Why was that so important to you? Why was it like, what were you watching in your kids that made it, I mean like, even to the point where you're like emotional about it, like, what, what did you see in your kids that you were like, this is so important to me as a mom, as a parent, to make this a priority in our lives?~

~Mmm.~

Tess Scholl: ~that I, the background that I was raised in was about that, about being a kid and um, Like, fostering that, um, the joy of, like, life, and, um, uh, and, like, just, like, creating with your hands and your body and your, just, that passion for, like, um, discovery, I think, and adventure. So I I guess I just, like, sort of being, like, lost if I didn't do something about it, I guess.~

Ela Richmond: ~Yeah, wow. Wow. And why is that so important to you, this, this joy of life, like, I, I go, I walk around and I, I pay attention to kids, especially in this, this work that, that we're in.~

# Empowering Voices in Education

Tess Scholl: ~Um, kids to have a voice. And that goes back to like what we talked about at the beginning of the podcast. You know, when we have, I mean, ~[00:00:00] when you have a voice in what you are learning, you're more invested in, um, the outcome or how much energy you put into something. And, and I think that's really true for kids.

And, um, I don't think it happens often or enough. And so even at OWL Collective, we're working with the kids to, uh, to have a voice. You know, if kids are coming from, to our program from public, they don't know what that looks like. They don't know what it looks like to have a voice and actually make a choice or say no or have a different opinion.

Ela Richmond: Mm

Tess Scholl: been really nice to hear the kids try to come up with solutions when they, when it's time for them to have a voice. Um, It takes them a moment to, uh, like work together as a team, because the, the [00:01:00] idea of, um, Knowledge Seekers is that, um, like I said at the beginning, we don't do anything in isolation.

And, yeah, the collective, we, um, we're there together, um, and it's the job. of the teacher to be a guide and to help the students have a voice and come up with what they want to learn. So it's a constant conversation about like, what do you want to learn? What, how do you learn? And, um, like what brings you joy?

And, um, how can we work together as the teacher and the student? ~And even the parents different goals for their children. Um, I have different goals for my boys personally, and I, the collective is all about working in collaboration to meet everyone's goals.~

YOUR CHILD'S VOICE MATTERS

# Are Our Kids Truly Alive and Curious?

Ela Richmond: [00:00:00] ~~~Yeah, wow. Wow. And why is that so important to you, this, this joy of life, like, I, I go, I walk around and I, ~~~I pay attention to kids, especially in this, this work that, that we're in. Just like, how do these kids look? Do they look alive? Do they look, um, full? Do they look like they are excited and curious and ready to discover the world, like you were saying?

And, um, honestly for a lot of them, the answer is no, which is really, really, really sad to me. Mm

Tess Scholl: when you were just explaining that, it's,

Ela Richmond: Mm hmm. Mm

Tess Scholl: start out this way, and then things change. And, you know, When we put them in scenarios where they don't get choices and they don't, they don't get to be who they want to be in, in the, in their moments of their day, it squashes something, right? It squashes self confidence, self esteem, like, The part that [00:01:00] tells them they're valued and they have I think that's what it does So I think if we can allow our kids to and I'm not perfect At this with homeschooling like I wish I could just like let go of the All the, like my stuff, right.

And just let them do whatever they want, whenever they want. But I'm definitely not at that point yet with like letting go and just allowing them to do, make all the decisions themselves. Um, so I'm still at the point where I'm trying to guide them to me, like help them make choices education wise. But I think when we take those little four and five and six year olds, and we say, No, it's not time to play with sticks.

It's time to go to school and we're gonna be late and we're all stressed out about it and then we're gonna, you need to [00:02:00] be in this place that's, um, telling you what to do, how to do it. I think we, We're not actually telling kids they know what they need for themselves. So, I think when we allow kids to have more autonomy in how they go about their world and how they learn, and give them a voice and give them the ability to say no, um, I'm not interested, or, That doesn't feel safe, or that, that is too confusing or too overwhelming.

I think there's such a, there's not a surge. It's just our awareness of anxiety and, uh, different ways of being in the world. Um, but when we don't like really hear our kids, I think something gets squashed down. And we become adults that don't believe we're valued and that we're [00:03:00] worthy of having our own opinions and saying no.

And it's, I don't know, it's just like, this foundation that if you don't provide, you know, everything we do has consequences whether they're positive or negative, but I just really want to create a foundation that they, they feel like they have a voice. They're worthy of that voice. And that people will listen.

And if people don't listen, they have strategies to still be heard. Um, so I think honestly, like, it's about that foundation. And I, I can only hope that what I'm doing works. You know, I think that my parents did a very good job of, I have a twin sister and I have a brother. And I think we all, really do have like this foundational level of truly like self worth, which translates into [00:04:00] self

Ela Richmond: Mm

Tess Scholl: confidence and self awareness and, and like an understanding of who we are in the world.

So I'm trying to keep that

~~Ela Richmond: ~Yeah, I think, I think that's understated. Um, this, this confidence in self, right? Like, the confidence that I can have an opinion and I can have a thought and I can share my thought.~~~

# 30 - Tess Scholl

Tess Scholl: [00:00:00] really wanted my kids to be kids. That was really important for me, for as long as possible. I get emotional talking about it, but, um, you know, kids aren't supposed to sit down and be still. They're supposed to honestly, just discover the world, um, for themselves.

And

Ela Richmond: welcome back to the Open Ed Podcast. I'm your sometimes host Ella, and today I'm joined by Tess Scholl. She is a mom of two twin 10 year olds. She is also the founder of Knowledge Seekers, which is a mindful learning program in Oregon. Um, and we're going to get into her homeschooling journey with her kids as well as kind of what, um, what prompted her to start Knowledge Seekers and kind of what it's all about.

So

Okay, so I wanted to open up with a question, how did you even get started in homeschooling? You were telling me a little bit about the fact that your parents homeschooled you when it was kind of [00:01:00] illegal, um, in Australia, which is awesome, um, and just like thinking back to the state of homeschooling, how far we've come, um, yeah, so you got started a little bit, you knew what it was, your parents were open minded enough, but then how did it really become a, a possibility and an option in your mind for your kids?

Tess Scholl: Yeah, so you're correct. I'm from Australia and um, when, when I think about my parents, I, I feel like they were like the poster children for like the hippie kind of situation in the, um, You know, I was born in the 80s and when I look now what I know about homeschool, I would say they unschooled us for a couple years and it was really just a continuation of them wanting to, um, really provide an environment for their kids that allowed them to be themselves.

And, [00:02:00] um, you know, that whole entire. era was all about like defining yourself and in ways that were not necessarily in the mainstream. So, um, I think for them, it was just like a really natural kind of, it was something that was happening, right? The, the thoughts were different back then. Being open minded looked a lot different.

It was almost like the beginning of those, like, you know, the bubbles of, like, thought around, like, alternative living, alternative lifestyles, alternative thinking, alternative education. And so, you know, as a kid, I, It was just what they were doing. Right. Like I had no thought process into it. Um, and then when I, I got put in school, so, um, we were like daubed in that we were homeschooling.

we went to real school and it was just really challenging for me to do that. Like, it's not how I learned. And so I had a lot of difficulties, um, [00:03:00] homeschooling as a young child, as a teenager. And I didn't really get any confidence until college. How I was able to be like. You know, like figure out how to educate my, not myself, but how to be in education,

Ela Richmond: What do you mean by that? Can you explain that a little bit?

Tess Scholl: Well, I think that I spent so much time trying to catch up

Ela Richmond: Mm hmm.

Tess Scholl: as a child and as an adult, I was able to like, give myself time and to, uh, figure out what compensations I needed to make to get the education that like, I needed, I guess. And you know, when you're in college, like, It's a choice, right? It's not like in high school where they're like, you come here and you do this.

Like, there's a lot more autonomy in, um, in college. And I think that worked better for [00:04:00] me to be able to choose the kind of classes I was doing and things like that. And then I was finally able to like find a path that worked,

Ela Richmond: Yeah,

Tess Scholl: really should happen at the beginning of education.

Ela Richmond: No, it's so true. And what's so interesting is that this wasn't even a conversation back then. So, like, I will, I'll have a conversation with my mom or, um, there was a previous guest on the podcast, Sunny, um, who, like, So many of our parents went through these issues where they, they were behind and, or they were struggling and, or, and the school system told them, it's your fault.

Like something's not right with you. Um, and it's really, really validating and liberating that now the question is, okay, what's not right with the approach? What's not right with the curriculum? What's not, what is not right with the student is what's not right here. Um, and I think, It's funny, and, uh, not funny, I guess, but, like, It makes sense that so many people grew up believing, okay, I'm [00:05:00] bad at math.

I'm bad at reading. I'm bad at these things. I'm bad at test taking. I'll talk to my mom and she's just like, I've never been a good test taker. I'm terrible at

Tess Scholl: Yeah.

Ela Richmond: I can't, I can't think through these problems. Um, and nobody ever approached her and said, Hey, maybe it's just the way that somebody is trying to teach you, or maybe it's just the way that, uh, you're trying to take in these, these bits and pieces of information.

So it's really. Um, difficult to hear that coming from parents, but then also liberating on the other side because now parents know how to help their kids. So you went through all of these experiences and then now you have your own, your own kids. What, what does that process look like where you're looking at the education that they might get and you're saying, okay, maybe I don't want to do it like that.

Maybe I want to homeschool. Maybe I want to help personalize their education by myself.

Tess Scholl: Yeah, for sure. I think a lot of it. stemmed from. I was really, really wanted my kids to be [00:06:00] kids. That was really important for me, uh, for as long as possible. I get emotional talking about it, but, um, you know, kids aren't supposed to sit down and be still. Um, they're supposed to be dirty. like, honestly, just discover the world, um, for themselves.

And I think I just wanted them to have more time to do that. So, um, you know, there's such a big movement right now for micro schools and, like, alternatives to education, which OpenEd is just really able to, um, help foster. And so, I, but it, you know, I felt like it was either public school or [00:07:00] homeschool. It just wasn't even, what is it, four or five years ago, there just wasn't that much choice.

So initially I think it was just help them be kids as long as I could.

Ela Richmond: Why

Tess Scholl: So that's what we did.

Ela Richmond: you? Yeah.

Tess Scholl: Sorry.

Ela Richmond: Why was that so important to you? Why was it like, what were you watching in your kids that made it, I mean like, even to the point where you're like emotional about it, like, what, what did you see in your kids that you were like, this is so important to me as a mom, as a parent, to make this a priority in our lives?

Mmm.

Tess Scholl: that I, the background that I was raised in was about that, about being a kid and um, Like, fostering that, um, the joy of, like, [00:08:00] life, and, um, uh, and, like, just, like, creating with your hands and your body and your, just, that passion for, like, um, discovery, I think, and adventure. So I I guess I just, like, sort of being, like, lost if I didn't do something about it, I guess.

Ela Richmond: Yeah, wow. Wow. And why is that so important to you, this, this joy of life, like, I, I go, I walk around and I, I pay attention to kids, especially in this, this work that, that we're in. Just like, how do these kids look? Do they look alive? Do they look, um, full? Do they look like they are excited and curious and ready to discover the world, like you were [00:09:00] saying?

And, um, honestly for a lot of them, the answer is no, which is really, really, really sad to me. Mm

Tess Scholl: when you were just explaining that, it's,

Ela Richmond: Mm hmm. Mm

Tess Scholl: start out this way, and then things change. And, you know, When we put them in scenarios where they don't get choices and they don't, they don't get to be who they want to be in, in the, in their moments of their day, it squashes something, right? It squashes self confidence, self esteem, like, The part that tells them they're valued and they have I think that's what it does So I think if we can allow our kids to and I'm not perfect At this with homeschooling like I wish I could [00:10:00] just like let go of the All the, like my stuff, right.

And just let them do whatever they want, whenever they want. But I'm definitely not at that point yet with like letting go and just allowing them to do, make all the decisions themselves. Um, so I'm still at the point where I'm trying to guide them to me, like help them make choices education wise. But I think when we take those little four and five and six year olds, and we say, No, it's not time to play with sticks.

It's time to go to school and we're gonna be late and we're all stressed out about it and then we're gonna, you need to be in this place that's, um, telling you what to do, how to do it. I think we, We're not actually telling kids they know what they need for themselves. So, I think when we allow kids to have more [00:11:00] autonomy in how they go about their world and how they learn, and give them a voice and give them the ability to say no, um, I'm not interested, or, That doesn't feel safe, or that, that is too confusing or too overwhelming.

I think there's such a, there's not a surge. It's just our awareness of anxiety and, uh, different ways of being in the world. Um, but when we don't like really hear our kids, I think something gets squashed down. And we become adults that don't believe we're valued and that we're worthy of having our own opinions and saying no.

And it's, I don't know, it's just like, this foundation that if you don't provide, you know, everything we do has consequences whether they're positive or [00:12:00] negative, but I just really want to create a foundation that they, they feel like they have a voice. They're worthy of that voice. And that people will listen.

And if people don't listen, they have strategies to still be heard. Um, so I think honestly, like, it's about that foundation. And I, I can only hope that what I'm doing works. You know, I think that my parents did a very good job of, I have a twin sister and I have a brother. And I think we all, really do have like this foundational level of truly like self worth, which translates into self

Ela Richmond: Mm

Tess Scholl: confidence and self awareness and, and like an understanding of who we are in the world.

So I'm trying to keep that

Ela Richmond: Yeah, I think, I think that's understated. Um, [00:13:00] this, this confidence in self, right? Like, the confidence that I can have an opinion and I can have a thought and I can share my thought. And like, um, it's funny that you mentioned this because I've been reflecting a lot on just my own journey personally, like, into adulthood and beyond and just kind of thinking through.

One of the things that have been the most challenging in my life, and one of them, honestly, and even looking at so many of my friends as well, who are all adults, um, is the confidence when you ask the question, what do you want? confidence in the answer that comes after. And like, it's so interesting to me because, If you go down a path that's already prescribed for you, it's easy.

You don't have to answer that question. You don't even have to ask it and you can just walk and that's it. You're just checking boxes and you're walking. But, um, I have a really close friend and he is so ready to do his own things. So ready to chart his own path [00:14:00] and, uh, walk his own way. And the part that he's been struggling most with is answering the question, what do I want?

Because There's no right answer. It's just, what do you want? Now walk. And like, and you just have to have confidence in yourself and your ability to walk forward and, you know, take a left turn whenever you don't like, um, what's in front of you, but like, but I think that's fundamental, is being able to have the confidence in yourself, in your own wants and desires, and Recognizing that nobody else can tell you what to do.

Nobody else can tell you what life to live. It's like there, it's a part of the human condition that you are the one that bears the consequences of your choices. So you are the one that gets to choose. And with that is that fundamental confidence and necessary confidence to say, okay, this is where I'm going.

This is what I'm doing.

Tess Scholl: Yeah, and some things that I'm thinking about when [00:15:00] you, when you explain that situation is that, to me, it seems super easy, like, just say what you want, just like,

Ela Richmond: Yeah, exactly.

Tess Scholl: if we're, if we're, we have different, like, upbringing, we have different experiences, we have different educational experiences, and I am so thankful that that was given to me.

Like that, to have a voice and for it to be heard and honoured. But it's actually like not a thing that is just Not all kids experience that. And so that's where this fundamental part that you talk about comes from is that I have so many friends that what do you want is just like so overwhelming to them because they didn't grow up being asked, what do you want?

How do you want it? Like, and then that being listened to, [00:16:00] um, and I wouldn't say how, you know, historic schools have. Ask kids what they want and how do you want to do it? And what is your idea? And what, you know, like we haven't said, we value you so much that we truly want to hear you, you know? And if we don't get that fundamentally, of course it's overwhelming as an adult.

Trying to make your own decisions when the school told you to do this at this time, in this way. And potentially you had parents that parented from more of a, a position that was, um, kind of telling you what to do potentially. And so it seems easy as a young adult, uh, to be like, Oh, I'm just going to go ahead and like decide my whole life.

Right. Thank you. That's so overwhelming if you are not given those skills and, and, and VA and, um, your opinion hasn't been valued in the past. [00:17:00] Um, and so yeah, I you said it's been understated and I honest That's so true. Really, really, really has

Ela Richmond: I want your take on this. Um, what is the balance between challenge and validation, right? So like, it's really important to validate in the sense that somebody says something, somebody has an opinion, you're like, I hear you, but also challenging. You know, the world isn't just going to listen to your kids.

The world is not just going to say, Oh, you have a voice, like, let me listen to you. Right. Sometimes you have to fight to be heard. Sometimes you have to, um, either petition or in a business setting, for example, you have to create a pitch deck or like you have to sometimes make yourself be heard. And the, the, like the center of that is how badly do you want to say what you're trying to say, or.

How much, how necessary do you think it is? So as a child, right, like you can't get your kid used [00:18:00] to always being heard and always being valued because then the second that they're not, um, then they'll be frustrated or like that they won't understand which I guess is the cool thing about like kids playing with each other is there's that whole dynamic that already comes up naturally.

But how do you as a parent introduce that level of challenge as well?

Tess Scholl: That's a good question. I feel like I can answer it better like in an adult setting, which

Ela Richmond: Yeah, go for it.

Tess Scholl: Um, I think that we, it's important to recognize that we don't. We don't do anything in isolation, to be honest with you. When, when I hear friends say, Oh, I raised myself since I was six. I'm like, I hear you.

And that's no way true. We, we, we parent with other people around, we have colleagues when [00:19:00] we work. And if we don't kind of, if we don't honor like everyone else's experience, Um, as valid, then we also. We take away the enrichment of being in a community, and so when we teach kids to, um, their voices are heard, we also need to teach kids that They're not the only ones in the room.

They're not the only ones that create this web of community or structure or work environment. And so when we teach our kids that your voice is valued, we also have to teach kids that everyone else's voice is valued and everyone else's experience plays into the greater fabric of community. So if my kids are, you know, starting a new job and they're [00:20:00] like, I don't know, let's say 21 and, and, you know, the mentality shouldn't be, I'm worthy of a voice and you have to listen to me.

Right. Like, not like the righteous part, it, it should be like, I have a value to bring to whatever it is, like in more of a holistic way. So I want to make sure that when I teach my kids, they have a voice. They also have a responsibility to, to let everyone else have a voice too. So that it's more like, um, it's a collaboration.

Um, In, uh, in those kinds of circumstances. And of course, you know, when you're little, it needs to be at a fundamental level of like, I have a voice. Don't do that.

Ela Richmond: Yeah, 100%.

Tess Scholl: and things like that. So, you know, it starts that way, but all of this is so much more [00:21:00] valuable as an adult.

But again, if you, if you don't have a voice as an individual, how, how are you to encourage other people to have a voice? You know, and, um. But yeah, in homeschool, it's very important to realize that you, there's other people and other cultures and, and to really be mindful in how we, um, how we support our kids to interact with the greater world.

I don't know if that even answered your question. Actually, I

Ela Richmond: Well, I think the emphasis, yeah, the emphasis on, on the community aspect is important. It's the idea that like, okay, we are better together. And so, um, the whole notion of let's listen to everybody, let's listen to everybody's voices. Like the reason that, that. Listening to other people is actually important is because, uh, we all have different gifts.

Like, we're all gifted and talented in different ways and different, uh, means. And so, like, [00:22:00] there was this one post that Matt Bowman posted recently, um, on LinkedIn and he was basically like, I took this group of, of Utah Open Ed students to an office in eBay. Uh, the, the eBay office that the company, the big company, um, and the executives there were like, oh, we're just going to do something like really fun for these little kids.

We're going to give them some, some prompts and then, um, they're going to give us some ideas and they're going to be not great, but like, we're just going to, you know, we're going to make them, Happy and this is just going to be like our little thing that we do. And he was like, it was funny because 20 minutes into the, into the whole situation, all of the executives are taking so many notes because these 10 year olds have incredible ideas because nobody told them what's not possible.

So they have so many incredible ideas about what the company could do, how they could structure, how they could offer more value to, to, to customers, et cetera. And, um, I think that emphasizes it. Well, it's like. When you have a subset of the population that you just don't [00:23:00] listen to, or when you have people that you don't listen to, sometimes you're taking away from the opportunity to build and to create, to create more value.

Um, but I want to use

Tess Scholl: can't get estimated the kids. Right. Yeah.

Ela Richmond: I want to use this to kind of segue into your company because I know that, um, I was reading some of the stuff on your website and you were saying when you don't see what you want in the world, create it. So into this, create it. Um, what did you not see? Why did you decide to create Knowledge Seekers?

What is it? And kind of let me in on your, your mission, your purpose, what you're creating here.

Tess Scholl: Yeah, let's see, what didn't I see? I live in Northeast Portland and, um, I, I mean, there's potentially a program that I don't know about. Um, there's some co ops in the area. Um, more traditional co ops where parents are fully [00:24:00] involved and kids go, um, very, very part time limited and they usually have like a theme and they're wonderful for that community aspect and, and building, um, social relations and, um, I'm very, very into balance in my life.

Um, and what I wanted was something where I could be with my kids. I could, a scenario where I could be with my kids, I could be their teacher, but I could also not be their teacher. Um, I could also find a place that was able to give them what they wanted and And, um, and I would also have an opportunity to, um, have time for myself and really, um, create the balance that I needed in homeschool because it can become really overwhelming with doing every single subject and making [00:25:00] every single subject fun and exciting and hands on.

And, and so, um, you know, I'm, I'm a big believer in knowing your limits. I don't have an education background. Um, I have a social work background and, and, um, so I have been doing this for five years. So this is the fifth year, but, um, I gained balance. So I wanted to find something and we had previously been doing a two day program.

Um, Too far away. It was, I, I couldn't handle it anymore. I couldn't do the commute. It was too much. And so I, you know, I, I asked my boys like, what, what do you want? And they said essentially two things. They said, we want to decide what we learn and we want it to be really hands on and project based. And so then it was like, just a conversation with myself and, and, and, and our situation and trying to figure out.

How do I get them what they want [00:26:00] and also give our family what we need and, and really what I want. Right. I wanted a balance. And so, um, I looked into like different options. And if I had like, A really big house and all this room to like have a school in my house, I would have done that and I would have hired a teacher and I would have done it out of my house and it would have been very low key.

No, no, no, like huge thing, but I don't. And so, um, I had to find a location and I had to find a teacher and it just turned into this amazing opportunity to share all of this with other families and to try to create community. Um, Of families and kids that were looking for similar things, that they were looking for hands on, that they wanted.

Um, kids to have a voice. And that goes back to like what we talked about at the beginning of the podcast. [00:27:00] You know, when we have, I mean, when you have a voice in what you are learning, you're more invested in, um, the outcome or how much energy you put into something. And, and I think that's really true for kids.

And, um, I don't think it happens often or enough. And so even at OWL Collective, we're working with the kids to, uh, to have a voice. You know, if kids are coming from, to our program from public, they don't know what that looks like. They don't know what it looks like to have a voice and actually make a choice or say no or have a different opinion.

Ela Richmond: Mm

Tess Scholl: been really nice to hear the kids try to come up with solutions when they, when it's time for them to have a voice. Um, It takes them a moment to, uh, like work together as a team, [00:28:00] because the, the idea of, um, Knowledge Seekers is that, um, like I said at the beginning, we don't do anything in isolation.

And, yeah, the collective, we, um, we're there together, um, and it's the job. of the teacher to be a guide and to help the students have a voice and come up with what they want to learn. So it's a constant conversation about like, what do you want to learn? What, how do you learn? And, um, like what brings you joy?

And, um, how can we work together as the teacher and the student? And even the parents different goals for their children. Um, I have different goals for my boys personally, and I, the collective is all about working in collaboration to meet everyone's goals. And so that's what we're trying to do in a very hands [00:29:00] on, um, way. So that's generally kind of, that's the gist of

Ela Richmond: Yeah, I love that. Can you explain, um, one of the things that you mentioned was that like you have them each have an opportunity to share their opinions, to share what they're thinking. What's an example of that? Like, I don't know if there's a specific instance that comes to mind. Um, but what's an example of them all collaborating to share something together?

Tess Scholl: Yeah, so recently they, I don't know how it came about, but they all of a sudden decided they were doing a play. And it was not, there was no plan for a play that day. So The, the kids kind of have these ideas, the teachers listen, she creates a lesson plan on what the children have, um, kind of indicated they're interested in.

So she had like a general plan of topics they were doing that day, [00:30:00] but then all of a sudden they were just doing a play, right? They, they said, we're doing a play. And so she's like, okay, like, so they started working on the play and they've decided it Based on Hansel and Gretel, um, which I personally have no idea how my kids know about that like that.

Sorry But um, you know when it's morphed, but what's been really interesting because I'm upstairs in the attic like doing, you know, Admin stuff so I can hear them, but I can't hear everything but it's been really fascinating to hear them have their own individual personalities and voices, but also really having to consciously let other kids have their boy voice without squashing it.

Right? So my kids have an idea, but another kid doesn't want to do that. So they've had to be like, Oh, so how do we [00:31:00] incorporate everyone's ideas and how do we incorporate, um, um, Uh, like we have one student that wants to write every single thing down and it's this amazing opportunity for her to be creative and how she writes and to, um, you know, for her that like doing a play makes sense to have a, a script.

And so she's been really having, um, a nice time, like writing it out and being very strategic about it. And my boys are like, We don't need a script. We memorize everything. And so there's these, that's like so different and personalities, but they've been all working together. Like, how do we have a script, but not have a script?

And how do we make sure everyone gets what they need? And, um, you know, the teacher has been really great about helping them navigate that social interaction. And so the whole play was 100%. The, it was just amazing to see that [00:32:00] evolve and we're going to. Like, invite all the family and have like a little play and they've been doing all of the, um, you know, everyone has different skills they've been working on.

Someone's been working on the props and, um, so it's just really, it's nice. But to have something evolve so organically and then have it continue because it's, It's such an amazing social opportunity to learn. How do you work together to put on a play and honor everyone's, um, voices? Yeah. It was, it's been really interesting.

Ela Richmond: Yeah, I love that. That sounds so fun. Um, and it's, it's, it, it's a great example of Peter Gray's whole idea of play being so important for kids to just learn random, um, human things, like to, to collaborate, to build together, or, to disagree [00:33:00] and then figure out how we're going to compromise. Things like that, where you don't learn it by any other way than just doing it.

And to learn it with other students is so, so, so valuable early on. Um,

Tess Scholl: agree.

Ela Richmond: I'm gonna hit you with some rapid fire questions if that's okay.

Tess Scholl: Oh yeah, sure.

Ela Richmond: All right, so this is going to close us out. So first rapid fire question has to do with curriculum resources, things like that, because parents are always looking for curriculum, um, either some sort of app or game or something that other parents are loving.

What is something that you're really loving right now

Tess Scholl: That's a good question. So, I only use curriculum for, um, spelling and reading. Um, and I do that for a very specific reason, and that's because that's what I have always found challenging. And so, I have essentially, Winged every single subject except for reading and spelling. [00:34:00] Um, you know, we, we often do a lot of things out of fear.

And so that's my, um, that's mine is that, you know, I don't, I didn't get the fundamentals of that, so I don't feel like I can teach it or wing it. And so, um, what I've actually been liking in that kind of arena is a free. Website that you create an account and you become a teacher and you have like a little classroom.

It's called quill Q u i l l, it might be like dot org. Um But it's a grammar program and um, I like it because I can assign specific things It's something that I don't have to stress about because I don't know how to teach grammar. I That's not my strong point. I have a lot of [00:35:00] strengths and that's not one of them.

And so, and it's pretty, like, hands off. It's something my boys can do by themselves. Um, so as far as like a free, great addition to any kind of curriculum, I would say Quill. Um, I'm not huge on specific curriculum, so I'm trying to think of like,

Ela Richmond: or resources, or if there's even something. Inside of your, um, the Knowledge Seekers program that really works for your students. Like, maybe it's some sort of game, or maybe it's some sort of fun thing that you'll like to do. Um, yeah, any, any tips for homeschool parents?

Tess Scholl: Yeah. Okay. Let's see. Tips. Tips. Definitely. So I need to get better about this. Um, I am a very structured person in certain ways. I like to, um, if I'm going to spend time doing something, I want to see results and that's on me, right? It's got nothing to do with my [00:36:00] kids. I can guarantee they're the opposite.

So I think a good tip is just like allowing yourself to not actually doing Do what you have planned to do And to be okay with it, and I'm actually really bad at that So like I just need to listen to my own tip in this scenario um, and I think a really good tip for like life, and I was thinking about this earlier today is Being kind to yourself and giving yourself grace and not going into the guilt spiral of not being enough and doing enough.

Um, I think to remind ourselves that we often truly do the best In the, like, in the micro moments that we have. So like, sure. When we look back, was it our best? [00:37:00] No, but did we try to do the best in those moments? Yes. And I think that truly, um, reminding yourself that you did the best in the moments and then giving yourself permission to like, be okay with that, I think is fundamental to being successful.

in life and as a homeschooler, right? Like being like, okay, that didn't go well, but I

Ela Richmond: Mm hmm.

Tess Scholl: the best in the moments that I had. And then I would say the big, a really good tip, which I hope most people are doing is just finding community because You know, I can only imagine how detailed, um, and complicated homeschooling is going to get when I'm homeschooling, um, my kids as they age and go through their different, um, challenges in their own lives.

And so I know that community is going to be really important and finding the [00:38:00] community that, that makes me and my family thrive. It

Ela Richmond: Yeah.

Tess Scholl: it's from a place of, you know, like love.

Ela Richmond: I'm curious, are you more interested in community for yourself or for your kids or both? Because I feel like what's interesting is I see so many parents connecting, um, but initially the question is like, how do I find community for my kids and then the parents also find community, which is really cool.

Mm

Tess Scholl: Yeah, so I have always been, my favorite thing is forming community and, and, and learning about people. Um, I mean, I'll tell you my whole life story and like the first time I meet you and I, and I want to know about people truly like what makes them tick and who they are as a person. And, um, And so that's incredibly important for me, and I do have a community, like I have some amazing friends, and that developed more when I had kids.

And, um, and I [00:39:00] became a parent, I found people that I connected with, and that's only blossomed as my kids have gotten older. And so, um, That was a community for my kids also because it was it started as a parent. So all the people I connected with had kids and so my kids do also have a community by virtue of me really needing a community.

Um, and Um, Knowledge Seekers is just another iteration of how do, how do I create a life of balance where I can, we can be kind of the happiest family. We can be and part of that is outsourcing some of my kids education

Ela Richmond: Mm hmm.

Tess Scholl: someone that um, our teacher julia is incredible she's Amazing at really listening to the [00:40:00] kids and and and also Infusing that part of like the challenge.

You talked about the challenge, like at what point, like, you know, that kind of dance with the challenge. And so challenging the kids and their abilities, um, at the same time, she's really skilled at doing that. And, and just coming up with. Helping the kids come up with projects or, you know, the program's not about letting the kids do whatever they want, whenever they want.

It's about, um, creating learning opportunities that allow them to, um, uh, You know, create a passion for learning, and we don't know what we don't know, right? So, Julia definitely comes up with projects that they didn't necessarily say they wanted to do, but by learning the student and how they work and, and their desires, um, she's able to help, um, [00:41:00] Design the program so that it is interesting to the kids and it is what they, you know, have, um, kind of, um, they may not have chosen to study Antarctica, but she knows that we have this little, this student that's obsessed with penguins.

So why not create a huge unit study that covers all of that? So many different areas. And one of those areas is penguins. So it's about that holistic approach. And, um, Julia does an amazing job of, um, creating that learning environment of passion.

Ela Richmond: Awesome. And then the last question for you is about what, your biggest challenge. What was your biggest challenge throughout this homeschool journey so far and how did you overcome it? And or if you have not yet overcome it, um, how are you solving it currently?

Tess Scholl: Yeah, it's, I think it's the piece we talked about where, um, [00:42:00] I'm not a huge component of like, uh, state standards. But there's a, a fear because you know, it's my, it's to do with me, it's never to do with your kids just FYI, it's usually, you know, it's the fear that they won't know A, B, and C and then, you know, be able to do the big D that they're looking for, whatever it is, right?

And so I'm often like, okay, we need to do this spelling, we need to do this math, because I do spelling and math with my kids. Because Knowledge Seekers is the arts, the sciences, and the humanities. So, um, I, I feel like I'm too rigid in like what we need to do each day. And so, recently I, I, I've been stepping back and being like, Okay, how, how can we, How can I have my needs met and my goals for my kids without them being [00:43:00] resistant and not wanting to do it?

Cause like, I don't know how to make spelling interesting. So, like, how can we do things differently to, um, still create The desire to learn

Ela Richmond: hmm.

Tess Scholl: me. And so that has just been me stepping back, reaching out. I've had to reach out to like different friends and other homeschoolers and really just like have more of an intentional thought process around how do I make math more interesting or like not as pressured.

So that's my challenge right now, that I think this is going to be, like, life long. Until they graduate, I'm going to be pushing, I'm going to have to push myself to let go more. For sure.

Ela Richmond: Likely. Well, this has been incredible.

Tess Scholl: Just be okay with the fact that they haven't done math that whole day. Yeah.

Ela Richmond: yeah, it's, it's grace. It's, it's like not every day [00:44:00] is going to look the same and it's okay. Well, this has been really, really incredible. Thank you for coming on and sharing everything. Um, sharing all about knowledge seekers and, and your kids and families. Just aspirations with learning and curiosity and fostering spirits that care about, you know, Learning and doing something in this world, creating the things that, um, don't yet exist.

So very excited and happy that we could, we could have you on the podcast.

Tess Scholl: Yeah. Yeah. And I'm really, um, you know, we talked about the community part. Um, I'm really invested in just helping people become less overwhelmed with the whole homeschool process. So I keep telling people, if you just have questions, it's not, I, of course I want more students in my classroom, but what I want is families that feel like, They can do it.

And so if that means asking me a bunch of questions, like I would rather have a 45 minute conversation with a [00:45:00] family to make them feel more comfortable than to get those kids in my classroom, right? And so, um, if anyone ever has any questions, please email me and resources. I mean, I live in Portland, Oregon, so that's where I'm going to have most of my knowledge, but I'd love to just hear from parents that needed support.

Okay. For sure.

Ela Richmond: Yeah, that would be awesome. Well, thanks again so much. This was

Tess Scholl: Thank you so much. I, I really enjoyed that. And, um, yeah, thanks for being, giving me the space.
