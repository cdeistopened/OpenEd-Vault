"Have We Been Teaching STEM Completely Backwards?"

## Show Notes:

**Rethinking STEM: Keeping Curiosity at the Heart of Education**

Jack Casdorph, a mechanical engineer developing hands-on physics kits, and Rachel Davie, a former math teacher now homeschooling her children, explore what's broken in traditional science education and how project-based learning transforms how children engage with STEM subjects.

Through personal stories and professional insights, our guests reveal how traditional education often extinguishes natural curiosity and fails to connect theory with real-world applications. Jack introduces his STEM spectrum concept showing the imbalance between theoretical knowledge and practical skills, while Rachel provides perspectives from both classroom teaching and homeschooling environments.

## Creative Mashup Concept

Caption: Sesame Street's scientific method is better than what schools teach

  

FB:

The way science is taught in most schools is backwards, and Sesame Street proves it.  
Instead of the convoluted steps kids are forced to memorize in classrooms, Sesame Street distilled it down to three words that actually work: 'I wonder, what if, let's try.'  
This engineer spent years in formal education only to discover that a show aimed at toddlers had already solved what academia couldn't – how to teach science without killing curiosity.  
Listen to what happens when education drops the bureaucratic nonsense and gets back to what matters.

```Plain


[CLIP - COMBINED]
[00:06:33-00:06:58] "My favorite version of the steps of the scientific method that I've found actually comes from watching Sesame Street with my kids. Their version is, 'I wonder, what if, let's try.' Obviously there are sub-steps you could break down, you could overcomplicate it, but I really like that version of just like, let's try it."

[Visual overlay: Brief clips from the Sesame Street video showing the "I wonder" gesture (finger to temple), "what if" gesture (finger to chin), and "let's try" gesture (finger in the air)]

[00:15:08-00:15:32] "The natural way humans learn is by doing something, running into a problem, and then seeking the knowledge needed to overcome that obstacle. Traditional education often does the opposite - it frontloads all this information without context and hopes students will remember it for when they eventually need it."

1. **Bold Challenge Statement:**  
    "Science education has it backwards"
2. **Problem-Solution Format:**  
    "Complex scientific method → 'I wonder, what if, let's try'"
3. **Counterintuitive Statement:**  
    "Kids already know the scientific method better than schools"
4. **Question Format:**  
    "What if we simplified science back to curiosity?"
5. **Secret Revealed:**  
    "The three-word scientific method schools don't teach"

## Production Notes:

1. When showing the Sesame Street clips, focus on the gestures and problem-solving approach rather than extended segments with lyrics.
2. Consider using visual annotations that highlight the three steps ("I wonder" → "What if" → "Let's try") as they appear in the video.
3. You could include brief glimpses of characters building with alternative materials to illustrate the problem-solving process without including the song itself.
4. The message should emphasize how this simplified approach captures the essence of scientific thinking better than the rigid multi-step method typically taught in schools.

  

  

## Clip #1 (Science Education Critique)

  

This is why kids hate science class.

```Plain
[CLIP #1 - COMBINED]
[00:00:00-00:00:40] "When I was in like third grade, I was convinced that I didn't like science... we spent like a half hour doing a writeup on this thing where she dictated in front of the entire class, verbatim what we were supposed to write... even though matter and energy were not created or destroyed, my interest in science at the time was totally destroyed."

[00:06:26-00:07:00] "I think that traditional education spends maybe a little bit too much time on the theoretical side... tends to start with the theory and then kind of move towards application and problem solving... typically the practical side isn't even touched in a lot of education. That's why kids ask 'When are we gonna use this in real life?'"
```

## Clip #2 (The Treehouse Project - Project-Based Learning)

```Plain
[CLIP #2 - 11:00 to 11:45]
"When I was about eight or nine, I came up to my dad and I asked him if he could build me a tree house and his response was, 'Nope. But I can help you build a tree house.' I was kind of a bit confused by that, but I was like, well, whatever. I'm getting a tree house. So he told me that before we could actually start building in a tree, he wanted me to get better at climbing a tree. So we went out, he showed off a little bit of his own climbing skills, and told me some benchmarks that he wanted me to meet before I could be considered 'monkey enough' to build a tree house in a tree."
```

The first clip captures the critique of traditional education with the personal story and theoretical insight. The second clip stands alone as a complete project-based learning example that has a clear beginning and context for the listener.

## Transcript

Jack, Rachael, Andrea

**Jack Casdorph:** [00:00:00] when I was in like third grade, I was convinced that I didn't like science. we spent like a half hour doing a writeup on this thing where she dictated in front of the entire class, verbatim what we were supposed to write even though matter and energy were not created or destroyed, my interest in science at the time was totally destroyed.

  

**Andrea Fife:** Welcome back to the Open Ed Podcast. Before we get going, I would love to tell you about today's guests. So meet Jack, a mechanical engineer with a passion for rethinking how we teach science. He has experienced nearly every type of education, firsthand, public, private, charter, and homeschool, and now runs Clean Your Craft, where he's developing hands-on physics kits and a Physics for Makers curriculum designed to spark real curiosity in kids.

And joining him today is Rachel, a former high school math teacher who now works online while homeschooling her [00:01:00] three kids with a deep passion for making math and science relatable and fun. She loves inspiring others to see the beauty in numbers and the wonder in how the world works. And I'm your sometimes host Andrea Fife.

Let's dive in and discover how to keep real curiosity at the heart of education. Welcome Jack and Rachel. Tell us a little bit about how you feel like, science education is going in the world today.

**Jack Casdorph:** I think that, science and the way it is taught should be fun, and it often isn't like it should be the subject where you get to do stuff, you get to. Touch things, you get to play with things, you get to see what they do. I guess that's true of art and definitely pe but other than that, you know, most things are kinda on book, on paper.

Science should be the break that kids get from that. But often it's not, it's just as much paper stuff as all the other subjects. I love science. That's probably gonna become apparent throughout this, [00:02:00] interview. And I love making and building and math and engineering all things related to that.

But when I was in like third grade, I was convinced that I didn't like science. The reason for that was because, I don't think I had a very good third grade science teacher. I'm not gonna name her. I don't even remember her name. But if I did, we'll just call her, Mrs. Smith. when Mrs.

Smith would have us do an experiment, I swear it was more about the writeup than, than the experiment. Like, I actually remember we did one where we put, like magnetized a needle and put it on like a foam packing peanut and put it in a bowl of water so that it could align with magnetic north, you know, basically the homemade compass. The experiment itself was fine, you know, it's a good way to learn, about magnetism, but it took like. 25 seconds to do. And then we spent like a half hour doing a writeup on this thing where she dictated in front of the entire class, verbatim what we were supposed to write in this writeup.

And it's the most boring thing ever. And she is going through, things [00:03:00] like Matter, was not created or destroyed. Energy is not created or destroyed. Things that are true, but ~~like I.~~ Not really even relevant. And the whole time, even as ~~like a,~~ a third grader, ~~um,~~ I could tell that this was, ~~I didn't,~~ I couldn't tell that it was a bad way to teach science.

I just thought that science sucked. ~~Um,~~ but I could tell that there was something wrong with this. And I was just thinking like, Of course, matter wasn't created, destroyed. ~~We,~~ we put a piece of foam and a little metal stick and water, like what did you think was gonna happen? the whole thing just felt ridiculous.

~~uh,~~ even though matter and energy were not created or destroyed, ~~um,~~ my interest in science at the time was totally destroyed, ~~uh,~~ because I thought it was just some bureaucratic rule following thing where you just had to write a bunch of stuff down just 'cause you know, the man said you had to. It wasn't until a few years later that I came to realize, oh, science is amazing. ~~Uh,~~ Mrs. Smith wasn't the best.

**Rachael Davie:** I agree with all of that. I feel like learning math and science should be fun and so often it's just not. And sometimes it's the way that you're even taught [00:04:00] to teach that is not fun. I feel like I, when I was teaching high school, I was on the other side of that issue. So as a classroom teacher, my first few years of teaching, you know, all my training and everything, my focus was about ensuring students. We're proficient, ~~um,~~ teaching them exactly how to approach a problem, follow the steps, check every box, make sure you get the right answer. But over time, I realized that this approach was limiting for students, some remedial students, but actually more often for my advanced students, my honors level students, this took their thinking and really limited them.

It, their thinking became almost robotic. So if they were given a question and it didn't look. Exactly like the examples they were given before they would freeze up, they would have no idea how to even get started. So since then, I have come a long ways and I've come to understand that true understanding doesn't come from drilling those textbook procedures. It takes creativity and flexibility, and sometimes even [00:05:00] pushing students, making them think for themselves, because sometimes that's actually even a challenge.

**Jack Casdorph:** Yeah, I think it found it interesting that you mentioned like drilling or memorizing textbooks, procedures. I swear every single year, every science class I had, we would spend like a week or two going over the steps of the scientific method. memorizing each one and one thing, it felt really redundant and it felt like those steps didn't actually match up super well with what I consider to be like real investigating or learning that it doesn't always follow these rigid steps. It's not always in order. Sometimes you go a little bit and then you have to go back because. You discovered something and screwed something up.

And so like, well, why write a conclusion when your results were bad? ~~Just,~~ just go back and change something and get better results. ~~So I,~~ I found it interesting as, ~~um,~~ my favorite version of the steps of the scientific method that I've found, ~~uh,~~ actually is come from watching Sesame Street with my kids. Their version is, I wonder what [00:06:00] if, let's try, ~~um.~~ And obviously there are sub steps to that. You could break it down, you could overcomplicate it, but I really like that version of just like, let's try it.

**Andrea Fife:** ~~That's,~~ that's great. And it sounds like if you approached it that way, ~~uh,~~ students would probably be having more fun ~~For sure. Um.~~ Aside from just trying to inject fun into science or into math, you know, we're talking about some really related fields here. ~~Um,~~ really kind of this more comprehensive idea of stem.

~~Uh, what should,~~ what should we be doing to improve how STEM is approached?

**Jack Casdorph:** Yeah, I think that's a really good question. ~~I'm gonna actually pull up, uh, a little graphic that I've made. Um, okay. um,~~ I consider all of the, ~~uh,~~ stem things, science, technology, engineering, math, to be kind of ~~the,~~ the same basic thing just on different portions of a spectrum. ~~Um,~~ or if we're including steam, you know, we can include art there. It kind of, in my opinion, has its own spectrum of what's a little bit more technical and about, ~~um,~~ you know, following certain techniques or procedures.

And then what's more free flowing and ~~ab~~ artistic. ~~Um, but for these purposes, I'm gonna ignore art even though it's important. Um,~~ just talking about these basic, ~~uh,~~ [00:07:00] subjects, on the one end you have the completely theoretical or abstract, ~~uh,~~ just math. It just talks about like numbers and shapes and how those numbers and shapes relate to each other. ~~Uh,~~ next you have science, which science does its best to, ~~uh.~~ Describe and understand how the world around us works. ~~Um,~~ math often is a big part of that because math is kind of the language of science. You know, ~~it's~~ a lot of, ~~uh,~~ things out there and how those things work. They have mathematical relationships with each other, things tend to fall at a certain rate and we can assign. A number to that, ~~you know,~~ different things on different sides of a lever have a mathematical relationship to each other. ~~There's there,~~ there's math involved. ~~Um,~~ next we have engineering, which is kind of ~~the, uh,~~ the so what side of science? ~~Uh,~~ it basically is like, okay, so we've learned these things about how the world works now.

~~How,~~ how can we manipulate the world to. Make it more what we want it to be. ~~You know,~~ how can we optimize this thing? How can we tweak this, ~~um,~~ little [00:08:00] parameter or input variable to get ~~the, um,~~ the output that we want. ~~Um,~~ and then finally have technology, which is the kind of application of engineering and science. And I'm also gonna include, ~~um,~~ making and building as kind of a. Subset of technology. ~~Um,~~ in part those are things that I feel are, ~~um,~~ lacking ~~in,~~ in most traditional education is, ~~uh,~~ most kids don't know how to make anything. ~~Uh,~~ they don't know how to fix anything, ~~um,~~ unless they've really specifically sought out some sort of shop class or something.

~~But even then.~~ Generally the only the kids that seek that out are the kids that actually already have some of those aptitudes or have learned some of that stuff at home. ~~Um, I. Anyway, so, um,~~ the reason I talked about this whole spectrum thing, ~~um,~~ is I think that traditional education, ~~um,~~ spends maybe a little bit too much time over here on the left end that, you know, tends to start with the theory and then kind of move more towards the application and the problem solving, ~~and. And kind of somewhere over here.~~ Typically this stuff on the right ~~isn't even,~~ isn't even touched in a lot of education. ~~Um,~~ but that can lead to a couple of problems. One is, ~~um,~~ [00:09:00] as, ~~uh,~~ Rachel mentioned that you get these kind of kids who are a little bit robotic. ~~They know how to,~~ they know how to answer questions that are in a textbook.

You give them a textbook question, boom, they've got it, but then they don't know how to. Apply that, or they don't know how to write their own questions based off of what's happening around them. ~~Um,~~ and so they might, they're kind of end up lacking some of this problem solving and reasoning, even though they might be really great at like the computation and the facts. ~~Um, and another problem is, is it.~~ If you're only dealing with this, ~~uh,~~ left side here, then you get that constant question that kids ask of when are we gonna use this in real life? ~~Um, and I~~ I'm actually curious, ~~uh, with,~~ with both of you guys, ~~uh,~~ having teaching experience, ~~um,~~ have you guys ever gotten that question and kind of struggled ~~to,~~ to come up with an answer of when are you gonna use this?

**Rachael Davie:** A hundred times. Yes. And I think, ~~um, uh,~~ on one level you build trust with your students that, yes, we're building this skill and then we're going to use it in this application. ~~Um,~~ and so, ~~um,~~ building that trust with your students is, ~~um,~~ necessary, but you want [00:10:00] them to know, like, understand that this really and truly is something that's useful.

So what if, um, people didn't start on the left hand side of the spectrum? What happens if people start on the far right hand side of this spectrum and they start with, here is a problem and you don't have any of the skills needed? To solve this problem. ~~Um, do you think that, um,~~ I'm just interested in hearing your thoughts on, ~~um,~~ if you think that people can ~~start on the,~~ start on the right and ~~like~~ go back to the left.

~~How,~~ how do you feel about that?

**Jack Casdorph:** Yeah. ~~Um,~~ first of all, yes, the simple answer. Yes, you totally can. ~~Um,~~ and you often should. ~~Um,~~ so to illustrate this, ~~uh,~~ I wanted to give an example of, ~~uh,~~ a way ~~that my,~~ that my dad, ~~uh,~~ taught me. ~~Um,~~ so my dad is not what you would. I typically think of as an educator, ~~uh,~~ nor is he an academic of, of any kind. ~~Um,~~ but, ~~um,~~ when, I'm gonna go back just to touch. ~~Um,~~ obviously I, I have a mechanical engineering degree, so I took quite a bit of math. Science engineering classes, a lot of the, the stuff that dealt on the theoretical [00:11:00] side, but when it comes to like actually solving problems, whether the problem solving approach involves more theoretical or practical skills, ~~uh,~~ I, I feel like most of my knowledge related to problem solving, ~~um,~~ came from my dad, ~~um,~~ not from any of my PhD professors or, you know, highly accomplished. ~~Mentors are people that, that taught me, not that my dad isn't highly accomplished. Um, but~~ so I wanted to kinda explain a little bit what, what, teaching, ~~uh,~~ or being taught by my dad, ~~uh,~~ looks like. So when I was about eight or nine,

I came up to my dad and I asked him if he could build me a tree house and his response was, Nope. But I can help you build a tree house. ~~Uh,~~ and I, I was kind of a bit confused by that, but I was like, well, whatever. I'm getting a tree house. That's, that's all I really care about. ~~Um,~~ so I was like, okay, well if you're, if you're helping me build a tree house, let's, let's go, let's do it. ~~Uh,~~ and so he told me that before we could actually start building in a tree, ~~uh,~~ he wanted me to get better at climbing a tree. ~~Um,~~ so. We went out, he kind of showed off a little bit of, ~~uh,~~ his own climbing skills, ~~um,~~ and told me some, some [00:12:00] benchmarks that he wanted me to meet before I could be considered monkey enough to, ~~um,~~ to build, ~~uh,~~ a tree house and a tree. So. ~~Uh,~~ I spent the next couple of days climbing all over the trees in our yard, ~~um,~~ swinging from one branch to another, ~~uh,~~ jumping and swinging, practicing all sorts of fancy dismounts so that I could, ~~uh,~~ I could prove to my dad that I was, I was monkey enough to, to start doing this.

~~Um,~~ after ~~the,~~ the first day, ~~um,~~ I'm pretty sure I had already totally met his benchmarks and done some other, you know, ~~I. I,~~ I'm a pretty good climber and I already was. ~~Um,~~ but, ~~so~~ I'm pretty sure he just, ~~he~~ kept the monkey thing going for a few days 'cause he didn't have time to actually start doing stuff yet.

So he is like, okay, just ~~keep,~~ keep learning, keep at it. ~~We'll,~~ we'll start soon. ~~Maybe,~~ maybe tomorrow. ~~Um.~~ After I had finally, ~~uh,~~ been officially pronounced monkey enough, ~~um,~~ then he was like, okay, ~~uh,~~ next thing it was actually like, it was actually my birthday at the time, and he gave me a cordless drill, ~~uh,~~ along with a bunch of Phillips bits and some screws.

~~Um,~~ he knew that. ~~Um,~~ I was gonna be really bad at using it at first and that, ~~uh,~~ I was gonna trash a whole bunch of [00:13:00] bits, ~~uh,~~ you know, strip 'em so they don't really work anymore. ~~So,~~ but he was fine with that, that's why he got me a bunch. ~~Uh,~~ and then he was like, Hey, so I'm actually needing to replace a bunch of the deck boards ~~on the,~~ on the back deck ~~and.~~ I need someone with ~~like~~ a brand new drill, who needs to learn how to use it a little bit? Who could put a bunch of screws down? ~~Do you,~~ do you

know anybody like that? ~~Uh,~~ which is very much my dad's way ~~of,~~ of teaching and approaching things. ~~Um,~~ I'm not sure if it's been mentioned yet. ~~So~~ Andrea is actually my sister. We have the same dad. ~~Um,~~ so ~~she might,~~ she might be laughing, ~~uh,~~ a little bit at ~~these, uh. Some of~~ these stories because of that. ~~Um,~~ then once I had put down a whole bunch of screws in the deck, ~~um,~~ and made him super frustrated because he had to take out a whole bunch of screws that I had stripped really bad, ~~uh,~~ but I got to where I was at least. Pretty okay at it then I was like, okay, ~~we can,~~ we can build the tree house right now, right? ~~I can,~~ I can use the tools. I can use tools in a tree. ~~Uh,~~ it's like, yeah, mostly. But before we actually go out and get materials, ~~uh,~~ we need to come up with a design of what we're gonna make so that we know what materials to get. ~~Uh,~~ so then he ~~had me, um,~~ gave me ~~like~~ [00:14:00] a pencil and paper and ruler and had me draw out a whole bunch of different designs. ~~Um.~~ I learned pretty quickly like what I needed to do, how I needed to draw so that my dad could actually understand ~~what,~~ what I just scribbled on paper. And he gave me ~~some,~~ some tips on how to do different views, ~~uh,~~ things like that. ~~And. Uh,~~ it also just so happened that at the same time, ~~um,~~ in my school, we were supposed to do this ~~like~~ big project competition thing, ~~uh,~~ where the prompt was we were just supposed to make something to represent some sort of dream that I had. ~~Uh,~~ so my parents were like, well, you seem to have a dream about having a tree house, so why don't you make like a miniature tree house out of Popsicle sticks?

And that can be ~~your,~~ your dream. And that can also be like. Another step of you designing ~~this,~~ this thing. So I did that. ~~Um,~~ I'm pretty sure ~~the,~~ that ~~the,~~ as part of that competition thing, I think my tree house thing actually like won at the school level and then at the regional level and then went to state.

And ~~I, I, I don't,~~ I guess it didn't win there 'cause I don't really remember what happened after that. ~~Um, but it, uh. Yeah, I think that's all I was gonna say. Just a second. Oh.~~ But yeah, it did pretty well in this [00:15:00] competition and ~~we,~~ I actually, ~~uh,~~ kind of learned and found out that it was also really useful to have, as I was talking with my dad, I was like, Hey, what if we put like a pulley and a bucket over here and, ~~uh,~~ maybe what about a fireman's pull?

And, you know, ~~we, we,~~ we talked about ~~all sorts of.~~ All sorts of things that, ~~um,~~ we didn't end up incorporating. But it was useful to have this thing that we could be like, okay, well what about right here? What are we gonna do here? And ~~it, uh,~~ it was really great to have.

**Rachael Davie:** It sounds like quite the interesting project. ~~It reminds me of just a few years ago,~~ my husband was replacing our wooden deck. ~~Um, and he,~~ the wooden steps needed a new stringer built

and he mentioned that to me. Like, oh, I need, ~~uh,~~ I need you to calculate how long this needs to be and what the angles need to be. And then he was cutting it out. I remember thinking, oh, this would be a great project for my students in the classroom because they were actually learning about solving right triangles then. And so I took some pictures and made them a fun little handout with some questions and presented it to the class. And interestingly, my class responded completely different than you did as a child. [00:16:00] Building your tree house. And they complained and they said it was too hard. And I got questions like, why can't we just do the worksheet on these? Why do we have to do such a hard problem? And it's because. They were stuck way over there on the left hand side of your spectrum with the math problems.

And that's, that whole other side of the spectrum was just a skill that they hadn't developed yet because it takes a lot more creativity and mental, you know, strength to wrestle with a problem and to figure it out. And that's a whole other set of skills that many of them just really hadn't developed yet.

~~And so it's,~~ it's interesting to me that, ~~um,~~ if you start at the end and you start with the why. Then go backwards and figure out all the, how sometimes ~~you, you, you know,~~ you have a totally different result.

**Andrea Fife:** there's also something to be said for it being your own problem that you're, that you're very invested in. You know, I wonder if those same students would've been a lot more motivated [00:17:00] if say their parents said, we can install a swimming pool if you can figure out how to replace the deck. Right.

And you know, I think students really see through the fake problems. We put in there in their path, even if it is like real world learning, if it isn't in their real world, I think sometimes it can still just feel like, okay, it's a well written textbook problem, but it still feels like a textbook problem if it's delivered in the classroom instead of on location, you know, screwdriver in hand in your own backyard, ~~building your.~~

Own? Well, ~~I think, uh. for sure, for sure. Um, actually, I mean,~~ I think this is ~~a, a,~~ a great thing to discuss. ~~There's a,~~ there's a word in academia for what we're talking about, which is, ~~you know,~~ project-based learning, ~~um, you know, and,~~ and ~~the,~~ the challenges to project-based learning, why people maybe shy away from this, ~~you know,~~ what it is, what it works well.

~~Um, you know,~~ but what Jack is describing as, ~~you know, what he.~~ The way that, ~~that his dad,~~ our dad teaches, ~~uh,~~ [00:18:00] a lot of teachers would probably call project based learning.

**Jack Casdorph:** Yeah. ~~Um, I,~~ I think that is, ~~uh,~~ so we didn't know that at the time, and ~~I'm,~~ I'm sure my ~~dad,~~ dad still doesn't, ~~um,~~ because ~~he, uh, like I said,~~ he doesn't have any formal. Background in any sort of, ~~uh, formal teaching or~~ teaching philosophies, even though I consider him to be a really good one-on-one, ~~um,~~ teacher. ~~Um,~~ but ~~yeah, um,~~ he could have totally just, ~~um,~~ built the treehouse by himself. ~~He's,~~ he's a really skilled builder. It wouldn't have been that big of a deal for him. ~~Um,~~ but instead he saw that I was ~~like~~ really excited, ~~uh,~~ about something. ~~Um,~~ which I think can be ~~the,~~ the difference between ~~the, as Andrea was talking about, the, um,~~ the real world based problem, that's still a textbook problem because it's, ~~you know,~~ based off of someone else's real world.

The kid might go, okay, well I'm, I'm not a framer, so what do I care about? Stair stringers? Like, I'm never gonna do that. ~~Um. It.~~ But if it's something that the kid is already really excited about and willing to put in ~~a lot of,~~ a lot of work for, ~~um,~~ that's, that's where project based learning ~~can,~~ can really excel. ~~Um,~~ and that's where ~~I was,~~ I was really excited about this tree house thing. ~~Um,~~ and he saw that. So he is like, okay, ~~uh,~~ I can use this to teach my kid a whole bunch of [00:19:00] stuff. ~~Um.~~ And in the process I learned how to use power tools. I learned how to climb trees. I got good exercise. I learned how to make technical sketches and to communicate those ideas and draw better. ~~Um, you know, I,~~ I learned a lot of things. ~~Um.~~ And I think all in all, I probably spent like 120 hours of ~~like~~ really self-motivated learning doing these things. And my dad probably put in like five or 10 hours of ~~like, you know,~~ occasionally ~~give,~~ giving me some feedback or presenting me with a new challenge. ~~Um,~~ and then, ~~you know,~~ he spent money ~~on a.~~ On a cordless drill and Popsicle sticks ~~and other,~~ and other supplies too. But, ~~um,~~ I think all in all, ~~for the,~~ for the time and money he put in, he was able to get ~~like~~ quite a bit of, ~~um, I. Learning and~~ excited learning out of me. So in that case, ~~um,~~ I think the project-based learning, you know, starting from the I want to make something, I want to accomplish something, and then figuring out how, I think that worked pretty well for me.

~~Um.~~ Also as a side note, ~~um,~~ a lot of employers out there, ~~um,~~ are [00:20:00] starting to hire based more off of the skills that a candidate has than their, ~~um,~~ degree or academic credentials. But there's still that question, well, ~~how do you.~~ How do you communicate that you have a skill, ~~um,~~ and you can say it, but ~~that's~~ if you don't have a degree or credential to back it up, then what, what does it mean anything?

Well, ~~um,~~ a good thing about this project based stuff is that if you have done a bunch of projects ~~and you document blah~~ and you document that you can create like a portfolio that you could present and use to demonstrate the skills that you've learned.

**Andrea Fife:** ~~I think that's, yeah. Excellent.~~ Rachel, I'm really interested because ~~you've, uh,~~ you've been an educator in the classroom, but you also teach your own kids at home. I'm really curious ~~what you, how,~~ how that differs for you, what you feel like you can implement in a classroom versus, ~~uh, versus what's,~~ what's possible with that open education style ~~you've,~~ you've chosen for your family.

**Rachael Davie:** Well, I feel like this whole discussion on project based learning brings ~~up.~~ Up a really important question. If we know that this is a great way of learning, [00:21:00] why aren't schools doing more project-based learning? And I think it comes down to logistics. If you have a class of 30 students and they all pick. 30 different projects. You can't feasibly come alongside every single one of them, ~~you know,~~ and help them. And if you need to develop a certain set of skills, there is no guarantee that the particular project they pick is going to hit on all of those skills ~~that you know~~ that they need to learn. They will probably learn some great skills, but you won't know until the project is done what those skills actually are. And so I think, ~~uh,~~ some of that. ~~Kind of~~ creating, ~~um,~~ a little bit of a structure and saying, okay, now here's something we can do and here's some of the skills. I really am hoping ~~that we, you know,~~ that we can learn as we go. And giving a little bit of choice within structure is kind of the way to go. And it's a lot easier when you don't have a full classroom of students. And when you have more flexibility and education and smaller numbers of students at a time, you have, ~~um,~~ a lot more. Ability to pick those [00:22:00] projects and go further with them.

**Andrea Fife:** ~~I, um,~~ I like everyone here. I've had ~~a,~~ a bunch of diverse education experiences. As a parent. I've chosen to partner with our local public schools to kind of handle that left end of the spectrum. ~~Uh,~~ with my kids, I feel like they're getting a pretty solid education there, but where I choose to supplement is more on, ~~on that.~~

That right hand of the spectrum, you know, asking questions about what they're studying in the classroom and then looking for ways to extend that at home, because I know I can do things at home one-on-one that I could never expect ~~my,~~ my kids, ~~uh,~~ teachers to be able to do in that educational setting.

~~I've,~~ I've chosen for them. ~~Um, you know,~~ so as a parent, whether you're a parent that is full-time. Homeschool if you're doing a hybrid model, if you're looking to supplement, ~~uh,~~ and give your kids more opportunities on that maker creator technology side. ~~Um,~~ Jack, do you have any recommended resources ~~for,~~ for parents ~~who are,~~ who are looking to do more ~~on,~~ on that side of the education spectrum?

**Jack Casdorph:** Yeah. So, ~~uh,~~ I think as both of you [00:23:00] guys mentioned, it can be a lot about, ~~um,~~ maybe picking and choosing, ~~um,~~ some things from here. You know, using the traditional in school education for some things and supplementing with this at home. ~~Um, there, there are a lot of things, uh, out there. Um, but, um.~~ This is where I'd like to talk, ~~uh,~~ specifically about, ~~um.~~ Some of the stuff that I'm developing. ~~Um,~~ so, ~~uh,~~ as was mentioned, ~~uh,~~ in the beginning, ~~um, my,~~ my wife and I are working on something we call, ~~uh,~~ creator's Craft Crates, ~~uh,~~ which includes both, ~~uh,~~ kits, physical kits, ~~uh,~~ for learning, ~~uh,~~ as well as curriculum. ~~Um,~~ now. ~~These,~~ these kits could be technically called stem kits.

~~Um,~~ I'm gonna choose to call them physics kits. ~~Uh,~~ the reason for that is, ~~um,~~ I have ~~some,~~ some problems with a lot of ~~the,~~ the STEM kits that are out there. ~~And~~ first of all, ~~um, I,~~ I feel like a lot of them are ~~just, they're~~ just toys. ~~Um,~~ they're just kinda cash grabs, ~~uh,~~ from companies where they've, ~~I. Uh,~~ thrown some educational stuff on the box so that ~~it,~~ it looks like it has educational value when ~~there's,~~ there's really not [00:24:00] much educational value there. ~~Uh,~~ the other problem I have with a lot of these kits out there, ~~um,~~ even though there are some great ones, I don't wanna put 'em all down, but. ~~Um,~~ most of them I feel like don't really leave any room for the kids to make creative choices or do their own thing. ~~Uh,~~ basically it's, you know, they start with something that is, ~~uh,~~ pre-designed and pre-manufactured to be a certain thing and the kids assemble that and it. Turns into that thing ~~and,~~ and that's it. ~~The, it,~~ it doesn't matter who got the box or what they decided to do, as long as they follow the instructions, everybody ends up with the same thing. And it might be a nice thing that's fun and ~~does~~ does what it's supposed to, but ~~I. What,~~ what did the kid really learn when all they're doing is just following instructions?

You know, basically their kit was just IKEA furniture that they get. ~~They,~~ they assemble it, they follow the instructions. It's just, in this case, the IKEA furniture is shaped like a dinosaur or a solar system, but ~~they're,~~ they're still not really creating, they're just assembling. ~~Um,~~ I think a good example of this, ~~um. in the, uh,~~ [00:25:00] in the Lego movie, for those who aren't familiar, ~~the~~ the main character Emmett, he starts out as, ~~uh,~~ a construction worker who just follows all of the instructions, ~~uh,~~ to the letter, including his social life. ~~He,~~ he watches the exact show that he's told he is supposed to watch, listens to the music he's told he is supposed to watch.

He's just, ~~uh,~~ an instruction follower. And then as the movie progresses, ~~uh,~~ he learns to start to pursue and develop his own original ideas. And that in doing so, ~~uh,~~ he becomes what they refer to as the master builders. ~~Um, I.~~ And I think it was really interesting that they used this specifically in the Lego movie because there are kind of two approaches to Lego. ~~Uh,~~ one is you get a really cool, ~~uh,~~ box and you follow the instructions and you end up with what's on the picture of the box. ~~I.~~ Which ~~there's,~~ there's some great things to that approach. One is you'll probably get a good end result. ~~Um,~~ another is, you know, following directions and instructions is useful and important [00:26:00] as a life skill. ~~Um,~~ you might end up being really good at that, but then you don't really know how to make or do anything on your own ~~how to.~~ How to make something from an idea in your head rather than instructions on a paper. ~~Um,~~ and so the other side ~~of,~~ of Lego is just, you start with ~~a,~~ a jumbled mess ~~of,~~ of Lego in a bin and you just start making, and ~~you,~~ you figure out what it's gonna be, what you wanna do.

You just kind of figure things out along the way. ~~Um,~~ I wanted to bring a little bit more of the, you figure it out approach, ~~um,~~ this project based learning type thing. ~~Um,~~ but as was discussed, ~~it that can ex,~~ that can do better within a structure because if it's just. A kid picks a project and they follow it, then their learning experience can be pretty patchy.

~~And they,~~ they get some things here, some things there, but other things that are important and they probably should have been taught at that age might get skipped. ~~Um,~~ and those skills ~~on the,~~ on the left side of the spectrum that we keep talking about. ~~Um, they,~~ those ones can get kind of jumped over or lost.

~~Um,~~ in fact, I'm gonna [00:27:00] share my screen again. ~~uh,~~ what we've kind of been talking about here ~~Can't get the right zoom level. There we go.~~ Is that the traditional education can do a really good job on this left end and then you kinda end up lacking on the right end. And then the project based learning, you can kind of end up ~~with the,~~ with the opposite problem of, you know, maybe you're pretty good at the kid, ends up learning a lot of hands-on skills, some application, ~~um,~~ but maybe their writing or math or. ~~Um,~~ kind of base technical skills just end up really lacking. ~~Uh,~~ so what I think, ~~uh,~~ work best is, is a hybrid approach where you have projects, you have a reason for learning things so that kids start to see, ~~uh,~~ these knowledge. ~~Um,~~ the knowledge that they're gaining as tools to accomplish their goals. ~~Uh,~~ you have some of those positive aspects of project-based learning, but it's still within a structure, ~~uh,~~ and a framework that you're still making sure to hit the right points. You're not having gaps in what they're learning. ~~Um,~~ and I think that this way can really be kind of the best of, of both worlds. ~~Um,~~ additionally, [00:28:00] this is, I. This is kind of how jobs work. It's not like anyone comes up to you and they're like, okay, well you know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna pay you for this year and you can just decide to work on whatever you wanna work on for this year. And, you know, just make sure it's something you like. I'll make sure you have what you need to do it, ~~uh,~~ just, just work on whatever you No, that those. Generally speaking, those jobs do not exist. ~~Um,~~ it's someone comes up to you and says, Hey, I need you to do this. And then within that structure and framework you have the freedom to decide your own approach, how you wanna do it. ~~Um, I~~ I don't think it's necessarily preparing, ~~uh,~~ kids very well for the real world to be, have a totally open-ended, you can do whatever you want. ~~Um,~~ and learn whatever you want type thing. But I also don't think it's great to be, Hey, you, you can only learn these things in this way, and none of it's gonna feel like it matters because it just feels like learning for learning's [00:29:00] sake or learning for test taking sake rather than learning so that you can accomplish cool things.

**Andrea Fife:** ~~um,~~ I had the awesome opportunity to test some of your early kit designs with my kids, and I'm thinking about their reactions to, ~~um, I. In particular, I think it's,~~ I think you call it a car launcher. ~~Uh,~~ there was definitely some steps to follow, but pretty quickly we had a car launcher and the point was not to build the car launcher.

The point was to launch things. And that ~~was,~~ was pretty clearly explained in the materials that came, ~~uh, in my.~~ In my household, we're pretty good at ~~the,~~ the try things and see ~~what,~~ what happens. Maybe a little too good at it, maybe a little too crazy with the things that we're willing to try. ~~Um,~~ so we jumped pretty immediately into the kids saying, oh, I wonder what would happen if we launched these peppermints down the stairs.

At the dog. You know, ~~the,~~ the types of things that ~~are,~~ are definitely ~~the,~~ the barriers removed approach to learning. But I'm thinking about the fact that my kids have been raised around people who [00:30:00] are naturally likely to go there. ~~Um,~~ they're not ~~the~~ the type of students who are gonna stare at you and say, well, what?

What next? What am I allowed to do next? What am I supposed to do next? Instead, you'd have to ~~like~~ hold them back and say, ~~that's not what you're,~~ that's not what you're supposed to do. ~~Um,~~ do you have any advice for helping kids who don't know that it's okay to create ~~who,~~ who are used to book learning, who are used to worksheets?

What would you suggest to help somebody become a maker? Unleash their creative thinking.

**Jack Casdorph:** Yeah. ~~Um,~~ so I have several suggestions, ~~um,~~ both for kids and for parents. ~~Um, so my,~~ my first suggestion is to just start doing it. Just try it. ~~Um,~~ you're probably gonna be bad at it at first. ~~Um,~~ but just start trying. ~~Um,~~ and then for parents ~~is~~ let them try, let them be bad at something. ~~So if, if you kind of look at, um, I. Uh, just skills in general. Um, you know,~~ anyone who's gotten to be pretty good at something, ~~uh,~~ that skill comes from two sources. One is ~~just~~ natural, ~~uh,~~ aptitude and abilities. [00:31:00] And ~~then~~ the other one is learned skills. ~~Uh,~~ whether that's learned ~~by, uh,~~ through exercise, through muscle memory, ~~through, um, you know,~~ through trying. But in order to be really good at something, you need a combination of both, ~~which.~~ One thing ~~that~~ that means is that if you want to be good at something, it's a required unskipable step to start by being bad at it. ~~Um,~~ you can't just ~~ex~~ expect to, oh, well, ~~uh, I didn't,~~ it didn't work out very well, so I guess I just can't do that.

~~I'm,~~ I'm just bad. Well, yeah, of course you are. You just barely started. ~~You,~~ you are on your journey. You are on ~~level,~~ level one. You aren't ready to battle a boss yet. You're still figuring ~~some,~~ some things out. Right now you're bad and that's great. That's where you're supposed to start. ~~Uh,~~ so that's my main, ~~uh,~~ advice ~~is,~~ is just start.

~~Uh,~~ now my advice for the parents is, ~~um,~~ so kids, especially young kids. They start out as a default level. They do want to try things, ~~um,~~ they want to try everything. They see you cooking, they wanna cook, they see you building, they wanna [00:32:00] build, ~~they wanna,~~ they wanna do everything. So my advice is let them, let them try. Obviously ~~they're not gonna,~~ they're not gonna be great at it ~~to,~~ to start. And maybe ~~the,~~ some of the things that they wanna do, ~~um. Aren't~~ aren't safe, or they're too big, they're too messy. ~~Uh,~~ like no, you can't practice cutting the tile ~~for, uh,~~ for our bathroom. We only bought so much. We're not gonna buy another pack. There are things that you're not gonna let your kids do. ~~Um,~~ but there are plenty of things that maybe aren't that expensive, aren't that dangerous or that messy. That you could let them do. So ~~like~~ if they come up to you and like, Hey, I wanna do ~~this,~~ this, then like, great, ~~we can't,~~ maybe we can't quite do that, but we can scale it down a little bit or find, ~~you know,~~ a more kid friendly version of that and start doing that. ~~Um, so, you know, rather than, so nah, all.~~ So most if we take building skills ~~for an,~~ for example, ~~um,~~ the kid wants to start building cool things, ~~um,~~ they're probably not gonna start by building a big bookshelf or a piece of furniture. ~~Uh, you know,~~ maybe especially if they're like. [00:33:00] Four or something. They're not really ready to build hardly anything with real wood. ~~Uh,~~ but what they can do is they can take some cardboard and they can tape it together and they can cut it. ~~Uh. Uh.~~ maybe with some adult assistance, depending on their skills there, ~~uh,~~ and they can start to connect their ideas with the real world. They can start to learn what their hands can do and what their hands can't do. They can learn what the tools around them can and can't do, what the materials can and can't do, and all of those things. And ~~so at~~ once they start, they will immediately start learning, start getting better, and then pretty soon. They will be better.

**Andrea Fife:** Rachel, have you had any experiences ~~with your,~~ with your own kids or with students ~~that,~~ that come to mind of some of these introductory, ~~but just,~~ just let 'em try. ~~Just,~~ just let 'em start somewhere. Experiences.

**Rachael Davie:** Yes, I have a 7-year-old. Son and his absolute favorite thing right now is building robots. And he wants to use everything in the house. And so I ~~have be~~ started making it a little bit more [00:34:00] of a habit of anytime I go to throw away something that would be kind of a recycling item, instead of throwing it out, I ask him, do you want to add this to your robot stuff kit?

So he has toilet paper rolls and duct tape and random plastic things off of packaging. And he loves it. And the more he builds, the more he sees what he can build. And so then sometimes he'll say, Hey, can you buy me a package of rubber bands? Hey, can you get me some of these? Can you get me some of those?

And the more that he builds, the better he gets at it. And he's seven, you know, his robots are not going to do anything besides sit there and look cool. But as he is building, he is developing those skills. ~~And honestly, he's better at thinking creatively than I ever have been because that doesn't come naturally to me. Um, but~~ I can see that as he continues to build, he's growing those skills just by playing with the recycling.

**Andrea Fife:** That's, ~~that's great. Uh,~~ Jack, ~~um,~~ what's something ~~that,~~ that a kid can start doing right now, regardless of skill level, knowing that this is a lead in to something exciting, you wanna share ~~with,~~ with the listeners?

**Jack Casdorph:** Yeah. ~~Um, so.~~ Before I share my exciting thing, I just wanted to say that ~~I,~~ I loved, ~~uh,~~ Rachel's approach of just using cheap [00:35:00] things around the house. ~~Uh,~~ learning by working with things. It doesn't require working with nice things, ~~um,~~ maybe certain levels of learning later, but ~~like you,~~ you don't need ~~to~~ to start there. ~~You can,~~ it can start cheap. ~~Uh, it can start, you know,~~ with just whatever you have around. ~~And~~ in a lot of ways, that actually fuels the creative process better because you have those constraints of like, I'm limited to only the things around me. And maybe this thing was never meant to be used this way, but could it be used this way? Let me see. Rather than like, well, I have the full extent of the internet and I can just buy a bunch of things that were ~~made to do a specific, uh.~~ Made to do a specific thing and ~~they'll,~~ they'll probably do that thing 'cause somebody else already designed it to happen. ~~Um,~~ along those lines, ~~um,~~ I know it can be really hard to have like, ~~uh,~~ a starting place.

So I wanted to, I host, ~~uh,~~ a small competition, ~~uh,~~ for kids. This is for kids of any age. Any skill level. ~~Um, but~~ the competition is going to be a bridge building competition, ~~um,~~ where you build the bridges out of [00:36:00] food. So basically ~~like a,~~ like a gingerbread house or whatever, but it's a bridge. ~~Uh, so~~ part of the reason I wanted to do this is first of all. ~~You know,~~ hopefully, ~~uh,~~ everyone ~~has,~~ has some food, ~~um,~~ and want it to be accessible. Something that you don't have to go out and buy anything, ~~um,~~ specific for. ~~And~~ I want kids to be able to learn that ~~it~~ creating something. ~~It~~ doesn't have to be this magnificent, refined thing. ~~Uh.~~ I think that kids tend to see in a lot of movies, ~~um, and~~ television and media. They tend to see, oh, well this character ~~had~~ had an idea and so they went into the garage and then boom, they whipped out this thing that looks like a finished product. ~~You know that~~ things that light up, even though they don't have to, everything ~~looks,~~ looks perfect. It looks like it's about ready to just be put on a shelf and ~~like that,~~ that's not how it works.

You, the starting steps ~~are,~~ are messy. They're kind of janky. ~~Uh, but that's.~~ That's fine. It's, you learn from those limitations, you learn from those failures. ~~Um,~~ so as part of it, so as this [00:37:00] contest, ~~um.~~ I want kids to be able to create something for a purpose, ~~uh,~~ with materials and things that weren't specifically designed for that purpose. ~~Uh,~~ so that you can learn to think outside the box a little bit, ~~uh, as~~ you can make a bridge, ~~uh,~~ out of food, and then test the weight bearing capacity of that bridge, ~~uh,~~ by just putting ~~a bag, like~~ a grocery bag around it and putting weights in it. ~~Uh,~~ in this case I'm suggesting water bottles because. Everyone has those typically. ~~Um,~~ and that doing so you can test and see how well, ~~um, the~~ the bridge does at bearing weight. ~~Um, so~~ as part of this contest, ~~um, I,~~ I'm asking ~~the,~~ the kids to ~~just~~ take a video. ~~Uh,~~ of their bridge ~~show,~~ show it being tested so that you have ~~that,~~ that evidence that you can share, that ~~you know,~~ it held this much weight. ~~Um,~~ and ~~that~~ you can share that ~~with a,~~ with a specific hashtag. ~~Uh,~~ that helps me find it, but it also helps the other participants find them so that they can ~~kind of~~ compare ~~of~~ like, oh, well what did someone else do? ~~Um,~~ 'cause I think one problem that you can run into, especially with homeschool education, is ~~I. Uh,~~ I think sometimes you can lack [00:38:00] a measuring stick. ~~Um, you know, maybe,~~ maybe you're given a grade, maybe you're not. But ~~even if you're,~~ even if you are given a grade, it's like, well, it's given to you by your mom. So like, ~~what is,~~ what does that mean? And as far as ~~like,~~ how much ~~can you~~ do you actually know, like, did I do a good job or does my mom think I'm cool? ~~Um, but I.~~ With a little bit more community engagement and interaction, you can go, oh, well, ~~uh,~~ this other kid about my age, ~~he,~~ he built this and, ~~uh, well,~~ I think my bridge is better, so I think I'm doing okay. Or, ~~well,~~ this other kid ~~did some,~~ did some really cool things. I think I'm gonna try to learn from ~~what,~~ what they did.

But you can get a little bit more, you know, community engagement and interaction and some of that learning that can come from other people. as far as, ~~uh,~~ how to actually participate in this contest, I guess I should mention that stuff. ~~Um,~~ so the submission window, ~~uh,~~ for the contest will end on May 18th. ~~Uh, so~~ 2025. ~~Uh,~~ so if you're seeing this video and it's before that, ~~uh,~~ jump on it, ~~um,~~ make a quick bridge. It doesn't have to be ~~a.~~ A big, difficult thing. ~~Um,~~ and then to submit, you just take a video, ~~uh,~~ and submit that. I'll have, ~~um,~~ a link in the description [00:39:00] of this with some more specific guidelines ~~and,~~ and steps ~~for,~~ for how to participate.

**Andrea Fife:** That's great. ~~I think.~~

**Rachael Davie:** ~~like fun, and~~ I will definitely be having my kids participate in that because that sounds like a blast.

**Andrea Fife:** Say it sounds like will be ~~write,~~ write up your seven year old's alley to look around ~~and, and create and,~~ and see what can be done. I'm thinking, I'm checking my calendar. I'm like, May 18th. ~~Um,~~ thinking if I ~~can,~~ can get my kids ~~to,~~ to submit ~~by,~~ by then as well. ~~Um,~~ are adults allowed to participate, Jack?

**Jack Casdorph:** ~~Um, sure.~~

**Andrea Fife:** ~~I don't have to win, but like~~ can I make a bridge and can I send it to you and will you tell me I did a good job?

**Jack Casdorph:** ~~um,~~ well, only if you did a good job. ~~Um.~~

**Andrea Fife:** That's fair.

**Jack Casdorph:** ~~the, uh, Um,~~ so there won't be any necessarily official winning. ~~Um,~~ but those that are sent to me ~~that, um,~~ that were able to handle a lot of weight or I think did a really good job in other ways, ~~um.~~ Whether ~~it was,~~ it looked really cool or they used some food item in what I thought was a really ~~cool, innovative, uh,~~ creative way, or ~~maybe the,~~ maybe it broke in the most spectacular way, or I thought the kid just did a really good job of remaining happy and being excited. Even though what they made wasn't very good, [00:40:00] whatever, I'm gonna make a highlight video. ~~Um,~~ of the ones that I think ~~were,~~ were really great. ~~Um,~~ I'll post that on my YouTube channel so that, ~~uh,~~ the kids ~~can,~~ can see that they got that recognition. ~~Um,~~ if they don't happen to get chosen, I'll be doing ~~other, uh,~~ other contests, other things.

After that they'll have, ~~uh, other,~~ other chances, ~~uh,~~ as far as can, ~~uh,~~ adults participate. Yeah, of course. ~~Um,~~ there's, I was talking about there not being ~~any,~~ any age limits or constraints to creating other than ones that we kind of tend to make up ourselves. ~~Uh,~~ that's not just on the lower end. ~~Uh,~~ adults can start doing things too, especially if they're fun. Like why not? ~~Uh,~~ you don't have to take. A real course and do textbook problems. You know, you're an adult now. ~~You,~~ you've escaped that part of your life. Congratulations. But that doesn't mean ~~you can't, that~~ you shouldn't still seek out fun ways ~~to,~~ to learn ~~and,~~ and grow your skills.
