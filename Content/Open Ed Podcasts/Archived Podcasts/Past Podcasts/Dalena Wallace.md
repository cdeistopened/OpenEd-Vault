CLIP OPTION 3 - Shopping Mall School:

```Plain
Dalena: "We also have like our old mall, you know, a lot of these shopping malls are just going like totally like ghost town, you know, and just vacant."

Isaac: "Yeah, you just you have a different class in each store and you roller skate in between them, you know."

Dalena: "Yeah, yep. Yes, exactly, the roller skates. Yeah, I thought of that too. Yep. And then the food court, you you have all your options there and it's just like your education. You have all your schools to choose from. take a class a la carte here and there."
```

CLIP OPTION 4 - Family Reality vs Expectations (combining both stories):

```Plain
Dalena: "And so that was really the very start of our family planning, unplanning, you know... And when that happened, just remember kind of, again, I'm a person of faith and I prayed, I prayed to God and I just said, if you allow me to be a mom, if you allow me to have kids, I will have as many as you want me to have and I will do it your way."

[Could be combined with Isaac's story:]

Isaac: "We were like, well, wait four or five years, do some stuff, then we'll have like four or five kids. And we got pregnant right away, like right away after we got married, we were surprised by that... We got pregnant with our second and then had a miscarriage and for five years could not get pregnant and thought we would never get pregnant again. So we adopted. And then we got pregnant again after we adopted."

## Transcript

Dalena (00:02.829)  
Hey, Isaac, I'm here. I'm good. Thanks. Not in my normal place, and I cannot find any place to be where there's not going to be people walking behind me. So I'm not sure what to do about that. You're OK? OK. OK, yeah.

Isaac (00:02.934)  
Hey, how are ya?

Good to see ya!

Isaac (00:20.846)  
I'm not worried about it. I think it's fine. We keep it real.

Dalena (00:26.271)  
Yeah, it's very real. is me thinking I would be back home at my office by now and I'm like, okay, now what?

Isaac (00:35.85)  
All good, been there many times. It's just nice that we're in a world where it's possible to even do it like this. Well, I love it. I appreciate you taking the time. The recording already started automatically, which I didn't know it was gonna do, but this part will get edited out anyway. I wanna make sure I am pronouncing your name correctly. Is it Delana?

Dalena (00:43.701)  
No kidding. Yeah, just work them.

Dalena (01:00.833)  
Yeah. Delina. Long E. I don't even notice. I don't even notice anymore because everyone has their own variation of how they say my name. I just get used to it.

Isaac (01:05.288)  
I think I have been doing that like every single time and I am sorry.

Isaac (01:15.47)  
you know, a hallway station.

I realized we were on that meeting and one of the other women on the call, said Delana and she kind of raised her eyebrow and I was like, wait a second. I have never actually asked. it's amazing.

Dalena (01:32.653)  
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it's fine. And I don't even correct people because honestly I'm like, well that's a fair way of saying it.

Isaac (01:42.72)  
I, people always pronounce my name right, but nobody spells it right. And I never, I'm like, it's a weird name. There's two A's. I'm not worried about it, you know? So, well, I say, let's just jump right in. This will be pretty informal. I just want to, you know, get to know, especially your story. So.

Dalena (01:46.252)  
Yeah.

Dalena (01:49.685)  
Yeah. Yeah.

Dalena (01:56.374)  
Yeah, it will be. Okay, and you're sure you're fine with the background and everything and the setting? I mean, we could reschedule if we need to. Okay. Yeah, hopefully nothing crazy happens in the background.

Isaac (02:03.128)  
Yeah.

No, I'm totally fine. you're comfortable rolling, I say we roll.

Isaac (02:11.692)  
Yeah, I think we should be we should be OK. Worst case, we either edit it or we, you know, go redo it. But I think it'll be all right. All right, let's jump in. All right, welcome back to the open ed podcast on your sometimes host, Isaac Morehouse. Today, I have the maven of micro schools, the Kansas queen of customizing kids education, Delina Wallace. Thanks for joining me for this chat.

Dalena (02:16.247)  
Right. OK. Yeah.

Dalena (02:41.345)  
You're welcome. Thanks for having me, Isaac. This is great.

Isaac (02:44.682)  
Yeah, and I was just looking up, you I know we've chatted a few times. I was reading about some of your stuff. You are part of more organizations and efforts than I can count. And you've been at it for a long time. And I would love to just start with your own story. Like, how did you grow up? What was your own education like and kind of what led you to where you are today?

Dalena (03:08.107)  
Yeah, sure. Well, first of all, I just want to say thanks for being flexible with everything. Flexibility is key in everything that we do, and it's key in education. For our listeners who don't know, this podcast right now is being recorded and I'm not in my office like I thought I was going to be. I've been running about and have my kids at a class this afternoon that I had the timing of the class wrong and I'm like, so I won't be back home from my office for that podcast. So here I am at

coffee shop. But that's how it goes. You know, we roll with it and really, yeah, just to get to your question about my background and everything. Currently, I'm a homeschooling mom. I have six kids. I love what I do when we get really creative in education. It's been a good fit for our family. I'm currently homeschooling my younger four and my oldest two are in high school and they get to attend a private school. They do some dual enrollment courses through a college

here in town. But my own background, I didn't grow up homeschooling. I had never heard of anyone who had homeschooled. I had my own kids and had never met another homeschooler in my life. And, you know, but that's okay. I was able to go to a great private school growing up and it really impacted my life. It was a Christian school that aligns with my faith and and my family was, you know, the way that they were able to send me there is that my dad was

a teacher at the school and so that gave us a discounted tuition and we got to go to that school and it was wonderful and really education's just you know it's all interwoven into my family and my background my dad was my third grade teacher my mom was my kindergarten teacher and education's just something I'm passionate about and I'm passionate about making it creative.

Isaac (05:03.374)  
So when it came time to start thinking about how you wanted to educate your own kids, I'm assuming, like, was your first thought, well, can we have a similar, you know, Christian private school experience for them that you had? Or were you already thinking about something different?

Dalena (05:20.587)  
You know, so my story is really interesting and I have, you know, it's,

It's part of my story. So I don't mind sharing it, but it's like it's personal to me because I really did think that I was going to just send my kids to a school like I grew up in. I loved it. I had a great experience and I don't know maybe some of your listeners can relate to this, but I had like things mapped out as far as like what my family was going to look like and you know, I wanted to have two kids. My husband and I discussed it. We were going to have two kids and somehow we were going to determine that one would be a

and one would be a girl. And we, I just knew what kind of school I would send them to. And that was that. Well, with our very first pregnancy, we actually lost that baby in a miscarriage. And so that was so impactful and it continues to impact the trajectory of my life and our family moving forward because that really, it just kind of wiped the slate clean. Like I was like, so things might not

not go how I had expected and how I had planned. And I don't even know if I'm going to get to be a mom. So that was really the very start of our family planning, unplanning, you know.

And when that happened, just remember kind of, again, I'm a person of faith and I prayed, I prayed to God and I just said, if you allow me to be a mom, if you allow me to have kids, I will have as many as you want me to have and I will do it your way. And whatever you, whatever you want, just please let me be a mom. And so that was the beginning of this whole new adventure of homeschooling and having six kids and living in Kansas and all the other

Dalena (07:11.309)  
things that were very unexpected for me. But yeah, I like to share that. I know it's unique to me, but it was something that I just can't overlook as being a very important start to this whole thing.

Isaac (07:27.98)  
I love that. And thank you for being willing to share that. know that every time, every time someone is willing to share something really personal like that, there are always people out there who are like, hey, thank you. I needed to know I'm not alone. I mean, I can tell you my wife and I had the opposite of a planned family, kind of in a different way. We were like, well, we got married very young. We were like, well, wait four or five years, do some stuff.

then we'll have like four or five kids. And we got pregnant right away, like right away after we got married, we were surprised by that. So we're like, okay, well, plans change. So instead of going to Africa and doing all this stuff, we'll stay here, we'll have our kids and start having kids now. We got pregnant with our second and then had a miscarriage and for five years could not get pregnant and thought we would never get pregnant again. So we adopted.

And then we got pregnant again after we adopted. And then there was another five years where we couldn't get pregnant and thought we wouldn't have any more kids. And then all of a sudden we had another kid. So we have this huge spread of kids. Every one of them, with the exception of the adopted daughter, were unplanned, unexpected. like, I would not have chosen to have a kid, five year gap, two kids, five year gap, and another kid. But that's the way, and like, I remember after that miscarriage thinking we would never have any other children. We would have one child and that was it.

Dalena (08:40.031)  
Yeah.

Isaac (08:54.626)  
obviously thankful for that one child, just it's similar to you when you kind of get broken and you're just praying and you're like, hey, okay, whatever happens, I can't take anything for granted. I have this idea of this family and it's all gonna line up according to my plan and it just doesn't. And that kind of gives you that perspective of like, I gotta make the most of whatever I have when it comes to my family and I can't control it, but I gotta make the most of what I do have. I'm.

Dalena (09:11.287)  
Yeah.

Dalena (09:16.129)  
Yes, exactly.

Isaac (09:22.784)  
So glad that you shared that. That's such a cool story. the homeschooling decision, when did you first encounter that as an option? Like, did you meet other homeschoolers and have that moment where you kind of realized, I guess I could do that? Like, how did that come about?

Dalena (09:25.037)  
Yeah.

Dalena (09:38.349)  
So in that season after our first miscarriage and before I even became pregnant with right right now who is our oldest I kept running into like it seemed like to me for the first time ever but they were everywhere there were homeschool moms everywhere all of a sudden You know, I would just be meeting somebody Unrelated to education at all and we'd be meeting up for coffee and then she would start talking and she'd tell me about her family situation

and she talked about homeschooling and I'm like, I'm like, what? You homeschool? And it was like one after another after another. And then people just started introducing me to other young moms and other families in my church. And I was like, wow, this is a thing. Like, really? OK. And so even before I had my my oldest daughter right now, I just knew that's what that was the direction that I was going to go. And that was what the Lord wanted me to do.

And so I started down that path and yeah, it was really great. It's been really great. But then if I can kind of fast forward, this is kind of where my business endeavors and my passion and microschools and other innovative education options come into play because 10 years in, know, homeschooling my six kids and I started to realize, hmm, this is really hard.

I need some support, I need some community. What are my options here? Who can I hire to teach this subject or what can they do online? And then I started organizing some classes for the community because I was like, if I'm feeling this way, I'm pretty sure there's other homeschool moms who could use some help with this stuff. And so...

The way I started out was actually just opening my home up to inviting a couple friends to come in with me and we would share teaching during the day. And we would just split different subjects and that worked really well. Excuse me. And then we had some other, excuse me. Don't know if we can edit that part out, but it's fine.

Isaac (11:53.119)  
sure we can edit it out.

Dalena (11:54.253)  
So, but then, you know, I had other friends who would find out what we were doing and they were like, you're doing some classes in your home. This is great. Can we join you? And three families became five families, became seven, became 10, became 12. And now it's developed into a co-op and we have 16 families in the co-op. I started out as the director. I was the founder and the director. But then...

you know, for the past two years I haven't been the director. I've had others like take on that, but my kids are still going there and they're getting their classes and I help find the teachers to teach the subjects and all those great things. So, you know, going through the journey of homeschooling, realizing it's difficult, realizing I need to have some options, I need to have some support. What can we do to make this a well-rounded experience and a healthy experience for me and my kids?

And so I kind of got into co-op things and then microschools. I actually opened a Perenda Microschool in my home and we did that for a year. We were part of a pilot program that came to Kansas and it was a very great learning experience. And what it did was it just completely turned me on to the idea of anybody can do this. Like we can organize families and we can start a school.

they call it a micro school like I'd never heard of that term before but like hey let's go this is great and so I became so passionate about it I really wanted to encourage others who were doing micro schools and then I that yeah things have just taken off since then

Isaac (13:20.503)  
Yep. Yep.

Isaac (13:35.902)  
It's what I love about this arena is it's been like quietly, it's been hidden. It's been under the surface for a long time for at least I would say 30 years that the homeschooling has been percolating without anybody noticing. And then when you have all of the technology come in and enable various things and various models that have like a tech enabled component or even something like Prenda, which is

It's not that Prenda itself is running schools online, but the ability to bring a franchise-like model to different cities and to have a platform that you can operate your school with online. All of a sudden, the people who have emerged in this new market, they have years and in some cases, decades of in-the-trenches firsthand experience, which is so different than a lot of markets where someone has an idea like, oh, I think we could automate accounting.

You know, and like they haven't worked as an accountant for 30 years, but homeschool moms, man, I remember growing up, my, mom homeschooled us and similar to what you described. And I loved it. I think I was probably eight or nine around this time. There was maybe five other families and we, would meet, we'd rotate whose house it was at. It was one day a week. like each, each mom had a unit that lasted like four weeks and it could be on anything. One of them was on the solar system. One of them was on Russia.

One of like, and you would go there and they would do the activities and different things and assignments. And then at the end, each family would make like a presentation of like, you whatever. And it was, I just remember thinking it was so fun. like, none of those moms felt equipped to teach their kids all of the subjects. But every one of those moms had one thing that she knew enough about.

to do something pretty cool. It could be baking, something very practical. It could be something very abstract. There was a mom who was a chemist and she did something around chemistry. And I think when you have that idea, your kids love it and just the variety and the experience. And so moms who've been in the trenches kind of just manually doing these things. And then all of sudden these models come along, these business models and like, that's called a micro school. You're already kind of doing it. Hey, here's like an operating plan.

Dalena (15:32.897)  
Yeah.

Isaac (15:53.388)  
you see this really cool bubbling up of entrepreneurs like yourself who like, you know that customer journey inside and out. You've lived it and are living it. And all you needed was some of these frameworks or some of these, know, whether it's funding from nonprofits or venture capital. And so anyway, you see like a flowering of things that are just really exciting to me, all these different models that, you know, didn't used to have names, but now they have names, you know.

Dalena (16:12.577)  
Mm-hmm.

Dalena (16:19.413)  
Right, right. Yeah, exactly. It's been incredible to see it and then to learn of the others who are doing this. So, know, homeschool moms, like we connect and we kind of have our own community and whatever. We kind of have this radar now going out, like we can kind of identify each other. It's like, yeah, and we can connect with that. But then there's also this entire...

ecosystem of micro school founders and creative educators who have stepped out of a traditional classroom or they were maybe like homeschool moms like myself or maybe some of them were just you know businessmen who said I see a need I know how to do this this is what America needs this is what my family needs I'm gonna start a school I mean Elon Musk did that right so he's he started two schools it's kind of a thing it's kind

of a thing. yeah, just seeing the creativity and looking around and seeing this whole landscape of innovation in education has been so inspiring.

Isaac (17:24.706)  
Yeah, so you will love this, Delina, and maybe you've already seen it, but I just saw, I think it was yesterday, some micro school page on Facebook shared it, but it's studied by the National School Choice Awareness Foundation. So I'm gonna read these off for our listeners. This is pretty crazy. So this is percentage of parents who have considered different educational options. So,

I don't know exactly what their criteria is for consideration, but regardless, these trends are really interesting. They're comparing the average from 2022 to 2024 of parents considering these options versus 2025. So you can see, you know, just like in the last year. So consider traditional public schools in neighborhoods, there's a 22 % drop in parents considering that option.

traditional public schools outside of neighborhoods, a 12 % drop. Then you have public charter schools, 7 % increase. Public magnet schools, 18 % increase. Private or faith-based, 24 % increase. Full-time online schools, 17 % increase. Homeschooling, 39 % increase. And frankly, I think it's probably a lot higher than that. Homeschooling is...

pretty hard to get a handle on and people don't always want you to know in some states. And then here's the last one. This is, think, the coolest. Microschooling or hybrid learning. 220 % increase of the number of parents considering that option.

Dalena (18:50.6)  
Right.

Dalena (19:00.642)  
Whoa.

That is so amazing. That's awesome. I love it. Love it.

Isaac (19:07.05)  
It's crazy. And I think it really speaks to, know, we call it the opening up of education, right? And that's the name of this like open education. It's just, it's another way of saying school choice, but it's broader than that. I think it's starting from the parent's perspective. School choice is kind of starting from like the school or policy perspective. From the parent's perspective, what do you want? You want everything open to you.

Dalena (19:18.229)  
you

Dalena (19:32.482)  
Right.

Isaac (19:32.718)  
on the table, you wanna be able to pick from the whole menu. Maybe you want some online, maybe you want some in person, maybe for one kid you want five days a week, but for one kid you want one day a week, right? And like having that, and you can see this in these hybrid and micro schools, and that can mean different things to different people, but like that right now is what families want. They don't wanna have to do all of it by themselves, they don't want their kids to be at home all the time, but they certainly don't wanna have to commit to five days a week, 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.

Dalena (19:41.076)  
huh.

Dalena (19:50.903)  
Wow.

Dalena (19:58.893)  
you

Isaac (20:01.292)  
You gotta follow the school schedule for vacations and holidays. And I think like seeing this flowering of models there is what excites me. So I wanna ask you, that was a long ramble. What have you seen in Kansas in particular in the last, let's say five years since COVID? What are some of the things I would love to hear like, and you can be totally real about it, right? What are the pros and cons? What are some models and things, efforts that haven't panned out? And what have you maybe learned from that? And then what are some things that do seem to be working really

Dalena (20:10.477)  
Mm-hmm.

Dalena (20:26.645)  
Yeah.

Dalena (20:31.053)  
Sure, well I can say I've definitely seen an explosion of individuals who are starting something. know, like actual, just normal, your everyday people.

You know, like I said, some of them might have been educators, but moms, moms and dads, pastors, businessmen, like people who just see a need and have a vision for what education should look like. And they're stepping up to the plate and they're not waiting around for reformation to happen within the traditional public school system. And then the other thing is that like we've we've kind of realized we don't

have to have, even if we're looking for a private school option, it doesn't even have to look like those traditional private schools that we've known and that I grew up in. They don't have to be so expensive. They don't have to be five days a week. They don't have to be in a traditional brick and mortar school. And so I think the freedom, like it's really catching. It's like contagious, you know. So when you hear about and you see others who have all the freedom in the world to

and to curate their child's education experience, where you see a school founder who is like, you know, completely unboxed, you know, and saying, this, let's do it like this, like, why not? Then again, it's just, it's very catching and contagious. And so it's spreading. But then I will say, like you said, you know, kind of good and bad, just show what's happening here. I will say that I sense from homeschoolers and particularly

particular, that they might feel a bit threatened and a little nervous about this whole change in landscape. like, wait a minute, we kind of had this like corner market in this whole thing of being able to have parent directed education. But if you're doing it and it doesn't look the way that it looks for us, like we're as traditional homeschoolers, but you're doing something and you're maybe saying that you're homeschooling, but we don't really

Dalena (22:44.623)  
feel like it's the same thing. So there's a lot of what I would say conversations that need to happen and open dialogue and just continuing to encourage everyone to be open minded about things and how this can look because we are headed into a whole new frontier and it's exciting and it's a good thing and it may be different than the way you grew up homeschooling and the way that I started the first

know, 10 years of homeschooling and there's just this shift but I feel like it is such a positive thing, something that we should be really excited about.

Isaac (23:24.578)  
Yeah, I love that point on, you know, kind of the homeschool pioneers, the real early adopters recognizing, because I'm super sensitive to, because this happens in a lot of industries, the organic nature and the independence and the do-it-yourself kind of frontier, you know, culture there that has existed for so long. Now, suddenly with this explosion, you have all of these different people saying, whoa,

There's an opportunity here in something around self-directed learning, micro schools, hybrid school, whatever they're calling it. bringing in a lot of programs, a lot of funding, sometimes that involves state funding or state programs. And I think what, what there is a concern about rightly so is don't pull in all those independent, you know, people who are out there doing it their own way and, use funding.

as a way to entice them to get sucked into the system. And then you start imposing more and more regulations on them. And eventually you stifle innovation. And isn't that a perfect analogy? But you could see even in like the world of independent creators, you have at first this flowering when new platforms and the internet opens up of people making all kinds of art, music, videos, et cetera. And then you get, you know, and it's like, yes, we're freed from the big three movie studios or whatever it is. But then you get like,

Netflix and Amazon Prime, and slowly they're like pulling everyone in to their revised version. It's the new big studio, right? And kind of choking out that independent market. And I think we want all of the above, right? So like all those families who just would never feel like they could homeschool if the option was you gotta go completely on your own. You gotta organize everything. You gotta figure it all out. All of these new options that are popping up.

allow all of those people, those late majority, those like, they're not early adopters, but they're willing to take some risk, massively expands the market. But you wanna make sure that happens without squelching all that exploration and freedom that's happening out there on the edges of people who are doing it completely their own way, because that's how you keep it from stagnating. You don't want it to just all get pulled in under one centralized system. So I'm very sensitive to those.

Dalena (25:35.725)  
Yeah.

Isaac (25:42.304)  
And frankly, I love it. Like when you run into homeschoolers who say, yeah, there's an ESA in my state and they'll give me eight grand for my kids if I register them, but I'm not gonna do it. Cause I don't want the strings that come with it. Like good, we always need people who are like that to make sure that it doesn't become something that just starts to centralize again. Cause that's the tendency of these things. So I think it's an interesting dynamic to watch play out.

Dalena (26:01.697)  
Yeah, exactly. Right. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

Isaac (26:08.45)  
What, so let me ask from models, cause I've had this, this is like more of a specific question, but I was talking with a friend who ran an Acton Academy, that Acton has a pretty strong point of view on wanting to have five days a week in person and they don't want like what they call a drop-in culture because that makes it really hard to actually develop culture in the classroom, culture among teachers, if there isn't that commitment and people are in and out.

And then I also recently talked to a champion prep Academy here in Orlando, Florida. And they have a five day a week program, a four day a week program, a three day, a two day and a one day. have every option and they have a completely virtual option. And so they have like, Hey, whatever works for you. Right. And they treat it more like a, more like a college campus, especially for high school. Hey, you come when you want to come to the classes you want to go to and you leave when you want to leave. So I'm curious if you have seen the pros and cons, like what is your.

experience been of these models where it's really flexible? Do you lose continuity? Is it hard for relationships or culture to form? Or is that, the pros outweigh the cons? I just would love to hear you riff on that a little bit.

Dalena (27:21.399)  
Sure.

Yeah, I've been to several acting academies. really like what they do. I again, it's one of those things that's not going to be for everybody. And so I my personal preference would be for a school to have all of the above like to have those options to have the full time option for the families that need it. But then to keep in mind that there's going to be some families that are looking for a hybrid model like can my kids just attend the two days a week in person three days a week?

We'll be at home. They'll do their work, you know with me or we have other activities we want to do and So I that's my preference, but I will say in talking to you know, and and I have a network, know in Wichita we have a really strong hub of Microschools and Microschool founders and we meet monthly and we talk about these types of things when someone might be discussing like the possibility of going to a four day a week when they used to be a five day week or they do

and a Monday, Wednesday, and they're thinking of adding in a Tuesday, Thursday program. So we have all these discussions about pros and cons of these things. And I really think the more options that you have available in your school for families to decide how they want to make it work, the better off that you're going to be. So that's kind of my understanding of the marketplace there. And with talking with some of the teachers, I will say that

that lack of continuity and not having five days a week, it really can be a thing. You know, when you're trying to assign some work and the parents are like, they'll do it at home, but maybe it doesn't happen at home. But then again, it's like, who is that on? That shouldn't be on, you know, the teacher who's facilitating the two day a week class. It's like the parent and the student and it brings it back home and brings the responsibility back to the parent and the family.

Isaac (29:04.43)  
You

Isaac (29:21.154)  
Yeah, it's funny, I was talking to a group of micro school operators a couple of weeks ago and kind of walking through the jobs to be done framework, which is used in a lot of businesses and kind of asking like, what are you solving for and for who? Because the temptation is to say, well, we're just solving everything for everybody, right? As a business owner, you want that, you want the biggest market possible. But if that's the case, you're not really solving anyone's problem well, you're

Dalena (29:48.151)  
for.

Isaac (29:49.016)  
kind of solving a lot of people's problem not very well. And so figuring out, you know, I know like for my wife and I, there are times where we will sign our kids up for a class and we actually don't care about the content of the class. We just want them to have that time hanging out with their friends. That's the main thing. And we don't really care if they do the homework. Other times it's cause we really need them to learn this one subject better and we're not gonna do a good job. And we really care about that. And it just depends. And so I think like,

Dalena (30:02.625)  
Yes. Right. Yep.

Isaac (30:15.352)  
Having that point of view and understanding, if you are, let's say, an acting academy and you are really, really focused, you have a very strong point of view about this kind of hero's journey approach to your child's education and you know to do that well, it's gotta be a five day week commitment, lean into that, market that, find the people who want that. If you're way more open and flexible, like lean into that, the temptation is to try to do all of the above and you kinda have to pick a lane, I think, at least when you're getting started.

Dalena (30:30.517)  
Mm-hmm. True.

Dalena (30:39.873)  
Yeah, right.

Isaac (30:44.738)  
Let me ask you this, Delina, I'm curious for the micro school operators in your network, is the physical space, is that a challenge? Like finding a space, trying to figure out leasing arrangements, working out the finances of that, what is that like right now? Is there plenty of space out there for reasonable prices? Are people using churches, commercial spaces, their homes? Is that a pain point? I know in the past that was often a pain point and churches were usually kind of like,

iffy about it and it was hard to get, know, commercial leases were really expensive. I think they've come down quite a bit, but I'm curious your take on that component.

Dalena (31:15.117)  
Yeah.

Dalena (31:22.943)  
Again, we see a lot.

all of the above. I'm seeing these models. I have some friends who are micro school founders who operate right out of their home. To me, I feel like that's the easiest, most simplified, most cost effective way to do that. But it's not gonna be for everybody because you talk to those founders and they're like, I want my space back. I really want this separation between like, okay, we start the school day and then I'm done and I'm at home. So there's that side of things. Churches, particularly

Isaac (31:37.197)  
Yes.

Isaac (31:45.038)  
Ha!

Dalena (31:55.423)  
I know that churches are really open to that. have heard, you know, I don't know personally of any situation, but I've heard others say that like churches will maybe hesitate to open their doors if they're not.

aligning with their faith and their values, which I can understand that as well. But I do know lot of like co-ops and micro schools that do use church space. I'm trying to think of some of the more creative. There's a school in town, it's called Northfield School of Liberal Arts, and they own two like old Victorian homes, and they're near a campus, a college campus, and so they use, no one lives in these homes. This home has just completely been used as

their school and they get creative and they take classes down at Friends University and they kind of do these hybrid models and I think it's very cool. I've seen all kinds of spaces used.

Isaac (32:57.186)  
That is really cool. love that. You're starting to my imagination fired up. know like starting with what you have, start with your home, get some customers and get some demand first before you go crazy in a building. when you think about some of the possibilities, like I'm imagining even you buy a rundown house and part of the experience is if it's like teenage kids, hey, we're gonna rehab this house as part of the education.

Dalena (33:24.471)  
Yep. That's so cool. Yes.

Isaac (33:26.818)  
Like let's go and, you know, let's make our, let's literally build our own classroom or build our own. What do we want it to be like? We all had a part in it. We installed the windows. There's so many cool, cool possibilities that I think when you're limited to the assumptions of the traditional class approach, you don't really think about, right? You're not really, you're not really opened up to that, but yeah, I love that idea. And I know there's, there's been a number of small liberal arts colleges that have gone out of business in the last, you know, five years.

Dalena (33:31.553)  
Yes.

Isaac (33:56.078)  
And I have always had this, because some of them have beautiful campuses, this idea of like, would be so cool to buy a campus and then just run all kinds of different micro schools and programs out of it, you know?

Dalena (34:03.745)  
my goodness, Yes, yeah, I've had that same exact vision. You know, in Wichita specifically, we have had six closed schools, public schools that closed in the past year. So this was in 2024, I believe, that they actually closed. They announced it in 2023. And...

School buildings aren't really good for anything as much as a school. mean, and so I think it'd be incredible. But then we also have like our old mall, you know, a lot of these shopping malls are just going like totally like ghost town, you know, and just vacant.

Isaac (34:39.074)  
Yes.

Isaac (34:43.564)  
Yeah, you just you have a different class in each store and you roller skate in between them, you know.

Dalena (34:46.695)  
yeah, yep. Yes, exactly, the roller skates. Yeah, I thought of that too. Yep. And then the food court, you you have all your options there and it's just like your education. You have all your schools to choose from. take a class a la carte here and there.

Isaac (35:01.454)  
Yeah, and let your kids and local food trucks and whatever set up their own little food businesses and the food court. And yeah, I do love, there is so much potential. And I think the more those trends that I read off from that study, the more that happens, the more the size of that market, because in absolute numbers, it's still really small, right? The number of parents considering micro or hybrid schools, yes, it jumped 220%, but it was at 5%. Now it's at 16.

Dalena (35:09.633)  
Yep. Yep.

Dalena (35:30.027)  
Right. Yeah.

Isaac (35:30.73)  
Once those relative numbers get larger, the opportunity to take some of those risks and to say, yeah, I'm gonna buy an old shopping mall and we're gonna turn it into a micro school hub with a food court and all kinds of stuff. Like we're gonna see more and more of that coming. So hopefully Kansas will continue to lead the way.

Dalena (35:47.021)  
That's right. Yes, absolutely. Yeah, if I have anything to do with it, really, you know, I think that our location, our geographic location in the United States is significant. We are right in the heart of the country. And to see that this sort of thing is like bubbling up and stirring and building and I just know it's going to catch, you know, and of course we know Kansas is not the only state. This is happening in every state everywhere. But to know that it's

happening in the heart of the country is really exciting to me.

Isaac (36:21.794)  
Yeah, I like to think of Kansas as the most normal place in the country. Like it's just not really extreme in any direction. Everything's kind of fairly normal. And so if it could happen there, I feel like it can happen anywhere, right? So let's wrap it up with one final question for you, Delina. If people listening to this, if they are, you know, maybe they're homeschooling their kids or doing some form of hybrid for their own children.

Dalena (36:26.891)  
Hahaha.

Right. Yep, yep.

Isaac (36:51.438)  
but they see some gaps. They see some things that they would love for their kids, others in their community, but they're like, I don't know. Am I an entrepreneur? Do I want to take this on? What would be some advice you give them for getting started if they want to try to organize a co-op or a micro school?

Dalena (37:07.339)  
Yeah, so I would invite wherever you're at in Kansas, we have a website called [wisetogether.org](http://wisetogether.org/) and it's specific to the Wichita area. But if you join that, you can go on the website, you can get some ideas of like the meetings that are happening, you can see a directory of schools, there's a whole list of creative schools. And I just feel like those types of things help.

Inspire people and help people think outside of the box. I'm happy to I I love facilitating like tours and taking people around so you can visit You know when I hear of someone who's dreaming of something I think the best thing to do is to take them by the hand and say I love it. Let me show you what's happening over here Maybe you'll get some more ideas or maybe you know if I introduce you to Katie or to Devon or to Pam They'll lead you in this, you know and answer your questions. We have a great community so

finding some others, you there's networks in every state. Well, maybe not in every state, but we're getting there. But, you know, the Vail Education Fund, they're excellent at helping with innovators. So if you can kind of find those networks and even if it's a Facebook group, but just jumping in the conversation and putting your ideas out there, there's going to be people who are doing it already who are like a step ahead of you. And to me, I feel like that relationship, maybe like

a form of mentorship, but it's more like just coming alongside and partnering with you. So finding someone who's kind of in that same space would be my advice.

Isaac (38:43.894)  
I love it. the Lena, thank you so much. I will be the first to strap on my roller skates when you buy that shopping mall. I'll come over and check out the food court. Appreciate you being flexible with us. Call it in from a coffee shop.

Dalena (38:49.325)  
Yes. Sounds fun. Thank you, Isaac. This has been great.
