### Introduction and Guest Welcome [00:00]

Ela: Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. I'm Ela Richmond, your sometimes host, and today I have Sandy Grant with us. How are you today, Sandy?

Sandy: Doing great.

Ela: Sandy has six kids and began homeschooling in 2004, so she's been doing this for a very long time. She's a veteran in this field. Five of your kids are done with homeschool, and now you just have one more, correct?

Sandy: Yes, he's 16 and a junior this year.

Ela: That's awesome. You're very involved in the homeschool world. You have a guide that's absolutely incredible for new homeschool parents that you share liberally. You're embedded in different Facebook groups and communities. What has that journey been like for you, getting started in homeschool and then becoming as involved as you are now?

### Sandy's Homeschooling Journey Begins [00:53]

Sandy: We originally started homeschooling when my third child was approaching kindergarten age. He already knew pretty much everything he needed to know for kindergarten, so I started thinking about homeschooling him. My husband suggested we might also homeschool the older two, who were approaching second and fourth grade. We decided to pull them all out at that point, and I just fell in love with homeschooling.

The community was much smaller back then. There were fewer resources, and we were pretty much on our own, but we found some small groups to get us going and a good support system. One thing I really appreciated was how those who had done it before were willing to share their ideas and what worked for them. As I moved along, I started offering more homeschool support options.

I found I was answering the same questions repeatedly, so I created a document that I share to help answer all the beginning questions—things that work, things that don't, and whatever tips I can give that might be helpful.

### Adapting Homeschool Methods [03:03]

Sandy: When we started, we were on a very limited budget—think $50 for all three kids total. We were buying inexpensive workbooks or looking for materials at thrift stores, just trying to find affordable resources to cover all the subjects.

I started with what I was familiar with, trying to replicate public school. We'd start with math for half an hour, then move on to language arts. I had that structure laid out, and we had a little school room in the basement where everybody had their own desk. I quickly found that wasn't working.

I'd have a baby that needed diaper changes or nursing, and I'd miss math for the day. Or I'd send the kids out for recess, my sister would call, and since we hadn't talked in weeks, I'd want to catch up. Then I'd realize we'd skipped three subjects.

I discovered what worked better was having a checklist of what we wanted to accomplish during the day—doing math, reading with the kids, spelling, whatever I wanted each child to complete. By making charts and just listing what we needed to do, our day became more natural and fluid. If I was busy with the baby, I could have them do something independently, like a computer program, and then get back to them when I was done.

### Creating Effective Checklists [05:32]

Ela: How did you figure out what was going to go on those checklists to begin with? What was guiding you?

Sandy: I look at each subject and what I want to include. For language arts, I break it down. It's not just "do your language arts" on the chart. It'll say "read with mom" every day, "do your spelling" every day, and "read for 30 minutes" or for a younger kid, maybe 15 minutes on their own.

With math, I'll say "complete one lesson" and "work on math facts." Then there's science and history and just the basic things you want to include in your day. Each year I evaluate what I want to focus on and what should go on their charts.

I try to keep it to about 10 things, some of which they can do on their own when I'm not available. You learn as you go. Many times I'll make a chart and three weeks in realize it's not working—we have too much to do, or a curriculum isn't working for that child. So I'll revamp their chart, and that's fine. Even halfway through the year, if you find a math curriculum isn't working, it's perfectly fine to switch things up and change as needed.

### Evaluating Curriculum Effectiveness [07:30]

Ela: I've heard this from so many parents, but how do you know when a curriculum won't work for a certain kid? How do you know the difference between "this is just challenging for them" and "this really isn't going to work"?

Sandy: That takes a lot of intuition and gut feeling. I have kids who won't do something simply because they don't like it—not because it's too hard or too easy, they're just being stubborn. So you have to ask, are they just being stubborn? And even if that is the case, is this a fight worth fighting?

Right now I'm dealing with my son with writing. I tried to make it as simple as possible—just write for five minutes every day in a Google Doc, I don't care what you write about. But he has fought me so much on that. So I'm evaluating: is this worth fighting over when he won't do any of his other school because this one task is so overwhelming? Should we look at different options to cover the material or focus on something else for language arts this year?

It's a lot of trial and error. You have to be willing to recognize that's part of the process—figuring out what works, what doesn't, and what battles are worth fighting. Sometimes if it's just busy work anyway and they don't want to do it, there's no point in forcing it. Even if it looked fun to me, if they're not enjoying it, we need to reevaluate.

### Balancing Parent and Teacher Roles [09:52]

Ela: I imagine that's difficult with six different kids, six different personalities, six different passions and things they're good at. How has that been for you as a parent, as the person guiding them in this homeschool journey, to figure out the best path for each individual child?

Sandy: I do most of my planning during the summer. Once school starts, I don't have time to make lesson plans. I try to determine what we're going to do during the school year and how much I want them to get done each day. During summer, I look at each subject and how each kid can meet those requirements.

Some years we'll do history all together as part of our morning routine. Other years we'll all cover US history but differently—one using a public school textbook, one reading Joy Hakim's "History of US" books, and one watching Liberty Kids. You meet them where they are and try to cover the subject. Some years we go light on history and heavier on science, and some years we really focus on read-alouds.

Every year I ask, "Where do I want our focus to be this year?" And it changes every year. One year, all we did for history was watch an episode of American Ride during lunch, and that was our history for the year.

### Transitioning from Young Kids to Teens [18:38]

Ela: What was the journey like for you to go from homeschooling young kids to homeschooling older kids? There are a lot of people trying to figure that out because it's difficult to go from young kids, where you understand most of the material, to teenagers, where the challenges are so different.

Sandy: I think it's the same as any aspect of parenting. You go from a baby who's just lying there in the crib to a toddler to a preschooler—they grow so gradually that you just go from one step to the next. When I first started dealing with high school, I worried about whether I could do it, whether I would ruin my kids.

From my experience, as long as you keep trying, you won't ruin your kids. No matter what curriculum you're using, whether you're an unschooler or using online school, whatever you're doing—as long as you keep trying, you won't ruin your kids. I think we worry probably a lot more than we need to, which is standard for mothering. We worry about everything from potty training to college to their future lives.

One of the joys of homeschooling is that there's curriculum designed to be taught by people who don't know anything about the subject. For high school science, I picked homeschool curriculum rather than public school textbooks because those aren't designed to be taught at home.

### College and Career Paths [23:51]

Ela: Can you talk about your kids and college? Isaac, our CEO at OpenEd, is pretty big on the idea that not everybody needs to go to college—there are trades and specific jobs you can get without college, and then there's a set of jobs that require college. What was that experience like for you? Were you already open to the idea of no college, or did that evolve as you reflected on your children's needs?

Sandy: It's complex because my sister and I were the first college graduates in my family. For me, getting a college education was the end goal because I saw how not having one limited some of my family members. Even my brother reached a point in his career where he couldn't advance without a degree.

I also wanted my kids to be surrounded by peers who were doing something with their lives when they moved out. I didn't want them just getting an apartment somewhere and hanging out with people playing video games all day. I wanted them associating with people trying to better their lives, and I felt college was the best place for that.

Honestly, that's still probably what I'd prefer, but I don't think a degree is always necessary or beneficial. My oldest graduated in outdoor education, which has proven challenging because there are mostly part-time positions available. Unless there's a marketable job at the end of that four-year degree, we essentially paid for the experience. In contrast, my son graduated in computer programming and immediately earned a substantial income. You have to be wise in choosing direction, especially if they'll need a solid income.

### Encouraging Self-Led Interests [27:06]

Ela: In your guide, you mention the importance of leaving time not just for curriculum but for self-led interests. Can you talk about how you've helped your kids develop their interests over time?

Sandy: I try to keep our core schoolwork simple. I want to ensure they have a broad base—understanding the basic timeline of history, concepts of biology and physics, and so on. But I don't want to fill their whole day with assigned work and leave no time for their own interests.

I aim to keep formal schoolwork to about four hours, so they're done by early afternoon and have plenty of time for their own pursuits. Whether they use that time is up to them—I've got dinner to make and other things to do. My son has loved computer programming since he was 10-12, making things on Scratch, and that's what he grew up to be—a computer programmer.

I think this flexibility is also good preparation for life. In adulthood, you have free time you need to fill. If you're constantly told what to do as a child, then as an adult with free time, you might not know what to do with it. It's important they learn to choose how to spend their time.

### Social Aspects of Homeschooling [33:06]

Ela: What was it like balancing the at-home aspect with the social aspect, especially having six kids? Were you trying to find activities that worked for everybody, or were you open to different activities for different kids?

Sandy: When I had all six at home, it was really challenging. I wanted each of them to have something they were doing, but when you're running six kids to different activities, you run out of days in the week. For a while, we were involved in a relaxed-style co-op that had groups for preschoolers, girls, boys, and teenagers. We did that for a couple years so everyone had their group, all within a two-hour block of our day. That was heaven-sent for me because there was no way I could meet everyone's needs otherwise.

The social landscape has changed dramatically. My older kids will tell you the social aspect wasn't what they wanted it to be, largely because there weren't as many homeschoolers then. There weren't as many classes available, and we didn't have the funds. My oldest never used My Tech High, which is now OpenEd. My second only did it her senior year.

My younger kids have had many more options. My youngest chooses not to participate much socially—he's perfectly happy that way. But Zach, who organized the prom, was very social and had friends everywhere. I'd ask, "Where did you meet this person?" He went to three or four different proms his senior year because he had so many friends inviting him.

### Rapid Fire Questions and Conclusion [37:05]

Ela: Let's end with some rapid-fire questions. First, what advice would you have for a new OpenEd parent at any grade level?

Sandy: Number one, read ParentLink because it answers many of your questions. There's a large learning curve, especially with custom-built programs. Don't be afraid to ask questions, even if people say, "Have you read ParentLink?" Yes, reading it first will eliminate some basic questions, but there are no stupid questions—people will help you either way.

Ela: What has been the biggest challenge in your homeschool journey?

Sandy: Balancing being a mom and being a teacher. The responsibility of their education lies on your shoulders—it's daunting. Maintaining that parent relationship and letting them know that no matter how they do on schoolwork, you still love them. It's not easy, but if you just keep trying, you won't ruin your kids.

Ela: What's one success story that stands out?

Sandy: My daughter who wasn't academic—I heard about a Shakespeare class and thought there was no way she'd want to do it. But I asked anyway, and she said yes. While she wasn't the most dedicated student, she loved the social and theater aspects, which led her to community theater, which she still does today. The lesson is: don't hesitate to ask your kids about opportunities, even if you think they might not be interested.

Ela: Last question—what do you see as the main challenge for homeschool families in the coming year?

Sandy: One thing I actually miss about homeschooling being less popular is the community aspect where moms taught the classes. Now, with more funding in the system, parents often just send their kids to class without actively participating in the homeschool environment. This can make parents feel more isolated. Finding your tribe or group of people who also homeschool makes it easier.

    Primary quote: [39:23] "With a six year old, you throw them in a room full of six year olds and instantaneously, they've got three new best friends. Teenagers, you do the same thing and it's nine times out of 10..."  
    Supporting examples:

    - Shakespeare to theater transition [43:20]
    - Strategy doc: "Social-Emotional Learning and Mental Health" priority
    - Connects to target audience belief: "Concerns about socialization and lack of interaction with peers"
    
    [Content]  
    "With a six-year-old, you throw them in a room and instantly they have three best friends. With teenagers, it's different," shares veteran homeschool mom Sandy. "Finding people you click with is hard at that age – whether you're in school or not."
    
    The myth that homeschoolers lack socialization is crumbling. Instead, families are discovering that meaningful connections often happen through shared interests and purposeful activities. One OpenEd student found his tribe through debate club, eventually organizing his own student-run prom. Another connected through community theater after a Shakespeare class sparked unexpected passion.
    
    The lesson? Real socialization isn't about sitting in a classroom with 30 peers – it's about finding your people through genuine interests.
    
    [Expansion possibilities]
    
    - Add stats from Strategic Narrative doc about social outcomes
    - Include more examples from transcript of successful social connections
    - Could develop into larger piece about different socialization approaches by age
    - Consider adding parent testimonials about socialization successes

    - A passionate baker whose food blog now outshines mom's pantry
    
    The common thread? Time and freedom to pursue interests deeply. While traditional schools treat passions as "extracurriculars," open education allows them to become the core of learning – and often, future careers.

### Long Clips

- [About your homeschooling journey/An OpenEd parent's resource guide (attach her resource document)](https://clip.opus.pro/clip/P1101920qV1e?editType=normal#24)
    
    What has that journey been like for you, getting started in homeschool and then over time getting as deep as you are now?
    
    Sandy Grant (00:54.32)  
    we originally started homeschooling when, my number three child was approaching kindergarten age and he already knew pretty much everything he needed to know, during kindergarten. And so I kind of started thinking about maybe homeschooling him. And then my husband suggested that we, might also, homeschool the older two who were in,
    
    approaching second and fourth grade. And so we decided to pull them all out at that point and I just fell in love with homeschooling and I loved it. The community was a lot smaller back then. There were a lot less resources and we were pretty much on our own but we found some small groups to get us going and a good support group.
    
    One of the things I really appreciated was those who had done it, were willing to, sorry, the dog is barking. Cookie, come here. Willing to share their ideas with me and what worked for them. And so as I moved along, I started doing more homeschool support options and.
    
    I found I was answering the same questions over and over again, so I did make a document that I share to kind of answer all the beginning questions and things that work, things that don't, and hopefully whatever tips I can give that are helpful.
    

### Short clips

- [It doesn’t hurt to ask your kids](https://clip.opus.pro/clip/P1101920qV1e?editType=normal#5)
    
    What is one story or example of something that has really, really worked for your kid? ~~Either like a success that they were able to have because they have this flexibility and they do homeschool or~~ just something that looking back you're like, this was really, really cool, one of my favorite moments.
    
    Sandy Grant (43:20.44)  
    I think one of them was my one daughter who's not academic I heard about a Shakespeare class that was happening and I'm like there is no way in this world that she's gonna want to do that that is way too academic for her but I'm like okay I'll ask her and she actually said yes that she wanted to take the class and so I signed her up for the class and I will say she was not the most stalwart student in the class but she loved
    
    the social aspect of it and she loved the theater aspect of it and it got her into doing community theater and she's doing community theater still. So it was, I think it doesn't hurt to ask your kids.
    
    even if you don't think it would be something that they would be interested in, go ahead and ask them if you think it's something they would benefit from, say, what do you think about taking this ballroom dance class? Probably they might say no. But you might be surprised as well.
    
- [It’s hard being a homeschool teacher AND a mom](https://clip.opus.pro/clip/P1101920qV1e?editType=normal#7)
    
    What has been the biggest challenge in your homeschool journey?
    
    Sandy Grant (41:57.546)  
    It's a little overwhelming.
    
    Sandy Grant (42:16.82)  
    I would say the balancing between being a mom and being a teacher. Just for me, knowing that the responsibility of their education lies on my shoulders, it's a big daunting, you know.
    
    responsibility that you're faced with as a homeschool mom and yet that relationship of being their mom and letting them know that no matter how they do on their schoolwork you still love them. It's hard. It's not an easy thing to do but I'll come back to if you just keep trying you won't ruin your kids.
    
- [What if you’re never taught how to schedule your own time (](https://clip.opus.pro/clip/P1101920qV1e?editType=normal#28)_[I like this one)](https://clip.opus.pro/clip/P1101920qV1e?editType=normal#28)_
    
    if you are constantly being told as a child what you need to do to fill your time, then when you're an adult and you have free time and you're like, I don't know what to do with it, you know? And so I think it's important that they have the option to.
    
    choose how they spend some time of their day.
    
    Ela Richmond (32:12.798)  
    I completely agree with that. I've seen so many people that I know really, really well, friends, family, et cetera, that grew up with that whole like, okay, every single bit of your schedule is filled. You're gonna do school in the morning, then you have clubs, then you have all these other things, and then they stop. And it's like, you're so used to a certain pace, but then the question is, okay, well, how am I gonna fill my time? And taking an active role in filling your own time is really, really difficult if you've never been taught how to do that.

So Sandy has six kids. She began homeschool in 2004. So she's been doing this for a very, very long time. She's a veteran in this. Five of your kids are done with homeschool, and now you just have one more, correct?

Sandy Grant (00:23.928)  
Yes, he's 16 and he's a junior this year, so.

Ela Richmond (00:28.684)  
That's awesome. And you're very, very involved in the homeschool world. You have a guide that is absolutely incredible for new homeschool parents that I know you share liberally. You're very embedded inside of just different Facebook groups and different communities. What has that journey been like for you, getting started in homeschool and then over time getting as deep as you are now?

Sandy Grant (00:54.32)  
we originally started homeschooling when, my number three child was approaching kindergarten age and he already knew pretty much everything he needed to know, during kindergarten. And so I kind of started thinking about maybe homeschooling him. And then my husband suggested that we, might also, homeschool the older two who were in,

approaching second and fourth grade. And so we decided to pull them all out at that point and I just fell in love with homeschooling and I loved it. The community was a lot smaller back then. There were a lot less resources and we were pretty much on our own but we found some small groups to get us going and a good support group.

One of the things I really appreciated was those who had done it, were willing to, sorry, the dog is barking. Cookie, come here. Willing to share their ideas with me and what worked for them. And so as I moved along, I started doing more homeschool support options and.

I found I was answering the same questions over and over again, so I did make a document that I share to kind of answer all the beginning questions and things that work, things that don't, and hopefully whatever tips I can give that are helpful.

Ela Richmond (02:37.782)  
yeah, that document is incredible. If you're okay with it, I would totally love to link it below and just kind of share it with, thank you, to share it with all of our audience. Because I was reading through it and it goes through everything from the curriculums that you've tried to the different resources that have been helpful in your family to the way that you structure your learning. So when you got started, you mentioned that homeschool was obviously such a different thing than it is today. There were...

Sandy Grant (02:42.22)  
Yes, you're welcome to.

Ela Richmond (03:05.87)  
far fewer resources, far fewer communities. What was that like for you? watching all of this unfold, how has that been over time?

Sandy Grant (03:15.48)  
I guess it was a giant leap in that I, we, one, we were on a very limited budget. think our budget was $50 for all three kids total. And so we were buying inexpensive workbooks or looking for things that the DI or the thrift stores and stuff, just looking for inexpensive resources that I could cover all the subjects.

One of the things I did start with was I I started with what I was familiar with and trying to replicate public schools where we would start with math and do that for a half hour and then move on to language arts. And I had that structure laid out and we had a little school room down in the basement where we all sat and everybody had a desk to sit at. I quickly found that

that was not working. had a baby that would need diaper changes or I'd have to go to nurse and I'd miss math, you know, for the day or I'd send the kids out to recess and my sister would call and, you know, it's been weeks since I talked to her. So I'd want to talk to her. And so I talked to her and realized that we skipped three subjects. And so I found that

what really worked better was having a checklist of, this is what we want to get done during the day. We want to do math. We want to, I want an opportunity to read with the kids or we need to do spelling and just whatever I wanted each child to accomplish. And I can kind of show a little picture of a chart. There's a couple of them. I found that

by making charts and just listing what we needed to do, our day was more natural and fluid. And if things were going, if I was busy with the baby, then I could have them do something that they could do on their own. You know, if they had a computer program that they used, I said, well, go do your read your rabbit and then I'll get back to you when I'm done with the baby. And it made it a lot easier.

Sandy Grant (05:40.13)  
having a lot of kids to work around to be able to make sure I got everything done and we didn't let everything go. But it was more functional and doable than trying to stick on a schedule, per se.

Ela Richmond (05:49.56)  
Mm -hmm.

Ela Richmond (06:01.676)  
Yeah, how did you figure out what was going to go on those checklists to begin with? Well, like what was guiding you in that?

Sandy Grant (06:09.208)  
mostly I kind of look at each subject and what I want to include and, and for the most part, I like for language arts, I break it down. So it's not like it just says, do your language arts on the chart. It'll say, okay, we're going to do read with mom and every day. And I want you to do your spelling every day. And I want you to read for 30 minutes or, know, for a younger kid, maybe 15 minutes on your own. And so I would.

say okay there's language arts and then I would same with math I would say okay I want you to do a lesson of math and I want you to work on your math facts so those two things would be on the chart and then you know science and history and just the basic things that you would want to include in your day and each year I kind of evaluate okay what do I want to focus on and what do I want on their charts

And then I try to keep it down to like about 10 things on their chart, some of them that they can do on their own for when I am not available to help them. And so it's kind of a, you learn as you go and many years I'll make a chart and three weeks in and I will say, this is not working. We have way too much to do or this curriculum is not something that they're gonna.

that's gonna work for this kid. So I'll go in, revamp their chart a few weeks in and that's fine. Or even halfway through the year, you know, if you find, okay, we were using this curriculum for math and it's just not working, it's perfectly fine to switch things up and change as needed. So.

Ela Richmond (07:58.498)  
How do you, my gosh, yeah. How do you know, I've heard this from so many parents, but how do you know when a curriculum won't work for a certain kid? Like how do you know the difference between, okay, this is just challenging for them and hey, this is really not gonna work.

Sandy Grant (08:17.216)  
That takes a lot of intuition and just gut feeling sometimes because I know I have a lot of kids who just won't do it because they don't like it and it's not because it's too hard, it's not because it's too easy, it's just they're being stubborn. And so you kind of have to say, are they just being stubborn? And even if that is the case, okay, is this a fight that I'm worth fighting?

that's worth fighting, you know? Right now I'm dealing with my son with writing. I was trying to bare bones it and make it as easy as possible for him and I said, okay, I want you to write for five minutes every day. I don't care what you write and that was just one little thing on his chart. I want you to write for five minutes and here's a Google Doc, I want you to use this Google Doc and I'll just make sure you wrote something every day and he has

fought me on that so much and so I'm in the process of trying to evaluate, okay, is this worth fighting because he won't do any of his other school because this one task is so overwhelming for him or do we look at a different option to cover the material or to something else to focus on for language arts this year, you know, and so it's just kind of

A lot of trial and error and you just have to be willing to recognize that that's part of the game plan and that's just kind of something that you will have to address is trial and error and trying to figure out, what works, what doesn't work and what am I willing to fight with and what can I say? You know what? This really is not worth what I'm getting out of it, you know? Cause sometimes, you know, if it's just busy work anyway,

and they don't want to do the busy work, then there's no point in making them do it. Even if it looked fun to me, why are you not enjoying it, you know? I think sometimes we think it would be a good thing, a good fit for them and it's not, so.

Ela Richmond (10:32.842)  
Mm -hmm. I imagine that's also difficult with six different kids, six different, you know, personalities, six different passions and things that they're good at. How has that been for you as, you know, a parent, as the person that's kind of leading them and guiding them in this homeschool journey to figure out the best path for each individual six kids?

Sandy Grant (10:57.112)  
I think each year I spend a lot, I do most of my planning during the summer. Once school starts, I don't have time to make lessons plans a lot. And so I pretty much try to say, okay, this is what we're going to do during the school year. And this is how much I want them to get done each day. And so during the summer, I'll kind of look at each subject and how each kid can get that subject.

checked off on their list. some years we'll do it all together like for history. Some years we will do it as part of our morning routine where we just include history in there. Other years we'll all be covering the same like doing US history but I'll have one using a textbook, a public school textbook, one just reading

Joy Hakim's story of our history of us books, the 11 volume set, you know, and one of them may be watching Liberty Kids, you know, and so the different kids you kind of meet them where they are and try and cover the subject. Some years we go really light on history and go heavier on science and some years.

we really focus on read out louds and making the most of that experience. And so every year I kind of just say, where do I want our focus to be this year? And it changes every year, you know. One year, all we did for history was during lunch, we watched an episode of American Ride and that was our history for the year. And so you just kind of have to...

Ela Richmond (12:40.674)  
Mm

Sandy Grant (12:54.848)  
say what works for our family this year and it can change as well.

Ela Richmond (13:01.8)  
Is this a lot of trial and error too? So like you're figuring out, okay, this kid might work best with online resources or this kid might really, really enjoy videos or this kid might really enjoy reading. Is it a lot of that? And then trying to like slot in what works best for a kid in the subject that works best for them.

Sandy Grant (13:21.332)  
Yeah, it is. Like one year I had it all planned out. I was going to use story of the world and that's what we were going to do. And I had all the books lined up, what read out louds we were going to do and the worksheets were all set and everything. And the first day, the first week of school, I brought out the textbook and my one daughter says, I won't do that. I don't like that textbook. And so I won't do that. And she...

was not even going to make it possible for me to do it with anybody. She was just being really stubborn about it. And so what I did was I took a step back and said, okay, what can we do to hit this subject without using this textbook that she is so adamant that she will not sit through.

And so story of the world has an activity guide where there's a recommended picture books that go along with each chapter. So I just, every week I put those picture books on hold and we read the picture books rather than the textbook. And we did it as part of our, just bedtime routine, I think. And I just, we just read picture books and they were all about the same subject. she got all the material, just not.

using the textbooks. Two years later, she decided she wanted to do Story of the World and she wanted to do the textbook. So we did end up using the textbook, just not that year. She was being very stubborn and didn't want to even consider it.

Ela Richmond (15:04.694)  
Yeah, when do you fight your kids on those things? Like when are you like, okay, I know you're being stubborn, you know, like we have to do this as opposed to recognizing that maybe let's say, because I was talking to somebody else and they were talking about the fact that sometimes your kids are ready to receive information in a certain way and sometimes they're not, right? Sometimes they're ready to learn about math and this complex thing and sometimes they're not and if you just wait a little bit more,

Sandy Grant (15:26.53)  
there.

Ela Richmond (15:32.714)  
then the patience that you have will allow you to meet them when they're ready. But like, how do you know as a parent? I mean, I guess this is really hard to answer, but like...

Sandy Grant (15:43.032)  
It's really hard because you're not only their teacher, you're also their mom and you have to deal with them all day long and you can't send them home and make their parents do the homework with them or anything. It's all on you and so I tend to probably be a little light on, I'm like, this isn't working and it's not worth fighting. For the most part, I don't like fighting with my kids and so...

Ela Richmond (15:49.837)  
Mm -hmm.

Sandy Grant (16:13.194)  
If I can, I usually will try and find an alternative that accomplishes the same task. If they're not interested in using that specific curriculum, I will say, well, we still need to do language arts. I'm not going to let you not do language arts. But these are our options. What option do you want? And giving them a little choice as to.

I'm not going to make you use this curriculum if it's going to be a fight, but you do need to do something. So let's find something that you're willing to do. And sometimes it's hard. Sometimes I've got some kids who would do it, whatever I asked them to do and felt bad if I was, if they were not doing everything. And then I had other kids who were like, you can try and teach me mom. Good luck. I don't want to learn, you know?

Ela Richmond (16:48.472)  
Mm -hmm.

Sandy Grant (17:11.124)  
And so each kid is different and sometimes you have to put the relationship before your desire to have them meet all of your check boxes that you want to have them meet.

Ela Richmond (17:29.9)  
Hmm. That is an interesting note right there. Put your relationship before, like your parent relationship, parent to child relationship before your teacher to child relationship or the homeschooling relationship. I bet a lot of parents feel that, where it's like, it's like, you know, you're with your kid all the time in a normal school environment, traditional school environment. It's the teacher and then the parents at home. How do you, how do you balance that?

Sandy Grant (17:37.464)  
Mm -hmm.

Ela Richmond (17:59.138)  
delicately.

Sandy Grant (18:00.608)  
I don't know that I did a really good job it. Honestly, I don't know that it's, it's hard. It is hard because you're with your kid and you're tucking in them into bed and in your head you're like, why didn't you do your math today? I'm so frustrated about this because I, I'm trying to make this easy on you and you're trying to make it hard on me. And, and, and yet you want to be able to just leave all that behind and just say, I love you kid, you know, and

No matter what you're doing in school and that we've been fighting all morning about trying to get you to do what's on your checklist, you still want them to know that you love them. And it's really just hard and you just have to keep trying. that's my number one thing, just keep trying and it's not going to look picture perfect. No matter, I mean, maybe there's a picture perfect homeschool family out there, but I haven't met them and it certainly wasn't me.

But I have people who think it is. I have people who say, her kids are geniuses. My kids are not geniuses. But you just keep trying. And you just do your best so that you can know at the end, I did try. And they may not be going to college, or that may not be their path. But you tried. You did the best you could.

to provide them with everything they needed.

Ela Richmond (19:36.493)  
Mm -hmm.

Sandy Grant (19:37.142)  
You just do your best.

Ela Richmond (19:39.318)  
Yeah, I want to touch on that in a little bit. You mentioned earlier that you've, well, three of your kids, two of them are in college and then one of them is not. And she chose that as her own path. But I want to touch on that in a second. But before I get there, what was the what was the journey for you to go from homeschooling young kids to homeschooling older kids? Because I think there are a lot of people that also kind of are trying to figure that out, too, because

It's difficult to go from young kids where you understand most of the material. It's not extremely advanced. It's fun. They're pretty receptive. They might be a little bit like all over the place, but they're usually pretty happy to learn to teenagers where the challenges are so different. What was that like for you and all your kids?

Sandy Grant (20:20.331)  
Mm

Sandy Grant (20:28.834)  
I mean, I think it's the same as any aspect of parenting. You go from a baby who's just laying there in the crib to a toddler to a preschooler. I mean, they grow so gradually that you just kind of go from one step. I do know that for me, when I first was delving into high school, you know, with my oldest, it's very, you worry about it.

because you're like, can I do this? Am I going to ruin my kids? It's a big concern. Am I going to ruin my kids? And from my experience, as long as you keep trying, you will not ruin your kids. No matter what curriculum you're using, no matter whether you're an unschooler or a online schooler, whatever you're doing, as long as you keep trying.

You won't ruin your kids. I do think that we worry probably a lot more than we need to, which is standard for mothering. I think, you know, we worry that our kids aren't potty training early enough and we worry whether or not our kids will go to college. We worry. Now that I have three kids who have graduated from college, I worry that they'll be able to live the life that they want to live, you know? And so you do worry.

but you just need to know that as long as you keep trying, you'll be okay. And they'll turn out okay. It's, homeschooling high school is not all that much different than the other grades. And one of the joys of homeschooling is they do have, there is homeschool curriculum out there that is designed to be taught by people who don't know.

Ela Richmond (22:04.696)  
Yeah, I like that.

Sandy Grant (22:25.62)  
anything about the subject, you know, and so I tried to use, if I used a science curriculum for high school, I picked a homeschool one rather than a public school one because those are not designed to be taught at home. And so.

Ela Richmond (22:42.134)  
What's an example of what they do differently?

Sandy Grant (22:46.232)  
Primarily, they have it written to the student rather than written as a textbook. They kind of assume the student doesn't know anything and also assume that the student doesn't have anywheres to go for the answer. So they'll include answer keys that the student has access to or.

The descriptions are written in such a way that the student can help find the answers to the questions. And so they're just designed to be used by people who are not experts in the subject.

Ela Richmond (23:29.42)  
That's awesome. Yeah, that's super helpful. bet a lot of homeschool parents, if they're just getting started, probably hopefully are learning something there. Because I didn't know that there was a difference between those two. So that's really cool.

Sandy Grant (23:43.256)  
Yeah, I mean I took calculus, but I certainly couldn't solve the problems that my kids have to solve in their calculus workbook or their assignments. I couldn't do that at this point. It's been 30 years since I was in school. So yeah, you get the solutions manuals that are provided by the curriculum and the answer keys.

Ela Richmond (24:00.693)  
Mm -hmm.

Sandy Grant (24:12.524)  
You just kind of, and part of it is you learn alongside your kids as well.

Ela Richmond (24:18.424)  
Have you enjoyed that?

Sandy Grant (24:20.374)  
I have. I much prefer the younger set. will say teenagers stress me out a little bit. But one of the things I really loved is I didn't use a reading curriculum for most of my kids. Most of them, we just went to the library and got readers. And I pointed to the words and they read along with me and they learned to read that way. But it wasn't working for my youngest. And so I actually got a reading curriculum.

for him that was designed for dyslexic kids.

I was amazed that I'm like, I never knew that, you know, the rules about the soft C's and the soft G's, you know, I had no idea. And so it was great for me to be able to learn all these new things that, you know, I've been reading for 40 years, but I didn't ever know that that's why that letter made that sound at that point, you know.

And so I love learning and so it's been fun to be able to learn the things that I'm able to learn alongside my kids. So.

Ela Richmond (25:33.548)  
found that that's definitely a common thread in a lot of homeschool parents is just the love of learning.

Sandy Grant (25:40.182)  
Yeah. And I kind of miss it because in teenagers they do so much on their own. I'm like, I kind of want to do that with you. But at the same time, they do need a little bit of autonomy and they don't like doing everything with moms.

Ela Richmond (25:45.845)  
Mm -hmm.

Ela Richmond (25:55.956)  
Mm -hmm. Yeah, so back to the conversation about your kids and college. So one of the things that Isaac, our CEO at OpenEd, is pretty big on is the idea that not everybody needs to go to college and that there are so many options outside in the world. There are trades, there are very specific types of jobs that you can get into without college.

And then there's a set of jobs that you can't get into unless you go to college. What was that experience like for you? Were you already pretty open to the idea of no college or was that something that you became more okay with as you started to reflect on your child and the things that they needed?

Sandy Grant (26:41.709)  
you

Sandy Grant (26:46.488)  
It's kind of hard because I grew up, me and my sister were the first college graduates in my family. And so for me, that was the end goal is to get a college education because I saw that not having a college education limited some of my family. They couldn't do certain things.

Ela Richmond (26:55.586)  
Wow.

Sandy Grant (27:14.968)  
Even my brother went to work and he was working, but he got to a certain point where he couldn't advance without a degree. And so for me, that college degree was important. Also, I wanted my kids to be able to, when they moved out of the home, to be surrounded by a group of peers who were doing something with their lives. You know, I didn't want them...

Ela Richmond (27:24.195)  
Thanks

Sandy Grant (27:44.172)  
getting an apartment somewhere and hanging out with a bunch of kids who were just playing video games all day or working at pizza as a delivery boy. I wanted them to be associating with people who were trying to better their lives. And I felt like college was the best place for them to do that. And so for the most part, that was always my goal.

Ela Richmond (28:00.962)  
Mm -hmm.

Sandy Grant (28:12.896)  
And honestly, that's probably where I would like them to go. But I don't honestly think that that degree is always necessary or even beneficial. My oldest graduated in our education. And it's quite a useless degree because there's no full -time positions in our education. There's a whole bunch of part -time positions, but she's, you know, she's.

found it really, it's really hard to find a job. And so unless there's a job at the end of that four -year degree that's a marketable job, we paid four years for the experience, not for the job that she got at the end, you know. Whereas my son, he graduated in computer programming and came out earning a big, huge paycheck, you know. And so...

Ela Richmond (28:56.845)  
Mm -hmm.

Sandy Grant (29:10.548)  
It kind of depends on what their major is and you have to be wise and help them to be wise in choosing the direction that they're going, especially if they're going to need to have a solid income. Now my oldest still pays her bills and she's had a job. It just hasn't been in her field.

Ela Richmond (29:30.658)  
That makes sense. Kind of along the same lines, one of the things that you mentioned in your guide, which again everybody should check out, was the idea of self -led interests and how as a homeschool family, it's really important to leave time not just for the curriculum and the subjects that you have to do and check the boxes on, but also for the self -led interests that your children might have. Can you talk to me a little bit about that and...

kind of how you've helped your kids develop their self -led interests over time.

Sandy Grant (30:07.618)  
I think my key is I just try to keep everything that has to do with our home school, you know, we're going to get our school done type stuff. I try to keep that pretty simple and I make sure, want to make sure that they're well, they've got a broad base for everything they need to learn so that they, you know, can understand the basic timeline of history and the basic concepts of biology and physics and stuff like that.

But I don't want to fill up their whole day with things that they have to do for me and leave no time for them to have things that they're interested in. And so I try to keep it down to, you know, about four hours worth of school, maybe a little bit more, you know, so that they're done by two or three in the afternoon and they can have plenty of time to do their own thing.

And whether or not they filled that time is kind of more up to them because at that time I'm like, I got to get dinner done and stuff like that. I've moved on. but like my son has, since he was 10 to 12 has loved computer programming and he was making things on scratch and, that's what he grew up to be is a computer programmer. and so.

I think that it allows them to have that flexibility to do it. And also I think it's a good preparation for life because in life you have a lot of free time that you have to fill. And if you are constantly being told as a child what you need to do to fill your time, then when you're an adult and you have free time and you're like, I don't know what to do with it, you know? And so I think it's important that they have the option to.

choose how they spend some time of their day.

Ela Richmond (32:12.798)  
I completely agree with that. I've seen so many people that I know really, really well, friends, family, et cetera, that grew up with that whole like, okay, every single bit of your schedule is filled. You're gonna do school in the morning, then you have clubs, then you have all these other things, and then they stop. And it's like, you're so used to a certain pace, but then the question is, okay, well, how am I gonna fill my time? And taking an active role in filling your own time is really, really difficult if you've never been taught how to do that.

What are some other examples of things that your kids have done to fill their time?

Sandy Grant (32:47.512)  
it kind of just went off their interest. My oldest was a reader. She read a ton. My number two was a baker. She cooked a lot and she, she has a food blog where she shares her recipes and her pantry looks nothing like my pantry. It's a lot more fancy. She's, she, she loves to cook.

Number three, he's a programmer. He spends all of his time on the computer and that's what he does. Then, just go down the list. Number four.

Ela Richmond (33:24.12)  
Thanks.

Sandy Grant (33:25.59)  
was mostly social. She was more interested in going and playing with her friends. We signed her up for ballet for a year and they wanted to have her take more classes and she's pretty much, yeah, I'd rather play with my friends. But she's a very social person and she's very good at, she loves everybody, you know? That's her personality and she can make friends with anybody.

My next son spent a lot of time doing debate with the Wasatch Independent Debate League. He started, actually, when he was 11, he said he wanted to do debate. You have to be 12, but he turned 12.

the week before school started, he was technically old enough. And so he actually had to talk with Sam Martino who's in charge of it and he had to get permission to join at that young age. But he loved it, he did it for the full six years. was on the student council and he was a TA for the beginning and intermediate classes for a couple years. And he actually

his senior year, he decided that they needed to have a prom for his senior year. And so he actually formed committees and...

I took him over to the community center and we rented the building and he, I went as a chaperone. I just, I'm like, I should probably go and, and support just to be supportive of you. I should probably go and see how it's going. And I took him over there and I'm like, where are all the debate staff, you know, where's, where are all the people from debate? And he's like, no, this is just us. And so

Sandy Grant (35:21.08)  
It was just a bunch of teenagers that ran the entire prom and there was no adult Other the only other adults there were his chaperone Person that he was over the chaperones. It was all their family his family his aunts and uncles were there and so He was able to do that all by himself. And so that's how he is

Ela Richmond (35:28.141)  
Wow.

Ela Richmond (35:37.922)  
Wow, that's so cool.

Sandy Grant (35:43.72)  
And then finally my youngest is really into Minecraft videos and he watches Minecraft videos and he makes Minecraft videos and he records and he edits and he does all the background stuff and he spends exorbitant amounts of time doing that.

Ela Richmond (36:07.01)  
That's so cool that you've given them the opportunity to do that. What was it like balancing, obviously, the at -home aspect, but also the social aspect, especially having six kids? Were you trying to find things in the beginning that could, I don't know, work for everybody? Or were you open to doing one thing for one kid and another thing for another kid?

Sandy Grant (36:28.664)  
when I had all six home, it was really hard. I liked for each of them to have something that they were doing. but like if you're running six kids to something, you run out of days to run, run the kids. And so for a while there, we were involved in a, in a, just a small, relaxed style co -op.

Ela Richmond (36:44.247)  
Yeah.

Sandy Grant (36:54.378)  
where they had a group for preschoolers, a group for girls, group for boys, and a group for the teenagers. And we did that for a couple years so that everybody had their group, but it was all within a two -hour block of our day. I really feel like that was heaven -sent for me because it's what I needed at that point, because there was no way I could meet everybody's at that.

Ela Richmond (37:18.124)  
Mm -hmm.

Sandy Grant (37:19.668)  
And after a couple years, the group kind of died. But by then, I had kids graduating and I didn't have as, my payload wasn't as heavy, I guess. I didn't have as much on my hands because I was sending kids off to college and stuff. And so, but for those years, that worked really well to be able to meet all of their social needs. My older kids will tell you that,

the social was not what they wanted it to be. And it was pretty much because there weren't as many homeschoolers out there. There weren't as many classes available for homeschoolers to take. And we also didn't have the funds. My oldest never used MyTechHigh, which is now OpenEd. My second just did it her senior year.

And so there just wasn't as many options for them. My younger kids have had a lot more options available to them. My youngest chooses not to partake of them. He's perfectly happy not doing much socially. But Zach, the one who did the prom, he was...

Ela Richmond (38:21.634)  
Mm -hmm.

Sandy Grant (38:44.054)  
very social and had friends all over the place. I'm like, where did you meet this person? He had friends all over the place and he went to, think, three or four different proms his senior year because he was invited to them by all of his friends. There's definitely more options available now than...

Ela Richmond (39:02.97)  
wow.

Sandy Grant (39:12.556)  
there have been in the past.

Ela Richmond (39:15.098)  
yeah, and that's exciting. I mean, for newer families especially, but also I mean, I imagine for even you watching how much this landscape has developed, it's pretty exciting.

Sandy Grant (39:23.884)  
Yeah. Yeah.

I know when my older two first started being teenagers, we would get, you know, on the homeschool groups and we'd try to get all the kids together. But you're, you're dealing with teenagers and it's not with, with a six year old, you throw them in a room full of six year olds and I'll instantaneously, they've they've got three new best friends. Teenagers, you do the same thing and it's nine times out of 10, you're going to find nobody that you want to talk to as a teenager.

You know, and so it was a struggle that there were options out there that they were able to do, but finding people who you clicked with is hard as a teenager and so.

Ela Richmond (40:12.886)  
Yeah. my gosh. I mean, it was even difficult. I went to traditional school, but that was even difficult for me.

Sandy Grant (40:18.581)  
Yeah, yeah, and I was the same. Social just was not something that happened and I went to school every day.

Ela Richmond (40:26.326)  
Yeah. No, yeah, I love that. So I'm going to hit you with a couple of rapid fire questions to end out this interview. It's been so fun so far. I'm excited to hear your thoughts on these next things. So rapid fire question number one.

What advice would you have for a new open ed or open education parent at any grade level?

Sandy Grant (40:53.492)  
Number one, read ParentLink because it answers a lot of your questions and there is a large learning curve, especially if you're going custom built. There's a lot of things you need to know, what's approved, what's not approved and how to create your schedule and stuff. But reading ParentLink can help you do that. Ask other parents who have been there.

that's probably a big thing is you just don't be afraid to ask questions. Even if people will say, well, have you read ParentLink?

Yeah, it's true. You should probably read ParentLink first because then it'll cut out a lot of your stupid questions, but really there's no stupid questions. so there will be people who will answer you even if it is something that you could have found out in ParentLink.

Ela Richmond (41:52.844)  
No, that's a good point. ParentLink has a ton of information. Sometimes it's difficult to navigate which... yeah, which we are working on. So updates to come hopefully in the next little while. But yes, definitely a good resource. Next rapid fire question. What has been the biggest challenge in your homeschool journey?

Sandy Grant (41:57.546)  
It's a little overwhelming.

Sandy Grant (42:16.82)  
I would say the balancing between being a mom and being a teacher. Just for me, knowing that the responsibility of their education lies on my shoulders, it's a big daunting, you know.

responsibility that you're faced with as a homeschool mom and yet that relationship of being their mom and letting them know that no matter how they do on their schoolwork you still love them. It's hard. It's not an easy thing to do but I'll come back to if you just keep trying you won't ruin your kids.

Ela Richmond (42:58.334)  
Mm -hmm, I love that. Third rapid -fire question. What is one story or example of something that has really, really worked for your kid? Either like a success that they were able to have because they have this flexibility and they do homeschool or just something that looking back you're like, this was really, really cool, one of my favorite moments.

Sandy Grant (43:20.44)  
I think one of them was my one daughter who's not academic I heard about a Shakespeare class that was happening and I'm like there is no way in this world that she's gonna want to do that that is way too academic for her but I'm like okay I'll ask her and she actually said yes that she wanted to take the class and so I signed her up for the class and I will say she was not the most stalwart student in the class but she loved

the social aspect of it and she loved the theater aspect of it and it got her into doing community theater and she's doing community theater still. So it was, I think it doesn't hurt to ask your kids.

even if you don't think it would be something that they would be interested in, go ahead and ask them if you think it's something they would benefit from, say, what do you think about taking this ballroom dance class? Probably they might say no. But you might be surprised as well.

Ela Richmond (44:28.008)  
Great advice. And the last rapid fire question. What do you see being a challenge this next year, this coming year, different from this year and the years prior for homeschool families? I know you're really involved. You talk to a lot of them.

Sandy Grant (44:44.83)  
one of the things I actually miss about homeschooling not being as popular is there was a lot more community where the moms were teaching the classes. And so I, as a mom would sign my kid up for a class, but I would be helping with that class. And so I'd get to know the moms. And so one of the hardest things

Ela Richmond (44:59.351)  
Mmm.

Sandy Grant (45:09.908)  
with the advent of funds being put into the system, a lot more parents are just sending their kids to class, but they're not actively participating in that homeschool environment. And so I guess to me, the lack of support and interaction among the homeschool parents.

and helping each other out and associating with others who are also in your situation, it makes you feel a little bit more isolated as a parent at home schools because you're not associating with people with other people. So, you know, the more you can find your tribe or find your group of people that you can associate with that also homeschool, I think it makes it easier.

So.

Ela Richmond (46:00.6)  
That's a great point. Well, this has been so amazing and you've shared so many amazing things. I hope that everybody listening is walking away with a lot of great tips, actionable things, and also just like mindset things, better ways to look at their homeschool journey. Thank you so much.

Sandy Grant (46:19.318)  
You're welcome. I hope it was helpful.

Ela Richmond (46:23.146)  
No, it definitely was. And you're very active in all of the Facebooks and also basically most homeschool groups, right?

Sandy Grant (46:32.758)  
Yeah, primarily the Utah Home School Network because I'm an admin there. But I do try to be on the My Tech High page and all of that.

Ela Richmond (46:48.227)  
that's fine. We'll edit that part out.

Sandy Grant (46:50.808)  
My son just got home and the dog passed to welcome him, so. Yeah, thank you.

Ela Richmond (46:57.528)  
That's so cute. Well, thank you again so much. This was awesome.
