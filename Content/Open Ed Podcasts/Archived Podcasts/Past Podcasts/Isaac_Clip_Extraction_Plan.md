## What Makes a Good Short-Form Clip?

### Criteria (from podcast-production skill + video-caption-creation)

**1. Story Arc Structure**
- **Setup** (15-30s): Problem, context, or hook
- **Tension** (30-60s): Escalation, conflict, or surprising insight
- **Resolution** (15-30s): Payoff, insight, or actionable takeaway
- **Total length**: 15-60 seconds optimal

**2. Hook Quality (First 3 Seconds)**
- Creates immediate curiosity or emotion
- Addresses a pain point or common question
- Uses accessible language (McDonald's Test)
- Stops the scroll

**3. Standalone Value**
- Works without context from full episode
- Self-contained insight or story
- Clear beginning, middle, end
- No need to watch full episode to understand

**4. Shareability Factors**
- Relatable to homeschool/education parents
- Challenges common assumptions
- Provides practical value
- Creates "I need to share this" moment

**5. Visual Potential**
- Can be enhanced with on-screen text
- Clear speaker (Isaac or guest)
- Natural pauses for text overlays
- Emotional moments (facial expressions matter)

## Clip Types to Look For

- Step-by-step guidance
- Example: "How to balance freedom and future prep"

### 3. Personal Stories
- Isaac's own experiences
- Guest transformation stories
- Relatable struggles and wins

### 4. Myth-Busting

- "Will my kids be weird?" type questions
- Debunks misconceptions

### 5. Emotional Moments

- Powerful realizations
- Moments of connection

### 6. Data/Research Insights
- Surprising statistics
- Research-backed claims
- Counter-intuitive findings

## Workflow Per Episode

### Step 1: Read Full Transcript
- Understand the episode's themes
- Identify 5-8 potential clip moments
- Note timestamps and speakers

### Step 2: Extract Clip Candidates
For each candidate clip, document:
- **Timestamp range** (MM:SS - MM:SS)
- **Speaker(s)**
- **Core message/insight**
- **Story arc** (Setup → Tension → Resolution)
- **Why it's shareable**
- **Target audience** (who would stop scrolling?)

### Step 3: Edit Transcript for Clips
- Use verbatim quotes only (no paraphrasing)
- Mark cuts with ~~strikethrough~~
- Note any rearrangements needed
- Ensure natural flow after editing

### Step 4: Create On-Screen Text Options
For each clip, generate 5-7 hook options:
- **Option 1:** [Hook text] - Category: [Polarizing/Direct Challenge/etc.]
- **Option 2:** [Hook text] - Category: [Counter-Intuitive/etc.]
- Continue for 5-7 options

### Step 5: Platform Optimization
- **TikTok/Reels:** 15-30 seconds, energetic hook
- **YouTube Shorts:** 30-60 seconds, search-friendly
- **LinkedIn:** 60+ seconds, professional tone
- Note platform-specific adaptations
