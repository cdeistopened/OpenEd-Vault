Unpopular opinion: Strict adherence to traditional education models limits a child's potential.

It's not about choosing between homeschool, public school, or private school.

It's about creating a personalized blend that works for YOUR child.

Success comes from flexibility, not rigidity.

  

  

  

  

Problem: Your child is struggling in a traditional school setting.

Solution: Explore open education options.

Open education allows you to:

- Customize learning to your child's needs
- Incorporate real-world experiences
- Blend different educational approaches
- Empower your child to make choices

This flexibility can reignite your child's love for learning.

New Title Option: When Traditional School Fails Your Child (There's Always a Way)

    **Short Clips:**  
    1. THOUGHT: **Andrea Fife:** "Everything's kind of a game, and you've got to decide which games you're willing to play and which ones you're willing to take the risk of not playing." Timestamp: [00:14:02]~~2. TOOL: **Andrea Fife:** "To break free of all the constraints and not feel like just because you chose something this year means you have to choose it always." Timestamp: [00:32:48]~~  
    **Long Clips:**  
    1. TOOL: **Andrea Fife:** "Prior to my experiences at OpenEd, I would have said my experiences were fairly traditional. I spent most of my educational time in what you'd picture as a traditional classroom. But looking back, I realize that while my parents chose a fairly traditional setting, they made choices at every phase to personalize my education. ... From enrolling me in a private school when I was young, to taking a teacher's advice to have me skip a grade for a more challenging academic experience, to allowing me to choose between a more rigorous or social setting in middle school—there were constant adjustments." Timestamp: [00:02:55]  
    2. TREND: **Andrea Fife:** "School was always very easy for me up until I graduated from high school. Looking back, I attribute that to a very supportive environment and my mom personalizing every experience I had, even if it wasn't at home. I didn't realize this until I went off to college on a full tuition scholarship, which I lost really fast. ... I chose a traditional university experience because that's what everybody does, right? But it was awful for me. I had no idea you could test out of classes. I was a music therapy major at first, and despite 13 years of piano lessons, they put me in beginner-level music theory and keyboarding classes. I just stopped going because it wasn't meeting my needs or engaging me." Timestamp: [00:16:00]
    
    **Short Clips:**~~1. TOOL: **Andrea Fife:** "A huge part of that was her willingness to put in the work personally. She never demanded something from the system that didn't exist. Instead, she'd say, 'This doesn't exist, but I think it could. If I'm willing to put in the time, can we create the space?'" Timestamps: [00:05:13]~~  
    2. THOUGHT: **Andrea Fife:** "She wanted us to have personalized education opportunities and be interest-driven, but she didn't want to go so far that we didn't recognize when a system is a system and how to learn to thrive, adapt, and change what we did have control over to make it work." Timestamp: [00:11:04]~~3. TOOL: **Andrea Fife:** "I said, 'Okay, don't go.' He was shocked and said he had to go or he'd fail. I asked him who cares if he fails, and who says he has to graduate. ... I wanted to make sure he knew that the struggles he was having were a result of a choice he made to take that class. If at any point the class stops meeting his needs, he just needs to let me know." Timestamps: [00:14:02]~~  
    **Long Clips:**  
    1. THOUGHT: **Andrea Fife:** "If I could give any piece of my experience to all parents, it would be to see what I get to see. Because I have access to thousands of families and their weekly learning logs, the variety I've seen has changed my entire perspective on education. It's changed how I parent and all my philosophies of education. ... I used to be very rigid, thinking there was one best way. But that first six months here was very humbling. I realized there are so many ways, and kids are thriving in so many different approaches." Timestamp: [00:42:52]  
    2. TOOL: **Andrea Fife:** "As for my goals, I want there not to be a 'no.' For any family or student who can identify their goal, I want us to have a way to get them there. Part of that is also helping kids express their goals, which often involves deconstructing the traditional narrative of what's possible. ... My ultimate goal is that no matter what someone says their goal is, I already have a list of ways to help them access it. That's what success looks like to me—not taking no for an answer and finding a way to get to yes for every learner." Timestamp: [00:42:52]  
    3. TREND: **Isaac:** "Unless and until you know what you want out of it, just assuming college comes after high school doesn't make sense. The fact that you went to work, discovered your interest in graphic design, and then had a reason to go take those classes made all the difference. ... There should be more focus on getting experience in different professions during or after high school. If I had a dollar for every lawyer I know who hates their job and wishes they hadn't gone to law school, I'd be rich. If they had spent a year at a law firm and saw what most lawyers do all day, many of them would have changed their minds." Timestamp: [00:30:20]

## Rough Transcript

# 005 - Andrea Fife

[00:00:00] **Isaac:** Uh, all right, Charlie, I'm going to give you a warning up front that there are people outside my window. They're sawing a piece of butcher block for my wife in our kitchen, and they might have to saw, there might be a one or two times where we got to pause and let them finish, uh, or edit it out. But hopefully we're good to go.

[00:00:17] So with that, I'm going to try to get started in three seconds. All right. Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. Isaac Morehouse here. And, uh, today. I've got Andrea Fyfe, who is the head of learning at Open Ed, and I don't know. I mean, it's only been a couple months that I have been working with Andrea, but I have spent most of 20 years in and around education, and I'm not exaggerating when I say I don't know if I have ever met someone.

[00:00:47] With so much genuine intensity and passion for helping families get the best possible education they can. If there is one ounce of additional educational value that can be gotten out [00:01:00] of something, Andrea is going to find it and get it to those families and as many people as she possibly can. So, Andrea, I wanted to start by asking, where does that come from?

[00:01:10] Where does this intense passion come from? You care so much about helping people maximize their education. I want to know why that, why that's in you.

[00:01:18] **Andrea Fife:** Oh man, I, that's such a, I had to laugh when you described that as intense passion because those are definitely words that I've, I have heard to describe me before. Um, that, I mean, that passion, I mean, it comes partly from my time in the classroom. I was a 5th grade teacher for 10 years, and during that time just my approach kind of changed from that meet the general needs to, you know, try to, try to find every student that needed something a little bit extra and, and, and maximize their, their experience.

[00:01:52] That's honestly actually the reason why I ended up leaving the classroom, um, because it was just unsustainable, [00:02:00] uh, to, to try to go every day and for every single student meet each of those individual needs. Uh, the environment wasn't conducive to the level of personalization that I was trying to provide for, for every student and I was so burned out.

[00:02:17] I actually considered leaving education entirely. Um, and going back into the business world and was super fortunate to find this program that really is built on that idea of being able to maximize everything for, for every learner. So, um, always been there. Definitely noticed it in my time in person in the classroom.

[00:02:38] **Isaac:** Well, I want to zoom back a little bit. I just love, like, I feel like getting people's personal stories is like one of the best way to tease out other insights and things that, that, um, you know, they bring to the table. I would love to back up a little further and rewind to your own upbringing in your own educational experience.

[00:02:55] What was that like? If I remember, maybe there was a mix of [00:03:00] public school, private, like there was, there was some level, like your parents had some awareness of the need to customize, if I remember. So I'd love to just get that, that background from you,

[00:03:08] **Andrea Fife:** Yeah, absolutely. So I, um, Prior to my experiences here at OpenEd, if you would have asked me what my experiences were, whether they were traditional or non traditional, I probably would have answered that they were fairly traditional. I spent most of my educational time in what you would picture as a traditional classroom.

[00:03:28] You know, desks facing the front with a teacher at the front. So I would have thought my experience was fairly traditional until I really looked back at it and thought about what The choices my parents were making at every single step along the way at every phase of that education, uh, that I realized while they chose a fairly traditional setting for me, uh, it was a great choice for my personalized education was a traditional setting.

[00:03:53] But when I think about all the choices that they made from choosing to enroll me in a private school, um, when I was [00:04:00] young, uh, taking a teacher's advice to actually have me. skip a grade when I was, when I was really young for a more challenging academic experience, to allowing me to choose in middle school whether I wanted a more rigorous setting or a more social setting, um, to a year when I actually went back to the private school setting and participated in a grade level that didn't, even exist, um, with a, a truly personalized opportunity.

[00:04:31] I mean, my mom just called the school and was like, this isn't working for, for Andrea. Can, can we bring her back? Uh, I know you don't actually have an eighth grade, um, but can we, can we put her there anyway? She'll, she'll just learn math on her own. Can you just let her sit in the classroom? We'll grade her assignments at home, but I think the rest of the curriculum at this advanced private school is going to work.

[00:04:50] Um,

[00:04:51] **Isaac:** that, that right there, that is amazing. That gives me such a window into where you got some of this, just that you're there, that your mom was [00:05:00] like, look, I don't care that it doesn't exist. I know what my daughter needs. Let's make it work. Can we just make this work and taking the initiative to recognize, like, You can do that.

[00:05:09] You can ask for things that don't already exist. You can customize.

[00:05:13] **Andrea Fife:** Yeah, and I think a huge part of that is she was always willing to put in the work personally. I really never observed my mom demanding something from the system that didn't exist. But she would, she was always willing to go in and say, Hey, this doesn't exist, but I think it could. Uh, if I'm willing to put in, you know, put in the time, can we, can we create the space?

[00:05:33] And so that, that was absolutely the case with that 8th grade experience. You know, she said, No extra lift to the teacher. I'm not asking the teacher to teach seventh grade math and eighth grade math. We can handle the, the math at home. I'll review the homework. Can she just independent study math during that particular block?

[00:05:51] We'll just kind of flip it. She'll do the work there. We'll do the teaching at home. Um, and I think that was one of the secrets, is she was always, she always had this knack for [00:06:00] seeing this already exists, this piece is there. Uh, this safe, supportive environment where people are learning, it's quiet, it's, you know, it's gonna be a great place for learning, but it isn't the curriculum Andrea's ready for.

[00:06:13] How can, can we supplement, how can we get, get the most out of, you know, Both options. I guess when you ask me, where does my passion and intensity come from for that? Absolutely Comes from from my mom and her ability to just say how can I get more out of this?

[00:06:32] **Isaac:** Yeah, it's funny. You, you hinted on something that it's a combination that like it's not just finding the right curriculum or teacher or content for a kid. The setting and the environment are such a huge part of it too. And recognizing like how to bring those two things together because you can get, especially with all the things that are online now you can find almost any type of content.

[00:06:57] That might be a good fit for a particular kid, the content [00:07:00] itself, but you know, the old Marshall McLuhan saying the medium is the message, the way that that content is consumed or the environment the kid is in. If they're around other kids or other people that help spur them on versus an environment that makes them feel threatened or stressed, I think that's so important too.

[00:07:16] So it sounds like you kind of had both, you know, your parents recognizing both things. What is, what does Andrea need in terms of the content of the learning, but what kind of environment is going to work for her?

[00:07:26] **Andrea Fife:** Yeah, uh, absolutely. I always, uh, I always did really well in social learning environments. Uh, I learn well in groups. I, I work well, you know, in an environment where other people are working. I'm not always super self motivated, you know? If, if it's just up to me to be like, No one else is working, but I'm going to work.

[00:07:46] So I've always done really, really well in an area where other students are doing studious things. Um, but with access to a curriculum that's challenging for me or that's personalized or that's interesting or, um, but absolutely a blend, a blend [00:08:00] of the curriculum, the methodology and the environment.

[00:08:04] **Isaac:** Uh, I know that your whole family is very into musical theater talk. Talk to me about the relationship between that and kind of your, your own education and your children's education. Where does, where does that fit? How do those things go together? Because I think sometimes it's easy to see, whether it's sports or, um, music, theater, as you know, dance.

[00:08:28] Those are fun. Hobbies, education is like the real serious stuff. Education is just like learning the math and the science and the, you know. And then those are like, maybe if you're lucky, you have the time, you got your homework done, you can go do the fun stuff, but I don't think you see it that way. So I curious, I'd love to hear your take on that.

[00:08:44] **Andrea Fife:** Uh, yeah, I don't see it that way at all. Um, I always tell people I can't teach without singing and I can't sing without teaching. Uh, they both come out at the same time. It's probably annoying to, to people. But, you know, even if I'm working with adults and we're learning a song, I'm breaking it down into the grammar.[00:09:00]

[00:09:00] You know, you're going to memorize this better if you understand the You know, these prep, this preposition came before this or whatever, and then I end up launching into a grammar lesson. Uh, and if I'm teaching grammar, I'm teaching it through song. Um, I got that from my mom as well. Uh, you're, you're gonna hear that a lot.

[00:09:16] She's the best educator that, that I've, that I've ever known. Um, and so, I don't know that this is the time or the place, but if you would like me to sing my linking verbs, I absolutely still can. Um, that, that's, it was just a, that's how my mom taught. From, from the time that we were little, we would sing in the car on, on trips.

[00:09:37] Um, you know, we would learn rounds as a, as a family, and then she used it in her classroom. She used it at home. Music and education for me are one in the same. Um, Learning to play the piano was a requirement in the household that I grew up in. Uh, I never, when I was younger I didn't quite know why, but once, when I was older, um, my mom explained to me that she knew that I needed the [00:10:00] challenge.

[00:10:00] Uh, that some other things came really easily to me, and she told me, you needed something in your life that you had to work hard for. I wanted you to learn that, and, and piano was, was that thing. And so, that's You know, that was, was woven all, all throughout, uh, and then that later turned into, uh, you know, I took dance for a while, but then that was super time consuming, didn't quite match with our family's values of how much time to dedicate to that extracurricular.

[00:10:30] Wanted to kind of sing and dance that didn't exist So my mom went to the dance studio and said hey, what if I teach a class that is singing and dancing? Um, we can trade i'll teach for free You can enroll whatever your students want to you know Whatever your other dance students might be interested in that in that class If I can use the studio space and so You know, she created this class for my sisters and I other kids got to enroll Um It's always been one and the same in, in our [00:11:00] house.

[00:11:00] Uh, music is learning. Learning is music all together.

[00:11:04] **Isaac:** Uh, I love what you said about, there's, there's a two separate thoughts that I have here from, from what you're sharing. What you said about your mom with piano. I think that's a really good thing to remember that there, it is very true that I think most kids, if they just sort of do the traditional approach to schooling, They end up spending way too much time being forced to do things that they're not particularly good at and they don't particularly like.

[00:11:28] And I think it's really important to be sensitive to that and be like, look, find those things that get your kids excited, that they excel at, that they do really well and let them chase those interests. But it's also important to have some things that are challenging, like to have those challenges. I think that's a great recognition by your mom that, Hey, everything else is coming easy.

[00:11:46] You do need to learn to struggle through some things and that is an important lesson to learn. I know as a homeschooling my kids ourselves and having a lot of, a lot of self direction involved and giving the kids a lot of scope to pursue their interests. One thing we've [00:12:00] done the same thing. We actually have all, all three of our younger kids are taking piano lessons right now, whether they want to or not.

[00:12:05] My mom made me do that. I hated it at the time and I'm so grateful now. Um, but like if everything in life is just stuff your parents are forcing you to do, I don't think you learn very much about how to be self directed and self motivated, but if there's not anything. That is hard. I think that there's something missing.

[00:12:22] Like there should be some things that are a challenge and that you have to force yourself to get over. And maybe that's, if you're a shy kid, maybe it's doing one thing with a group that kind of forces you to get over that. If you're a really outgoing and very hyper, maybe it's learning to read by yourself.

[00:12:36] Like something that does push you a little bit is such a good balance, even though you want to have a lot of self direction.

[00:12:43] **Andrea Fife:** Now one thing that my mom was always really careful about and, and that she would tell us about, she, she wanted us to have personalized opportunities, but she also wanted to prepare us for an adult world that wasn't necessarily going to provide that same experience for, [00:13:00] for us. And that was something she was always really cautious about.

[00:13:02] She's like, I want you to be able to pursue your interests, but I also do want you to understand that. There are systems in the world that are more or less non negotiable. Paying your taxes is a great example. Obviously you can choose not to, but most people wouldn't choose the consequences of that choice.

[00:13:18] So, so really, in effect, paying taxes is non negotiable. There are certain systems that are the system. Uh, and so, my mom wanted us to have personalized education opportunities. She wanted us to be interest driven. She wanted us to always, uh, Have access to the next challenge the next thing that we wanted to consume or do but she also didn't want to go so far To personalized and student directed that we didn't have the opportunity to recognize When a system is a system and how to learn to Thrive adapt change what we did have control over to make it Work, and I really appreciate that.

[00:13:59] [00:14:00] She was able to find that balance

[00:14:02] **Isaac:** that's a great lesson. I've had some of those conversations with my kids about, you know, the difference between. What you have the right to do and what might be a good idea to do, right? There are certain games, even social conventions. I remember my youngest, he just kind of very, very independent. No one's going to tell him what to do.

[00:14:19] And even when he was young and sort of the typical convention where a stranger says, Hey buddy, what, how are you? And he'd be like, he just wouldn't answer. And he'd be like, I don't know this person. I'm not obligated to answer. And I would say, that is true. You're not obligated to. But think about the various social games involved, the costs and the benefits of coming across as someone who's rude versus not there.

[00:14:42] There are consequences of these things. And like, if you think of it, not as binary, I'm forced to do this or I'm free to not do this. everything's kind of a game and you got to decide which games you're willing to play and which games you're willing to take the risk of not playing and just kind of approaching it a little bit more [00:15:00] fluidly than uh, You must do this and anything that you're not forced to do just don't do it all because it's all terrible You know, that's that's a good.

[00:15:08] Um, it's a good distinction for kids and for adults

[00:15:11] **Andrea Fife:** I have, I have the best story that, that relates to that. Um, but I'm also kind of curious, like, do your kids get annoyed when you point that out of like, you really do get to make all these choices. You just have to accept the consequences of those choices. Like, did they ever kind of roll their eyes at you and just be like, why won't you just tell me what to do?

[00:15:30] Why? Why do you turn this back on me?

[00:15:33] **Isaac:** Yes, for sure. My my oldest very philosophical. He'll He likes those kinds of conversations and he'll be like, he'll go back and forth and talk about it and find it to be like, interesting to discuss and to kind of like probe the boundaries of the difference between what you're free to do. Not my middle children are like, why are you telling me all this stuff?

[00:15:52] Just tell me what to do. You know what I mean? Like they don't want to deal with that. But

[00:15:59] **Andrea Fife:** a senior in [00:16:00] high school this year. Um, and I think it was two years ago, he was taking an AP History class that he was not loving. AP World History. And he came home from school, and he's complaining about his World History class. I mean, he was just like, really annoyed about this class.

[00:16:13] And I said, okay, don't go. And he was like, what? I have to go. If I don't go, I'll fail. And I said, and who cares? Well, if it's a required class for graduation, Mom. Says who? Well, says the school, like it's on the list of things I have to do to graduate. And I said, and who says you have to graduate? And he's like, well, I, I just kind of thought I was supposed to.

[00:16:36] And, and I said, I don't care if you graduate. Do you care if you graduate? What are your goals? Is graduating aligned with your goals? And he's just like stuttering, stammering. Like, why can't you just be normal and just be like, there is no choice, but go to world history and like it. And so, you know, we get through to the end of this and he's like, what?

[00:16:55] I just want to complain, Mom. I want to go to history. I want to do well [00:17:00] in this class. I just wanted to complain and I was like, okay, sounds great. I just wanted to make sure you knew that the struggles you were having in your world history class right now are a result of a choice you made. to take that class.

[00:17:14] And if at any point that class stops meeting your needs, you just let me know. I don't, I, I don't, I don't really care what the school's gonna say when I walk in and say Alex doesn't want to take history. Like, who cares? I, I don't. If it's required for graduation, that's fine. How do we talk about him still accessing the awesome courses you teach and not worrying about the checklist?

[00:17:36] I'm, I'm fine with that. If he's fine with that, you've got so many great courses. If this one doesn't meet his needs, let's move him into another one. And he was honestly very annoyed with me for that whole, that whole conversation. Like, just tell me to go to class, mom. Mm

[00:17:51] **Isaac:** though, for, especially as your kids get into their teens that. Even if the end result is they end up doing the same thing, they, [00:18:00] they know why they understand their own motivations because sometimes it's easy to kind of like, If it's easy to trick ourselves of the reason we're doing things is because we have to and then that makes it when we don't enjoy it, we get to kind of blame other people and we just sort of we're just sort of a passenger and these things are just happening to us.

[00:18:17] And I've had something similar with, um, you know, my kids as they've gotten older, as is very common with kids who are homeschooled, they get into their teens and they just really want to be around other kids their age a lot more. And so, you know, my, my son at one point was like, um, look, I want to go to school this year to the public school.

[00:18:36] I don't care at all about any of the classes or any of the stuff or about the grades. I just want to go so I can hang out with kids my age and like run on the track team and do all that kind of stuff. So, and I said, okay, well, what, what do you think will happen if you like do no homework and do no classes and do whatever else?

[00:18:55] He's like, I don't know. I'll probably constantly be bothered by teachers, administrators. They'll be bothering [00:19:00] you. And like, it'll, and I'm like, well, that does that sound like a good experience? He's like, no. And I'm like, okay, well you need to figure out. What's the minimum level you're willing to tolerate?

[00:19:08] Right. Like what's the minimum, like, cause he's like, I know that I'm not doing it for the learning, but I don't want to also be like suffering constantly because I'm doing nothing. So like, can I just go and like, do good enough that I basically get to be left alone to do the parts that I want to do? And him just recognizing that that's what he was doing made it so much easier.

[00:19:28] And he didn't, he didn't turn around and try to blame and get angry at other people, you know what I

[00:19:35] **Andrea Fife:** and I think, oh man, that's, that's, I love, love giving kids those, those choices and helping. Talk them through and listening to them talk through what's what's my priority. I love I love a good rubric. I love a good syllabus, you know, if you're traditional education I love a good syllabus because you get the opportunity to just look over it and decide You know what what to [00:20:00] what degree does this matter?

[00:20:01] Does does this matter to me? I talked to my son through that process with a a class he was taking that had a Notebook check. I'll tell you right now. I'm not big on notebook checks Uh note taking is not for everyone and I don't think it should be mandated I think if that helps you in your process great take notes, and if it doesn't Uh, so he he's not a note taker.

[00:20:21] He was very stressed by this notebook check there was a very prescriptive list of exactly what you would be graded on whether or not you put a number on the page and You know, he's just all irate and I I said, but your teacher gave you a rubric. Let's look at it. You know, we looked and here's what you have to do to earn 100 points and here's what you have to do to earn 80 points and here's what you have to do.

[00:20:41] And I said, which one do you want to earn? And he was like, I think 50 looks easy. I circled it and I was like, that's your goal. Don't you dare earn more than 50 points this notebook check this year. I want your energy to go into the other things that you no matter more absolutely do not exceed. [00:21:00] 50 points on this notebook check this year and he was like, okay,

[00:21:05] **Isaac:** That is amazing. Um, going back to something you said before, because it's just, I just had this sort of realization that this is not some realization that no one's ever had before, but about music and dancing and theater. It's so funny that how much I think back to my own child that I grew up homeschooled.

[00:21:24] I remember my mom used to get cassette tapes sometimes that we would listen to while we were driving around in the car and they would be about whatever history or geography. And everybody knows this. The songs that I heard on those cassette tapes, I remember that stuff way more than anything I learned in books or from lectures.

[00:21:41] And pretty much all of human history, every society, the most important ideas, stories, histories, values, Have been conveyed through singing, dancing, theater, like production, storytelling, and as a form of entertainment, that's how like the lessons, how the knowledge [00:22:00] gets passed on. And somehow this has sort of gotten separated and it's kind of like entertainment and fun over here.

[00:22:05] And then learning over here. And I just, I think there's probably a lot of ways to be more intentional about bringing those back together.

[00:22:12] **Andrea Fife:** Yeah, it makes no sense to separate them. I mean, even the fact that, and I'm going to get on a bit of a soapbox here, but the fact that we've turned singing into, like, something you can be good at or bad at is a bit mystifying to me. Uh, it's like a human skill. People can sing, just like people can talk.

[00:22:29] You can do it, everyone can do it. There are some people that, for whatever reason, people, you know, their voice appeals to them and they might want to listen to them more or whatever, but it's actually really not impressive. Pretty much everybody can sing. Nearly everyone can sing well. Being able to carry a tune is, is actually nothing to be proud of.

[00:22:47] Most people can do it. Um, so I think the fact that we've made it somehow, what is just very a human, a very human thing, that, that we've made it into something that we compete at is always a bit [00:23:00] mystifying to me anyway. Um, but I mean there's all

[00:23:04] **Isaac:** never thought of that, Andrea. That was a really great, that was a really great thought.

[00:23:08] **Andrea Fife:** There's all sorts of research that says exactly what you just said, you know, that if you can put it in song, people, people remember it. You know, like I said, I can still sing my linking verbs. I can, uh, I can still find the, several of the, the countries in Africa on the map in order because I learned that in song when I was, was younger.

[00:23:28] I mean, if you want to remember it. Sing it or move to it. I mean common, common memory, uh, memory strategy, learning strategy in, you know, in instruction is attached movement to it. I will often, if I need to memorize something, I, I learned the sign language alphabet once, and if I need to memorize something, if I just sign the first Letter of the word in in order while I'm memorizing it.

[00:23:54] I Remember it better just that physical motion of you know Doing doing that any little [00:24:00] physical motion that you're gonna attach to something There's a lot more fun if you do it artistically and and call it dance

[00:24:07] **Isaac:** We should, we should start, uh, we should start incorporating this into our business meetings, Andrea, when we're going to, you know. Review business goals. We should, you know, do it in song. Here we

[00:24:16] **Andrea Fife:** Yeah, I was going to say, if you see me like suddenly moving in the meetings, I'm trying to remember the acronyms and I'm just, you know, signing. This is, this is what that, what that stands for.

[00:24:27] **Isaac:** let me ask you about your, uh, your college experience. Um, and then, and then I want to chat a little bit about your kids. You've mentioned a couple of stories, but I know you have a couple more really interesting things, but talk to me about your college experience.

[00:24:40] **Andrea Fife:** Okay, uh, so this is where, where it gets fun and I get transparent about some, some struggles in my academic career. So, uh, school was always very easy for me up until the point that I, that I graduated from high school. Looking back, I, uh, attribute that to a lot of things. One was a very supportive environment.

[00:24:59] [00:25:00] Uh, one was, like I said, my mom was, was behind the scenes personalizing, uh, Every experience that I had, uh, even if it wasn't in the home, and it rarely was, uh, she was always there in the background. She had pulled some sort of strings to make certain I was getting exactly what I needed, and I didn't know that, uh, until I went off to college, um, on a full tuition scholarship.

[00:25:24] Uh, which I lost really fast. Um, because that, that environment changed. I, I, I chose a traditional university experience. It's what everybody does, right? That's the, that's the goal. You do high school and then you go off to college just like everybody else and you pick from maybe three to five schools that you've heard of and that everybody at your school is talking about.

[00:25:44] You know, that's where I'm going to go. That's And you just pick something because that's what you do after high school. So, so that's what I did after high school and I went off to this very traditional environment with, you know, these large class sizes and, you know, uh, your [00:26:00] traditional, here's your syllabus and turn your things in when you're supposed to and your teacher may not even know your name and uh, every assignment's just going to be what it is.

[00:26:09] The professor's probably been teaching this class the same way for 10, Years, they just print off the next version of the syllabus, and everybody does exactly what worked last semester. Uh, you know, so even just year to year and updates, and I don't want to disparage every professor. I'm certain there are great ones out there, but as a generalization, that's, that's often what that traditional university experience is.

[00:26:33] Um,

[00:26:34] **Isaac:** mine. I probably had maybe one out of eight or 10 professors that were, uh, different and were good, but that was the majority. That was definitely a majority.

[00:26:42] **Andrea Fife:** Right, and, and, it was just, it was awful for me. Uh, the other big, big, uh, issue was, um, I had no idea you could test out of classes. If I had known that you could test out of college classes, I may have had a very different experience. But I went, uh, in, I was actually a music [00:27:00] therapy major, uh, at the beginning of my attempt at university.

[00:27:04] Um, and I had 13 years of piano lessons. Uh, I was really quite an accomplished pianist. I had no idea you could test out of, uh, Test out of classes, so they put me into like the music theory 101 and keyboarding 101 and RL skills I was in a keyboarding like a beginning level keyboarding class to learn to play the piano after having had 13 years of piano lessons And so I just stopped going it didn't it wasn't meeting my needs.

[00:27:33] It wasn't serving me. It wasn't engaging I had no desire to be there and so I just You Didn't go, which is a really fantastic way to lose a full tuition scholarship Really fast, is to just say, I mean I could have, I could have aced that class so easily But I don't thrive in environments that aren't challenging And so, and nobody noticed, [00:28:00] like nobody said Oh my goodness, she seems to be just whizzing through this.

[00:28:05] Maybe we could increase the level of difficulty, or maybe we could talk to her about her options. Maybe we could explain to her, you don't belong in this class. Let's get you either tested out or into the most advanced, you know, music classes that, that we have. But nobody, nobody even noticed. And so, I just, You know, so I came back the next year.

[00:28:26] I changed majors. Against my mother's advice, I decided to try to be an English major. I said, well, I love two things. I love music and I love language and words, so I'll try to be an English major. And she said, you're going to hate those classes even more than you hated your music classes. You know, you're going to want to get in there and you're going to want to like, you know, discuss the things that matter to you.

[00:28:45] And they're going to want you to find the right words. the answer that they're expecting, um, from the way that this class is supposed to go and you're gonna hate it. But I didn't know what else to do, so I went back the second year as an English major, made it about, [00:29:00] I don't know, six or eight weeks, and called my parents and said, I'm coming home.

[00:29:03] I don't, this is, I, I don't know what I'm doing here, I don't know what my goals are, this doesn't seem to be aligned to anything real, so how about I just come home? Came home. Got a job, started working at a real estate company. Uh, while I was there, I discovered that I have a passion for graphic design. Um, and once I knew that, once I discovered this, I was like, I think I want to go back to school.

[00:29:28] I want to learn more about this. I truly want to study this. What programs are there out there that are going to teach me graphic design and marketing? Because i'm fascinated by this. I was able to find a different, uh, program that was non traditional that the course was the classes were only five weeks long.

[00:29:45] You take one class at a time. It was interest based. They had opportunities where I could you know, test out of classes, or or they, you know, showed me how to how to take the clep tests and how to do prior learning that they would evaluate and all those kinds of things. [00:30:00] So much more personalized, plus it was interest based, uh, you know, ended up from that program going from totally dropped out, lost my full tuition scholarship to, you know, graduating with a 4.

[00:30:14] 0, went on to get a master's in education from, from the same institution. Just a completely different experience.

[00:30:20] **Isaac:** That you are speaking my language there. I mean, cause I, I know I've talked about a few times on this show, but I, you know, I founded a college alternative company, um, you know, to get people into careers to apprentice. And one of the main things was not to just say, Oh, college is a waste, but to say, unless and until you know what you want out of it, just the assumption that it comes after high school.

[00:30:44] And then you just sort of like do it. And you don't know why the fact that you, you know, You went and you said, okay, now I'm going to go work. And in the context of the real world, you discovered, Hey, I'm interested in graphic design. I want to learn more. Now I have a reason to go [00:31:00] take these classes, to go get this training.

[00:31:02] There's a, there's a connection to an outcome that I want that makes all the difference in the world. And I feel like if, if there would be more focused on even during high school, but certainly after. Go, if, if something interests you, go shadow somebody, go intern, go apprentice, go get some experience in some different professions.

[00:31:20] And if you suddenly realize, I mean, I, if I had a dollar for every lawyer I knew who said, I, I hate my job and I wish I was, I wish I didn't go to law school, but now I have to be a lawyer because it's the only thing that will pay for my law school debt. If they would have spent a year at a law firm and saw what most lawyers do all day, a lot of those kids would have been like, nevermind, I don't want to do it.

[00:31:38] Right. But they did it just because they thought everybody told them you're smart. You're good at debate. You should go be a lawyer. Right. And like, just getting some of that context can really help focus. What you do with that post secondary education that

[00:31:52] **Andrea Fife:** Yeah, and it's so interesting as a parent now, you know, to be like, I wish that someone would have told me I don't have to go to [00:32:00] college straight out of high school. Now as a parent, you know, I turn around and I say that to my kids. Um, but I also need to be respectful of the fact that they might want to.

[00:32:09] You know, that might actually be a goal that they have. And that's one of the most challenging things for me as a parent, and especially working here and having learned all the things at OpenEd that, you know, that I've learned and the philosophies and getting to meet so many interesting parents doing so many things.

[00:32:25] Uh, but when I go back and I have those conversations with my kids and I listen to them and they say, But that is aligned with my goals. Then, then I also have to be willing to listen to that and say, Great, then for you, that's the absolute, absolute right choice. Um,

[00:32:42] **Isaac:** that

[00:32:42] **Andrea Fife:** even if I'm like, I wish I wouldn't have done it, they still might want to and it still might be the right choice for them.

[00:32:48] **Isaac:** and this is, this is one thing that I really love about what we're trying to convey through this podcast, our content, this idea of open education, it's not quite the same as [00:33:00] like any one sort of alternative education approach because what can happen? I had this myself, right? I found it an alternative to college and I was openly out there talking about how college is so often a waste of money and you're not learning anything and all these things.

[00:33:13] And then I would have people be like, yeah, we'll wait till your kids get old enough. What are you going to do? What are you going to do? And I, and I would say, look, I will encourage them to identify their goals and do what they want you to pursue them. And if, and if they want to go to college and that's what they want to do to get there, that's okay.

[00:33:30] I'm not going to be like, no guys, I've built my brand as being the anti college guys. So you're not allowed to go to college. Right. But there's, but there's a pride component, you know, same with being a homeschooler. When, when my son first said, I want to go to the public school this year. There's a pride part that's like, but what will my friends think of me?

[00:33:45] Cause I've always been the alternative education guy. Right. And like, and that's hard. You don't want to hold on too tightly or like unschooling or Montessori or whatever your unique approach is. If, if that doesn't work for one kid or for one year or for one time, you have to have some [00:34:00] humility in the reverse direction too.

[00:34:01] It takes a lot of courage to leave the system. But if you get too wedded to one particular alternative approach, it can also take a lot of humility to be willing to say, okay, um, yes, you can go to public school this year if you want to, even though everybody knows me as the guy who rails against the traditional school system.

[00:34:18] And I got it. And I got to take a reputational hit that my kid goes like, it's not about me. It's about the kids and what they need at that given time. And that's a lesson that's really good to be reminded of.

[00:34:28] **Andrea Fife:** and I love that the story that you shared, you know, was that your son identified why he wanted to be there. You know and and said like I get there's a there's a trade off Um, but I want to be there for social reasons and I think that that's an area I want to grow in and I think that's the environment that's going to let me grow in that area and you know being able to to pick and choose or to make those changes or to combine You know, the best, um, you know, for the people who are doing a couple of classes at a boundary school [00:35:00] or, you know, whatever that that picking and choosing is for me, that's, that's the beauty.

[00:35:06] And to. To break free of all of the constraints, to not feel like that just because you chose it this year means you have to choose it always. I, I've talked to my youngest all the time. I am trying so hard to talk him into a year of road schooling and he is not here for it. And it's driving me crazy.

[00:35:25] **Isaac:** You got the RV ready. You guys are going to go do it.

[00:35:27] **Andrea Fife:** bought the trailer this summer.

[00:35:29] You know, I am, I'm ready for it. Every year I, I tease him that like, You know, I'm just I threatened that I'm gonna pull him out of school and we're gonna road school and that shouldn't be a Threat but uh, he loves museums and he just loves to immerse himself in everything He's the coolest kid to travel with because he's truly so interested and he can just sun up to sundown Just learn learn learn go go go and i'm like, oh, I just want to put him in an rv and road school so badly But when I talk to him about it, he's like but mom I love my classes.

[00:35:58] I love what [00:36:00] i'm learning I really enjoy my Experience and then I'm like, okay, then this isn't this isn't the year But I'll probably ask you again next year and we'll see if maybe Maybe next year's the year and maybe it will never be the year because ultimately it's gonna be his choice Maybe it's actually me that wants to road school Maybe it's actually me that wants to go all those places and dive into the curriculum that I would need to dive into to teach Him maybe it's actually me feeling a little bit antsy to get out on the road and learn

[00:36:29] **Isaac:** I, I, I get that too. And I've had to balance my love for adventure and change with my kids need for consistency and stability sometimes. So, uh, totally, totally understand that you told me something the other day I thought was really interesting. Another great example with your own kids of, you know, thinking of education is something that you can customize and turn into something flexible, even within the constraints of a typical, uh, You know, like of a, of a public school in this case, your, one of your [00:37:00] sons is really interested in, I think, engineering and you've got, he kind of like created a elective class for himself.

[00:37:06] Can you share that story? I thought that was a really cool, a really cool story.

[00:37:10] **Andrea Fife:** Yeah, so we are really fortunate that they're, uh, we're part of a really forward thinking traditional public school district here. Um, and so my kids have access to a college and career center, uh, that the whole concept I just love. So here in the community, local businesses actually support the college and career center.

[00:37:31] And in exchange the college and career center bases some of their curriculum on the skills that the local businesses have said This is what our workforce needs and

[00:37:40] **Isaac:** What a concept. I love that. That's

[00:37:42] **Andrea Fife:** They have this whole pipeline, uh, where then those businesses offer internships and work based learning opportunities. And so, you know, the businesses say, here's the skills that the future workforce needs.

[00:37:53] The school says, great, we'll hire teachers that can teach those. We'll invest in, in the resources for them. And then when [00:38:00] these kids are juniors and seniors, we would love for them to get actually out into the workforce, try these things out. So they have this really great work based learning program. Um, and my, my son who's a senior this year, they actually reached out to him with a work based learning opportunity last year.

[00:38:16] He ended up declining it, um, because he didn't have room in his schedule and he, he really wanted to focus on some other things. But he had this goal to be able to do work based learning his senior year. Um, but The area that we live in, it's not super, um, the performing arts are not big here and we're a big performing arts family.

[00:38:36] So, uh, the opportunity he wanted doesn't exist and I just don't like to take that as that means that the answer, answer's no. So he, he did all the engineering classes offered at this local college and career center. He did the whole pathway. Um, he got OSHA certified as a freshman. Uh, at the College and Career Center, he carries that around in his wallet, badge of pride, that certification means so much more to him than any grade he's ever earned at the [00:39:00] school.

[00:39:00] Um, but you know, he finished the whole engineering pathway, um, but there was really no work based learning opportunity that, that really fit his needs. And Flip side of this, he's super into the performing arts. Um, so he's in the theater program. He, you know, competes at the, the state level in the, the chorus and drama things.

[00:39:23] Um, so we were at the, the school's final performance last year, and he always works really closely with their sound and engineering, uh, tech who comes from the outside to come help with this. And all of a sudden, I said. Wait a second. Do you think that they would let us create a work based learning class for you that was building the sets for the school plays?

[00:39:45] And Joseph could be your mentor, um, you know, and we could pitch it to the school as this is, uh, you know, set construction with an engineering project. perspective, you can learn how to [00:40:00] do all the rendering and everything in the software programs and then use your drawings to actually build the sets. And he was like, oh, that'd be, that'd be so cool.

[00:40:09] And I was like, we're going to find out. So we emailed the work based learning coordinator and he's like, I, I think, but like I don't, I don't quite know what you mean, who would be the mentor. So I emailed the theater teacher and I was like, this is what we're trying to do. Would you support this? And she's like, absolutely.

[00:40:23] I'll get the contact information. So got the work based learning coordinator to talk to the theater teacher, uh, got it all worked out. And so, uh, for third period this year on his actual traditional schedule, he's earning high school credit for it. All, you know, checks all the traditional. boxes, he is building all the sets for his school's production designing and building those and You know using those engineering skills that he learned over at the college and career center to give back Uh, so his drama program doesn't have to you know, necessarily pay for set construction or whatever.

[00:40:59] He's [00:41:00] got the skills He's gonna do that. I just I love everything about it. The, the full cycle, the everything he's learning, the fact that he gets to give back, the fact that it meets these traditional boxes and actually even qualifies for high school credit. It's, for me, it's just the best of all worlds and to get to see him Just thriving in something that he loves and that when I send him off for the hours that I choose to partner with our local public school for his his education Uh, you know that I know that he's doing something that he truly sees actual value in

[00:41:36] **Isaac:** and, and that all gets unlocked from that moment when he said, I really want this, I'm interested in this, but it doesn't exist. And when you said. That's not good enough. We got to find a way right that those are those moments like there has to be a way to make this happen That's amazing. I I know you know my own My mom and some of the other homeschoolers around where I grew up it would Similarly would just go and figure out [00:42:00] ways to make things happen go to the local business go to the ski resort and say can We have a homeschool ski day.

[00:42:04] What do we need to do to make it happen? Can we negotiate this thing? And I think that's that's what I find so fun about The open ed program, which we have our district partnership program in Utah and in Oregon, hopefully coming to more states soon. The things that you see as head of learning and open ed with these thousands of families you've interacted with, the amount of variety and creativity in what kind of customized learning they do for their kids is just amazing.

[00:42:33] So I would love for you to kind of bring us home here with what is kind of the main, I don't know, maybe. What, what is your, what do you love most about what you see with the parents in open ed? And then what are your goals? Like, what do you see as success? When to you, do you say this program is doing what I want it to do for people?

[00:42:52] I don't know if that's too broad of a question, but I'd love to hear your take on that.

[00:42:56] **Andrea Fife:** That's great. Uh first half of the question. I'm trying to remember [00:43:00] exactly what the first

[00:43:01] **Isaac:** What kind of like, what, what are the, what are like some of the big trends and themes that you

[00:43:04] **Andrea Fife:** Okay, okay.

[00:43:05] **Isaac:** are doing this?

[00:43:06] **Andrea Fife:** Yeah, so honestly if I could give, if I could give any piece of my experience to all of the parents, all parents, um, it would be to be able to see what I get to see.

[00:43:19] So because I get access to all of these Uh, you know, thousands and thousands of families. And I've just read so many. Uh, our district model students send in a weekly learning log that just kind of describes what they did, what they learned that week, and the variety in those. It has changed, changed my entire perspective of education.

[00:43:41] My, my first six months here, um, as a homeroom teacher, it just changed, changed how I parent, it changed, All my philosophies of education because I used to be very rigid. I thought there was a best way Um, and that I was doing it Uh, absolutely would have told everyone there is a way and it's the way that i'm doing [00:44:00] it Uh that that was a very humbling first six months to realize.

[00:44:03] Oh my goodness There are so many ways and these kids are thriving in so many different ways And then when I started going I want to try that I want to try that. I want to try that and started implementing the things that other families are doing Uh, and and saw them them working with my kids That if I could give that to others just the ability to have read thousands of different approaches and finding the value in Every single one of them, you know, there's many that I probably wouldn't commit to for the full year But that I would absolutely do for a week Um, you know, I think I would be in and out of methodologies if I if you know If I was if my kids were less resistant to a more open education approach Uh, you know, there's a lot of different things I I would do and try and i've learned that from the family So if there was if I could create [00:45:00] a way For everyone to get to hear All of that to get to assimilate all of that to get to feel inspired By all of that and I will just tell you Isaac That's probably the thing that i'm most excited about about open ed About this podcast about the open ed daily is I I think that that's the mission.

[00:45:19] I think that's the goal I I think that that's the idea is not to say there is a way but to say there are so many ways

[00:45:27] **Isaac:** we should, we should put together, uh, I know the marketing team is listening to this, so this is a little idea. Every once in a while we should do like, you know, 10 most interesting courses we saw from open ed families this year or something like that. Like, cause I know you've, you've seen some amazing, you have some amazing,

[00:45:44] **Andrea Fife:** they're doing they are doing so many amazing things that I just I just So one year I helped a family who, uh, they were planning to go sailing for nine months and were going to be basically off the grid. They wanted to make certain that they [00:46:00] would be able to meet the program requirements to be part of the district model and they knew it was going to take some innovation and it took some doing, but I met with them.

[00:46:07] We mapped out exactly like they sent me the schedule of when they would be in port, when they would have internet, when they wouldn't. I was like, if you do this, if you do this, if we put a note in your file, getting to help that family. Uh, you know, know that they would have all the curriculum they needed to, like, reach all their educational goals.

[00:46:25] And that they also got to check off this huge bucket list as a, as a family and just sail for nine months. Uh, knowing that I played a small part in that is

[00:46:36] **Isaac:** your sale to your son, Andrea. Cause you know how like they tell kids to go and say, you know, Hey dad, can I have a, you know, 1, 000? And then of course we'll say no. And they say, okay, well, just kidding. But I, I put a dent in the car, right? You ask for the crazy thing first.

[00:46:51] So you got to say that to your son. You got to say, we're going to go sailing. We're going to do sailing schooling next year. And then when he, when he freaks out, you can say, no, just kidding. We're just going to go in the trailer and [00:47:00] do it on the road. Then maybe it'll be easier, you know, for

[00:47:02] **Andrea Fife:** Yeah, because if you go sailing, I say you have no internet. In the RV, at least we have access to the internet. Maybe I can get a teenager to do that.

[00:47:09] **Isaac:** is, that is an amazing story. What, how, how do you, so. Bringing it to this final question and, and, you know, maybe you don't have a super soundbite answer, but what are your goals? Like when you look at the program and your goals of running the, the, the learning team over here, what do you see as success?

[00:47:26] What do you want to see for these families?

[00:47:28] **Andrea Fife:** Uh, I want to see there not be a no. I, I want for any, any family, any student who can identify their goal for us to have a way to get them there. Uh, that's, that's, uh, It's always my goal. Uh, I think it has several different components. One is also being able to help kids be able to express their goals. Uh, if, if we don't understand what goal we're working toward, it's really difficult to map out a path.

[00:47:55] Toward that and and part of that is understanding that they can have goals [00:48:00] that they've never heard of before there's sort of a Deconstructing the the traditional narrative that that has to happen before someone can truly tell me their goal because if they think there's only one Of three options. I said, what are your goals after high school?

[00:48:13] And they and they think the only option is college They're gonna tell me college. They might not mean it. They just they don't know there are other options So so I guess step one would be make sure that they know there are other options so that we can have a safe It's a solid conversation about what are your goals.

[00:48:29] And then I would just want to know that no matter what someone says, I already have a list of like, awesome, here's where to start. We have it. We have, you know, we can help you access that, that, that's my goal.

[00:48:43] **Isaac:** I love it. I love it. Not taking no getting, finding a way to get to yes. Andrea, thank you so much for joining us. Thanks everybody for joining this episode of the open ed podcast.

## Polished Transcript

### [00:00:00] Introduction

**Isaac Morehouse:** Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. I'm Isaac Morehouse, and today I'm joined by Andrea Fife, who is the head of learning at OpenEd. I've only been working with Andrea for a couple of months, but I can honestly say that in my 20 years in and around education, I don't think I've ever met someone with such genuine intensity and passion for helping families get the best possible education they can. Andrea, I wanted to start by asking: Where does that intense passion come from? Why do you care so much about helping people maximize their education?

### [00:01:18] Andrea's Background in Education

**Andrea Fife:** That passion comes partly from my time in the classroom. I was a 5th grade teacher for 10 years, and during that time, my approach changed from meeting general needs to trying to find every student who needed something extra and maximize their experience. That's actually why I ended up leaving the classroom—it was unsustainable to try to meet each student's individual needs every day. The environment wasn't conducive to that level of personalization, and I was so burned out that I considered leaving education entirely.

Fortunately, I found this program that's built on the idea of being able to maximize everything for every learner. The passion has always been there, but it definitely became more noticeable during my time in the classroom.

### [00:02:55] Andrea's Educational Experience

**Isaac:** Let's rewind a bit to your own upbringing and educational experience. What was that like?

**Andrea:** Prior to my experiences at OpenEd, I would have said my experiences were fairly traditional. I spent most of my educational time in what you'd picture as a traditional classroom. But looking back, I realize that while my parents chose a fairly traditional setting, they made choices at every phase to personalize my education.

From enrolling me in a private school when I was young, to taking a teacher's advice to have me skip a grade for a more challenging academic experience, to allowing me to choose between a more rigorous or social setting in middle school—there were constant adjustments. There was even a year when I went back to a private school and participated in a grade level that didn't even exist. My mom called the school and said, "This isn't working for Andrea. Can we bring her back? I know you don't have an eighth grade, but can we put her there anyway? She'll learn math on her own."

### [00:05:13] The Importance of Parental Initiative

**Isaac:** That gives me such insight into where you got some of this from—your mom was willing to say, "I don't care that it doesn't exist. I know what my daughter needs. Let's make this work." She recognized that you can ask for things that don't already exist. You can customize.

**Andrea:** Absolutely. A huge part of that was her willingness to put in the work personally. She never demanded something from the system that didn't exist. Instead, she'd say, "This doesn't exist, but I think it could. If I'm willing to put in the time, can we create the space?"

For example, with that 8th grade experience, she said, "No extra work for the teacher. I'm not asking them to teach seventh and eighth grade math. We can handle the math at home. I'll review the homework. Can she just independent study math during that particular block?" She always had this knack for seeing what already existed and figuring out how to supplement it to get the most out of both options.

### [00:06:32] The Role of Music in Education

**Isaac:** You mentioned that your whole family is very into musical theater. Can you talk about the relationship between that and your own education, as well as your children's education?

**Andrea:** Music and education are one and the same for me. I always say I can't teach without singing, and I can't sing without teaching. Even when I'm working with adults and we're learning a song, I'm breaking it down into grammar lessons. If I'm teaching grammar, I'm teaching it through song. I got that from my mom—she's the best educator I've ever known.

Learning to play the piano was a requirement in our household. When I was older, my mom explained that she knew I needed the challenge because some other things came really easily to me. She wanted me to learn that there were things I had to work hard for, and piano was that thing.

Later, when I wanted to do both singing and dancing but that didn't exist as a class, my mom went to the dance studio and proposed teaching a class that combined both. She offered to teach for free if they'd let their other dance students enroll and provide the studio space. Music has always been learning, and learning has always been music in our house.

### [00:11:04] The Importance of Challenges in Education

**Isaac:** I love what you said about piano. It's a good reminder that while it's important to let kids chase their interests and excel at what they're good at, it's also important to have some challenges. Your mom recognized that everything else was coming easy to you, and you needed to learn to struggle through some things.

As a homeschooling parent myself, we've done something similar with piano lessons. If everything in life is just stuff your parents are forcing you to do, you don't learn much about being self-directed. But if there's nothing that's hard, something's missing. There should be some things that are a challenge and that you have to force yourself to get over.

**Andrea:** One thing my mom was always careful about was preparing us for an adult world that wasn't necessarily going to provide the same personalized experience. She wanted us to pursue our interests, but she also wanted us to understand that there are systems in the world that are more or less non-negotiable.

She wanted us to have personalized education opportunities and be interest-driven, but she didn't want to go so far that we didn't recognize when a system is a system and how to learn to thrive, adapt, and change what we did have control over to make it work. I really appreciate that she was able to find that balance.

### [00:14:02] Teaching Kids to Make Choices

**Isaac:** That's a great lesson. I've had similar conversations with my kids about the difference between what you have the right to do and what might be a good idea to do. Everything's kind of a game, and you've got to decide which games you're willing to play and which ones you're willing to take the risk of not playing.

**Andrea:** I have a great story that relates to that. My son, who's a senior in high school this year, was complaining about his AP World History class. I said, "Okay, don't go." He was shocked and said he had to go or he'd fail. I asked him who cares if he fails, and who says he has to graduate.

We got through to the end of this conversation, and he said, "I just wanted to complain, Mom. I want to go to history. I want to do well in this class." I told him that was great, but I wanted to make sure he knew that the struggles he was having were a result of a choice he made to take that class. If at any point the class stops meeting his needs, he just needs to let me know.

### [00:16:00] Andrea's College Experience

**Isaac:** Let's talk about your college experience. What was that like?

**Andrea:** School was always very easy for me up until I graduated from high school. Looking back, I attribute that to a very supportive environment and my mom personalizing every experience I had, even if it wasn't at home. I didn't realize this until I went off to college on a full tuition scholarship, which I lost really fast.

I chose a traditional university experience because that's what everybody does, right? But it was awful for me. I had no idea you could test out of classes. I was a music therapy major at first, and despite 13 years of piano lessons, they put me in beginner-level music theory and keyboarding classes. I just stopped going because it wasn't meeting my needs or engaging me.

I came back the next year and changed majors to English, against my mother's advice. I made it about six or eight weeks before calling my parents and saying, "I'm coming home. I don't know what I'm doing here."

After coming home, I got a job at a real estate company where I discovered a passion for graphic design. That's when I decided I wanted to go back to school to learn more about it. I found a different, non-traditional program where classes were only five weeks long, you take one class at a time, and it was interest-based. They had opportunities to test out of classes or take CLEP tests. It was much more personalized. I went from being a dropout to graduating with a 4.0 and going on to get a master's in education from the same institution. It was a completely different experience.

### [00:30:20] The Importance of Real-World Experience

**Isaac:** You're speaking my language there. Unless and until you know what you want out of it, just assuming college comes after high school doesn't make sense. The fact that you went to work, discovered your interest in graphic design, and then had a reason to go take those classes made all the difference.

There should be more focus on getting experience in different professions during or after high school. If I had a dollar for every lawyer I know who hates their job and wishes they hadn't gone to law school, I'd be rich. If they had spent a year at a law firm and saw what most lawyers do all day, many of them would have changed their minds.

**Andrea:** It's interesting as a parent now. I wish someone had told me I didn't have to go to college straight out of high school. Now I say that to my kids, but I also need to be respectful of the fact that they might want to. That's one of the most challenging things for me as a parent, especially working at OpenEd and learning about so many different approaches. When my kids tell me that going to college is aligned with their goals, I have to be willing to listen and say, "Great, then for you, that's absolutely the right choice."

### [00:32:48] The Flexibility of Open Education

**Isaac:** This is what I love about what we're trying to convey through this podcast and our content—this idea of open education. It's not quite the same as any one alternative education approach. When my son first said he wanted to go to public school, there was a pride component that made it hard for me as someone known for alternative education. But you have to have some humility and recognize that it's not about you, it's about what the kids need at that given time.

**Andrea:** I love that your son identified why he wanted to be there—for social reasons and personal growth. Being able to pick and choose, make changes, or combine approaches—that's the beauty of it. To break free of all the constraints and not feel like just because you chose something this year means you have to choose it always.

I've been trying to talk my youngest into a year of road schooling, and he's not interested. I bought the trailer this summer, and I'm ready for it. But when I talk to him about it, he says he loves his classes and enjoys his experience. So I have to respect that, even though I'm the one who wants to go on the road and learn.

### [00:36:29] Customizing Education Within Traditional Systems

**Isaac:** You told me something the other day about one of your sons creating an elective class for himself within the public school system. Can you share that story?

**Andrea:** We're fortunate to be part of a forward-thinking public school district. They have a college and career center supported by local businesses, which base some of their curriculum on the skills these businesses say the workforce needs. My son who's a senior this year did all the engineering classes offered at this center and got OSHA certified as a freshman.

He's also really into performing arts, but there wasn't a work-based learning opportunity that fit both his interests. So we proposed creating a work-based learning class for him that involved building sets for the school plays, combining his engineering skills with his love for theater.

We worked with the work-based learning coordinator and the theater teacher to set it up. Now, for third period this year, he's earning high school credit for designing and building all the sets for his school's productions, using the engineering skills he learned at the college and career center. It's the best of all worlds—he's thriving in something he loves, giving back to his school, and it meets all the traditional requirements for high school credit.

### [00:41:36] The Power of Finding Solutions

**Isaac:** That's amazing. It all gets unlocked from that moment when he said he was interested in something that didn't exist, and you said, "That's not good enough. We've got to find a way." That's what I find so fun about the OpenEd program—the amount of variety and creativity in what kind of customized learning these families do for their kids is just amazing.

### [00:42:52] Andrea's Vision for OpenEd

**Isaac:** What do you love most about what you see with the parents in OpenEd? And what are your goals? When do you say this program is doing what you want it to do for people?

**Andrea:** If I could give any piece of my experience to all parents, it would be to see what I get to see. Because I have access to thousands of families and their weekly learning logs, the variety I've seen has changed my entire perspective on education. It's changed how I parent and all my philosophies of education.

I used to be very rigid, thinking there was one best way. But that first six months here was very humbling. I realized there are so many ways, and kids are thriving in so many different approaches. If I could give that perspective to others—the ability to see thousands of different approaches and find value in every single one of them—that would be amazing.

As for my goals, I want there not to be a "no." For any family or student who can identify their goal, I want us to have a way to get them there. Part of that is also helping kids express their goals, which often involves deconstructing the traditional narrative of what's possible.

My ultimate goal is that no matter what someone says their goal is, I already have a list of ways to help them access it. That's what success looks like to me—not taking no for an answer and finding a way to get to yes for every learner.

**Isaac:** I love it. Andrea, thank you so much for joining us. Thanks everybody for joining this episode of the OpenEd podcast.
