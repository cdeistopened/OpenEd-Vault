- **The Biggest Mistake Homeschool Parents Make**
    
    The biggest mistake homeschool parents make? Trying to replicate public school at home.
    
    Brettani Shannon learned this the hard way. Like many parents, she thought success meant structured schedules, rigid lesson plans, and recreating the traditional classroom experience. But she quickly discovered something powerful—homeschooling thrives when it’s built around relationships, not just curriculum.
    
    Instead of forcing a one-size-fits-all system, she leaned into her child’s strengths, interests, and natural curiosity. The result? A learning environment filled with joy, confidence, and discovery.
    
    💡 “It’s a thousand times more valuable than just checking off the standard boxes.”
    
    This is what education _should_ be—personalized, meaningful, and empowering. Whether through OpenEd’s resources or community-driven learning, parents have the tools to create something better.
    
    Are you ready to break free from the old model and redefine learning for your child?

- **The Most Fun Day Every Day**
    
    _“Mom, it doesn’t even feel like school… it’s just the most fun day, every day!”_
    
    That’s what Brettani Shannon’s daughter said when asked if she was happy with homeschooling.
    
    For many families, the idea of learning without rigid schedules and standardized tests feels impossible. But what if education could be something kids _love_? What if it could be an adventure, where curiosity leads the way?
    
    Instead of dreading the school day, Brettani’s daughter wakes up excited to learn. Instead of feeling boxed in by a curriculum, she explores, discovers, and grows in ways that fit her unique strengths.
    
    💡 "Ooh, summer’s going to be a disappointment—because school is _so much fun_."
    
    This is what education can look like when we break free from the old model. A bond between parent and child, learning that sparks joy, and a lifelong love for knowledge.
    
    Are we ready to reimagine education? The answer is right in front of us.

- **The Priceless Joy of Education**
    
    🔥 _"Being able to meet your kids where they’re at is priceless."_
    
    Imagine if education wasn’t about forcing kids into a rigid system but instead about fueling their natural curiosity. Brettani Shannon has seen the difference firsthand—when learning is personalized, kids thrive.
    
    💡 Instead of dragging through lessons, they _light up_ with excitement.
    
    💡 Instead of dreading school, they _wake up eager_ to learn.
    
    💡 Instead of struggling to fit into a one-size-fits-all system, they _flourish_ in a way that suits them best.
    
    _"That’s just a really different experience than I had growing up… and I’m so thankful my kids get to have that."_
    
    Education shouldn’t be about jumping through hoops—it should be about unlocking potential. And when kids are on fire for learning, everything changes.

- **The Key to Homeschooling Success**
    
    🎓 _“Listen to the voices of people who’ve been there, done that, and raised successful kids.”_
    
    Homeschooling can feel overwhelming, especially when you’re trying to figure out what _works_. But here’s the truth: there’s no single right way to do it.
    
    Some families follow structured curriculums. Others embrace unschooling. Some mix and match. The key? Learning from those who’ve walked this path before.
    
    💡 _Happy homeschoolers. Happily graduated homeschoolers._ Their experiences prove that success doesn’t come from a one-size-fits-all approach.
    
    It’s easy to believe education _has_ to look a certain way, but when we listen to those who’ve created thriving, joyful learning environments, we realize there are countless ways to succeed.
    
    Homeschooling isn’t about copying someone else’s journey—it’s about finding what works for _your_ family. And the best way to do that? Learning from those who’ve done it well.
    
    \#OpenEd \#HomeschoolingSuccess \#EducationReimagined \#LearnFromExperience \#ParentingWisely
    
- **Becoming a 'Yes Mommy' Thanks to Open Ed!**
    
    _“Just becoming a ‘yes’ mommy with homeschooling has been a delight.”_
    
    For many parents, the biggest challenge in homeschooling isn’t just time—it’s finances. But thanks to OpenEd’s reimbursements, Brettani Shannon found herself saying _yes_ to enriching classes, incredible resources, and learning experiences she previously had to pass up.
    
    📚 **Yes** to the perfect book for her child’s interests.
    
    🎨 **Yes** to creative, hands-on learning opportunities.
    
    🎓 **Yes** to a personalized education without financial stress.
    
    Beyond homeschooling, Brettani also reflects on her 14-year-old’s experience in a _small_, 100-student school. While she wouldn’t have personally chosen every aspect of the curriculum, she realized something profound:
    
    💡 _Culture matters more than curriculum._
    
    The kindness, the close-knit community, the sense of belonging—that’s what shaped her daughter’s education in ways a textbook never could.
    
    Because in the end, education isn’t just about what kids learn—it’s about how they _feel_ while learning. And when they feel safe, supported, and excited, _that_ is when real growth happens.

### Polished Transcript

Brettani Shannon: [00:00:00] when you find that place, that school setting that matches your kids, that they just fit and they feel safe and you start to see them blossom and feel proud of themselves. It's amazing. It's so worth it.

​

Ela Richmond: Question number one. What resource, curriculum, online educational resource would you highly recommend?

Brettani Shannon: Well, my recommendation for parents would be to spend a little time with the creator of Blue Manor Academy. He's a prep school kid turned home school teacher. Curriculum entrepreneur and has made an online faith based prep school for super low cost for families. But beyond that curriculum as a resource, it's his master talks for parents that help you just sort of on the school, your own brain to think outside of the traditional public [00:01:00] school system and think, uh, he talks about how those like.

Top 10 percent of thinkers in the world and what their education was like and how it's so different from the traditional public school. And that was really, really valuable and kind of a quick start for unlearning public school systems in your own mind so that you don't try to read, like duplicate public school at home.

Cause that's probably a very ineffective and frustrating thing to do.

Ela Richmond: Mm

Brettani Shannon: Curriculum and educational resources. I would say that, uh, above anything else, open ed really has been the most beneficial because of the incredible parent support and access that parents have to live sessions every day that can get, they can get their questions answered.

Um, I think open ed downplays the. Incredible free resources that they have, including a huge variety of classes and [00:02:00] clubs that are live and that my student really, really enjoys. They have them every day of the week for different age groups. Each month carries a different offering. They're always really, really well done, perfectly paced.

They have two staff. So there's one that's managing the chat and one that's teaching the class, just super calm. And easy and fruitful in addition to free tutoring hours and software and online programming. So as a one stop shop for really like super generous and incredibly free resources, plus support open ed all the way.

Ela Richmond: I love hearing that.

Brettani Shannon: Yeah, no, it's, it's so easy to promote. Um, I would say that the last thing I would say is parents are often not sure of what their rights or responsibilities are. And ed choice is a really good first stop for that. Really understanding what your state expects and then [00:03:00] joining Facebook groups in your area that you can talk to other parents about their experiences, I would say would be a great starting point.

Curriculum in general can be really overwhelming. Um, but I got a lot out of, uh, Kathy Duffy reviews. She does a really thorough in depth dig into curriculum. That's her profession. And she's written books on it and she talks about the pros and cons, uh, for faith based parents. It's also really helpful because she always touches on that, like what you can expect.

Um, but of course she reviews secular and faith based, but super valuable starting point.

Ela Richmond: That's incredible. And, um, I really appreciate you mentioning just the resources that we have. That's something that I definitely want to see us promoting a little bit more. Like the fact that people can get, you know, free access to things like Adobe and, or free access to things like the Microsoft 365, which usually costs a lot of money.

Um, just like all of the little things that come along with open ed [00:04:00] and that parents don't even know all the time that we offer. I think that's something that we're working on showcasing just to, What exists not just in homeroom resources, but also the by request section and then making sure that parents know.

Hey, we're here to support you We have you know parent support sessions happening literally almost every single day every single week. We have student support happening all the time. We are here to support you and Just making sure that everybody knows what exists because I think in the past Um, we've been definitely Working on ramping up the amount that we're promoting these things because There are so many people that want to help your kids out.

Educators, past educators, existing educators, things like that.

Brettani Shannon: And how well they're actually done. I just want to reiterate that because we've tried a lot of different things, a lot of different curriculums and, you know, recorded classes and all that. And I can honestly say nothing has compared. It's like, it's, it, my interactions with open ed from a parent point of view have [00:05:00] exceeded all of our, Expectations where I would say that's usually the opposite, you know, usually the advertising or the promotion is, you know, great and you're excited.

And then it's like so hard to navigate or figure out or the class was too fast or it was confusing or something went wrong. And that just doesn't happen. It's like, Everything with open ed and those classes and home and supports are just calm and easy and just you feel Really?

blessed to have had them.

Ela Richmond: Wow, that makes me so happy to hear. Um, my second question is, what is something that has brought you so much joy to see in your kid's educational journey? Some story or just like example of open education being such a blessing and gift in your life.

Brettani Shannon: Oh, okay. Well, I would say it's, uh, changed my eight year old into a morning person, which sounds crazy, but just having the freedom to meet my child where they're at. And then there's her [00:06:00] strengths and her weaknesses, you know, waking up. Early in the morning and getting ready and getting out the door and having these things.

It was a very negative part of our family experience. I think I might have mentioned this already.

Ela Richmond: Yeah.

Yeah.

Brettani Shannon: but you know, that kind of freedom and it's just, it's bonded us together. So now, um, I don't know if I, said this or not, but you know, I kept asking my daughter the first week and the second week and the third week, you know, are you, are you glad you made the decision to homeschool?

And my favorite answer of hers was, well, it doesn't really feel like school. It's just kind of like the most fun day every day. And like, Ooh, summer's going to be a disappointment because it is great. We're having so much fun and to give her the freedom to learn in a way that gets her excited and wanting to do more. [00:07:00] Has are just seeing my daughter for how special she is and her unique strengths and Watching her learn is so I just feel like it bonds us together in a special way that I'm so thankful for and I would also Shout out to Open Ed again for the purpose of just the financial reimbursement, because I've homeschooled in the past, and it wasn't as easy, you know, because you're really struggling financially, you know, you're trying to piece things together without spending any money because homeschool usually means one income in a family and, you know, It's hard to manage.

And so to have that, um, reprieve, just that, like, no, I can say yes. I can say yes to this great class. Yes. I can buy this great book. Yes. We can go do this fun thing. Just becoming a yes mommy with homeschooling because open ed reimburses has been a delight. And it really has been. It's been a [00:08:00] different experience than I've done in the past as well.

Um, would say outside of homeschooling as well, though, you know, the school that I have a 14 year old and the school that she's been in most of her life, uh, was a small school, about a hundred kids. And you know, I don't think that I. I, I wouldn't have chosen maybe some of the curriculum that they used.

Um, I prefer a more innovative approach to learning, but none of that was in comparison to the value that we got out of the culture and my kids, you know, she grew up in this school where she was cherished. She was, um, kids in this school are kind to each other. They are, it's very, very family. And I worked there last year and I remember kids would come from public school and they, it was like, you could see the, the anxiety that they carried into [00:09:00] it and their lack of social skills and they're unsure of themselves and not yet, just not believing in themselves, not wanting to learn, having had It's multiple bad experiences and then taking about two months until they find they can just take a breath and go, Oh, like this is home.

And when you find that place, that school setting that matches your kids, that they just fit and they feel safe and you start to see them blossom and feel proud of themselves. It's amazing. It's so worth it. I mean, they're really, my kids are in two very different school environments right now, and I'm really thankful for that.

It fits them perfectly. And I'm really, really thankful. I'm doing very eclectic, you know, wild homeschooling at home and couldn't be happier. And my 14 year old is, it is a classical education, ninth grade. Um, you know, she wears a uniform and. Learns Latin and it's very different than me, [00:10:00] but she loves it and she's thriving there.

And so I think being able to meet your kids where they're at is priceless. And when they're on fire for learning and are excited about it every day, that's just a really different experience than I had growing up. And I'm so thankful that my kids get to have that.

Ela Richmond: As a parent. So this is my, my last and final rapid fire. as a parent who has two children, one in like true open education in the sense that it's, it is open ed and then, um, another kid in a private school. How do you create the open education for your child that is in a private school? How do you customize their education to their experience or to their interests and their needs?

Um, what has that been like for you as a parent?

Brettani Shannon: Yeah, well, I'm lucky enough to be in a community and be, have, have. put myself, have interjected [00:11:00] myself into my kids learning experience wherever they're at, so I always make sure I have a place at that school and in that community and that I know teachers and leaders and that I'm participating in their learning experiences, whether I'm the teacher or The parent, so for my child, that's at school and I'm talking to the administrators, I'm sharing, you know, I've, I've shared grant opportunities that they've gotten.

I share, you know, different educational resources that I have. I volunteer. I participate active participants in the school and I serve them and. I think that really helps the dynamic and knowing that we're, we are all caring for this child together and that, you know, the school is very thankful for our, my contribution too.

So there's that. In addition to that, my daughter is in dance, which is a huge component in our lives. And I, [00:12:00] uh, my other daughter is to dance, dance, gymnastics, other extracurriculars, horse, uh, horseback And I think that Education doesn't stop at the, you know, core subjects done in school. Education is all the time.

You know, we're teaching our kids all of their waking hours, seven days a week, and the environments that we have them in home and extracurricular activities are continuing to teach them about the possibilities in life and who they can be in character development and all of that jazz. So, um, we have our kids in a dance studio that has.

Served our community for a really long time, and they are competitive dance studio, and they raise up student leaders. So when students become juniors and seniors in high school, they can teach, take teaching positions there. And so it's a really. very, very fruitful experience for all of our kids and also helps to create that core [00:13:00] social structure.

So whether we're doing school at a site or we're doing homeschool, it really helps to cultivate like a, a backbone of community and support and character development.

Ela Richmond: I love that. Yeah,

Brettani Shannon: With my younger one, we're involved in a lot of different community aspects. So, um, I think I mentioned this before, but we go to a homeschool PE group that, you know, has over 400 kids in our small community that meet there and we go on field trips and Have get togethers and we're part of a homeschool co op and we take group classes in the community.

And so we rub shoulders with a lot of different, um, other homeschool families and they create relationships and that way, both parents and kids. So we don't feel like we're alone in the boat and we share, you know, Hey, I'm planning a field trip here and there. So great

Ela Richmond: Wow. Yeah, that's, that's so cool. Um, well, this has been an incredible conversation, and I mean, [00:14:00] I know that because you're a parent ambassador, you're going to be involved in lots of things. All of the organ families can expect to see you at lots of events, and also, especially in the Facebook. Um, to, to wrap up, is there any final piece of advice that you'd give to either a new Open Ed, Open Education parent, um, or somebody that, you know, you can resonate with, that you were in their shoes a while ago?

Mm.

Brettani Shannon: biggest mistake that I made, and I think most people would make, Home school parents can make do make is to try to duplicate the public school program at home. And to, I would say that focusing on relationship first and getting to know your child and honoring their unique passions, interests, strengths, weaknesses, and desires to give them some freedom of choice and buy in into the experience is super, super valuable.

And it's. a thousand times more valuable than going through a curriculum and checking [00:15:00] off the standard boxes. Um,

Ela Richmond: Mm hmm. Yeah.

Brettani Shannon: that freedom for what it is and continuing to be inspired because it's easy, especially if you purchase a curriculum that has a set plan, um, it's easy to fall back into that.

So just keeping your mind refreshed, keeping yourself inspired. And, um, when you feel like you're bogged down by that schedule or expectations to make the effort to refresh yourself, your families, friends, and resources. And so, yeah, I mean, you can always, um, just stay in Facebook groups. Um, we have one options for education that, um, or homeschooling groups and just listen to those voices of people who've been there and done that and have kids that are successful and in, by every measure.

You know, it's easy to think it has to be done one way or another, but, um, taking inspiration from people who are happy homeschoolers and happily [00:16:00] graduated homeschoolers is really valuable.

Ela Richmond: Yeah, I love that so much. Thanks so much, Brittany, for all of your insight and wisdom. I really appreciate it. And also, if anybody wants to, definitely go check out her site. I'll leave it in the description below. Thank you. There's a lot of really great things there as well.

Brettani Shannon: Bye.
