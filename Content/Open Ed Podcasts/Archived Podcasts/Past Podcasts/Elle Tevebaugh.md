# Homeschooling Reality Check: Day One Disaster

Elle Tevebaugh: my first official day as a homeschool teacher, uh, we were, we started bright and early, took some first day pictures.

and at six o'clock that evening we were at a park across the street and I was saying, we will.

finish this. No matter what. We won't do anything fun until we finished it. You have to do this. And everyone was crying and it was the worst day of homeschool. And there were more like that. I was so determined that it had to look like public school and we had to be keeping up and we had to be doing all the things.

And I so appreciate that there are homeschool families out there that choose this school. spectrum of learning from unschooling to very organized, very structured all day, five days a week learning. And we have moved around on that spectrum over the years and I'm becoming more comfortable. Uh, so it's taken a long time and, and continual reminders to myself that learning happens in so many different ways.

~~~And we do have formal learning that we do in the morning. If we don't start by about 30 in the morning, our family doesn't get to it. We struggle the rest of the day and other people start in the afternoons. I know, but we do that. And then we get out and hang out with homeschool groups and learn through All our curiosity, our projects, my one of my kiddos loves building dominoes and he's always building and learning science things and asking questions and the other is very creative and likes to work on books and things like that.~~~

So it's taken time, I guess, would be my thought on [00:01:00] that.

# A Year and a Half of Math in Just Four Months!

Elle Tevebaugh: The prodigy app is a math and reading app.

We don't use the reading part as much, but my younger son has gained about **a year and a half of math in about About four months** of that app, and he even took a break in there for a month. So in three months, and it's covering areas of math that I did not, that I wouldn't even think of covering, honestly.

Um, but he's learning, and he'll come up and ask me a question, but it's, it's gamified. And so they answer a question correctly, they get points, they get magic, and they attack, they do their attack in the game, and then there's another question. And so. In some ways, that's not ideal, right? Like, I don't want him learning all his math from an app, but on the other hand, he is now ahead in math because he loves this app.

And I actually sometimes have to tell him like, that's enough screen time. I know it's learning screens, but you need to take a break, run around a little. And so that prodigy app has been huge for our family because they're, they play it, they get practicing and they then ask me questions and I get to teach them new things and they go, Oh, I get it [00:01:00] now.

And go do it 20 more times until they've, you know. Mastered it.

A confession from a homeschool parent:

“I used to think perfect was possible.

Every year, I'd create these elaborate plans. Cover everything we missed. Close every learning gap. Hit every milestone.

Then reality would show up, uninvited.

But something magical happened in year four: I stopped chasing perfection and started embracing progress.

The truth? You don't need to be the perfect teacher. You just need to be their teacher.

We're 10 weeks into our fourth year now. Some days shine bright. Others test our patience.

But watching my kids grow into amazing humans? That's worth every imperfect moment.

Remember: Your best is enough. Even when it doesn't feel like it.

Because at the end of the day, it's not about reaching the stars. It's about enjoying the journey upward.”

  

# Shooting for the Stars, Embracing Reality

Elle Tevebaugh: ~ I always start the year with this really high expectation of all the things we're going to learn. And I'm going to cover everything from previous years that we didn't get around to and I'm going to try and get them back up to grade level in this area.

And it's never, that's not reality. So I shoot for the stars and then we do the best that we can as we go along. And, um, I think that each year that we homeschool, and this is halfway through our, We started mid summer because of a move, actually. And so, we, we had finished early, and we started early, and we're about 10 weeks into our learning right now, and this fourth year has been our best yet, because I am getting more comfortable and confident that I am their best teacher, even though I'm not perfect anywhere near it.

I'm the best teacher for them, and, uh, we, each day, we have great days, and we have struggle days, and it's It's overall going to be okay. They're, they're progressing and becoming amazing human beings.

When Elle Tevebaugh's son wrote more in a 20-minute letter to a friend than he had in an entire week of remote learning assignments, she discovered the hidden truth about education that would transform her family's learning journey.

Four years into homeschooling, Elle shares the raw reality of what works (and what spectacularly doesn't) when transitioning from traditional schooling to a personalized approach. From her disastrous first day that ended in tears at the park to discovering the power of nature-based learning, her story reveals the messy, beautiful truth about finding your family's educational path.

### Learn:

- Why recreating school at home leads to burnout and resistance (and what to do instead)
- How de-schooling creates the mental space needed for authentic learning to emerge
- The unexpected way nature-based programs rebuild confidence and curiosity
- Why structured flexibility matters more than perfect lesson plans
- How interest-led learning accelerated her son's math progress by 18 months in just 4 months
- The emotional reality of accepting you are your child's best teacher (even on the hard days)

    📚 **"I was determined to make homeschool look like public school… and it was a disaster."**
    
    I used to think homeschooling had to mirror the traditional system. Rigid schedules. Strict lesson plans. No breaks until everything was done.
    
    And you know what? **Everyone was miserable.**
    
    It took years for me to realize that **learning isn’t just about checking boxes**. It’s about curiosity, engagement, and letting kids discover knowledge in ways that make sense to them.
    
    There’s a whole **spectrum** of homeschooling—from unschooling to fully structured learning. And **it’s okay to move along that spectrum** as you figure out what works for your family.
    
    💡 **The biggest lesson I’ve learned? Learning happens in so many different ways.**
    
    Whether you’re new to homeschooling or feeling stuck in an old mindset, remember: **you don’t have to recreate public school at home.**
    
    Education should be freeing, not frustrating.
    
      
    
- **A Year and a Half of Math in Just Four Months!**
    
    🎮 **"I don’t want my kid learning all his math from an app… but here’s the thing."**
    
    Like most parents, I worry about screen time. I want my child to learn math **in a balanced way**, not just from a game.
    
    But then I saw something amazing happen.
    
    He started **loving** math. He’d come up to me asking questions, excited to understand concepts. He’d practice again and again—**because the game made it fun**.
    
    Now? **He’s ahead in math.**
    
    Of course, I still have to set limits. I tell him, _"That’s enough screen time—go run around!"_ But tools like **Prodigy** have become a huge asset for our family.
    
    💡 The best part? It’s not just about the app—it’s about the **engagement and curiosity it creates.** He plays, practices, asks questions, and suddenly… math isn’t a struggle.
    
    At the end of the day, **learning should be engaging.** If a tool sparks curiosity and **makes kids excited to learn**, that’s a win in my book.
    
- **Shooting for the Stars, Embracing Reality**
    
    📚 **"Every year, I start with huge expectations… and every year, reality reminds me otherwise."**
    
    At the beginning of the school year, I tell myself:
    
    ✅ We’ll cover everything we missed last year
    
    ✅ We’ll get caught up to grade level
    
    ✅ We’ll follow the perfect plan
    
    But the truth? **That’s not reality.**
    
    I’ve learned to **shoot for the stars but embrace the journey**—knowing that progress isn’t always linear.
    
    Now, in our fourth year of homeschooling, I finally feel **more confident and comfortable.** I’ve realized something important:
    
    💡 **I may not be the perfect teacher, but I am the best teacher for my kids.**
    
    Some days are smooth, some days are tough, but overall? **They are learning, growing, and becoming incredible human beings.**
    
    And at the end of the day, **that’s what really matters.**

# Elle Tevebaugh

Elle Tevebaugh: [00:00:00] I think so many homeschooling parents and kids are lonely. It's so easy to get in your own small world and the joy that comes from connecting with others and the reassurance and the advice and the encouragement is just incredible.

Ela Richmond: Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. I'm your sometimes host Ella, and today I have on Ella Thibaba. I'm about to get into her whole story. So she's been homeschooling for about four years now, but we're also going to talk about something that she's very involved in which is called Nature Rangers, and she's going to share a little bit about that and how it's brought so much delight to her family.

But first I wanted to start with your story. So you got started in homeschooling about four years ago, correct? Can you share kind of like that whole experience, how you got started, what was the initial, um, I guess inciting moment?

Elle Tevebaugh: Yeah, [00:01:00] absolutely. Uh, my kids had just kind of fallen into the flow of public school. I had considered homeschooling, but never pursued it, and they were struggling a bit in school. And then those early COVID days happened. We were doing remote learning. I was trying to help my preschooler and kindergartner with, uh, you know, trying to do that online remote learning and assignments.

And, uh, at the time, my older son, who's now 11, he was in kindergarten, and he was Absolutely miserable. There was an assignment that they were supposed to write a few sentences each day about an animal and make their first book. And we spent maybe two hours a day that week struggling and fighting and crying and maybe getting at best one sentence into this book.

And then the next day, Friday, we, uh, didn't have remote learning that day. And I asked him to send a letter to a friend that had just moved away, and he must have written, Maybe a hundred words in that letter and mom. How do I spell this and how [00:02:00] could I say this to her and he wrote in? 20 minutes more than I had ever seen him right and he was excited and felt accomplished and I that was the Exciting moment of realizing I think homeschooling might be better for us.

I don't think that this is going to Succeed if we try this remote learning he had already been struggling. He was in the lowest reading group at school Despite all of the learning that we had done at home during his early years. And so, I just started to think that one on one attention and some choice learning involved would really help us.

Ela Richmond: That's a very cool observation. Were you involved in his schooling before? So when, I, obviously he was at K, so they don't have as much homework, but were you involved at all?

Elle Tevebaugh: Not really. I volunteered a few times in his classroom, and we tried to do a little bit of, you know, the early pre, pre school stuff that you do at home, and letters, and reading stories to him and such, but I remember this feeling, [00:03:00] driving them home from school, I would see something super interesting out the window, or, you know, on the weekends, and I just remember thinking, he's so tired, I don't want to try and have this conversation, the natural learning that happens in day to day life, I just thought he's exhausted already as a kindergartner from these long days.

And so I wouldn't have those conversations. But now the number of things that he has learned about that both of my kids ask these deep questions and are so interested in everything and want to show me things that they can build or create. Um, and so I wasn't super involved before and I remember thinking that the school days were more than enough and that I couldn't contribute more.

Ela Richmond: Yeah, that's so interesting. Did you see a change happen in him and in his life, um, whenever he started going to school? Like, when did that start?

Elle Tevebaugh: Yeah, that's an interesting question I hadn't considered, but I remember in preschool when he was about four, they had told me he's [00:04:00] going to have to repeat kindergarten, no, no matter what, because he gets so frustrated. And so I would say the first change that I really saw happen when he was in preschool and it continued through in kindergarten was that he, if he made one mistake in his writing or his reading, he would just He was so sad and so distressed by those mistakes and not keeping up with his peers that he was falling further behind because he couldn't, he didn't have the resilience to come back to it and keep going.

And we've worked really hard on developing that and he's doing so well now. But I think that that I remember just he was so tired and my younger one. Not so much. It was still just preschool that he was involved with and he enjoyed the play, I think, but That was one of the things just less energy for play less questions And then when we during summers, I would see they were curious playful learning asking so many questions as we just lived our lives [00:05:00] Yeah,

Ela Richmond: podcast yet. And I actually think that this is a really important point. Thinking back to my educational journey, thinking back to my family's educational journey, I remember being so tired after school. And you're correct, like, when you are so tired, you don't, you don't have that innate curiosity, you don't have that innate spark to look at.

Just the, the world around you and allow that to be somewhere that you learn. Um, I do think that that's actually so, so valuable and so impactful to mention. When you started to, I guess, help him to learn about the world and to, to see the world as his learning playground, so to speak, what was that transition and, and what, if you can, What was the inciting moment that made you actually pull them out?

Say, okay, this is what I'm doing. Where did you begin? Where were you like, okay, this is how I'm going to start?

Elle Tevebaugh: The inciting moment still was that, that piece of watching him [00:06:00] joyfully write a letter that he wanted to write, but Then, so I told his kindergartner teacher, I will keep reporting to you what we're doing, but we are not going to be submitting the, for the next month. I, and I just said, I appreciate you. I will check in with you.

I will let you know, but we cannot, we're a month into this remote learning and I cannot continue it. I'm going to try homeschooling and I'll, I'll let you know. Uh, then we were moving that next fall and I knew that the kids would be starting school a few weeks late. And I thought, let's just try homeschooling, even if it's just for a year.

And, uh, It was so different. I did not think of the world as his learning playground. That's a great phrase. Um, Those early days we, my first official day as a homeschool teacher, uh, we were, we started bright and early, took some first day pictures. I had this entire curriculum that I'd spent planning out and all these supplies and at six o'clock that evening we were at a park across the street and I was saying, we will.

finish this. No matter what. [00:07:00] We won't do anything fun until we finished it. You have to do this. And everyone was crying and it was the worst day of homeschool. And there were more like that. I was so determined that it had to look like public school and we had to be keeping up and we had to be doing all the things.

And I so appreciate that there are homeschool families out there that choose this school. spectrum of learning from unschooling to very organized, very structured all day, five days a week learning. And we have moved around on that spectrum over the years and I'm becoming more comfortable. Uh, so it's taken a long time and, and continual reminders to myself that learning happens in so many different ways.

And we do have formal learning that we do in the morning. If we don't start by about 30 in the morning, our family doesn't get to it. We struggle the rest of the day and other people start in the afternoons. I know, but we do that. And then we get out and hang out with homeschool groups and learn through All our curiosity, [00:08:00] our projects, my one of my kiddos loves building dominoes and he's always building and learning science things and asking questions and the other is very creative and likes to work on books and things like that.

So it's taken time, I guess, would be my thought on that.

Ela Richmond: and I guess that makes sense. And it's funny because the more that I speak with homeschool parents, the more this flexible learning journey becomes. The standard, I guess, it becomes so important that parents understand, okay, it's not just, um, what do we need to learn today, it's not just what is, what is the normal protocol, it is also what can we do given the constraints that our family has.

So, if we're moving, right, I'm going to have more constraints than if I was not moving and if we were still. Or, you know, does my kid have an illness or something? And just working through the constraints that your family has is also very important. [00:09:00] What has this looked like? So, um, and then I would love for you to kind of explain how you got into Nature Rangers as well.

So, what was the, I guess, the, not educational menu, so to speak, but like, did you start with the regular subjects? And then how did you start going interest based and passion based? Yeah, um, there'll be

Elle Tevebaugh: we still do such a mix of both of those. So early on, I found some great resources that helped you choose your own curriculum. I studied elementary ed in college. I had always wanted to be a teacher my entire life. And so I think that's some of why I felt like we have to accomplish it in this way.

But I chose not to become a classroom teacher because it seemed so rigid to me in the student observations that I was doing. So we, I do always try to cover the basic topics and the things that would be studied. And so I do a blend of, um, every summer looking into what are the standards for the grade this year for each of my kids?

[00:10:00] How can I connect those and where are they currently? So knowing, okay, this is the standard, but also they are two years behind on this subject and a year ahead in that subject. And I spent most of last year working on reading skills because we were struggling, so we did other things. But 60 percent of our time was spent just focusing on reading skills.

And so, So, uh, But then I make a lot of space for the learning and sometimes it comes and goes. So we'll have weeks where we're so focused on the curriculum and that have chosen or the thing that we've been learning. And then right now we're doing a project week this week and just realizing that we are actually we've done so well and worked so hard.

I can can give more attention and I have to acknowledge that I have not given attention to their passions and their curiosity and their interests. And so taking some time. And I always start the year with this really high expectation of all the things we're going to learn. And I'm going to cover everything from previous years that we didn't get around to [00:11:00] and I'm going to try and get them back up to grade level in this area.

And it's never, that's not reality. So I shoot for the stars and then we do the best that we can as we go along. And, um, I think that each year that we homeschool, and this is halfway through our, We started mid summer because of a move, actually. And so, we, we had finished early, and we started early, and we're about 10 weeks into our learning right now, and this fourth year has been our best yet, because I am getting more comfortable and confident that I am their best teacher, even though I'm not perfect anywhere near it.

I'm the best teacher for them, and, uh, we, each day, we have great days, and we have struggle days, and it's It's overall going to be okay. They're, they're progressing and becoming amazing human beings.

Ela Richmond: coming to acceptance of I am their best teacher. How long did that take? And, and why have you settled on that now?

Elle Tevebaugh: Oh, I am [00:12:00] so grateful and so lucky that I have a partner that is very supportive that I'm their best teacher. And he says, I would not homeschool if this was not something you'd be interested in. I know I don't have the capacity or interest or patience to do this. And so. But he keeps telling me and reminding me even on the days that I feel like we're so far behind where they would be in school.

But I think that what really brought me to that understanding was that, uh, I had done two years of homeschooling and we were starting our third year of homeschooling. Again, we started mid summer. My son asked in July, when are we starting homeschool? And I said, because I really want to. And he said, okay, tomorrow.

And I scrambled and got everything ready. And we were about a month into our third year. And I panicked and I heard about this really great school that was doing really interesting project based learning and all the kids, you know, everyone was welcome just as they, as they are and we'll meet you and help you and support you and [00:13:00] um, it just was a beautiful school and exactly the kind of school experience I would want for my kids and so I panicked.

Partially because we did pretty well with that first month but the same insecurities that come week by week, sometimes day by day were really strong in me at that moment. And I, I just decided like, let's just do school, but honestly, they lost ground in school. And I am, I am so for public school. I am so thankful that it exists.

I'm so grateful for teachers, but for my kids and for different reasons for each of them, they, they lost ground in school. They knew less about the reading material at the end of the year than they did at the beginning. Now they made some progress in math or in persistence, some different things. They made friendship connections that we still maintain today, but we saw that school year all the way through to the end and come June, they knew less than they had known the August before.

And I, [00:14:00] so that, and my partner reminding me over and over again, You are the best teacher for them. And even watching my, my kids work with other teachers and other environments, whether that be a group environment, I just see the ways that I know these tiny little details about. The way that they think or the amount of time that they need to consider a question or how to, you need to run some laps and get your wiggles out and then we'll come back to it.

I know them and I see these micro details about the way that they're learning that no one else has been able to give the time and attention to. And so as our, as parents, we have to know. I'm doing the best that I can with the resources and knowledge I have right now, and I cannot do better than my best, and some days my best looks terrible, and some days we have these beautiful, connective moments, and, and I'm the best mom I can be, and I'm the best teacher I can be, and for now, if they want to be in school later, or if it's better for our family, or they're learning better, I'm so open to them doing school someday, but for now, we need to stick to homeschool, because they're [00:15:00] making more progress than they have anywhere else.

Ela Richmond: Wow, that's interesting. I would not have expected that. Did they ask to come out of that school, or was it mostly that you were watching these, this progress and them actually slow down, and you were like, okay, wait, this isn't what's supposed to be happening.

Elle Tevebaugh: It was such a mix. There were days that going to school was a battle and tears and I will not put on my shoes and go to school. I don't want to or it's too hard or I would see how tired they were again that year in school. They just would come home so tired. They would come home and And just want to do screens and dinner and nothing else.

Like we didn't connect as a family all week long. So, but then, you know, they'd have a Halloween party at school and it was really fun. So school's the best. And I love my teacher and I love my friends. And so they, we barely made it through that school year there probably once or twice a week. I was doing it.

An inch from pulling [00:16:00] them from school. And I just thought we can't keep doing this. This is agony for our family, but we wanted to see it through and we wanted to give it its chance to really work. And it, it was good in some ways, but it wasn't what was best for us. And I'm so glad I had that experience because I still panic and think I'm going to put them in school.

And then I think I know where that leads. And for now we need to see this through and I've heard the homeschooling really There comes a point that it really clicks and the kids make a ton of progress And you sometimes you fall behind a lot of people fall behind in the early years But then something clicks and the kids know that I know how to learn And I know what I want to learn and they they figure it out and they can learn it very quickly when they're motivated and so even in the areas that they're behind I tell them that's just for now like we we've made choices as a family to move at the pace that works and someday you're gonna still love learning and you're gonna be able to it Um, shoot ahead in the areas that are important to you.

[00:17:00] Mm.

Ela Richmond: Where it makes sense for them to want to learn this. Uh, I was talking to somebody the other day and they were basically saying that their kid learned something that, you know, was supposed to take, was supposed to take six months in, like, three.

And I, I was sharing that I had a very similar experience with that with my brother because he He first went to school, learned math, and forgot math. And then he started deciding that he wanted to be an engineer, and doing robotics camps and things like that. And he came back to math and he was like, Oh, I need to learn this.

And so, he sat with it and taught himself faster. And there is something to be said about that, for sure.

Elle Tevebaugh: [00:18:00] I think I can hear you now. It cut out for a really long time there. Sorry.

Ela Richmond: Did you, did I cut out?

Elle Tevebaugh: I didn't hear you for the last 30 seconds or so. I heard about your brother and learning engineering and then it stopped.

Ela Richmond: Okay, sweet. So, uh, yes. I'm just gonna do a segue really quickly and then we'll cut this part out. Um, but yeah, so basically, yeah, the, the thing that, the thing that kids need is motivation. A reason why. Like, why does this matter to me? And, I mean, going back to the explanation of your, your son with the letter, like, he can write, he can read, but the why matters so much.

And, and yes, I love that, that emphasis on, Finding that is really important, and one day it will click when you find that thing for them. So, can we talk about the different things that you are exploring with and for your kids? The passion based types of things, and then, if, if that also segues into Nature Ranger, I would love to hear [00:19:00] how that has been, um, beneficial to your family.

That

Elle Tevebaugh: Absolutely. And they really do go together. I, in the Nature Rangers program that I am helping teach, I, see the ways that the kids find joy. We call them science talks or or nature walks and we're learning and exploring and they are asking questions about what is this plan? Or did you know this? They're teaching me so many things they're teaching each other.

And so there is so much enthusiasm in those nature settings where we have groups of kids up to 12 kids. We have a younger program, um, K through third grade and then an upper program for third grade. And I'm getting to see and work with both. I have a kid in each group and they, they play and they are constantly learning and they're growing physically stronger.

Their friendships are growing. Their communication skills are improving. They, their interest in nature science. Some of them have no interest when they start the program. The kids just want to drop, the parents just want a spot to drop off the [00:20:00] kids because being a homeschool parent is so important. It's 24 7, uh, and so it's this little five hour program where we are out and climbing and exploring and interested and they're, the kids are learning that interest from each other.

There's so much joy. And then they're teaching each other. My, one of my kiddos likes to finger knit and he was teaching that to the other students and one likes to draw and he was teaching that to the students. And so there's free time, but there are lessons, there are arts and crafts that are optional and the kids.

Make it their own. You know, I'll say, here's the craft we're going to do and you can use these. And this is how mine looks. And then every single one of them looks different and interesting and funny. And can I just use the paint to do this? And, you know, they're sharing their experiences and their passions in that.

And I, that is the best learning environment. There's the one on one and two on one teaching that we do at home. Um, and, and that's good. And it has its place. And there's also the project based You know, things that I'm allowing them to do in our homeschool program, but the, [00:21:00] I would say Nature Rangers is hands down our best day of the week because I get to see that.

And you know, my kids, I'm always there as the teacher, but I watch them connect with the other teachers and volunteers. And then I also see the other students who sometimes they've never been away from mom ever. And yet they're coming into this program and they're a little nervous at first, but there's just love and connection and fun.

They do so well, and I see them thrive, and I see them grow. It's incredible.

Ela Richmond: Oh, okay.

Elle Tevebaugh: Oh, I don't mind. Um, a day in the life and how we started. So we briefly lived in California for about six months and the founder of Nature Rangers, which is a non profit. She had started this program maybe five or six years ago, and I just needed some help. We had no friends or family during that window [00:22:00] that we were in California, and I just needed a break.

And so we paid for the drop off part of the program, and the kids did really well, and she would send me pictures, and they would come home with stories and crafts, and it was the most engaged. I had seen my younger kiddo in any learning in a while, and so I was very grateful for the program. And then the founder, Tracy, when we were leaving California, mentioned, Oh, I've always thought about if people would want to expand this somewhere, are you interested?

And so we did. I kind of panicked and thought I wouldn't be good enough at it and all those things. And that was actually the year that we put the boys in school for a year. And so I told her, no, thank you, but I love what you're doing, but they're going to be in school. So I started to try and develop my own program the following summer when we realized we were coming back to homeschooling.

I was trying to build out, I started to build out a curriculum and an idea and we'd do citizen projects and we'd do science and we'd do, you know, all these different things. And I realized Tracy already had this idea. beautiful program running. It was so powerful [00:23:00] and she already had all these different dynamics in it and all these lesson plans and it was just beautifully built out.

She had all this experience and she is so freely helped me to start this program. And so I, um, ran it for a year actually in Texas. And now we're living in Oregon. We're putting down roots here, but, um, we are, I'm starting it up again here in around the Medford area, and there has been such a great turnout.

The parents love it. The kids love it. And it's not because of me. It's what Tracy has built, and it's the volunteers and staff that I have, and the connection with such great other homeschooling kids. But, um, that was how I got started, uh, with the project. doing nature rangers was just realizing anything I build out isn't going to have all these resources at my fingertips.

And every time I have a question, Tracy will help me out. So it's now actually in four locations around the country, and I'm hoping that other people jump in and started in their area because really, you already have everything handed to you and you [00:24:00] just run the program. It's really lovely.

Ela Richmond: that is so cool. And what is, what is the, like, the change that you've seen inside of your sons since them doing the program?

Elle Tevebaugh: Yeah. Um, one of the things that I'm most grateful for, aside from that curiosity that I was telling you about is the friendships. There is something about a paid drop off program or the volunteers coming regularly. They know that their friends will be there and all the other homeschool programs that we, we are part of two of them here.

Um, but. You know, people come and go there, they're traveling, they're doing whatever, but people show up to drop their kids off for those five hours that they get to themselves. And so there's such consistency in the, um, the schedule of the day. Yeah. You had asked about the day in the life of, so we'll, we'll gather for a morning circle and, um, do we do our lessons pretty early, but there's free play in the morning for the younger kids.

It's a lot of free play with some lessons and crafts mixed in. And for the older kids. There are [00:25:00] probably three, three and a half hours of learning with some free play mixed in through the day and connections and conversation. And so we have We have lessons that are really powerful for the older kids.

We do a, um, scientific method experiment and they get, they, none of them were familiar with that at the beginning. And so they're starting to understand a hypothesis and then how to gather the data and how we really need to only be changing one thing, not multiple things. And so comparing different plants or different.

whatever we're studying that day. There are leadership discussions and they're at the beginning of one of the early leadership conversations this year, they had no idea what the word integrity meant. We, we start with a lot of questions there. What do you already know about this? What do you think this means?

What do you think is true about this animal or this kind of plant and how these trees are growing and so many, you know, letting them share so much of their knowledge and then just filling in some gaps and they're learning from each other through that. But the, to see them. Have a [00:26:00] deep comprehension of what integrity means and coming to understand that and learn from each other and ask hard questions has been incredible.

And we have optional crafts and we nature journal. So we, you know, sit down and spend time with nature and connect silently with nature as we sketch out a tree and learn about how scientists track what they're learning. And I don't even think that's all we do. Oh, we have wilderness skills. So they're learning to tie knots and they're learning to build shelters.

there's so much to do. We can't even fit it all in in a day. Um, but the changes in my kids have been more confidence learning those wilderness skills, teaching each other. Um, and I think that connection to nature and that time outside is really settling for them. And so I find that actually our Thursdays and Fridays, we meet with nature rangers on Wednesdays and the Thursdays and Fridays, I would say homeschool goes a little bit better because they have Connected with that internal learner, that curious child within them, and [00:27:00] they are grounded and they've connected with friends.

And so I think that it helps our whole school week, um, and helps them. Sometimes I would say other kids are more knowledgeable or more excited about science. And so that has increased their overall interest in science as well.

Ela Richmond: Those are all very important. I loved your, your emphasis on the fact that nature is very settling for them. Because that is something that parents struggle with quite often is, my kid is all over the place and, and I do not know what to do about it. And I can take them to a park, Um, and I can have them play outside.

But it's really cool that you have this extended period of play time and outside time. And then also this period where they get to be curious with a lot of other students. Um, I can imagine that that is just so cool. How has it been for you? Has it kind of, I don't know, opened your eyes to the small wonders of the world?

[00:28:00] Mmm.

Elle Tevebaugh: about it. I sometimes will tell the trees like, come just put your hand on this tree for one minute and just say hello to it and say, see if it says anything back and they'll go, it talked to me, you know, and that's the younger kids that they, they're like so into it. And I loved being outside as a kid.

I spent all my time outside by myself when I was a kid. And I had forgotten it, if I'm really honest. I had forgotten the peace and joy that it brings me. And I have a hard time getting us outside. I would say that the group activities, both Nature Rangers and the homeschool groups, are the main time that we spend outside.

And I struggle to get us out the door. We'll go to playgrounds, like you said, but I don't, I'm not good at getting us out on hikes, or going to, you know, Beautiful parks, not just city parks, but kind of out and further out of the city and into the wilderness. And [00:29:00] I just find that I am also excited about bugs and I'm also excited to climb the tree.

Sometimes, you know, I I'm on safety patrol all the time, so I can't do as much of that playfulness, but I find it has been It's also been very humbling because science was my worst subject all the way through public school, my, my years in public school, and I felt like I wasn't smart enough, and I couldn't remember.

I spent all my time outside, but no one was teaching me. This is this plant, and this is, here are all these, there's so much to know about nature science, and I have to remind my kids and myself You could spend your whole life studying this one topic and people have and they would still not know Everything there is to know because a lot of times there's this confidence like I know everything about it So it's been humbling to realize that there are students that know more especially being new to the area that know more about the natural Environment than I do and can tell me what plant that is or what bird that is [00:30:00] and that they feel so proud when they can teach me and And even being able to teach the science lessons and the scientific experiments, sometimes it's challenging for me in the prep work, but I have had So much joy in the learning, both beforehand and the kids talking to me after on the drive home about what they liked about that or what they learned that day.

And so I've, it's increased my interest in the natural world.

Ela Richmond: That's very, very impactful. So, you were saying that sometimes it's harder for y'all to get outside. What are the reasons that it usually is? Is it just like wrangling everybody and making the decision, okay, today's gonna be an outdoor day? Like, all the things that come along with it? I

Elle Tevebaugh: maybe a bad habit of so much of what we do is indoors. Very honestly, I tease that their, their dad is a bit of a vampire. He could stay inside in a basement for the rest of his life and be fine. And that's not [00:31:00] true. He actually, when we get him out the door, he is very peaceful and connected with nature and it just resonates beauty inside of us when we see that we are a very, very small part of a very big universe.

And. Sometimes when I'm standing on the beach or in a forest, I just feel how I'm connected to the entire planet that my feet are touching the soil. That is the entire. world. And so I see that in their dad. But I think that they have a little bit of that in them as well. So I spent all my time outside as a kid, but he has spent all of his life indoors.

And I think that the pull to it's just easy to stay inside. We wrangle and get out the door for all kinds of things. But I think our culture is geared toward being indoors and we don't. It's crazy. These nature rangers days, some days we'll get further into the park and we don't see anyone all day. We're the only ones out there.

Um, Um, and I know we have the luxury as homeschoolers of being out there on a Wednesday afternoon, [00:32:00] but it's just interesting to see that as a culture we've moved away from that nature experience, and I think that we just have the habit of school happens inside with paper, and school happens inside with art.

Manipulatives, but why would we be going outside and counting with rocks or drawing or like writing our words with sticks? You know, we don't think of homeschool. I don't think of homeschool as an outdoor experience very often But even the poor weather Doesn't you know, I show up for Nature Rangers, but if it's a little rainy We're not gonna get out the door or a little chilly or whatnot.

And so it it's a A way to be required to show up to get ourselves out the door that has that accountability for me of actually showing up.

Ela Richmond: I think that is exactly correct. The, the, the excuses, like if it's too cold outside, I'm just like, I don't really want to go to that. If it's the perfect 75 degree weather, it's beautiful, no cloud in the sky, like, yes, that is, [00:33:00] that is, you will catch me outside. But otherwise, all of those excuses that come along with it, even though, like, on the rainiest day, maybe you'll see a rainbow, maybe you'll see different type of vegetation, maybe you'll see, like, there's still opportunities, even in the rain or even in the cold.

Um, do you think a part of it is also fear and safety? Because there's this, like, emphasis toward. You know, the world is scary, and you need to make sure that kids stay safe, and what if a kid falls, or you know, hurts himself, or makes a bad decision? Like, how do y'all deal with that as something that parents bring up?

Yeah

Elle Tevebaugh: And so I'm going to send them to you and nature rangers because I know that you will watch that and you have the safety training to make sure that they're okay out there.

And I'm just not gonna deal with it. And I it is so important. I agree. It's easy to think and my [00:34:00] kids struggle with climbing trees. I would be 20 ft up in the air hanging by my knees and way upside down, waving my arms around as a little kid. And my parents didn't worry about that. And yet now none of us get outside or do any of that we are.

And I appreciate we need to keep this kid safe and actually in nature rangers, they are growing these skills. I see them getting faster and stronger. They are developing that gross motor. Skill that I think a lot of our kids are lacking and even the vision like we are so short sighted now because we are not looking at the far distance and so we're developing all of that.

But we do have a safe system and I don't know that the other nature rangers teachers say this, but I'll always say I can't have you climbing that. It's a little too dangerous. I would love for you to be able to. But if you break your leg, you're not going to be able to come back for a few weeks. So we're not and no kid has actually gotten more than a scuff.

That's the most we've had. We had one kiddo that tumbled down a hill because a stick that he was holding broke, but he just had dust all over [00:35:00] his face and in his ears and he kind of sputtered it out and everybody was fine. So we've had no, I've never heard of any serious injuries in the program, and we just make sure that there are guidelines and that we're teaching them how to play safely outside.

Ela Richmond: Yeah, emulated. It's, it's like, okay, well, if you're going, if you are going to be the responsible adult that is engaging with the outdoor world, In a responsible way, that's better to share that way to engage with the outdoor world with them than to just say, Okay, like, go out, have fun, play, figure it out.

Um, which like, obviously, even that, an unstructured play is really good for kids as well. So, yeah, I think that that's an ongoing conversation, though. The conversation between fear, safety, and, um, helping a kid just learn about the world. Like, you can't take away consequence from a child's There's a child's life, right?

There's choice, consequence, and like, if for example, a child, I mean the stick example, right? Like, observe the [00:36:00] fact that this stick is not strong, okay? And then you're going to use it, and then it's going to break, and you're going to fall, and that is okay, and you won't make that mistake again. And there are things about the natural world that we do need to recognize, and we do need to observe.

And there are things about just the world in general that you can only learn through experience. You know, it's just like, it's one of those things, and I think it definitely makes us, us better and more fully formed humans.

Elle Tevebaugh: I love learning and having my kids learn from natural consequences. I think it's just the way that makes the most sense. It's the way, I do as much as I can to help the kids learn the way that we as adults do, and even the motivation. We were talking early in the conversation about that interest in learning.

And I think part of why that's so significant is no adult is going to show up to work or a work that they don't want to be doing unless they're getting paid. So it's either you're doing a passion project or you're volunteering because you want to get the joy of the doing that work [00:37:00] is what is what pays you in a way.

And so I think, you know, I don't do like rewards. We don't do candy as rewards. Food is food, not rewards. But there are ways that they need to be rewarded by what they are learning. And it's, that's why I'm okay with interest led learning because there are times that I think we're never going to get into this and then they do eventually find interest in it and they cover it more quickly.

So I think natural consequences and being able to just experience that passion as they go along is, is a really healthy way of learning and it's not the only way of doing it, but it's worked well for our family.

Ela Richmond: I love that so much. Now I want to ask you some rapid fire questions just to end up our, end up our conversation. The first one is, what is a challenge that you have faced as a homeschool slash open education family, and how did you solve it?

Elle Tevebaugh: Yeah. Um, one challenge right now is that during that year that my kids were in school, one of them [00:38:00] did get an I. E. P. And so I have been trying to figure out and it's been really beautiful. We're receiving, um, Some services, some reading and math services, and it's been really lovely to watch a supplemental teacher help us.

And so, I'm so grateful to OpenEd because I chose, when we stepped out of school, I'm going to be the only one, I'm the only one teaching them, I'm the only one that can get us through these challenges. And so, I'm grateful to OpenEd for having that support, um, for students that are behind or struggling or have an IEP.

And I'm considering that we might possibly need that. For the other kiddo as well. And, uh, it's incredible to have that resource as a homeschool parent.

Ela Richmond: Wow, what resource are you using most?

Elle Tevebaugh: Um, a couple things. I appreciate the, um, that one-on-one IEP, but I actually love submitting my weekly logs. I write way more than is necessary and I, I know plenty of people in open ed actually that just. Do the bare minimum [00:39:00] and that is what works for them. And that's what's comfortable They really want to keep their homeschool to themselves.

I Love accountability though. I love having someone to submit something to I loved having homework in school and a deadline and an expectation and and so I actually write I have the kids chat with the homeroom teacher in the Email back and forth and then I log everything that we've done for the week and put it in the optional section and that has been an incredible opportunity for me to know as a homeschool parent all the things we've done because it is so easy to get to Friday afternoon and go, we barely did anything this week.

I have a list of like, 20 to 30 things every week that are in all these different topics that they've learning experiences conversations. We've had Lessons that we've had apps that they've used I could go on on and on but I am submitting that every week And I love having the accountability and it's the first year that I have known how much progress we're making Mm

Ela Richmond: cool. Um, I [00:40:00] wonder if it's also a great learning opportunity. So like, let's say your kid is struggling with something, or let's say that some variable changed at one point. You're not sure exactly what, but, um, some variable changed. And you get to go back into these weekly learning logs where you're like, okay, what did we do that was different?

And what is, what is consistent about the past little while that could crea give or create an insight for my kid?

Elle Tevebaugh: We had a lot of struggle a few weeks ago and I realized we had removed some of the playfulness of the early weeks. I remember in the early logs, I was like, we got indoor parkour stuff with the funding and we got woodworking stuff with the funding and then we had just stopped doing it and there wasn't as much choice or fun.

or interest in it. It was all math and history and science and reading and writing. And and those are so important. But it really we had lost some of the spark, and it's exactly what you said. I was able to look [00:41:00] back and I know some people have no interest in doing that, but I've tried to track logs before, and I don't have the consistency within myself to track that for my own records.

But knowing that I can submit it, submit it to a teacher and she'll see that and just even if she doesn't read it, I have a place and a weekly time on Friday afternoons to say this is what we've done this week.

Ela Richmond: Teachers read all of them, which I, and I know, um, internally, at least, the teachers are always just, like, so excited about what their students are doing. So excited about the progress that their students are making. And, um, yeah, so they, they definitely read all of them. But, I love that. Can you share with me, uh, my second rapid fire, can you share with me a, a resource, either inside Open Ed or outside, that you've been loving?

And Nature Rangers is one of them. Um, it can be a curriculum resource, it can be a program resource, it can be anything like that.

Elle Tevebaugh: Yeah. Oh man, can I say several things if I say them quickly? There's so [00:42:00] many. I love having homeschool groups with other parents. And so we do two of those a week, and it's sometimes hard to squeeze in school in the morning and get out the door by 11 30 to get to those. But I love having that community. I, um, there was another resource.

There are some in open ed. I love that. I, um, we have enjoyed the programming kit with the Lego spike kit, and we would never be able to do that. Utilize those resources. Having the funding that we've had through open it has turned things around for us. I actually haven't said that yet, but I think that that is actually why this has been the best year for us.

Aside from those other things, having more experience. I have always tried to stick to like 300 or less per school year. Because it just felt so stressful to try and budget for that and to feel like well It would be free if they went to public school. And so why am I both? I'm not making money I'm spending money.

And so I would just gather every free resource I could [00:43:00] but having finally having resources to hey They would love woodworking. We're gonna learn that and we're gonna learn safety skills with that I'm the only one that has cut myself in the woodworking. We'll say that One more thing The prodigy app is a math and reading app.

We don't use the reading part as much, but my younger son has gained about a year and a half of math in about About four months of that app, and he even took a break in there for a month. So in three months, and it's covering areas of math that I did not, that I wouldn't even think of covering, honestly.

Um, but he's learning, and he'll come up and ask me a question, but it's, it's gamified. And so they answer a question correctly, they get points, they get magic, and they attack, they do their attack in the game, and then there's another question. And so. In some ways, that's not ideal, right? Like, I don't want him learning all his math from an app, but on the other hand, he is now ahead in math because he loves this app.

And I actually sometimes have to tell him like, that's enough screen time. I know it's learning screens, but you [00:44:00] need to take a break, run around a little. And so that prodigy app has been huge for our family because they're, they play it, they get practicing and they then ask me questions and I get to teach them new things and they go, Oh, I get it now.

And go do it 20 more times until they've, you know. Mastered it.

Ela Richmond: I love that so much. And my last, my last rapid fire for you is, do you have any advice for a new and or existing OpenEd family? I

Elle Tevebaugh: Yeah, I would, uh, I guess I would advise like

Ela Richmond: so it's

Elle Tevebaugh: to explore the different resources. There are so many possibilities, uh, within the open ed. Website and so there are really cool apps and things that we're learning from in there And then I have really appreciated the homeroom teacher and being able to submit that and have conversations with her I would definitely look into as well Trying [00:45:00] to just try, like, jump into something and not feel like there are so many possibilities.

I don't know which thing to use, but just to explore what do you think would fit for your family out of these resources. You know, you can search what this, uh, topic for this grade, what resources are there. And then there are games and lessons and, you know, So many beautiful things and so it's not a question of is there a great thing out there but just choosing one and knowing that you can move on to another one at some point but Trying out those Those resources and then I guess just there is community if you can find other people.

I know people in Medford who are also in open ed and so we support each other and remind each other to submit logs and ask questions of each other and I've really appreciated that it doesn't feel like this thing that I'm doing alone. So I know there are different ways that you all are encouraging connection and community.

And I also really love the clubs. My kids have loved the clubs and it's interesting to watch them learn, uh, listening to others and communicating in a [00:46:00] group and using the technology to be in those clubs.

Ela Richmond: I love that so much. You mentioned that you've gotten connected with other Open Ed families in your area. How did you do that as a recommendation for other families that would love to learn who's in their area?

Elle Tevebaugh: Yeah, I don't know what you would recommend for people, but it just so happened that I heard about Open Ed through one of the homeschool groups that I had joined over the summer. And so they had already shared with each other, and then I've been sharing it with other people as I meet families around here that homeschool.

I tell them about Open Ed, so they might be joining here well by tomorrow. Hopefully they've submitted their applications for the mid year. Thank you. So it actually was through the communities of homeschoolers around the area. But I think getting involved locally and then finding other people, asking around who, is anyone in open ed and how do you utilize that?

Ela Richmond: Yeah, that's, that's a, A great recommendation, um, because most families are coming to OpenEd through other families. And one thing that we are working on is a new initiative is [00:47:00] parent led meetups. So that being a new initiative and that being something that we are going to support is other parents basically inciting meetups in their area.

I think that will also help with OpenEd families getting to meet each other and create these groups together.

Elle Tevebaugh: Absolutely. I think so many homeschooling parents and kids are lonely. It's so easy to get in your own small world and the joy that comes from connecting with others and the reassurance and the advice and the encouragement is just incredible.

Ela Richmond: Thank you so much for coming on this podcast. It's been incredible.

Elle Tevebaugh: It's so fun to chat with you. Thank you for your time.

When Elle Tevebaugh's son wrote more in a 20-minute letter to a friend than he had in an entire week of remote learning assignments, she discovered the hidden truth about education that would transform her family's learning journey.

Four years into homeschooling, Elle shares the raw reality of what works (and what spectacularly doesn't) when transitioning from traditional schooling to a personalized approach. From her disastrous first day that ended in tears at the park to discovering the power of nature-based learning, her story reveals the messy, beautiful truth about finding your family's educational path.

- The unexpected way nature-based programs rebuild confidence and curiosity
- Why structured flexibility matters more than perfect lesson plans
- How interest-led learning accelerated her son's math progress by 18 months in just 4 months
- The emotional reality of accepting you are your child's best teacher (even on the hard days)
