📍 📍 📍 we call it the who economy.

You're moving from the how economy to the who economy, right? Like, I don't ask, how do I solve this? I ask who like me has solved this already that I can go to for help. And so kind of combining, and that's where like, it's so hard to sell into for any vendor, the homeschool market, because it is the definition of the who economy.

It is word of mouth networks. They barely have functioning Facebook groups or websites or anything in most of these communities that trust me, I've moved. to five different states and plugged in as a new homeschooler in every one of them. And it takes a couple years before you discover all the opportunities because it's all just like word of mouth networks.

So trying to combine the trust that's built there in that one to one who do you know sense and put and scale it onto some kind of digital distribution is I think a really unique challenge that we'll start to see solved.

  

  

  

The new 1% of learners:

Tech-savvy

Self-directed

Emotionally intelligent

Entrepreneurially-minded

Learn through real-world projects

Value skills and competency over grades

  

  

  

ESAs are NOT just another name for vouchers.

Here's why it matters:

Vouchers = A ticket for one thing  
ESAs = A pool of money for multiple options

With ESAs:

- Families can customize education
- Unused funds roll over
- More flexibility and choice

We're moving from "where should I send my kid?" to "how can I build the best education for my child?"

The future of learning is personalized, not standardized.

Schools teach math, science, and literature.

But they're failing at the hidden curriculum:

- Project management
- Effective communication
- Professional norms
- Networking skills
- Emotional intelligence

These skills make or break careers. Yet they're rarely explicitly taught.

Want to revolutionize education?  
Make the hidden curriculum visible.

It's time to prepare students for the real world, not just for tests.

The hard truth about education startups:

Passion isn't enough. Good intentions aren't enough.

We need sustainable models that:

1. Provide value to students
2. Pay teachers well
3. Can scale beyond year 2 or 3

Many micro-schools and edtech startups fail because they lack a viable long-term strategy.

Innovation without sustainability is just a costly experiment.

Let's build education models that last.

  

  

Hard pill to swallow:

Your child's school might be preparing them for a world that no longer exists.

The future belongs to those who can adapt, create, and solve real problems.

It's time to rethink education.

These skills matter more than any textbook knowledge.

Thread for Isaac?

The education system is broken. @michaelbhorn explains why the "Great Unbundling" is coming (but not as fast as some predict): 🧵

1/7 Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) are changing the game. At least 14 states now have ESA programs (see @edchoice), allowing families to pay for various educational options with public funds. He estimates 10 million have access, but here's the catch:

2/7 The vast majority of families still use ESAs for traditional schooling. Why? Because unbundling takes time. Parents need to learn how to navigate this new world of educational choice.

3/7 "The longer students remain in the program, the share of ESA funds devoted to private school tuition decreases while expenditure shares increase for curriculum, instruction, tutoring, and specialized services." - @MichaelBHorn

4/7 This gradual shift is what Horn calls the "Great Unbundling" of education. It's not happening overnight, but it's happening. Families are slowly learning to customize their children's education. And in Utah, thanks to the precedent set by @OpenED, it’s happening a lot faster

5/7 The challenge? Building a sustainable marketplace of educational options. Many micro-schools and alternative models struggle to create long-term business models.

6/7 Horn argues that we need to focus on creating entirely new systems, rather than trying to transform the existing ones. This includes developing solutions like mastery-based transcripts and assessments.

7/7 The future of education is personalized, flexible, and unbundled. But it will take time, patience, and innovation to get there. As parents and educators, we need to be ready to embrace this change.

### Transcript

My perception is one size fits all never made sense. It was never the right way to educate kids, serve families.

It worked for a number of decades because the expectations were such that it sort of stayed in line, but it wasn't really the way to optimize learning or development or opportunity. And the system has been breaking for the last several decades. Parents increasingly are not putting up with one size fits all.

They're making lots of different choices, right? Some of them are going to the micro school for everything. We're going, like, you know, we're going to the charter. Some of them increasingly, I think, are starting to say like, "We'll take a little bit from here.

We'll go here for the sports. We'll take this tutor and cobbling it together."

And frankly, policy is starting to catch up, I think, in some meaningful ways. Depending on how you count it, somewhere between 13 and 19 states now have education savings accounts type policies. This competitive pressure is a good thing.

Because districts are going to have to find increasing ways to offer a portfolio of options and get out of the one size fits all mindset.

### Transcript

**Isaac:** [00:00:00] Michael, you're probably the best person I can think of to ask this question too. Like where we are on the adoption curve because for decades If you say oh the education system is too rigid. It's too confining. It constrains curiosity You know, ken robinson gave his famous ted talk and it was immediately everybody loved it It's like yes, everyone agrees.

Nobody's happy. But then all these innovators come out there and say here's this new model here's this new thing they tried to do vouchers back in the 90s and like Either if it's a if it's a private alternative, they never get that much scale or even if it's a policy change It seems pretty limited. I heard a stat, I don't know if this is true, so you can check me on it, that there's 47 million students in the U S that have access to some kind of school choice program or another, and only 1 million of those are actually.

Taking advantage of it. And I don't know if that's true, but I wouldn't be shocked if something like that was true. And so there's always been this kind of paradox as somebody who is trying to [00:01:00] innovate in this space myself. And in my case, it was college. Everyone would agree. Yeah. College doesn't prepare you for jobs.

It costs too much, blah, blah, blah. And then I'm like, great, look, I have this thing. It's a net cost of zero. You're going to get hired. 98 percent of our grads do blah, blah, blah. And the market still is really, really small. Right. And so.

It's felt like the adoption curve and like so you get on this graveyard of cool innovations and policy changes And I want to know like it feels to me like since covid The adoption has actually increased in like a meaningful like an exponential growth not linear growth Like there are more and more parents that actually are ready now for the things everybody's been talking about But I could be wrong like all these esa policy changes that could be innovators getting too far ahead of their skis and the market Might not be ready for it yet.

I don't know. I'd love your take I'm like, where are we on that adoption curve

**Michael:** Yeah, it's a great question. My guess is that it's more like 10 million students or so are actively taking advantage of choice options and the number would be higher if you consider [00:02:00] the fact that like families like mine can move to almost any locale in the country. Um, and therefore we have a choice at that level. So, you know, if you counted it that way, it's like, Probably 25 million. But let's say 10 million or so, I think, are taking advantage of some form of choice. I don't think they're unbundling, right? And doing the more radical forms of choice or permeability, shall we call it, right?

Where I'm in, I'm moving, and then, you know, Right. Like that's, I think that's much, much lower. Homeschooling populations, probably, you know, 4 million or something like that. So it's, it's, but let's call it 5 million.

I agree. It has upticked significantly since COVID. I think that broke, even though a lot of people rushed back to normal, some larger subset said, wait a second, we can do things differently. And so it unleashed a force. I think the ESA movement is fundamentally different in very important respects from vouchers.

Which is to say a [00:03:00] voucher is like a ticket for one thing. It's still one size fits all at some level. And ESA is like, here's a bunch of money. How do you want to distribute it across a bunch of options? And if you save, that's okay cause it spills over to next year and increases your options then.

Right. It's a very different, I think, mindset and so forth. So I, you know, when the wall street journal, like in their news section calls it a voucher, I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's different, and the difference, I think, matters, in my view. I think they're extremely like grassroots politically popular.

Not in the RD sort of divide of the world. Right. But like on the ground with actual families, I think they're extremely popular. I think the big question in terms of the, are we getting out ahead of it?

  

**Michael:** And I'm worried about this is like, I don't think the supply side, the demand, I think is growing finally the supply side in terms of a real marketplace of different options that are sustainable.

I don't think that's at the maturity that it needs to be.

  

### Talking Points

- The Illusion of One-Size-Fits-All  
    "One size fits all never made sense. It was never the right way to educate kids or serve families. It worked for a number of decades because the expectations were such that it sort of stayed in line, but it wasn't really the way to optimize learning or development or opportunity."
- The Breaking Point  
    "The system has been breaking for the last several decades. And parents increasingly are not putting up with one size fits all. They're making lots of different choices."
- ESAs vs. Vouchers  
    "The ESA movement is fundamentally different from vouchers. A voucher is like a ticket for one thing. It's still one size fits all at some level. An ESA is like, here's a bunch of money. How do you want to distribute it across a bunch of options?"
- The Challenge of Sustainable Innovation  
    "I don't think the supply side, in terms of a real marketplace of different options that are sustainable, is at the maturity it needs to be. I've seen a lot of micro schools and other options that don't feel like they have sustainable business models past year two or three."
- The Power of Social Trust in Education Choices  
    "To your point, Isaac, distributing funds is straightforward, but encouraging families to spend it is challenging. It requires social trust and recommendations and sort of guidance. Not in a top-down way, but like a very bottom-up social trust way."
- The Hidden Curriculum  
    "We talk about teamwork all the time. That's a big buzz phrase in education, building teamwork. Like we need to build team skills. We don't actually talk about how you run a meeting in a good place, how you do project management, how you coordinate team members."
- Rethinking Social Entrepreneurship  
    "I think we do ourselves a disservice by having social entrepreneurs versus just regular entrepreneurs. Building a business is helping someone make progress in some meaningful way."
- The Value of Paid Services in Education  
    "The clearest signal someone really values you is that they're willing to spend money against it. You don't have to be afraid of that. Like, that's actually a very clear signal you're doing something amazing for them."
- The Need for Better Education Marketplaces  
    "I totally agree. I think like I've made the argument to my friend Joe Connor who runs Odyssey, that ultimately I think he's going to become the guidance function because he's going to have to have a way to represent value in varied ways, because people are not going to be thinking about what value is in a monolithic way."
- The Challenge of Context in Education Reviews  
    "My wife used to say she works in the food and hospitality industries industry and she hates Yelp because she was like, well someone reviews the Thai restaurant poorly or well like... Do they have my sense of what Thai food is? Do they have my taste buds? Do they have my expectations? I have no idea."

  

## Blog: The Great Unbundling: Why Education is Ripe for Disruption

It’s 2024. You can customize everything from your coffee order to your car's playlist. So why are kids still stuck in a one-size-fits-all classroom?

Imagine if Amazon only sold one product, or if Netflix had just one show. Sounds ridiculous, but that's how we've been doing education for the past century.

Our recent podcast with Michael Horn started the same way most conversations about education have since Sir Ken Robinson's iconic 2006 TED talk: the education system has been breaking for a long time.

"My perception," Horn began, "is that one-size-fits-all was never the right way to educate kids or serve families."

Yet despite near universal agreement on the problem, the solution has been more elusive.

Horn, co-founder of the Clayton Christensen Institute and author of "From Reopen to Reinvent" and "Choosing College," argues that while change is coming, the current system isn't going to disappear overnight.

Many well-intentioned reformers have tried to fix education through top-down, system-wide changes. They propose sweeping policies, implement new standardized tests, or introduce technology into classrooms _en masse_. But time and again, these efforts fall short.

Why?

As Horn explains, "Public schools are part of a complex value network involving regulators, voters, parents, teachers, unions, and more."

This intricate web of stakeholders and interests makes the system resistant to change. Horn's mentor, Clayton Christensen (the "jobs to be done" guru), might say that schools fulfill a specific job for society – equal parts education and babysitting.

"Transforming an existing system is so hard," Horn notes, "because new ideas that don't fit into the established processes and priorities are often rejected."

So, dramatic changes are met with resistance, and the fundamental structure of education remains unchanged.

## The Great Unbundling

Instead of trying to overhaul the entire system at once, Horn argues for what he calls an “unbundling" of education. This approach recognizes that meaningful change often comes from outside the existing system, in a more piecemeal fashion.

Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) are one of the main drivers of this unbundling. These programs, now available in at least 14 states, grant families a scholarship for a variety of educational options.

"My guess is around 10 million students or so are actively taking advantage of choice options," Horn estimates.

However, most families start by spending ESA dollars on traditional private schools, so the true unbundling happens gradually.

As Horn explains, "The longer students remain in the program, the share of ESA funds devoted to private school tuition decreases while expenditure shares increase for curriculum, instruction, tutoring, and specialized services." In other words, families must _learn_ to customize their children's education, a process that typically unfolds gradually over time.

While data from most ESA programs shows that about 90% of funds still go to a single provider—typically private schools—Utah is bucking this trend. The forecast for Utah suggests that only 50% of ESA funds will go to single providers, indicating a much higher rate of customization and unbundling.

Matt Bowman, founder of OpenEd, attributes this difference to his organization's long-standing presence in the state. As he puts it, "My Tech High—OpenEd now—has been around for 15 years, showing that there's a way to 'à la carte' your child's education."

By demonstrating the viability and benefits of personalized, flexible education options for over a decade, OpenEd has primed Utah families to utilize ESAs from the start.

## Not Your Grandfather’s “School Choice”

The distinction between ESAs and traditional vouchers is crucial here. While vouchers typically offer a substitute one-size-fits-all solution, ESAs provide the flexibility for true customization. However, as Horn points out, this customizability is only valuable if there's a vibrant marketplace of options for families to choose from.

"We need to focus on creating entirely new systems," Horn argues, "rather than trying to transform the existing ones." This means building a robust ecosystem of educational providers, resources, and models that can cater to diverse needs without demanding the full-time parent-as-teacher presence often associated with traditional homeschooling.

Yet, it's important to acknowledge that for many families, the current system is working well enough. The frictions involved in customizing education—researching options, coordinating schedules, managing multiple providers—can make it unattractive to those who are basically satisfied with traditional schools. As Horn notes, "We shouldn't expect an unbundling of school to happen en masse or right away."

The path forward, then, is not about forcing change, but about creating opportunities for those who seek them. It's about building sustainable, innovative models like OpenEd that can serve as examples and catalysts. As more families see these alternatives in action, the "Great Unbundling" of education will continue to unfold—not as a sudden revolution, but as a gradual evolution towards a more personalized, flexible future of learning.

You're Galileo trying to convince people why they shouldn't burn you at the stake.

I don't think we've spent enough time thinking about real sustainable models.

But on the other side, I think there's been a lot of hesitancy... It's too big. They started with used books only. Or Airbnb—if they were like, 'You can rent anything from anybody.'

### Introduction and Welcome [00:00:00]

**Matt:** Welcome to this edition of the OpenEd podcast. We're excited to have you join us. Our guest today is Michael Horn, one of the world's most respected thought leaders in education. Michael has a long and impressive bio, but in essence, he's deeply involved in every aspect of education.

I'd like to give a special shout-out to his most recent book, "From Reopen to Reinvent," which features My Tech High, now OpenEd, as one of the highlighted providers. Thank you, Michael, for joining us today. We're really looking forward to our conversation.

**Michael:** It's great to be with you guys. I was chuckling at your introduction, Matt. You said "one of the most respected" and so on. I'd say I'm most respected in your corner of the world, but I'm not exactly wandering the halls of Congress anytime soon. So who knows?

**Isaac:** Matt, which page was it that My Tech High was mentioned in the book?

**Michael:** You guys are mentioned a few times in there.

**Isaac:** Matt probably knows exactly which page it first appears on. That's how excited we are to be chatting with you.

### Michael Horn's Recent Book and Personal Connection [00:45]

**Matt:** We're so glad to have you, Michael. Let me share a personal story that you might not even remember. Back in 2015, I had been running My Tech High, now OpenEd, for several years and reading everything you were writing. I thought, "I've got to chat with this guy somehow." So I responded to one of your blog posts, challenging something you said. You actually responded, and I was incredibly impressed by that. We ended up having a dialogue, and I've been honored to be connected with you ever since.

What I shared was that our model had been following the disruptive innovation cycle to a T. We found non-consumers of the public education system, i.e., homeschoolers. We then innovated around the edges of regulation, without crossing legal boundaries. We predicted that regulators would attempt to catch up and edit regulations, even if they weren't changing the law. All of those things were in your disruptive innovation cycle. I thought it was fascinating that you nailed it so precisely.

**Michael:** I had forgotten about that specific interaction, but I remember because I always loved engaging with people who gave earnest pushback in comments. That's how you learn, right? If someone's just being a jerk, I'm not going to read that. But I remember, I think I was testifying in Utah - or maybe it was some conference in Utah. I'm just recalling now. I've been in some state legislatures, but you came up to me at the conference and said, "We are doing this, look at what we're doing." And I was like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah." Then I've obviously learned a lot more about you all in the years since.

I agree that not just in the K-12 system, but through college and into employment, you all are truly rethinking what I would argue is the value network of what it means to get educated in this day and age. It's a very different world from the 1930s when there were a lot more middle-class jobs that didn't require advanced learning.

### Discussion on Education Models [03:34]

**Matt:** So, Michael, tell us more about what you're seeing these days.

**Michael:** My perception, and you guys are much closer to it because you're educating the families, is that one size fits all never made sense. It was never the right way to educate kids or serve families. It worked for a number of decades because the expectations were such that it sort of stayed in line, but it wasn't really the way to optimize learning or development or opportunity.

The system has been breaking for the last several decades. And then, my perception is that parents increasingly are not putting up with one size fits all. They're saying, "We are making choices." They're making lots of different choices.

Some of them are going to the micro school for everything.

Some are going to an independent school for everything.

Some are going to a charter.

Some of them, increasingly, I think, are starting to say, "We'll take a little bit from here. We'll go here for the sports. We'll take this tutor," and they're cobbling it together.

### Parental Choices in Education [04:39]

**Michael:** I think a lot of people are worried about the transaction costs on parents. I am too, but I think parents have always dealt with this stress in coordinating after-school activities, figuring out who's gonna care for their kid in summer, and so forth. So I think it's less of an add-on than we think.

And frankly, to your point, policy is starting to catch up in some meaningful ways.

Somewhere between 13 and 19 states now have education savings accounts type policies (ESAs). I think it's very significant. You obviously have figured out how to partner with districts and help them stand up alternative schooling options in some pretty neat ways. My belief is that this competitive pressure is a good thing because districts are going to have to find increasing ways to offer a portfolio of options and get out of the one-size-fits-all mindset.

### Adoption Curve in Education [06:18]

**Isaac:** Michael, you're probably the best person I can think of to ask this question. I would love your take on where we are on the adoption curve. For decades, if you say "Oh the education system is too rigid. It's too confining. It constrains curiosity," everyone agrees. But then all these innovators come out there and say "here's this new model, here's this new thing."

They tried to do vouchers back in the 90s and either if it's a private alternative, they never get that much scale, or even if it's a policy change, it seems pretty limited. I heard a stat, I don't know if this is true, that there's 47 million students in the U.S. that have access to some kind of school choice program or another, and only 1 million of those are actually taking advantage of it.

It feels to me like since COVID, the adoption has actually increased in a meaningful way - like an exponential growth, not linear growth. There are more and more parents that actually are ready now for the things everybody's been talking about. But I could be wrong - all these ESA policy changes could be innovators getting too far ahead of their skis and the market might not be ready for it yet. What's your take on where we are on that adoption curve?

### Challenges in Education Innovation [07:32]

**Michael:** It's a great question. Here are a couple of thoughts:

My estimate is that about 10 million students are actively taking advantage of choice options. That number could be higher—possibly 25 million—if you factor in families like mine who can choose where to live based on school districts. But let's stick with 10 million as a conservative figure.

Now, these 10 million aren't necessarily "unbundling" their education. They're not engaging in the more radical forms of choice or what we might call "permeability"—moving fluidly between different educational options. The group doing that is smaller, probably closer to the homeschooling population of about 4 million.

COVID has significantly accelerated this trend. While many rushed back to "normal," a substantial subset realized, "Wait a second, we can do things differently. And it's kind of awesome."

The ESA movement is fundamentally different from vouchers, and that's important. A voucher is essentially a ticket for one thing—it's still one-size-fits-all to some degree. An ESA, on the other hand, says, "Here's a pool of money. How do you want to distribute it across various options?" If you don't use it all, it rolls over to the next year, expanding your future choices. It's a very different mindset.

### Supply and Demand in Education [10:25]

**Michael:** I think the big question in terms of "are we getting out ahead of it?"—and I'm worried about this—is that I don't think the supply side is at the maturity it needs to be. The demand, I think, is growing. But in terms of a real marketplace of different options that are sustainable? I don't think we're there yet.

I say that because I've seen a lot of micro schools and other options that don't feel like they have sustainable business models past year two or three. It's often teachers saying, "I'll volunteer for a year." But that's not what we want. We want you to make a living doing this, to have it work out for mutual benefit for everyone.

I don't think we've spent enough time thinking about real sustainable models. This has to be bottom-up, not top-down, but I don't think there's been enough focus on building models that can last.

### Microschools and ESA Policies [13:56]

**Matt:** I just want to add a couple thoughts. The Wall Street Journal comment around ESAs being just vouchers—what's interesting is that the data from these ESA providers shows that still 90% of ESAs are going to a single provider: private school.

Except the forecast in Utah is 50%. People in the market are projecting Utah's usage to be 50% because My Tech High—OpenEd now—has been around for 15 years, showing that there's a way to "à la carte" your child's education.

I find it fascinating that as other states adopt ESAs, and even you've said it in articles, the adoption over time goes from a single-payer voucher to an à la carte model. We see that happen over years of an ESA, and Utah's ESA just started August 7th. It's the first in the market right now, and they're projecting people are going to use it more à la carte than any other state.

**Michael:** That's tremendous, Matt. I didn't realize that. The evidence, I think, is supporting the idea more broadly. I agree with the 90% number, but if you look at Florida, I think it's now down to 70% or something like that. So more people are realizing they can break this up, fracture it, and fractionalize it in different ways.

It's something you see in all markets, right? People are initially not aware of how they want to customize things. Think about the Henry Ford Model T—any color as long as it's black. That's great, it's an automobile. But then people start to become aware. "Oh, I want a different color. Oh, I want a different seating arrangement." Suddenly, choice becomes more viable as consumers get more experience with it.

### Vendor Side of Education Marketplaces [17:58]

**Isaac:** You know, it's funny that the vendor side, the provider side, I think is a little bit overlooked. There's this idea that if we pass an ESA, then boom, the market's open and all these providers will flood in. But this is a two-sided marketplace, and any two-sided marketplace faces the cold start problem.

In this case, it's not too hard to get the parents and students because you're basically just offering to give them money. That's a really easy thing to sell. But on the other side, I think there's been a lot of hesitancy.

If you go look at most of the existing ESA marketplaces—and that's probably an overly generous term—it's usually just literally a list of text with hyperlinks to different providers. There's very little marketplace functionality, but it's also just too broad.

Can you imagine if Amazon from day one was like, "We're the everything store. Literally everything you want can be bought and sold on our platform. Go ahead, vendors, start listing stuff." It's too big. They started with used books only. Or Airbnb—if they were like, "You can rent anything from anybody." No, it was just rooms in a house. It wasn't lawnmowers and kitchen utensils.

### The Importance of Niching Down in Education [21:51]

**Michael:** This is a crucial point because markets and investments thrive on certainty. Out School, as you know, conducted research through their foundation, entering various markets and essentially giving away money.

To Isaac's point, distributing funds is straightforward, but encouraging families to spend it is challenging. It requires social trust, recommendations, and guidance—not in a top-down manner, which often raises red flags, but through grassroots social trust. It's about families saying, "Oh, that provider is trustworthy, and you've used them? Alright, I'll give it a try."

This process takes time. You're correct in saying it's more effective when the initial scope is narrow. It becomes comprehensible and digestible. As Clayton Christensen would say, it solves one job to be done, not millions. If something claims to solve a myriad of problems, it's likely solving none effectively.

### Challenges of Nonprofits in Education [24:18]

**Michael:** Having run the Christiansen Institute, a nonprofit, for a decade, I've seen firsthand how challenging this sector can be. It's often death by a thousand cuts. One funder initiates this program, another starts that program, and suddenly you're juggling numerous initiatives without a cohesive strategic direction.

It's tempting to say, "Of course we should do that. How could we not help that one child?" But sometimes, the best course of action is to recognize that a child might be better served elsewhere. Our greatest service might be saying, "We're not the right fit, but let us help you find the appropriate resource," and being comfortable with saying no.

We struggle with this approach. Here's an unpopular opinion: I believe we do ourselves a disservice by distinguishing between social entrepreneurs and regular entrepreneurs.

**Isaac:** Amen.

**Michael:** At its core, building a business is about helping someone make meaningful progress. By creating a separate category for social entrepreneurship, we inadvertently invite the very problem you've described.

### The Value of Private Pay Options [26:44]

**Matt:** That's a fascinating perspective. Isaac, you've expanded my viewpoint on this. You suggested we should have some private pay options, and I see the merit. It's an effective way to get immediate feedback on quality and accountability. When services are free and lack that financial buy-in, we miss out on a valuable feedback loop that can drive higher standards for teachers and curriculum.

**Michael:** It might feel counterintuitive in education, but a clear indicator that someone truly values your service is their willingness to pay for it. I shared this perspective with another nonprofit CEO about a year ago. I told them, "You don't need to fear charging for your services. It's a strong signal that you're providing something valuable. If people aren't willing to pay, do they really have enough skin in the game to follow through with what you're trying to help them achieve? I have my doubts."

### The Role of Ratings and Reviews in Education [27:54]

**Matt:** This ties into the ESA marketplace we were discussing earlier. We're missing out on the ratings and reviews that Amazon has mastered. Almost nobody buys anything on Amazon without looking at the ratings and reviews. In the ESA marketplaces, we haven't seen that yet, and I really think that's a crucial missing piece. What are your thoughts on that, Michael?

**Michael:** I completely agree. I've made this argument to my friend Joe Connor, who runs Odyssey, one of these ESA transaction platforms. I've suggested that ultimately, he's going to need to become the guidance function because he'll need a way to represent value. I hesitate to use the word "quality," but let's say "value" in varied ways, because people aren't going to think about value in a monolithic way.

In some ways, he's going to have to innovate beyond what Amazon or Yelp have done. He'll need to give texture to what a service is helping accomplish and whether it's succeeding. I think we're going to need more of this kind of feedback system. And I believe it should be a very bottom-up solution to help reduce friction, increase transaction volume, and create good matches on these platforms.

**Matt:** That is the challenge because sometimes we'll get feedback from parents that say, "Hey, my child loves ALEKS math," or "My child doesn't love ALEKS math." Parents ask, "Well, what's the difference? Describe your child."

So now it needs context in this ratings and review system of what type of child was using this. Then, you know, based on that, it was a 4 out of 5 for this type of child, but a 1 out of 5 for this other type of child, and that's complex.

### The ‘Who Economy’ in Education [30:19]

**Isaac:** This conversation reminds me of my experience in the B2B SaaS startup world. We had a podcast where we explored the concept of the "Infocalypse" - there's too much information out there, and trust in typical sales and marketing tactics is breaking down.

We interviewed the founder of Trust Radius, a software review site. He shared fascinating insights about the limitations of traditional review systems. Other sites like G2 suffer from what we call "4.7 star syndrome." Everyone has figured out how to game the system. If you have 5 stars, it looks fake. If you have less than 4.7, you don't look good. So everybody aims for 4.7, and the ratings lose meaning.

Trust Radius found that the aggregate score of a tool is about 50 times less important to buyers than who the rating comes from. If you're a CFO trying to buy financial software, you don't want to just see an overall rating. You want to know what a CFO of a similarly sized company thinks of that software.

We've moved from a "how economy" to a "who economy." People don't ask, "How do I solve this?" They ask, "Who like me has solved this already that I can go to for help?"

This is why it's so hard to sell into the homeschool market. It's the definition of the who economy. It's all word-of-mouth networks. I've moved to five different states and plugged in as a new homeschooler in every one of them. It takes a couple of years before you discover all the opportunities because it's all just word-of-mouth networks.

Trying to combine the trust built in that one-to-one, who-do-you-know sense and scale it onto some kind of digital distribution is a really unique challenge that we'll start to see solved.

**Michael:** I totally agree with everything you said. Understanding the situation and circumstance is critical. We need to combat against that while creating social trust in the interim. That's what you just said, right? It took you two years to build that trust.

It's interesting to hear those reflections because I've said similar things without the depth of experience you've had. Two companies trying to sell into the homeschool space... But word of mouth and trust is very deep. People can hear, "Oh, that's how they thought about it. This does or doesn't reflect my situation, what I'm trying to accomplish. I will or won't take that recommendation."

### The Hidden Curriculum: Equipping Kids with Essential Skills & Habits of Success [34:09]

**Isaac:** I want to get some advice for parents from you because you are a parent yourself. You have kids. You've written some really interesting stuff about what you call the hidden curriculum, which I think is just so cool.

It's like, what are the things that you are learning maybe without even consciously knowing it? The environment that school puts you in, you learn what's explicitly taught, but you also learn other things. Some of them are not necessarily useful things in the market, like that there's one right answer, or you have to wait until somebody tells you what to do for innovation.

But you mentioned things specifically like project management, networking, understanding professional norms. I could go on rants about that for a long time when it comes to hiring young people. These are ways of building social capital that aren't ever explicitly taught, but that are probably more important than how well you do in algebra.

This kind of hidden curriculum, how do you recommend parents think about this and help equip their kids? How do you try to equip your own kids with these kinds of social capital, emotional intelligence type of skills?

**Michael:** You've just made it more relevant. You've made the skill much less opaque. It's clear what we're actually trying to convey here and why we're trying to convey it. Okay, you did it there. Now let's do it on some other domain. Let's transfer because we want you to build the skills so you can take it to different places.

That's valuable. Ideally, you're doing that starting with some real-world projects and you're then moving into an argument about the political landscape and then something about history. You can move around. You're Galileo trying to convince people why they shouldn't burn you at the stake. I don't care, but you're trying to build this skill set and we're trying to make it clearer about, "Hey, that's not gonna land well, put yourself in the other person's position, why did this argument fall flat?" Well, when you lead off with, "Listen to me," or whatever else, turns out that doesn't work.

### The Benefits of Youth Entrepreneurship [45:07]

**Matt:** Well, that's where I just need to give a plug for my passion around young entrepreneurship. I really think that having children dabble and experience with starting businesses at a very young age, even if it's our children went around and sold pumpkins out of a wagon that we had from our garden. Those skills just starting to think like an entrepreneur have always been the bedrock of My Tech High and now OpenEd.

Youth who apply entrepreneurship principles will learn so many other skills that they don't - those of the hidden curriculum - because entrepreneurship just draws those out naturally. And you realize what you don't know. You now need someone to write a marketing flyer for you, or you need someone to code your backend, or you need someone to go manage your finances. It creates this interdisciplinary group that is natural versus forced. So that's why I really love geeking out on entrepreneurship for kids.

**Isaac:** What a mic drop moment to end on. This has been so much fun. Michael, so glad you were able to come on and join us.

**Michael:** Yeah, a total blast. Love what you guys keep doing for kids and schools, and frankly, learning ecosystems around and at all levels. Cause like that, you know, when Matt came to me, it was like, we're reinventing college. And I was like, "Whoa, this is cool." So I love what y'all are about, what you're doing and where it's going to go.

**Isaac:** Keep up the good work. We'll see everybody next time on the OpenEd podcast.

**Matt:** Thanks.

My estimate is that about 10 million students are actively taking advantage of choice options. That number could be higher—possibly 25 million—if you factor in families like mine who can choose where to live based on school districts. But let's stick with 10 million as a conservative figure.

Now, these 10 million aren't necessarily "unbundling" their education. They're not engaging in the more radical forms of choice or what we might call "permeability"—moving fluidly between different educational options. The group doing that is smaller, probably closer to the homeschooling population of about 4 million.

COVID has significantly accelerated this trend. While many rushed back to "normal," a substantial subset realized, "Wait a second, we can do things differently. And it's kind of awesome."

The ESA movement is fundamentally different from vouchers, and that's important. A voucher is essentially a ticket for one thing—it's still one-size-fits-all to some degree. An ESA, on the other hand, says, "Here's a pool of money. How do you want to distribute it across various options?" If you don't use it all, it rolls over to the next year, expanding your future choices. It's a very different mindset.

### Supply and Demand in Education [10:25]

**Michael:** I think the big question in terms of "are we getting out ahead of it?"—and I'm worried about this—is that I don't think the supply side is at the maturity it needs to be. The demand, I think, is growing. But in terms of a real marketplace of different options that are sustainable? I don't think we're there yet.

I say that because I've seen a lot of micro schools and other options that don't feel like they have sustainable business models past year two or three. It's often teachers saying, "I'll volunteer for a year." But that's not what we want. We want you to make a living doing this, to have it work out for mutual benefit for everyone.

I don't think we've spent enough time thinking about real sustainable models. This has to be bottom-up, not top-down, but I don't think there's been enough focus on building models that can last.

### Microschools and ESA Policies [13:56]

**Matt:** I just want to add a couple thoughts. The Wall Street Journal comment around ESAs being just vouchers—what's interesting is that the data from these ESA providers shows that still 90% of ESAs are going to a single provider: private school.

Except the forecast in Utah is 50%. People in the market are projecting Utah's usage to be 50% because My Tech High—OpenEd now—has been around for 15 years, showing that there's a way to "à la carte" your child's education.

I find it fascinating that as other states adopt ESAs, and even you've said it in articles, the adoption over time goes from a single-payer voucher to an à la carte model. We see that happen over years of an ESA, and Utah's ESA just started August 7th. It's the first in the market right now, and they're projecting people are going to use it more à la carte than any other state.

**Michael:** That's tremendous, Matt. I didn't realize that. The evidence, I think, is supporting the idea more broadly. I agree with the 90% number, but if you look at Florida, I think it's now down to 70% or something like that. So more people are realizing they can break this up, fracture it, and fractionalize it in different ways.

It's something you see in all markets, right? People are initially not aware of how they want to customize things. Think about the Henry Ford Model T—any color as long as it's black. That's great, it's an automobile. But then people start to become aware. "Oh, I want a different color. Oh, I want a different seating arrangement." Suddenly, choice becomes more viable as consumers get more experience with it.

### Vendor Side of Education Marketplaces [17:58]

**Isaac:** You know, it's funny that the vendor side, the provider side, I think is a little bit overlooked. There's this idea that if we pass an ESA, then boom, the market's open and all these providers will flood in. But this is a two-sided marketplace, and any two-sided marketplace faces the cold start problem.

In this case, it's not too hard to get the parents and students because you're basically just offering to give them money. That's a really easy thing to sell. But on the other side, I think there's been a lot of hesitancy.

If you go look at most of the existing ESA marketplaces—and that's probably an overly generous term—it's usually just literally a list of text with hyperlinks to different providers. There's very little marketplace functionality, but it's also just too broad.

Can you imagine if Amazon from day one was like, "We're the everything store. Literally everything you want can be bought and sold on our platform. Go ahead, vendors, start listing stuff." It's too big. They started with used books only. Or Airbnb—if they were like, "You can rent anything from anybody." No, it was just rooms in a house. It wasn't lawnmowers and kitchen utensils.

### The Importance of Niching Down in Education [21:51]

**Michael:** This is a crucial point because markets and investments thrive on certainty. Out School, as you know, conducted research through their foundation, entering various markets and essentially giving away money.

To Isaac's point, distributing funds is straightforward, but encouraging families to spend it is challenging. It requires social trust, recommendations, and guidance—not in a top-down manner, which often raises red flags, but through grassroots social trust. It's about families saying, "Oh, that provider is trustworthy, and you've used them? Alright, I'll give it a try."

This process takes time. You're correct in saying it's more effective when the initial scope is narrow. It becomes comprehensible and digestible. As Clayton Christensen would say, it solves one job to be done, not millions. If something claims to solve a myriad of problems, it's likely solving none effectively.

### Challenges of Nonprofits in Education [24:18]

**Michael:** Having run the Christiansen Institute, a nonprofit, for a decade, I've seen firsthand how challenging this sector can be. It's often death by a thousand cuts. One funder initiates this program, another starts that program, and suddenly you're juggling numerous initiatives without a cohesive strategic direction.

It's tempting to say, "Of course we should do that. How could we not help that one child?" But sometimes, the best course of action is to recognize that a child might be better served elsewhere. Our greatest service might be saying, "We're not the right fit, but let us help you find the appropriate resource," and being comfortable with saying no.

We struggle with this approach. Here's an unpopular opinion: I believe we do ourselves a disservice by distinguishing between social entrepreneurs and regular entrepreneurs.

**Isaac:** Amen.

**Michael:** At its core, building a business is about helping someone make meaningful progress. By creating a separate category for social entrepreneurship, we inadvertently invite the very problem you've described.

### The Value of Private Pay Options [26:44]

**Matt:** That's a fascinating perspective. Isaac, you've expanded my viewpoint on this. You suggested we should have some private pay options, and I see the merit. It's an effective way to get immediate feedback on quality and accountability. When services are free and lack that financial buy-in, we miss out on a valuable feedback loop that can drive higher standards for teachers and curriculum.

**Michael:** It might feel counterintuitive in education, but a clear indicator that someone truly values your service is their willingness to pay for it. I shared this perspective with another nonprofit CEO about a year ago. I told them, "You don't need to fear charging for your services. It's a strong signal that you're providing something valuable. If people aren't willing to pay, do they really have enough skin in the game to follow through with what you're trying to help them achieve? I have my doubts."

### The Role of Ratings and Reviews in Education [27:54]

**Matt:** This ties into the ESA marketplace we were discussing earlier. We're missing out on the ratings and reviews that Amazon has mastered. Almost nobody buys anything on Amazon without looking at the ratings and reviews. In the ESA marketplaces, we haven't seen that yet, and I really think that's a crucial missing piece. What are your thoughts on that, Michael?

**Michael:** I completely agree. I've made this argument to my friend Joe Connor, who runs Odyssey, one of these ESA transaction platforms. I've suggested that ultimately, he's going to need to become the guidance function because he'll need a way to represent value. I hesitate to use the word "quality," but let's say "value" in varied ways, because people aren't going to think about value in a monolithic way.

In some ways, he's going to have to innovate beyond what Amazon or Yelp have done. He'll need to give texture to what a service is helping accomplish and whether it's succeeding. I think we're going to need more of this kind of feedback system. And I believe it should be a very bottom-up solution to help reduce friction, increase transaction volume, and create good matches on these platforms.

**Matt:** That is the challenge because sometimes we'll get feedback from parents that say, "Hey, my child loves ALEKS math," or "My child doesn't love ALEKS math." Parents ask, "Well, what's the difference? Describe your child."

So now it needs context in this ratings and review system of what type of child was using this. Then, you know, based on that, it was a 4 out of 5 for this type of child, but a 1 out of 5 for this other type of child, and that's complex.

### The ‘Who Economy’ in Education [30:19]

**Isaac:** This conversation reminds me of my experience in the B2B SaaS startup world. We had a podcast where we explored the concept of the "Infocalypse" - there's too much information out there, and trust in typical sales and marketing tactics is breaking down.

We interviewed the founder of Trust Radius, a software review site. He shared fascinating insights about the limitations of traditional review systems. Other sites like G2 suffer from what we call "4.7 star syndrome." Everyone has figured out how to game the system. If you have 5 stars, it looks fake. If you have less than 4.7, you don't look good. So everybody aims for 4.7, and the ratings lose meaning.

Trust Radius found that the aggregate score of a tool is about 50 times less important to buyers than who the rating comes from. If you're a CFO trying to buy financial software, you don't want to just see an overall rating. You want to know what a CFO of a similarly sized company thinks of that software.

We've moved from a "how economy" to a "who economy." People don't ask, "How do I solve this?" They ask, "Who like me has solved this already that I can go to for help?"

This is why it's so hard to sell into the homeschool market. It's the definition of the who economy. It's all word-of-mouth networks. I've moved to five different states and plugged in as a new homeschooler in every one of them. It takes a couple of years before you discover all the opportunities because it's all just word-of-mouth networks.

Trying to combine the trust built in that one-to-one, who-do-you-know sense and scale it onto some kind of digital distribution is a really unique challenge that we'll start to see solved.

**Michael:** I totally agree with everything you said. Understanding the situation and circumstance is critical. We need to combat against that while creating social trust in the interim. That's what you just said, right? It took you two years to build that trust.

It's interesting to hear those reflections because I've said similar things without the depth of experience you've had. Two companies trying to sell into the homeschool space... But word of mouth and trust is very deep. People can hear, "Oh, that's how they thought about it. This does or doesn't reflect my situation, what I'm trying to accomplish. I will or won't take that recommendation."

### The Hidden Curriculum: Equipping Kids with Essential Skills & Habits of Success [34:09]

**Isaac:** I want to get some advice for parents from you because you are a parent yourself. You have kids. You've written some really interesting stuff about what you call the hidden curriculum, which I think is just so cool.

It's like, what are the things that you are learning maybe without even consciously knowing it? The environment that school puts you in, you learn what's explicitly taught, but you also learn other things. Some of them are not necessarily useful things in the market, like that there's one right answer, or you have to wait until somebody tells you what to do for innovation.

But you mentioned things specifically like project management, networking, understanding professional norms. I could go on rants about that for a long time when it comes to hiring young people. These are ways of building social capital that aren't ever explicitly taught, but that are probably more important than how well you do in algebra.

This kind of hidden curriculum, how do you recommend parents think about this and help equip their kids? How do you try to equip your own kids with these kinds of social capital, emotional intelligence type of skills?

**Michael:** You've just made it more relevant. You've made the skill much less opaque. It's clear what we're actually trying to convey here and why we're trying to convey it. Okay, you did it there. Now let's do it on some other domain. Let's transfer because we want you to build the skills so you can take it to different places.

That's valuable. Ideally, you're doing that starting with some real-world projects and you're then moving into an argument about the political landscape and then something about history. You can move around. You're Galileo trying to convince people why they shouldn't burn you at the stake. I don't care, but you're trying to build this skill set and we're trying to make it clearer about, "Hey, that's not gonna land well, put yourself in the other person's position, why did this argument fall flat?" Well, when you lead off with, "Listen to me," or whatever else, turns out that doesn't work.

### The Benefits of Youth Entrepreneurship [45:07]

**Matt:** Well, that's where I just need to give a plug for my passion around young entrepreneurship. I really think that having children dabble and experience with starting businesses at a very young age, even if it's our children went around and sold pumpkins out of a wagon that we had from our garden. Those skills just starting to think like an entrepreneur have always been the bedrock of My Tech High and now OpenEd.

Youth who apply entrepreneurship principles will learn so many other skills that they don't - those of the hidden curriculum - because entrepreneurship just draws those out naturally. And you realize what you don't know. You now need someone to write a marketing flyer for you, or you need someone to code your backend, or you need someone to go manage your finances. It creates this interdisciplinary group that is natural versus forced. So that's why I really love geeking out on entrepreneurship for kids.

**Isaac:** What a mic drop moment to end on. This has been so much fun. Michael, so glad you were able to come on and join us.

**Michael:** Yeah, a total blast. Love what you guys keep doing for kids and schools, and frankly, learning ecosystems around and at all levels. Cause like that, you know, when Matt came to me, it was like, we're reinventing college. And I was like, "Whoa, this is cool." So I love what y'all are about, what you're doing and where it's going to go.

**Isaac:** Keep up the good work. We'll see everybody next time on the OpenEd podcast.

**Matt:** Thanks.

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhorn/2023/10/17/as-education-choice-grows-expect-more-school-unbundling-but-no-great-unbundling/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhorn/2023/10/17/as-education-choice-grows-expect-more-school-unbundling-but-no-great-unbundling/)

_**Growth of Education Savings Accounts (ESAs)**_  
"At least 14 states with education savings accounts (ESA) programs that allow families to pay for a variety of educational programs and supports from public funds."

_**Potential for “Unbundling:”**_ ESAs encourage families to consider diverse educational options beyond traditional schooling.  
"As a result, they have lots of incentive to think about cost-quality tradeoffs and to consider a broader universe of education possibilities that transcend schools."

_**Caution Against "Great Unbundling"**_: Horn warns against overstating the impact of ESAs on educational unbundling.  
"But we should be cautious about such grand statements. Good theory on innovation can help us parse out the hype from what's likely to play out."

_**Schools as babysitters?**_ Theory of Interdependence and Modularity  
"To believe that unbundling will occur en masse, one also must believe that schools have overshot what families desire in terms of functionality and reliability."

_**Gradual Change in ESA Usage:**_ Over time, families with ESAs tend to diversify and customize their educational spending MORE. This suggests a learning curve, or adjustment to this new modality.  
"According to a 2021 EdChoice research paper, 'the longer students remain in the program, the share of ESA funds devoted to private school tuition decreases while expenditure shares increase for curriculum, instruction, tutoring, and specialized services.'"

_**Prediction for the Future:**_ A gradual increase in educational unbundling rather than a sudden, widespread shift.  
"My takeaway is that we shouldn't expect an unbundling of school to happen en masse or right away. Instead, we should expect greater unbundling in schooling relative to what we've had."

[https://michaelbhorn.substack.com/p/could-the-us-become-an-apprentice](https://michaelbhorn.substack.com/p/could-the-us-become-an-apprentice)

_**The Apprenticeship Gap:**_ "There are hundreds of sectors in the economy where there are massive talent gaps, where employers cannot find talent and frankly, aren't hiring talent. And conversely, young people who are seeking to launch careers just cannot find a way in effectively."

_**Redefining Entry-Level Work:**_ "AI is going to make it worse because... employers are soon going to expect that all of that work is going to be done, all that menial grunt work is going to be done by AI. And they're going to expect their entry level workers to be doing higher value work from the get-go."

_**Apprenticeships as a Solution:**_ "An apprenticeship, by definition, is a job. It's a full-time job with built in training and career pathways. And so, I think that the way most people, most young people... will launch their careers in a decade, will be through some kind of apprenticeship program."

_**US vs Other Countries:**_ "In terms of apprentices as a percentage of the workforce, we're at 0.3%. Germany is 15 times better than us, so they're at about 4.5% apprentices as a percentage of the workforce."

_**The Role of Intermediaries:**_ "Apprenticeships flourish because there are what we call intermediaries who do the heavy lifting of setting up and running these programs... In the UK today, there are about 1200 intermediaries, which, based on the US economy, would translate into something like 8,000 intermediaries in the US today. ==**We have about 150 in the US today."**==

_**Funding Disparity:**_ "If you actually compare the amount we spend year over year on the post-secondary education or tuition-based debt-based infrastructure that we have to what we're spending on earn-and-learn apprenticeship infrastructure, it's 500 billion annually for tuition-based and under 400 million for earn-and-learn."

_**A Fairer System:**_ "An apprentice nation is one that really provides choice to you... We are more imbalanced than any other developed country in the world in having this sort of maniacal, sole focus on tuition-based, debt-based pathway to getting a good first job."

_**Political Support:**_ "Politically, this is something that I think Democrats and Republicans can get behind... if you look at what the UK has been spending, they were at their peak, they were spending, I think, 4 billion a year. So, ten times what we're spending today for an economy which is significantly smaller."

## Questions and Conversation starters:

1. People talk in terms of a current education "crisis." How can we reframe this as an opportunity for reinvention rather than just reopening?
2. In what ways does the traditional education system reinforce a zero-sum mentality, and how can we shift towards a positive-sum approach?
3. How might we redesign the education system to embrace failure as a step in learning rather than a final destination?
4. In what ways could we reimagine the role of teachers to focus more on mentoring, facilitating, and supporting students rather than just delivering content?
5. How might we incorporate more real-world experiences and project-based learning into the curriculum to better prepare students for the future workforce?
6. What are some strategies for helping parents understand and embrace a more personalized, flexible approach to education?

  

# Topics:

## Social Capital

1. Michael recognizes that social capital - the networks, relationships, and shared understanding that help people navigate systems - is crucial in education and future success.
2. He acknowledges that there's a significant disparity in access to social capital between students from different backgrounds. This is evident when he discusses the "Jeremy" character in his book, who lacks the social connections and understanding that more privileged students might have.
3. He emphasizes that schools need to focus on developing skills like project management, networking, and understanding professional norms - aspects of social capital that are often taken for granted but are crucial for success – teaching not just academic content, but also the "hidden curriculum" of how to navigate professional and academic environments. How can we teach kids to navigate these situations outside of the classroom?

## ”The Great Unbundling”

Arnold Kling writes about “unbundling government” - why do you need to get everything from one centralized provider?

There has been talk of a Great Unbundling in education. Signs are everywhere, but Horn predicts it’s not imminent. It takes time for families to adjust to an OpenEd model. Many parents are still served well by being able to send their kids to school for 6-7 hours per day while they go to work.

Within ESA programs, the longer a parent is in the program, the more likely they are to spend the funds on multiple different things (unbundled) vs. just private school tuition.

> We were seeing more unbundled schooling offerings emerge before the pandemic, but COVID accelerated the interest in these arrangements. More families realized that they had specific preferences for their children’s schooling and have sought customized offerings. But many more families still rely on the bundle and don’t feel like schools are overshooting at all... they feel underserved by schools, and want something better. They might want even more of the bundle—more childcare, more services, more food, more learning.

> More generally, because in the early years of an industry customers are willing to tolerate the product standardization that bundled offerings mandate because customization is prohibitively expensive... People are generally willing to conform their expectations and their behavior to accommodate use of the standard product.

> In other words, because of our nation’s long history with schools, it’s not as obvious to most families (the demand side) or many educational suppliers (the supply side) just how to think about the progress that different students and families desire... and how to ensure that unbundled offerings still lead to a desired level of coherence...

> Said differently, because most kids in America have gone to school for a long time, it’s just easy to keep talking, thinking about, and choosing schools.

> And that’s what it appears most families that have availed themselves of ESA options are still doing: choosing a school first, and then filling in some educational offerings around the margins. But, as families gain more experience with an ESA and the possibilities of unbundling and opportunities for customization, behavior changes.

> In other words, as families gain a deeper understanding of their needs and get more comfortable with customizing their education, they are more willing to unbundle it appears.

## “System Transformation”

[https://michaelbhorn.substack.com/p/why-system-transformation-is-likely?r=4uiv9&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email&triedRedirect=true](https://michaelbhorn.substack.com/p/why-system-transformation-is-likely?r=4uiv9&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email&triedRedirect=true)

This article might lead to a conversation about why change within the system is very difficult, but you can build a pressure valve into the system that makes it more flexible

> I can’t count the number of times people at an education conference have approached me and said something to the effect of, “But how do we transform the education system?” or “We need to focus on system transformation” or “How do we scale system transformation?”

However, Horn is skeptical of the term "system transformation," as he believes that true change rarely results from altering existing systems but rather from creating entirely new ones.

> Foremost among them is this: Despite all the fancy models and white papers around what are all the levers to pull in order to transform a system, system transformation almost never happens by changing the fundamental tenets of the system itself. Instead, it comes from replacing the system with a brand-new system.

Horn explains that public schools are part of a complex value network involving regulators, voters, parents, teachers, unions, and more. He notes that "transforming an existing system is so hard" because new ideas that don't fit into the established processes and priorities are often rejected.

To illustrate his point, Horn recounts the history of the transistor's invention in 1947, which disrupted vacuum tube technology. Companies like Sony succeeded by creating new products that didn't rely on vacuum tubes, thus disrupting the existing value network.

Horn argues that "if we’re serious about wholesale system transformation," we must focus on replacing the current educational system. He acknowledges the difficulty of this task in the U.S., where public schooling is universal and mandatory. Nevertheless, he sees potential in emergent models like microschools and DIY schooling, which operate outside traditional K–12 systems.

Horn suggests that "solutions like mastery-based transcripts and assessments" must be developed as part of a new value network. He advises that stakeholders should be patient for growth but impatient for progress, avoiding one-size-fits-all solutions.

In conclusion, Horn believes public schools can potentially respond by launching autonomous solutions, but he cautions against relying solely on top-down, system-wide transformations. Instead, he advocates for a dual transformation strategy that includes both internal changes and the development of entirely new systems.

# riverside_isaac_raw-synced-video-cfr_opened_podcast_0018 + 2

[00:00:00]

[00:00:00] **Matt:** Hey, everyone, welcome to the, this edition of the open ed podcast. We're super excited to have you. Our guest today is Michael Horn. He is one of the world's most respected thought leaders in education, and he has a long bio, but basically he does everything. And he's thought about everything related education.

[00:00:56] And so we're super excited to have Michael on on with us [00:01:00] today. I've got to do a little shout out for his most recent book, uh, from reopen to reinvent actually spotlights my tech high, which is now open ed, uh, as one of the providers that he spotlights in his, his book. So thank you, Michael, for joining us today.

[00:01:17] Super excited to chat with you. Oh,

[00:01:21] **Michael:** a blast to be with you guys. And I was, I was laughing when you did the intro, you know, you said one of the most respected blah, blah, blah. I'm most respected in like your corner of the world. Right. But I don't know about, you know, where, where, where else, you know, I'm not wandering the halls of Congress anytime soon.

[00:01:36] So, you know, who knows?

[00:01:38] **Isaac:** Matt, uh, what, what page was that, that, uh, my tech guy has mentioned in

[00:01:42] **Michael:** guys are a few page. You guys are a few in there. You guys are a few times in there.

[00:01:47] **Isaac:** Matt knows exactly which page the first, uh, appearances. So that's, um, that's how excited, excited we are to, to be on here and chatting with you. So, well,

[00:01:55] **Matt:** so glad to have you, Michael. And in fact, let me share a personal story that, [00:02:00] uh, I don't even know if you remember, Michael, this was back in 2015, so I had, you know, been running my tech high now, open ed for several years and reading everything that you were writing and I said, I've got to chat with that guy somehow and so I responded to one of your blog posts It's challenging something you said in it and you actually responded.

[00:02:23] And I was so impressed with that. And then we ended up having a dialogue and, uh, I've just been honored to be connected with you ever since. Cause you know, you, I, what I shared was our model has been following the disruptive innovation cycle to a T. We found non consumers of the public ed system, i. e.

[00:02:43] homeschoolers. We then innovated around the edges of regulation, not, you know, not crossing into law. And then we predicted the regulators would attempt to catch up and edit regulations, even if they [00:03:00] weren't changing the law. And so, Like all of those things were in your disruptive innovation cycle. And I thought it's fascinating that you nailed it to a T.

[00:03:08] So,

[00:03:09] **Michael:** No, and I, I mean, I have a, I had forgotten about that one, but I, I remember because I always loved. Engaging with people who gave like earnest pushback and comments. Cause that's how you learn, right? Like if you're just a jerk, that's like, I'm not going to read that. Right. Um, but then I remember, I think actually I was testifying in Utah.

[00:03:29] I could be wrong. It was some conference in Utah. So I I'm just walking back. I've been in some state legislatures, but the, um, and you came up to me at the conference and you were like, We are doing this, like see what we're doing. And I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then I've obviously learned a lot more about you all, uh, in the years since.

[00:03:50] And I agree like you, not just in the K 12 system, but through college and into employment, you all are truly [00:04:00] rethinking, I would argue the value network. Of what it means to get educated in this day and age in a very different world from, you know, the 1930s when there were a lot more middle class jobs that didn't require, uh, advanced learning.

[00:04:16] **Matt:** yeah, that's a good segue. Tell us more about what you're seeing these days, Michael.

[00:04:22] **Isaac:** yeah,

[00:04:23] **Michael:** Yeah. I mean, where, where do you want to go? I think it's a really interesting time because, My perception, and you guys are much closer to it because you're educating the families. But as I look at it, my perception is one size fits all never made sense. It was never the right way to educate kids, serve families, et cetera.

[00:04:41] It worked for a number of decades cause the expectations were such that like it sort of stayed in line, but it wasn't really the way to optimize learning or development or opportunity. And the system has been breaking for the last several decades. And then. My perception is like parents increasingly are not putting up [00:05:00] with one size fits all.

[00:05:01] They're saying we are making choices. They're making lots of different choices, right? Some of them are, we're going to the micro school for everything. We're going, you know, to an independent school for everything. We're going, like, you know, we're going to the charter. Some of them increasingly, I think, are starting to say like, we'll take a little bit from here.

[00:05:18] We'll go here for the sports. We'll take this tutor and cobbling it together. And I think a lot of people are worried about the transaction costs on parents. I am too, but. I think parents have always dealt with this stress in coordinating after school activities, figuring out who's gonna care for their kid summer and so forth.

[00:05:38] And so I think it's less than we think as a, as like an add-on, and parents are acting. And frankly, to your point, policy is starting to catch up I think in some meaningful ways like. You know, depending on how you count it, somewhere between 13 and 19 states now have education savings accounts type policies. It's, I, [00:06:00] I think it's very significant, and You know, you obviously have figured out how to partner with districts, right. And help them stand up, um, alternative schooling options in some pretty neat ways, my belief is that the only way, uh, districts, you know, like this, this competitive pressure is a good thing.

[00:06:21] Cause districts are going to have to find increasing ways to offer a portfolio of options and get out of the one size fits all mindset.

[00:06:28] **Isaac:** you know, Michael, um, you're probably the best person I can think of to ask this question too. I want, I would love your take on. Like where we are on the adoption curve because for decades If you say oh the education system is too rigid. It's too confining. It constrains curiosity You know, ken robinson gave his famous ted talk and it was immediately everybody loved it It's like yes, everyone agrees.

[00:06:53] Nobody's happy. But then all these innovators come out there and say here's this new model here's this new thing they tried to do vouchers [00:07:00] back in the 90s and like Either if it's a if it's a private alternative, they never get that much scale or even if it's a policy change It seems pretty limited. I heard a stat, I don't know if this is true, so you can check me on it, that there's 47 million students in the U S that have access to some kind of school choice program or another, and only 1 million of those are actually.

[00:07:23] Taking advantage of it. And I don't know if that's true, but I wouldn't be shocked if something like that was true. And so there's always been this kind of paradox as somebody who is trying to innovate in this space myself. And in my case, it was college. Everyone would agree. Yeah. College doesn't prepare you for jobs.

[00:07:38] It costs too much, blah, blah, blah. And then I'm like, great, look, I have this thing. It's a net cost of zero. You're going to get hired. 98 percent of our grads do blah, blah, blah. And the market still is really, really small. Right. And so. It's felt like the adoption curve and like so you get on this graveyard of cool innovations and policy changes And I want to know like it feels to me like since covid The [00:08:00] adoption has actually increased in like a meaningful like an exponential growth not linear growth Like there are more and more parents that actually are ready now for the things everybody's been talking about But I could be wrong like all these esa policy changes that could be innovators getting too far ahead of their skis and the market Might not be ready for it yet.

[00:08:16] I don't know. I'd love your take I'm like, where are we on that adoption curve

[00:08:21] **Michael:** Yeah, it's a great question. Um, so a couple thoughts, I guess I my guess is that it's more like 10 million students or so are actively taking advantage of choice. Uh, options and the number would be higher if you consider the fact that like families like mine can move to any, you know, locale, uh, in the, almost any locale in the country.

[00:08:45] Um, and therefore we have a choice at that level. So, you know, if you counted it that way, it's like, Probably 25 million. But let's say 10 million or so, I think, are taking advantage of some form of choice. I don't think they're unbundling, right? [00:09:00] And doing the more radical forms of choice or permeability, shall we call it, right?

[00:09:06] Where I'm in, I'm moving, and then, you know, Right. Like that's, I think that's much, much lower. That's probably about, you know, that's probably homeschooling populations, probably, you know, 4 million or something like that. So it's, it's, but let's call it 5 million. Right. Something like that. Um, So I think that's where we are there.

[00:09:25] I agree. It has upticked significantly since COVID. I think that broke, even though a lot of people rushed back to normal, some larger subset said, wait a second, we can do things differently. And it's kind of awesome. Um, and so it unleashed a force. I think the ESA movement is fundamentally different in very important respects from vouchers.

[00:09:49] Um, which is to say a voucher is like a ticket for one thing. It's still one size fits all at some level. And ESA is [00:10:00] like, here's a bunch of money. How do you want to distribute it across a bunch of options? And if you save, that's okay. Cause it spills over to next year and increases your options then.

[00:10:07] Right. It's a very different, I think, mindset and so forth. So I, I think, you know, when the wall street journal, like in their news section calls it a voucher, I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's different, and the difference, I think, matters, in my view. I think they're extremely like grassroots politically popular.

[00:10:29] They're the, you know, not in the RD sort of divide of the world. Right. But like on the ground with actual families, I think they're extremely popular. I think the big question in terms of the, are we getting out ahead of it? And I'm worried about this is like, I don't think the supply side, the demand, I think is growing finally the supply side in terms of a real marketplace of different options that are sustainable.

[00:10:54] I don't think that's mature at the maturity that it needs to be. And I guess I say that in the sense of like, [00:11:00] I think you can find an option. I think a lot of the micro schools and other things that I've seen. They don't feel like they have sustainable business models to me past year two or three because it's a lot of teachers being like, I'll volunteer for a year.

[00:11:14] No, no, no, no. I don't want you to volunteer for a year. I want you to make a living doing this and it like work out for like mutual benefit for everyone. Um, and I, I don't think we've spent enough time. I look, this has to be in bottoms up, not top down, but like, I don't think there's been enough time thinking about real sustainable models.

[00:11:33] Um, That, that, that solved there. I guess the last thing I would say, and I think Matt, this was like the original push you had on me, if I recall, um, was I think I made the statement that like, it's not just clear that disruptive innovation. Is possible in the US K 12 system because there's not a, there's not really a lot of non consumption, right?

[00:11:57] And I think that's still like a reality. [00:12:00] There are homeschool families, they're increasing, but like, it feels like public schools are free. They're not actually, by the way, but like, it feels like they are free. Right. And it's, I, it's very hard to compete with universal compulsory free. Um, in other marketplaces, you have much bigger areas of non consumption and more dynamism.

[00:12:21] And so I think that's why it's been so slow and halting to your point, Isaac, of like why it's taking so long and you have to throw over, frankly, not just like your own family's decision, which is fraught with emotion and social pressure, but also the expectations of your family members on like, you know, Your grandparents and like cousins, what are you doing?

[00:12:44] Right. Neighbors. Um, but also then employers, colleges, like our schools sit in this very complicated ecosystem of value network. I would call it right of lots of different players. And historically, when you see major [00:13:00] transformation. I like to say systems disrupt systems. Like system change is a folly. It's actually a whole new system replaces the existing system.

[00:13:09] That's a lot of work when you just think about how interdependent and interlocked and habitual small C conservative, so many elements of these are like you take your higher ed example, right? Isaac, you know, I think on a micro scale, you can do this, but to get all the companies and all the individuals to buy in to a very different signal of talent, ability, potential, it's just, it's, it's glacial.

[00:13:37] I mean, you know, and last thought, this is an optimistic one, even though it might not sound like it, you know, clay Christensen, when he wrote about the disruption of steel mills, it took 40 years. might take a little bit longer and that's, you know, we, we, we, we need to keep We need to keep pushing at it.

[00:13:58] I think,

[00:13:59] **Matt:** I just [00:14:00] want. Yeah, I so agree. I wanted to add a couple thoughts. Uh, I jotted down here. The, the, the Wall Street Journal comment around ESAs are just vouchers. What's interesting that we're seeing is that the data from these ESA providers, like, still 90 percent of ESAs are going to a single provider private school.

[00:14:24] Right. Except the forecast in Utah is 50%. And the reason people in the market are saying their projection of Utah's. Being 50 percent is because my tech high open ed has been around for 15 years to show that there's a way to all the cart your child's education. And I find that super fascinating that as other states and even you've said it in articles.

[00:14:54] The ESA adoption over time goes from a single payer voucher to [00:15:00] an a la carte model. We see that happen over years of an ESA and Utah's ESA starts, actually just started August 7th. So like literally it's the first in the market right now and they're projecting people are going to use it more a la carte than any other state.

[00:15:18] **Michael:** that's tremendous, Matt. I didn't realize that. I mean, and, and, and I think what you're seeing, the evidence I think is supporting the idea more broadly. I agree with the 90 percent number, but you look at Florida, I think it's now down to 70 percent or something like that. So, More people are realizing I can break this up, fracture it and fractionalize it in different ways.

[00:15:40] And it's something you see in all markets, right? Which is that people are initially not aware of how they want to customize things. You know, Henry Ford Model T, any color, as long as it's black, that's great. It's an automobile. But then I all of a sudden start to become aware of like. Oh, I want a different color.

[00:15:57] Oh, I want a different seating arrangement. Oh, I want to, [00:16:00] you know, sedan into a station wagon, into a truck, right? Like all of a sudden choice becomes more viable as, as consumers get more experience with it. And you think about the behavior in this country, we've had, you know, effectively, let's call it 120 years of people being like, Oh, I go to school. Um, and school includes. Football team, food, academics, you know, on, right. Like it, it's the bundle. And so I think it's, it's going to take some time, I think, um, to, to, to change that. I mean, we had this experience during the pandemic. Sorry, this is not a story I've shared anywhere publicly, but like when we.

[00:16:43] Here you go. Here you go. When we took our kids out of the independent school, they were in Montessori school. They're back in it now. It's great. Um, but when we took, uh, took them out, um, Uh, we, we sort of made an offer, if you will, to, um, [00:17:00] where we said, let us help you set up a micro school on your campus where it'll be just a few students and then like, they can opt into here and like, we'll do, you know, unbundle this here and they're like, we're just not ready for that conversation.

[00:17:14] Michael, you go do your thing. Right? Um, yeah. Okay, we tried. We tried to keep up with the community, but I think that's the other thing is the suppliers aren't like, you know, were it not for my tech high now open ed districts wouldn't even know how to have this like, you know, accommodate this. And I remember distinctly.

[00:17:33] Here's another story. I remember distinctly talking to our local school district during the pandemic and being like, Set up a micro school and they're like, what would that look like? They brought the senior leadership cabinet on a zoom meeting and I started to describe it and they like all went ghost white because like all the amount of work that they were thinking they would have to do to set that up was so high.

[00:17:52] And I was like, well, you could just talk to my tech high. Like there's a provider that could help you do 80 percent of what I just described. But like. [00:18:00] This is what it would mean. And, and I think they didn't get over their initial, I approached it wrong. They, they, they didn't get over the initial, uh, shock.

[00:18:07] I remember all the faces, like, I remember all the faces going ghost white. I was like, okay, I screwed that one up. So

[00:18:14] **Isaac:** you know, it's funny that the vendor side, the provider side, I think is a little bit overlooked. They're sort of this idea. If we pass an ESA and then it's just like, boom, the market's open and all these providers will flood in. But this is a two, this is a two sided marketplace and any two sided marketplace faces the cold start problem.

[00:18:35] And in this case. It's not too hard to get the parents and students because you're basically just offering to give them money That's a really easy thing to sell right like free money is an easy product to sell But on the other side, I think there's been a lot of hesitancy I mean if you go look at most of the existing esa like Marketplaces, that's a probably a overly generous term.

[00:18:57] It's usually just like literally a list [00:19:00] Of text with like hyperlinks to different providers and there's there's very little Marketplace functionality, but it's also just too broad. I mean, can you imagine if amazon from day one? Was like, we're the everything store. Literally everything you want can be bought and sold on our platform.

[00:19:16] Go ahead. Vendors start listing stuff. Like it's too big. They started with used books only. Right. Or Airbnb, if they were like, you can rent anything from anybody. No, it was just, it was just rooms in a house, right? It wasn't like lawnmowers and kitchen utensils. And so I think this, this. That combined with the fact that it's like everything, all education, everything you can, you can list as a provider, but there's also the uncertainty of policy.

[00:19:41] There's kind of a lot of a, let's test out an ESA for 5, 000 people under certain conditions. And there's a bunch of enemies of it and you know, it's going to get sued. You know, the restrictions are going to change and it's, and as an entrepreneur, that's scary because you could invest a lot of time. So there's not a lot of marketing of these resources.

[00:19:59] [00:20:00] There's not a lot invested from the vendor side and going insane. Oh, great. An ESA opened up. I'm going to invest millions of dollars in building an amazing education offering that can tap into these dollars. It's kind of like, well, I guess I'll like list some stuff there and dip my toe in and see if anything happens, but it's, I just don't know.

[00:20:17] There's too much uncertainty and I think that's going to take time. You're going to have to see one or two states that really prove it's not going anywhere. The guidelines are relatively stable. It's navigable to really get some serious investment.

[00:20:32] **Michael:** I think it's such a great point because we know markets like certainty investment, like certainty. Um, I think it's such a, a, such an important point. The other thing we know, out school, who you all know, um, they've done some research out of their foundation arm, um, where they went into different markets and helped, you know, started giving away money like this.

[00:20:54] And to your point, Isaac, easy to give the money away, actually hard to get the families to spend it because there also had to be [00:21:00] social trust and recommendations and sort of guidance. Right. And I don't mean that in a top down way, because I think that's often what. People hear when you hear guidance, but like a very bottom up social trust way of, of, of saying, Oh, like that, that, that's a trustworthy provider and you used it.

[00:21:17] Okay, cool. Like, I'll, I'll, I'll do that. Right? Um, and so that takes some time. And I think you're right. It's better if it's narrow initially, actually. Because it can be understood. It can be digested. It solves, as Clay would have said, you know, one job to be done, not, not like millions of jobs to be done. If you, if you give me something that says it solves millions of jobs to be done, I'll tell you something that's not solving any of them.

[00:21:40] **Isaac:** You know, that's funny. That reminds me of something I wanted to ask you about because I saw, I was looking at your Twitter. And, uh, you had a great tweet or maybe you were retweeting someone else. I can't remember. That was something to the effect of, what if we don't need schools to just keep offering more and more and more different stuff?

[00:21:56] What if they need to just do less and focus on a few things? And you said something [00:22:00] like the concept of pruning education is often overlooked. And I think especially for those of us who are like, let's open it up, let's get more possibility on the table. That may be true for the market as a whole, but for any individual like provider or school, Yeah.

[00:22:12] Yeah. What do you think about narrowing the scope and getting niching down? So to speak,

[00:22:18] **Michael:** Yeah. I mean, look, it's, I, so I agree with what you said as a market, as a whole. We want. More options varied, et cetera, but we want them to be actually differentiated. So I don't want someone that's doing all things for all people. I want them to be awesome at one thing and choose what they suck at. And then, uh, and, and, and I think we're just really bad at that historically in education, like public school districts.

[00:22:41] They're like, Oh, we should add a program on this. We should add a program on this. We should add a program. They never take anything off their plate. And we know the cost of complexity in terms of subpar performance and cost overrun from an administrative perspective, it's really, really high. Uh, and so I, I just, you know, the [00:23:00] whittling of programs that are not perhaps doing what you had hoped that they did.

[00:23:05] Which also, by the way, would mean that you have to have a clear definition up front of what you hope that they do. Um, but also frankly, like we're very wed to tradition in education without asking the question, is this like, what was the tradition built to do and is this the best way to still get that outcome or is there a better process, right?

[00:23:24] Like, Pep rallies were awesome for building school spirit 50 years ago. They can be pretty alienating to large parts of your population. You know, uh, uh, today, maybe there's other ways to do this. I don't know. I'm not smart enough, but I, we, we never asked the question of what should be cut.

[00:23:40] **Isaac:** it's funny. Um, and Matt, I'll let you jump in here. I know I've been kind of taken over, but it's almost like, um, the curse of a noble business. Like if you tell somebody, I'm passionate about education. I want to do something to help children learn better. That's so noble and everyone loves it so much that they're not going to tell [00:24:00] you the things that you shouldn't do nearly as well.

[00:24:02] If you're in like a typical tech startup and you're like, I'm trying to sell a product that helps companies optimize their API web hooks. And your business model is too broad. It's you're very much more likely to run into peers, investors who will say, you're trying to do too many things. Here's all the things that's wrong with what you're doing.

[00:24:19] If you say, I'm trying to help learners do these 15 things, and they all sound like really good, noble things. People feel they'll just tell you encouraging things and they're less likely to say your business model sucks, right? Because your intentions are so good.

[00:24:33] **Michael:** Yeah, totally. I mean, this is look, I ran a nonprofit for a decade, right? The Christiansen Institute. Um, it's so hard for nonprofits in this, in this realm in particular, because it's like a death by a thousand cuts. This funder says, start this program. This one starts this program, this one, this one.

[00:24:50] And you all of a sudden have tons of programs with no strategic direction or coherence, right? Among them. Um, Um, and I think that's the, you know, what you just said is the reason [00:25:00] why, like, Oh yeah, of course we should do that. Like, of course we should do that, right? How could we not do that for that one kid?

[00:25:06] And the answer is like, actually, maybe that kid would be better served. In a different offering. And like, the best thing we can do is say, we're not the right outlet, but we will help you get to the right place and say no to you. Um, and I think we're, we're, we're, I totally agree. We're not particularly good at it.

[00:25:24] I actually think because I'm among, like, I really trust you guys. So I'm going to say it's like the hot take that is not popular, but like, I think we do ourselves a disservice by having social entrepreneurs versus just regular entrepreneurs.

[00:25:38] **Isaac:** Amen.

[00:25:39] **Michael:** building a business. Is help like if it takes off, it's helping someone make progress in some meaningful way.

[00:25:45] And so I actually think by creating a category of social entrepreneurship, we invite the problem you just described. Yeah. Yep.

[00:25:53] **Isaac:** I told Matt, uh, when we first started talking about, you know, open ed and me coming on board. [00:26:00] I was like, I don't know if you face this map, but when I was running Praxis and I very deliberately for that reason, after having worked in nonprofits, wanted it to be a for profit because I wanted to know if I'm actually creating value in the market, I want those signals and that feedback as fast as possible.

[00:26:13] But I told him, you know, the worst thing in the world when you're an entrepreneur in the education space, everybody wants to talk with you and they're like, Hey, I'm doing something too. I'm doing good things too. And let's, let's do something together. Check out this thing. And I'm like, You, you have to become kind of a jerk and be like, sorry, not every idea is good.

[00:26:33] Not everything, you know, the number of people that used to come to me and say, you guys should also do this for veterans or older people returning to the workforce or, and I'm like, yes, yes, yes. Those all sound like great ideas. I can't do them. I have no comparative advantage there. So we're never going to offer that.

[00:26:48] I'm sorry, but then you just feel bad, you know, so anyway, uh, nobody likes to feel bad, but you gotta, you gotta figure out what you're good at. Otherwise, it's all going to be weak, weak offerings.

[00:26:59] **Matt:** No, [00:27:00] that's super interesting. I'll just add to that line, Isaac, that you've opened my world to is, Hey Matt, we should have some private pay options. Because that's the best way to get some immediate response of quality of accountability of, uh, you know, holding the teachers and curriculum to higher standard when you have things that are just free and don't have that threshold of a, of a buy in, uh, you miss out on a feedback loop that, that sometimes is really valuable.

[00:27:33] **Michael:** it feels weird in education. Right. But I, and I, it feels weird as an individual who like my livelihood is based on selling me. Right. But, uh, I think the clearest signal someone really values you. Is that they're willing to spend money right against it and it's not like, uh, I mean, I was telling this non another nonprofit this, um, about a year ago, I was telling the CEO and I was like, you know, you don't have to be afraid of that.

[00:27:57] Like, that's actually a very clear signal. You're doing [00:28:00] something amazing for them. If they weren't willing to do it, you know, do they really have skin in the game that they're going to follow through with the things you're trying to help them through? I have my doubts.

[00:28:11] **Matt:** Yeah, and this also goes to the ESA things we were talking about the, the lack, the, the generous description calling it a marketplace, but we are missing out on the ratings and reviews that Amazon has mastered, like almost nobody buys stuff on Amazon without looking at the ratings and reviews. And in the ESA marketplaces, we haven't seen that yet and really think that's a missing piece.

[00:28:38] What, what are your thoughts about that,

[00:28:40] **Michael:** I, I, yeah, I totally agree. I think like I've made the argument to my friend Joe Connor who runs Odyssey, right? That's one of these, um, essentially it's a transaction platform at the moment for, for these essays, but I've made the argument that ultimately I think he's going to become the guidance function because he's going to have to have a way to represent, [00:29:00] um, I hate the word quality, but like value, let's say, right.

[00:29:04] And ratings and in, in varied ways, because people are not going to be thinking about what value is in the, in, in a monolithic way. And so in some ways he's going to have to innovate. Beyond what an Amazon or Yelp, uh, have done, I think to try to give texture to like, you know, what is this helping accomplish?

[00:29:23] And did it, you know, did it do so or not? Um, uh, but, but I totally agree. I think, I think we're going to need more of that. Uh, and, and I, I, I would think it should be a very bottoms up solution again, um, to help reduce friction and increase transaction volume, uh, and, and, and, you know, good matches, right? Um, on these platforms

[00:29:46] **Matt:** No, and that is the challenge because sometimes we'll, we'll get feedback from parents. That say, hey, my child loves Alex math, or my child doesn't love Alex math and parents ask, well, what's the difference like [00:30:00] describe your child now? So now it needs context in this ratings and review system of what type of child was using this.

[00:30:09] And then, you know, well, based on that, it was a 4 out of 5 for this type of child, but a 1 out of 5 for this other type of child, and that's complex. Thanks.

[00:30:18] **Isaac:** You know, it's.

[00:30:19] **Michael:** I mean, you know, my wife used to say she works in the food and hospitality industries industry and She hates Yelp because she was like, well someone reviews the Thai restaurant poorly or well like Do they have my sense of what Thai food is? Do they have my taste buds? Do like, do they have my expect?

[00:30:38] I have no idea. Right. And, um, and I, so it's a very like, you know, classic average ratings, which we know are not super actually helpful. What I think helps with Amazon, right. Is you get the qualitative ones below. As well, but I think there's a, I think there's some room to your point to innovate here and [00:31:00] create a more textured way to think about what was I trying to accomplish?

[00:31:04] What's the context around my kid and family situation? And was this a good offering to make progress?

[00:31:09] **Isaac:** This is so funny to be having this conversation in the context of education, because most of my career has been more or less in the education world. But for the last two and a half years before open ed, I was working in B to B SAS startup world. That's tech tech, you know, software companies selling software to other software companies for the most part.

[00:31:28] And we had a podcast and one of the main thesis that you know, I was kind of working around was this. The Infocalypse. There's too much information out there and trust in sort of typical sales and marketing tactics is breaking down. What does that mean? And we interviewed the guy who founded Trust Radius, which is a software review site.

[00:31:48] And he had some really interesting insights and data. There's other software review sites, G2 and others, that basically do what Amazon does. And we, and we call it 4. 7 star syndrome. Everybody has 4. 7 stars these days because everyone figured [00:32:00] out how to game the system. If you have 5, it looks fake. If you have less than 4.

[00:32:03] 7, you don't look very good. So everybody figures out how to get there. So the, the ratings don't mean much. And a trust radius, he said, they do all these additional layers of things. And he said, what's fascinating when we survey all these buyers, the aggregate score that a tool gets is it's like one, like 50 times less important to them than who the rating comes from.

[00:32:29] So someone who is like them, if you are a CFO and you're trying to buy financial software, you don't want to just hear how the software is rated in aggregate. You want to see what a CFO of a similarly sized company thinks of that software. You want to say someone like me, what do they think? And you know, we, we call it the who economy.

[00:32:49] You're moving from the how economy to the who economy, right? Like, I don't ask, how do I solve this? I ask who like me has solved this already that I can go to for help. And so kind of combining, and that's [00:33:00] where like, it's so hard to sell into for any vendor, the homeschool market, because it is the definition of the who economy.

[00:33:07] It is word of mouth networks. They barely have functioning Facebook groups or websites or anything in most of these communities that trust me, I've moved. to five different states and plugged in as a new homeschooler in every one of them. And it takes a couple years before you discover all the opportunities because it's all just like word of mouth networks.

[00:33:24] So trying to combine the trust that's built there in that one to one who do you know sense and put and scale it onto some kind of digital distribution is I think a really unique challenge that we'll start to see solved.

[00:33:37] **Michael:** Yeah, I totally agree with everything you said. I'm not sure I have much to add, except that I think understanding the situation and the circumstance is so critical and then, you know, combating against that. But I guess that's the last piece of it, which is like. Creating social trust in the interim right in the community, because that's what you just said, right?

[00:33:56] It took you two years so interesting to hear those reflections, because I've said that [00:34:00] without the depth of experience you've had, but like, um, two companies trying to sell into the homeschool space. But I think word of mouth and trust is like very deep, right? People can hear, Oh, that's how they thought about it.

[00:34:14] This does or doesn't reflect, you know, my situation, what I'm trying to accomplish. I will or won't take that recommendation.

[00:34:21] **Isaac:** Can I change gears for the last 10 or so minutes here? I want to get some advice for parents from you because you are a parent yourself. You have kids. So I know you think about this. You've written some really interesting stuff about. What you call the hidden curriculum, which I think is just so, so cool.

[00:34:38] It's like, what are the things that you are learning maybe without even consciously knowing it, like the environment that you're in, the environment that school puts you in, you learn what's explicitly taught, but you also learn other things, right? Like some of them are not necessarily useful things in the market, like that there's one right answer, or you have to wait until somebody tells you what to do to, you know, innovation, whatever, but you, you met, [00:35:00] you mentioned things specifically skills like project management, networking.

[00:35:05] Understanding professional norms. I could go on rants for that for a long time when it comes to hiring young people, um, and some of these other like ways of building social capital. That aren't ever explicitly taught, but that are probably more important than how well you're, you know, how well you do in algebra.

[00:35:24] Um, this kind of hidden curriculum, how do you recommend parents think about this and help equip their kids? How do you try to equip your own kids with these kinds of social capital, emotional intelligence type of skills?

[00:35:38] **Michael:** Yeah. Uh, I, I love the question and, and the way I think about it is like the, what I call habits of success, right? Um, are things that are intentionally or unintentionally generally unintentionally Passed down and what I would say is like, actually, it turns out a lot of families that have navigated these crazy complex [00:36:00] education and career systems themselves often historically.

[00:36:04] I'm going to walk back what I'm saying in a moment, but, um, historically have sort of passed down these things through example. And sort of through, because like actions speak louder than words, right? Um, so sort of showing how you do it where I think in the last 10, 15 years, we've seen, um, things change is that a lot of families have sort of Out of a fear of their kids ever experiencing failure have sort of, you know, jumped in as the helicopter parent, et cetera, jumped in to make sure the kid doesn't learn the lesson of like, no, executive function skills mean like that there is value to you planning yourself and like executing a plan and then learning from that, right?

[00:36:49] Like, um, and, but it's because it was never explicitly taught to. Anyone really, right? We talk about teamwork all the time. That's [00:37:00] a big buzz phrase in education, building teamwork. Like we need to build team skills. We don't actually talk about how you run a meeting in a good place, how you do project management, how you coordinate team members.

[00:37:11] And so we get lots of free rider, you know, people hate projects in schools because they remember like everyone, you know, the one kid did all the work and the other is like, you know, it's free road off of it. Cause like. We never scaffolded how you do a project with other team members. We never like did that.

[00:37:29] We said, just like, go home and do it. Right. Um, and so I guess the net of it is some families get this because the parents are more explicit about it or model it and don't sort of interrupt that, that those lessons, some of this gets conveyed in very interesting ways. Like you learn, don't cheat, don't, you know, right.

[00:37:49] Like certain things like that in school. And frankly, like a bunch of kids, most kids don't get the lessons at all. And to your [00:38:00] point, uh, professional, um, uh, decorum is like a really interesting one, right? How you build a resume, how you show up on time, how you talk to someone, how you shake a hand and look at them in

[00:38:11] **Isaac:** when do you, when do you cc or bcc someone in an email? These are things that can make or break your early job and, and people have never had a concept of the decorum around

[00:38:21] **Michael:** A thousand percent and we don't talk about it or we're not explicit about it in any meaningful way. And so some people sort of kind of get it, they pick up on it. Most people don't. And we have the challenges. Um, That we do, quite frankly, and I think the argument I would make is like if we could much more explicitly embed this into the visible curriculum, um, and use the academic content really as a conduit to teach these habits, we'd all be much, much better off.

[00:38:56] And look, I believe that there's a role for. content knowledge and [00:39:00] like, I think I, you know, like background knowledge is critical to jumping into something. And there's lots of background knowledge I could choose to educate someone on. So I think whatever you do, it has to be very explicit about building, uh, these habits in, in much more visible ways.

[00:39:17] Cause otherwise, I mean, you know, we all see it like certain kids from certain families in certain school systems don't, don't have a clue. And they, they, they don't, Oh, you're expected to be on time. And on time means like ready to work. Not like straggling in at the minute really had no, Oh, you can get fired.

[00:39:35] If you're five minutes late and customers are out the door, really? Like they're surprised by it, but like no one ever told them,

[00:39:43] **Isaac:** You know, Matt, I wonder if you have had this experience with your kids or even just some of the open ended families over the years. But, um, my oldest son loves writing. He's a great writer. And so like, that's one of his strongest skills when he started getting jobs and his teens and stuff, it [00:40:00] turns out that being a good writer is a totally different skill from knowing how to text your boss.

[00:40:07] **Michael:** huh?

[00:40:08] **Isaac:** And so things like asking, saying you're going to be on vacation or, You know saying is it okay if I come in late or i'm quitting a job? How do you quit or when you're in the application process and they ask you something knowing how to respond and he would come to me Fortunately, he would show me he'd be like i'm about to send this text and sometimes i'm like whoa This is totally tone deaf and he didn't get it I'm, like if I were a boss, I would be offended by this and he's like why?

[00:40:33] And I and it was hard for me to even explain why because it's so intuitive. I'm like, well Try saying it this way. So over the years he's done this and now he's so good at it. He's like, I feel like I can get a job anywhere and I can like, get away with anything with my boss. Cause I just know how to text a boss.

[00:40:49] And that is so, such a weird thing you wouldn't think of, but just like the difference between the skill of writing or even speaking and the context [00:41:00] of sending a text message to your boss.

[00:41:02] **Michael:** I realized I didn't answer the second half of your question as you were going through that, because you explicitly taught your son, right? That those skills, um, part of the way we're dealing with our kids is we outsourced it to the Montessori school. Cause I think that Montessori is actually very good at doing several of these things, not the texting your boss one, but like a lot of these other ones, Montessori is very good at doing.

[00:41:23] And so we outsourced, I would argue some of that. Um, and then some of it, frankly, is like, you know, us trying to be more explicit about like, hey, we did this then. Um, the, the reason I thought about the second half of your question when you were telling the story was, A different thing, which is, uh, so I have twins and one of them was like, um, they were both upset at their, at my wife, uh, for something.

[00:41:47] And, um, uh, one of them said the more tactful one said, um, Oh, when I give mommy feedback, this is how I go about it. And she had this huge elaborate, like I butter her [00:42:00] up in this way and blah, blah, blah. And then I cuddle in and then I, and then I saved my point. I was like, wow, that's brilliant. The other one was like, Oh yeah, I do the same thing and made up a story.

[00:42:09] And I was like, well, I think you just learned what you should be doing.

[00:42:14] **Isaac:** Matt, you were going to jump in on this.

[00:42:16] **Matt:** No, just, uh, yeah. Five children, they've all grown up into different, you know, paths of their own. And yeah, we've had those conversations so many times about job interactions and applications and resumes. And, uh, it's just super valuable to have, to, to see children as they get older.

[00:42:34] Applying some of those principles. So no, I absolutely love chatting about that.

[00:42:39] **Isaac:** Well, see, seeing my, my oldest son, who, by the way, the only reason he started asking me about it was because he almost got fired a couple of times and he didn't understand why. Um, but it makes me with my younger kids think maybe there are ways to make some of this invisible curriculum stuff more visible and say, instead of like, Hey, read a book and read a chapter of a book and write a page about it.

[00:42:58] Like, Hey, imagine that [00:43:00] you work at a bakery and you just burned something and sold it to a customer anyway. How are you going to tell your boss? Write them, write them an email, right? Like even stuff like that, I think could be potentially, I don't know. I'll

[00:43:11] **Michael:** Well, but you make it right. But right. But you just, you just like, so I, you know, one of the things is right. Um, persuasive essay, right? You got to persuade your boss that, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You've just made it more relevant. You made the skill much more, uh, uh, you know, less opaque, right?

[00:43:30] Like it's clear what we're actually trying to convey here and why we're trying to convey it. Okay, you did it there. Now let's do it on a, you know, some other, some other, you know, domain, right? Let, let, let, let's transfer because we want you to build the skills so you can take it to different places.

[00:43:48] That's valuable. Ideally, you're doing that, you know, starting with some real world projects and you're then moving into like a argument about the, you know, political landscape and then something about history. Like you can move [00:44:00] around. You're Galileo trying to convince people why they shouldn't burn you at the stake, right?

[00:44:04] Like, I, I don't care, but you're trying to build this skill set and we're trying to make it clearer about, Hey, that's not gonna land well, put yourself in the other person's position, why is it, why, why did this argument fall flat? Well, when you lead off with, listen to me, or whatever else, Turns out that doesn't work.

[00:44:21] **Matt:** Well, that's where I just need to give a plug for my passion around young entrepreneurship. I really think that having children dabble and experience with starting businesses at a very young age, even if it's. Our children went around and sold pumpkins out of a wagon that we had from our garden. Those skills just starting to think like an entrepreneur have always been the bedrock of, of MiTek high.

[00:44:47] And now open ed is youth who apply entrepreneurship principles will learn so many other skills that they don't, that of those hidden curriculum, uh, because entrepreneurship just draws those [00:45:00] out naturally. And you realize what you don't know. You now need someone to write a marketing flyer for you, or you need someone to code your backend, or you need someone to go manage your finances.

[00:45:13] It creates this, uh, interdisciplinary group that is natural versus forced. So that's why I really love geeking out on entrepreneurship for kids.

[00:45:24] **Isaac:** what a, what a mic drop moment to, uh, to end on this. This is so much fun. Michael, uh, so glad you were able to come on and join us.

[00:45:32] **Michael:** Yeah, I know, a total blast. Love what you guys keep doing for kids and schools, uh, and, and frankly, learning ecosystems around, uh, and at all levels. Cause like that, you know, when Matt came to me, it was like, we're reinventing college. And, you know, I was like, whoa, this is cool. Um, and so I, I, I love what y'all are about, what you're doing and where it's going to go.

[00:45:55] **Isaac:** Keep up the good work. We'll see everybody next time on the open ed podcast.

[00:45:59] **Matt:** [00:46:00] Thanks.

>     **Three innovators offer a road-tested framework for career development that helps anyone make real progress on their path when they switch jobs.**
>     
>     Each year, an estimated 1 billion people switch jobs worldwide. A lucky few stumble into the role of their dreams, but hundreds of millions are disappointed. What if, when looking for a job, we could make more informed choices to better select the opportunity we seize? What if the power to move along our career paths lies with each of us, as opposed to hiring managers or the market?
>     
>     According to the “Jobs to Be Done” theory of product design—customers don’t simply buy products; they recruit them to do specific jobs that solve a problem. _Job Moves_ adopts this model to view jobs as positions we “hire” to help us make progress in our lives and careers. Based on research conducted with over a thousand professionals at all stages of their careers, Ethan Bernstein, Michael B. Horn, and Bob Moesta find that this notion bears out no matter your age, stage, or trajectory.
>     
>     Key to this new, universal approach is understanding our priorities at the specific moment when we make each move. This team has created a process to help individuals identify the current circumstances driving them to look for new opportunities, the experiences they hope to gain in a new job, what tradeoffs they’ll gladly make in return, and how to learn-before-switching if a new job will deliver. The result encourages job seekers to look beyond a title or company for a more holistic view and ask not what you can do in a job, but what a potential job can do for you.

**He's also the author of:**

- _[From Reopen to Reinvent: (Re)creating School for Every Child](https://michaelbhorn.com/portfolio/reopenvideos/)_
    
    A practical plan to rebuild an education system failing its students.
    
    In _From Reopen to Reinvent,_ education strategist Michael B. Horn calls for the overhaul of a broken education system. The book guides readers on building a better path to address widespread unmet learning needs.
    
    Using frameworks like Jobs to Be Done, “Begin with the End,” and discovery-driven planning, _From Reopen to Reinvent_ offers a comprehensive approach to schooling, focusing on mastery and the use of technology. It provides:
    
    - Processes and ideals for schools to address current challenges
    - Methods to turn threats into opportunities
    - Insights on the inflexibility and inequity in schools revealed by the COVID-19 pandemic
    
    Chapter 1 features…

    - [My Tech High](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9iYz4njgdE)
    
    Key Insights:
    
    - Positive sum education: Move away from a zero-sum, scarcity mindset in education to one where everyone can succeed and grow. Use technology to personalize learning and help all students develop their potential.
    - Mastery-based learning: Replace time-based progression with a system where students move on only after demonstrating mastery of concepts. This approach encourages perseverance and a growth mindset.
    - Rethink grading: Teachers grading their own students creates conflicts of interest and can be detrimental to learning. Consider alternative grading systems where teachers grade each other's students.
    - Team-based teaching: Horn argues that the traditional teaching model expects educators to be superhuman, handling everything from content delivery to mentoring, data analysis, and counseling. This is unsustainable and often leads to burnout. Instead, he proposes distributing these roles across a team of educators, allowing for specialization and more effective support for students. This aligns with OpenEd's vision of flexible, personalized education that adapts to both student and teacher needs.
        
        > "No teacher should do all of these activities."
        
    - Parent-friendly schools: Reconsider school schedules and calendars to better align with parents' needs, such as year-round schooling or flexible daily schedules that match work hours.
- _[Disrupting Class: How Disruptive Innovation Will Change the Way the World Learns (2008)](https://www.amazon.com/Disrupting-Class-Disruptive-Innovation-Change/dp/0071592067)_
    
    According to recent studies in neuroscience, the way we learn doesn't always match up with the way we are taught. If we hope to stay competitive-academically, economically, and technologically-we need to rethink our understanding of intelligence, reevaluate our educational system, and reinvigorate our commitment to learning. In other words, we need “disruptive innovation.”
    
    Now, in his long-awaited new book, Clayton M. Christensen and coauthors Michael B. Horn and Curtis W. Johnson take one of the most important issues of our time-education-and apply Christensen's now-famous theories of “disruptive” change using a wide range of real-life examples. Whether you're a school administrator, government official, business leader, parent, teacher, or entrepreneur, you'll discover surprising new ideas, outside-the-box strategies, and straight-A success stories.
    
    You'll learn how
    
    - Customized learning will help many more students succeed in school
    - Student-centric classrooms will increase the demand for new technology
    - Computers must be disruptively deployed to every student
    - Disruptive innovation can circumvent roadblocks that have prevented other attempts at school reform
    - We can compete in the global classroom-and get ahead in the global market
        
        Filled with fascinating case studies, scientific findings, and unprecedented insights on how innovation must be managed, _Disrupting Class_ will open your eyes to new possibilities, unlock hidden potential, and get you to think differently. Professor Christensen and his coauthors provide a bold new lesson in innovation that will help you make the grade for years to come.

- _[Choosing College](https://www.amazon.com/Choosing-College-Learning-Decisions-Throughout/dp/1119570115)_
    
    **Cut through the noise and make better college and career choices**
    
    This book is about addressing the college-choosing problem. The rankings, metrics, analytics, college visits, and advice that we use today to help us make these decisions are out of step with the progress individual students are trying to make. They don't give students and families the information and context they need to make such a high-stakes decision about whether and where to get an education.
    
    _Choosing College_ strips away the noise to help you understand why you’re going to school. What's driving you? What are you trying to accomplish? Once you know why, the book will help you make better choices.
    
    The research in this book illustrates that choosing a school is complicated. By constructing more than 200 mini-documentaries of how students chose different postsecondary educational experiences, the authors explore the motivations for how and why people make the decisions that they do at a much deeper, causal level. By the end, you’ll know why you’re going and what you’re really chasing.
    
    The book:
    
    - Identifies the five different Jobs for which students hire postsecondary education
    - Allows you to see your true options for what’s next
    - Offers guidance for how to successfully choose your pathway
    - Illuminates how colleges and entrepreneurs can build better experiences for each Job
    
    The authors help readers understand not what job students want out of college, but what "Job" students are hiring college to do for them.

**Context:** Horn interviewed Matt 3 years ago, during peak COVID, and has written about OpenEd/MTH in his book as an example of reinventing education. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8uXczCHCoU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8uXczCHCoU)]

- Summary  
    - Explanation of how the program works.
    - Impact of COVID-19: The pandemic has accelerated growth and interest in their program, especially for younger students.
    - Innovation in education: Bowman discusses the concept of "teacher as entrepreneur" and the potential for districts to embrace more flexible, personalized learning models.
    - Future of education: Bowman predicts that the "a la carte" approach to education will endure post-pandemic, with parents becoming more savvy consumers of educational options.
