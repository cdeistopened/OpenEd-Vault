### Why Math Mastery is important (Math UC)

Math was never my strong suit—it was where I struggled most in school. So when it came to teaching my kids, I needed something that truly worked.

Enter **Math-U-See.** Unlike traditional programs, this curriculum teaches to **mastery.** Each level is its own complete concept—addition, then subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, decimals. Step by step, building a rock-solid foundation.

Then, when they hit pre-algebra, it follows the traditional path: algebra, geometry, algebra II—all the way through **calculus.**

Did I ever take calculus? No. Do I ever plan to? Absolutely not. But my youngest son might—and **Math-U-See will get him there.**

What makes it even better?

✅ Engaging **video lessons**

✅ **Step-by-step guidance** that makes sense

✅ Personalized **support when you need it**—I’ve even called in for help, and they’re always ready to assist.

For any homeschool parent looking for a **math curriculum that actually works**, this has been a **game-changer.** I can’t recommend it enough!

### The doubt that stops most parents from homeschooling

**Am I enough to help him?**

That question haunted me as a homeschool parent. Could I really guide my child? Would I be able to give him what he needed?

The answer was **YES.**

I **am** enough. My husband **is** enough. **As a family, we are enough.** Because we don’t have to do this alone.

We have a **community**—a network of resources, people, and support that help us navigate this journey.

And the results?

My youngest didn’t speak at all until he was three. Now? He’s about to perform in a **theater production of Matilda.** 🎭

When we give our children the **freedom to explore their passions**, when we support them in ways that truly matter, they **thrive.**

That belief—the understanding that growth happens in its own time—has helped us push through the tough moments, the self-doubt, and the days we wanted to give up.

But there is no giving up.

Because life moves forward. Kids grow. And they **need us to keep learning and growing with them.**

### Her first instinct was to bring school home..

🚫 **Do NOT recreate public school at home.**

I was a public school kid. I loved it. I thrived in that environment. So naturally, when I started homeschooling, I thought:

_"I’ll be the teacher, my kids will be the students. We’ll have a chalkboard. Structure. The whole nine yards."_

Spoiler: **That’s NOT what happened.**

Thanks to the wisdom of other homeschooling parents, I discovered **deschooling**—a total reset. Instead of trying to force a classroom model at home, we:

✅ Observed how our kids **actually learn**

✅ Figured out when they’re most **alert and engaged**

✅ Explored what **sparks their curiosity**

✅ Rebuilt our **family connection**

✅ Got out into the world—**museums, field trips, parks, community events**

The result? **A thriving learning environment that actually works.**

Your child doesn’t have to sit at a desk from 8 AM to 3 PM to learn. **Education is everywhere**

  

  

  

# 024 - Laura Feller

Ela Richmond: [00:00:00] Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm Ella, your sometimes host. And today I'm joined by Laura Feller. She is an Open Ed mom. She has three boys. She's been doing open education for about eight years. And before that, she was deep inside of all things with children for about 20 plus years. So. She has a ton of experience, um, and I think this conversation will be very interesting.

We were talking a little bit before, and she was talking about how important it is for her kids to explore, and how open education has allowed her to do that. So, welcome to the podcast, Laura Feller.

Laura Feller: Thank you so much for having me.

Ela Richmond: So, I would love to know, how and why did you get started in open education to begin with?

Laura Feller: So, um, it's an interesting story. We moved here, um, 10 years ago from Texas and, um, we enrolled our son in public school. He had been in public school in Texas. So we jumped him into first grade here and it [00:01:00] wasn't a good fit for him. He was struggling, um, with understanding the material that was being taught.

which was causing behavioral issues. And we were involved parents. I was at the school every week trying to help him and do the best that I could. But I had two other small children at home as well. So I'm dragging them with me for volunteer hours. Um, and towards the end of the year, it just wasn't.

wasn't working anymore. And my husband actually said, we need to homeschool. We need to pull him out of the system. It's not working for him. And I grew up loving public school. It was great for me. And I was really hesitant with two small children at home to, to jump into homeschooling. It was overwhelming.

It was scary. I didn't know if I could do it. Um, And my husband was 100 percent saying [00:02:00] we have to do this. This is the best thing, um, for our son. And, um, so I, I trusted him and, and we did it. And it was far and away the best decision that we could have made. Um, it was, um, Exactly what our oldest needed, um, to really just grow and thrive.

And, um, the things that he's been able to accomplish, uh, is just amazing. So proud of him and the work that he's done.

Ela Richmond: That's incredible and I think, um, the point that you made about how he was struggling to understand and that led to behavioral issues is actually something that a lot of parents face and a lot of students face as well and the hard part is addressing that, right? So like, you have, it's the band aid effect where it's like, you have an issue and then you're trying to address the outburst, right?

Or like, the most apparent issue. Whenever, sometimes, the issue is [00:03:00] underneath and underlying. Um, something that was interesting to me was, I was, I was reading about, uh, child development and the difference between ADHD and anxiety, and how ADHD and anxiety both present similarly, in the sense that, for example, children can't focus.

So I was thinking about one of my cousins, um, he's been diagnosed with ADHD, but he has severe anxiety. And so I was, I was sitting with that as a question, and I mean, I don't have an answer, I'm not a medical professional, but like, When you see the most common symptom, right? My kid can't focus or my kid is having struggles with understanding this material or comprehending, and then you are trying to solve it very, very quickly as opposed to saying, okay, what could the underlying issues be?

Um, it's possible that you misdiagnosed and I see that happening quite, quite often. So, how did y'all eventually figure out like, um, Maybe there's another issue here. Was this that y'all were just open to it? Was this that, you know, it happened over time? [00:04:00] Yeah.

Laura Feller: was writing letters backwards, flip flopping, um, you know, kind of pretty classic signs, but he's also a lefty. And so the teachers were quick to say, well, he's left handed, so it's going to take him a little longer.

I'm also left handed and didn't have those same struggles. So, um, when he was, when, after we had pulled him to homeschool and I got to really sit with him and focus on what he was learning and how he was learning, he was still struggling. And so we actually went to, um, uh, BYU comprehensive clinic here in Utah and they do, testing for a much lower rate than than other places charge because it's graduate students that are running the [00:05:00] testing, which is wonderful because again, I love to support the education system so that you know, if if are going there can help them learn and can help us get answers for what our son is struggling with.

Um, That was going to be so helpful. So we did that and uncovered the dysgraphia, the dyscalculia, the issues that were causing the behavior problems were learning disabilities. And once I understood that, we could really focus on what curriculums and what, um, accommodations we could make at home to help him. understand that, that he's super smart, a super smart kid. His brain just learns differently and it works differently. And the puzzle pieces fit together in such a unique way that he had to figure out how to make those, those pieces fit together. And, [00:06:00] um, just to continue on with that story of testing, we, um, Eventually, now that he's older and in high school, we took him back to the clinic and got him retested because as he enters college age, we wanted to see if he was going to be eligible for accommodations or what he needed, how his growth has been, and from 2nd grade to now 11th grade, he no longer qualifies as having dysgraphia or dyscalculia.

Um, he still struggles. but he's learned how to adapt and work to correct it when it happens. So he's, he'll still write his numbers backwards, but he recognizes it and he'll flip them back, which is the, the best you can ask for is that he's learned how to recognize it and work through it. And doing so, it uncovered. [00:07:00] ADHD, other issues, because now that we had taken care of the learning disabilities, we were able to see, okay, there's more going on and now we can tackle these other issues that have presented themselves, um, next. And, and again, he's learning how to cope through it and work through it. And he's doing great.

Ela Richmond: What is that like being a problem solver as a mother, like seeing all these things and then saying, okay, um, it's very tough in a moment, especially like when you're in the thick of it. To decide, I'm not going to take the easy way out, I'm not just going to try and find the easiest solution, but I'm actually going to try and make sure that we are, we are fixing this, that we are, you know, um, actually solving the problem.

And then to uncover more issues along the way is also, you know, quite difficult. Like, how do you walk with your kid in that, and how do you, as a parent, maintain the, um, [00:08:00] just like the resolve, almost. Like, to continue trying to figure out the issues and make learning something that's so fun for this kid.

Laura Feller: It has been, it's been such a challenge, um, in the beginning it was overwhelming and scary and do, can I help him? Do I have the ability? Do I have the resources? Am I enough

Ela Richmond: Mm

Laura Feller: help him? And the answer was yes. Yes, I am enough to help him. My husband is enough as a family. We are enough to help him because we don't have to do it on our own.

We have a community, we have resources in the community that can help us manage and, um, find the pathway that's best for him. And that's been the case for, for all of our children. My youngest wasn't talking at all until he was three and now he's, He's going to be [00:09:00] in a production of Matilda on stage and, um, the, the things that, that our boys have been able to accomplish with the freedom to explore and find those things that are passions for, for them as outlets has helped. Has helped us all push forward through the hard times through the difficult times when we felt overwhelmed and like this isn't working and we need to give up. And there, there is no give up because life continues and kids grow and, and they, they need us to keep learning and growing with them.

Ela Richmond: I love that. I'm gonna ask you in a, in a moment about the freedom to explore, um, but I would love if you could give me kind of an overview on your homeschool slash open education journey. What was that like? So, how did you start? Did you start by trying to recreate public school? What [00:10:00] was that for you and your family? That's

Laura Feller: uh, I went to a homeschool conference the summer in between his first grade and second grade year, and at that conference I went to a seminar called Homeschool 101 or Homeschooling 101 with Terri Ann Perkey, and Terri Ann Perkey saved our homeschool journey. I am so, so thankful that that was my introduction to homeschool because she laid out the plan. And the plan 100 percent is do not recreate public school at home. That is not the way. And because I was such a public school kid myself and I loved public school and that's what worked for me. I 100 percent was ready to do that at home. I was going to be the teacher and my kids were going to be the students.

I was going to have a chalkboard and the whole nine yards. And that [00:11:00] Um, that isn't what ended up happening at all because Terry, uh, Torianne was so wonderful in laying out, um, the idea of de schooling, which was completely pulling out of school completely, observing your children, finding out how they learn, what time of day they're most awake and alert, what, you know, What turns on their, their spark, what sparks them, what their passions are, what they enjoy, um, really just kind of rebuilding that family connection, exploring the community, going to museums, going to, um, playdates and parks and, and, uh, field trips and all of those things to kind of get out into the world and explore.

And. What I ended up doing was slowly adding in home education [00:12:00] into our fun daily activities. So we would read or do audiobooks in the car on the way to our activities or draw a hopscotch board on the driveway and work on addition and subtraction facts as we hop on the on the board and it just learning became. second nature in, in everything that we did. Um, during COVID, we started an outdoor science club so that we could meet, um, socially distanced in our front yard and set up, you know, tables away from each other. And we did science experiments in the front yard with friends. And, um, it was just everything that, that we've been able to do.

Um, As we explore, the world has been educational, um, and just a wonderful experience for the, for the kids.

Ela Richmond: I would love for you to explain the [00:13:00] process of de schooling. So, um, I mean, the concept of de schooling has a lot of stigma behind it, but I like the way that you explained it, where it's basically like, As a parent, right, they've gone through school, and school assumes, especially traditional models, school assumes that your kid is going to learn best in a certain way.

They're going to learn best by sitting in a classroom, they're going to learn best by using certain curriculums, um, that they are going to learn best if we teach them a certain set of general topics first. And, um, de schooling in the way that you explained it is basically like, how do we figure out the right Way to school our kids.

The right way to educate our kids. The right way to approach them. And teach them what it means to actually learn. Um, to not come to them with assumptions. But instead, uncover and figure out how they best learn. How can I best, you know, cultivate their passions. Um, what was that process for you? And how did you actually figure that out?

Laura Feller: [00:14:00] Um, it was really interesting. So, um, Toriann in her seminar talked about just spending time observing your kids, just sit in a corner and watch what they do and how they do it. And as I did that, I discovered things, um, particularly about my oldest at the time that I was going through this process, that he is an auditory learner.

He learns best by being spoken to. and hearing it, which is the complete opposite of how I learn. I'm visual. I have to see it. If I can see it, I can most likely do it. Um, he does not work that way. He has to hear it, um, which was so foreign to me. But again, because of his learning disabilities, he could, I could ask him how to spell a word.

And if we did it orally, if I taught him by by talking [00:15:00] how to spell it, he could repeat it back to me perfectly. But if I asked him to write it down, it was a jumbled mess and none of the letters made sense. And it was again, because his brain is just wired a little bit differently, but going through those kind of like almost experimentation steps of uncovering how this works.

Um, maybe it's my, my history of, you know, uh, uh, Loving mysteries and Nancy drew and being the sleuth. I just loved trying to uncover these things and, and how can we find a way that works best for both of us. Um, and so it turned out that if I read the information and I learned it, then I could explain it to him verbally, orally, and then he would.

Get the information himself, which is how we ended up doing it. It took more time, [00:16:00] but it's what he needed and what worked best for us.

Ela Richmond: Yeah, something like that is definitely going to take time. Um, how could you tell that when he heard it, he learned best? Was it like, okay, so y'all, as an example, are reading this, this book, and you're asking him questions after, and as opposed to him reading the book by himself, or doing any other thing, whenever you'd get to the point where it's like, okay, now tell me what happened, he would just retain more?

Or like, what is an example that just tipped you off to, okay, this kid learns best when he hears things? You

Laura Feller: Um, so as a reader, um, he was a very slow reader. It would take him Oh, 10 minutes to do something that should really only take a couple. Um, it took a long time, but his comprehension. was spot on. No matter how long it took him to read, he would eventually get it, and he could comprehend it. But if [00:17:00] I read it to him, it was instant.

He knew exactly what I was talking about, and he could repeat it and explain it. And again, it happened a lot with our spelling words because, you know, I would show him the words on paper, He would, you know, copy them. We would do the different colors, each letter in a different color and rainbow colors and highlight colors and all of the different ways on paper and on paper.

He wasn't getting it. Once I gave him the spelling test at the end of the week, the paper was a mess and letters were flip flopped and switched and you know, it, it just wasn't working, but every time we did it orally. It clicked and he was so much faster and confident and it just eventually became so clear that he's learning and retaining differently than what worked for me my whole life.[00:18:00]

Ela Richmond: Yeah, that makes so much sense. Um, I want to take this back to this, this whole exploration kind of concept. What does it mean for you to explore the world with your kids and why is that so important to you?

Laura Feller: I think for me particularly, we, because we moved here from Texas, we moved away from family and we moved away from, from my community that was very, very tight knit. And so moving into a brand new state where we knew absolutely nobody, it was so important for me to immediately build a community and find friends and find that, that family bond that I was missing being so far away from home. And when we started homeschooling, I realized that was the community that I was needing, because homeschool families are tight knit families. Open education families are our families that have [00:19:00] prioritized education at home, which is such a commitment to, to family and to raising your kids in such a specific way.

And with that community came opportunities for Um, play dates and field trips and things that we could do together and experiences that we could have together. Um, volunteering in our community. I was part of a mom's club that got together once a week at a park and we did, um, volunteering at different events.

And it was, I, that was, I joined that club 10 years ago when we first moved here and we still get together, um, all the time, uh, because we just, we just clicked and connected and bonded. And, um, My boys started an arts academy once a week so that they could have that school experience away from me [00:20:00] with other kids in a classroom.

Which is, um, to me, such a great way to, for them to explore that part of the world. They've, you know, my youngest two have never been to public school, but this is close, not the same. It's one day a week, but they do go, they do have other teachers that teach language and science and, um, arts and things. And, um, they started musical theater at this And that opened up an entirely new community for us of, of a theater community, which is people of all different backgrounds that love to perform.

And my boys have just thrived in that, in that environment. And, um, we certainly would not have found all of these things if we hadn't been willing to go out into the world and seek them out. And [00:21:00] It's been, it's been a challenge. My, my boys are a little more introverted, um, and so I've had to do a little pushing and a little shoving and, and a little, we're going to have fun and we're going to do this thing.

Um, when we started musical theater, I said, give it one, one production. If you hate it, you never have to do it again. Well, that was probably about 12 shows ago. So they decided they liked it.

Ela Richmond: That's so cool, and I love your emphasis on the fact that homeschool doesn't have to feel confining. I think that's something that people are very afraid of before they get into this whole, you know, open education space. Is the idea that, okay, well I'm going to be at home, and my kids are not going to have this social environment, these social groups.

Like, is this going to be confining? Am I just going to be confining them to our house? Or like, Our community and our surrounding area and are we going to stop thinking big like is it going to be confining for their [00:22:00] mind? Um, and the, the recognition that open education is open. It's free. It's big. There are so many possibilities.

It's not confining. It's quite the opposite. It's actually freeing in a lot of ways. I would love to hear your take on what open education has done for your family and done for your children. Like, what have you seen since you've been doing open education for eight years with, with these boys?

Laura Feller: So what I have seen is, um, my boys are able to be themselves. Um, musical theater is certainly not for all kids and it, particularly in the middle school, high school years, it's not for a lot of boys. And, um, it's not for a lot of boys. My boys have never experienced any stigma or any issue with being in musical theater.

It's something they love to do and so they do it. Um, And because of the community that we've built around us and the [00:23:00] theater community that we have, it's accepted and celebrated and just part of who they are. My, um, my middle son is, um, has decided that he loves music and he's taught himself how to play the banjo, the ukulele, the harmonica, the piano.

And I'm a little bit on the accordion and it's all self taught. It's self guided. He is excited to do this and, um, he has a style that is all his own. And I just, I love that they have been able to, um, grow into themselves without out maybe some of the, um, pressures that come with, to conform and fit in and certainly things that even though I loved my public school experience, things that I felt pressured to do in that environment that, that I just [00:24:00] see my boys having complete freedom to be who they are and explore the things that they love, um, without, without worrying about what other people are going to think or say.

Ela Richmond: Yeah, that's, that's massive and big. How do you as a parent help them to explore that and understand what it means to grow into themselves?

Laura Feller: Um, I, I, they'll probably say I forced it a little bit. I, um, I have a dance background myself and, uh, performing. My, my husband was a musician. Um, we're just natural performers. And so, um, I think we may have, you know, pushed that a little bit. Our, our boys are not necessarily sporty. They do, um, like ninja obstacle training, which they love.

And my oldest is really, really good at. Um, and again, that's something else that we do. It's a class that they take during the day, um, because it's, it's a [00:25:00] homeschool class. So our open education, um, system allows us to be able to. to do these activities during the day, um, leaving our evenings open for their theater rehearsals and the other things that they want to do.

Um, but it's just been so, so fun to let them explore these different things and try different things. If it doesn't fit or work out, that's okay. We move on. Um, and. Open education has just really been able to allow us to give them those opportunities to try.

Ela Richmond: What would you say are your goals with Open Education? So, goal initially, whenever you came into, um, this whole world, and then goal now, that you've been in it for a long time.

Laura Feller: Um, that's really [00:26:00] interesting. So something that Torian said way back at the beginning was to write down almost like a mission statement because there are so many opportunities and advantages to homeschooling that you can get lost in it and be overwhelmed by all of the choices and be distracted by what your main goal originally was.

So she said, you know, write it down. Learn it, memorize it, um, and stay focused to it. And then, you know, as they grow, it may change, but be mindful of those changes as you go so that you kind of keep that goal in mind. And for us, our goal was that our boys would learn how to, how to learn. in the way that works best for them.

My husband loves history. He still loves to study history on his own. You know, in his own time, he'll watch the documentaries. [00:27:00] He'll listen to podcasts. He just loves history. And so he's continued to learn about it. And he's been the boy's history teacher because that's his passion. And he explains it in such a way that they enjoy it, which is great.

It's great. But that's certainly not something that he has to go to school to do. He's doing it on his own, and he's, you know, I think we've both taught our boys that if there's something that you love, you can explore it. We, we provide the tools and the resources. I certainly don't know how to play the banjo or the harmonica, um, but our middle son has, has, Decided that that is something that he wants to do and is a passion and he's found the resources to be able to do that.

And that's what we wanted for them. Learning is lifelong and if we can teach them how to do it and how to enjoy the process of it, that's what we [00:28:00] want for them.

Ela Richmond: I love your emphasis and point about, um, a mission statement, and just keeping yourself grounded in a goal, because I do think that that is That is so easy for parents, is, there are all these flashy things and then you're like, okay, yes, yes, yes, and then all of a sudden you look back and you take a step back and you're evaluating and you're wondering, okay, wait, hold on, um, each of these yeses are toward a different goal, and if I'm going to walk toward a goal and actually achieve it and hit it, Like, my yeses need to be, um, like, additive, right?

So it's, it's not like, okay, I'm going to, uh, I'm going to pursue one goal, and then another goal, and then another goal, and they're all going to help me get to, to a certain direction. It's almost like, okay, you have to understand what is the, what is the North Star? What is the, the, the overarching thing that you are walking toward?

And then there are things that are going to fit under and inside of it. But, um, That creates a ton of clarity for the [00:29:00] yeses and the noes, because the noes that you say matter so much as well inside of this, uh, there, there's so many opportunities and possibilities that you can't say yes to everything.

And I think that's difficult for parents. How do you as, you know, a mother with three probably extremely active boys, how do you determine what to say yes to? Like, maybe they come with you, come to you with a new idea. Hey mom, I really want to learn this thing. And then they're obsessed with it for a little bit, I mean, most parents have resonated with the fact that, like, your kid will be obsessed with something for a second, they're like, Mom, just trust me, like, this is the thing.

And then you get it for them, and then, like, they forget. And they don't care about it. At all. How do you decide what is something that you're willing to go all in on, and, and get them the resources for, and help them to, to achieve? Mm hmm.

Laura Feller: we have our core curriculums that we work on. They do math and language arts at home every single day. And those are things that are [00:30:00] non negotiable. We're going to do our math curriculum and our language arts curriculum and our reading. Those air done deals every day. Um, and then we add in science and history and those other Those other ones throughout the week, and then beyond that, we only have so many hours in a day, so they have to prioritize.

Um, we're able to do the ninja training because it's, it's one day a week during the day. Um, and it's a great, you know, physical PE outlet. Um, They do Kung Fu in the evenings. They're working towards their black belts. And, um, and then they do theater and because they do theater, they have voice lessons and that is where we've had to cap it.

So with my, with our middle son who loves music and instruments, we've said, okay, if you want to add piano lessons or [00:31:00] guitar lessons, Then something has to, it has to go. You have to choose, you know, we're maxed out. So you have to choose, do you want to continue voice lessons or should we switch to, to music lessons?

They're, they're both beneficial. They're both helpful. Um, We kind of let him decide. And so far he's chosen voice lessons. He loves musical theater and he's decided that he can learn the instruments on his own time through the internet. It's been wonderful. He teaches himself. And so for now, those are, that's where his priorities are. Um, with our oldest, um, he's, he's really struggled to, you know, he wants to, now that he's getting older, he wants to get a job and make some money and do those things. But there's a, there's a time issue because he's also taking college classes through Open [00:32:00] Ed. He's able to take college classes in high school and he has a goal of graduating with his associate's degree.

Whether he reaches that goal or not will support him, but if that's his goal, then that's where his focus needs to be and everything else needs to take a back seat to making sure that these classes are taken on time, you know, per semester. And so he's really had to, um, decide where his priorities are and last year he overbooked himself.

He did too many. Musical theater productions and tried to do too much and it was really stressful and he found his limit and he was able to say, okay, this year I need to back down and I need to say no more than I say yes. And that was such a growth opportunity for him as a young man to figure out where his limit is in a safe environment at home when [00:33:00] he's still young and we can still help him and support him.

So, um, you know, we, we set our boundaries for them and then eventually let them kind of find their own.

Ela Richmond: I absolutely love that approach. Giving your kids autonomy. And I think another thing that really stood out to me was, um, getting them acquainted to their own preferences. So, when you are a parent and, let's say, a kid doesn't have time limits. So, like, I mean, this was something that, that was interesting for me growing up.

I didn't have that many activities that I was a part of. So, I, I had a lot of free time and, like, I'd, I'd pick up random things. But, when your kids are already booked and, or have things, and, or, as a parent, you recognize that the either or is important. So, it's not just, like, And, it's not just like, okay, hey, we're just gonna start adding things on top because there is a limit.[00:34:00]

Once you position things into the either or, where it's like, okay, you can either do theater or do piano, and you have to decide what your preference is and which one you would stack rank higher. Like, getting them familiar with both their preferences, getting them familiar with the cost and the benefit.

So, hey, if you decide that this is something that you want to take on, you are also deciding that you are not going to do the other thing. And what that means is that, you know, and like, having them understand that is so, so valuable and so important. And then also it's interesting to me that you, you let your kid overbook himself.

You let him experience that. And like, There's probably a part of you that's kind of like, Mm, you're doing quite a lot, son. Um, but allowing him to figure that out and allowing him to overbook himself and get stressed and figure out, okay, I've learned my limit, [00:35:00] is such, like you were saying, an incredible growth opportunity for him to make better decisions in the future about his time, about his yeses and nos, about the things that he tells other people and commits to.

Um, and I, I love, love, love the way that you stress that and the way that you help your kids to learn to prioritize because that's what it seems like you're doing. It seems like, and tell me where I'm wrong here, but it seems like what you're doing is engaging in conversations with them. And you're not making decisions for them, but you're opening this door for a conversation to help them think through things and to help them make decisions for themselves.

And you're not telling them, you know, what to pursue. You're not saying, hey, this is, this is the path that you need to go down. Or, hey, you know, you're really talented at this. You should do this. You're not telling them the shoulds. It's like, okay, you get to make this decision. I'm going to help you lay out the pros and the cons.

And I'm going to help you lay out the, the, the things that would help you to make a better decision. But I'm not going to make that decision for you.[00:36:00]

Laura Feller: Yeah, 100%. It's, um, having those conversations, um, with our boys, we, when we, um, moved here, we decided to, um, To really open up more conversations with our boys. We didn't like the idea of, of punishing them or threatening them or, um, forcing them to, to do certain things, um, but we have really worked to gain their cooperation and their understanding of this is why, particularly with our oldest, who, um, is a little defiant of authority.

It's it's a little bit of a trigger point for him, um, which is part of why public school wasn't a good fit for him because there's a lot of authority in public schools. Which works great for a lot of kids. It just didn't work [00:37:00] for ours. And so, um, with, with our oldest, we needed to find ways to gain his cooperation so that he bought into what we were doing with our youngest.

His first reaction to anything was no. The first word out of his mouth was going to be no. No matter what we asked, do you want ice cream? No. And so we had to give him a minute. Is that no meaning yes or is that no meaning no? And he would think and then he would give us his actual answer. Yes, I want ice cream.

Um, but it was, it was learning how to communicate with them in the way that worked best for them. And again, that again comes with kind of the observation of what are they needing right now? And is it something that I can provide or is what they're asking for ridiculous? [00:38:00] And I'm going to have to put my foot down and say, no, this isn't happening.

And here's why this isn't happening. And that's, that's the part that was so important is explaining the why.

Ela Richmond: Interesting. So what is it, what does it look like to gain your kids cooperation? Because I can imagine, especially with boys, especially whenever you've gotten to a point where you're like, Hey, you know what, I am not going to say yes anymore and I do not like authority. Because I mean, like, kids go through that rebellious phase.

That rebellious phase at some point usually and especially whenever you've been told all your life how to do something and then you come out of that system where you have a lot more freedom and autonomy and then you, you figure out that you have preferences and, and all of those things contribute to the fact that sometimes kids will push back to the point that you allow them to.

How did you gain their cooperation? Because I think a lot of people try to stifle a kid's, um, sense of self and sense of I and sense [00:39:00] of, You know, push back. And so their goal is I'm, I want you to say yes. When I ask you to do something, I want you to agree with me and instead for y'all, it's, I want to regain and retain your sense of self and I want to, I want to honor that while also creating a conversation and allowing this to be a cooperation where you recognize that I might have something valuable to add.

And where we can work on this and through this together. What did that look like for you and your family?

Laura Feller: Yeah, that, um, I think because I had such a, a strong child education background and child development background that, um, I used a lot of the techniques that I used when I was a nanny, when I was working in childcare, um, For our oldest, it was a lot of, um, when he was younger, we would use the, I bet you [00:40:00] can't, because if you say you can't do something, of course he's going to want to do the thing.

So, you know, I, I bet you can't write that word on the dry erase board. It's such a hard word. I bet you can't do it. It's too much. Don't even try.

Ela Richmond: hmm.

Laura Feller: And he's like, Oh, yes, I can. And there he is on the dry erase board. Um, or it was, um, giving them options. We can, we can work on our math book on our math work for 20 minutes, or we can read for 20 minutes.

Which one would you like to do first? So both things are going to get done. It's just they get the say in which one happens first. And with that feeling of power and control comes some ownership of what they're doing and that has been really helpful is [00:41:00] making sure that they feel empowered to do these things.

Um, Even things like household chores, you know, taking out the trash. If you don't take out the trash, then it backs up, and then I can't cook in the kitchen, and then we've got a real problem here. So, I need you to do your job so that I can do my job. And explaining how that works and the why of why these things need to happen, um, has been so important in gaining their cooperation.

And I, honestly, I I adore my boys. I love them. I'm so thankful that we've had all of these years together and memories, daily memories of our years together. They haven't been away from me every day learning and growing and experiencing things, um, away from me. Sure they've had those, those times and those experiences are, middle son, um, decided that for his birthday, he wanted [00:42:00] to go to Texas to visit family.

And so he figured out how he could get to Colorado where my sister is. And then she was on her way to Texas. So he was going to ride with her down to Texas to stay with the family. And he did. And he had two weeks in Texas with the family. He flew on a plane by himself to Colorado, which was a huge step for all of us.

But he was so ready to again explore the world and do this scary thing on his own, um, and have this great experience because I think we've given him such a, a strong foundation of, um, of security that, that he can go explore on his own now, as much as I hate it, but I allow it.

Ela Richmond: Um, I love that point. I'm gonna hit you with some rapid fire questions here in a second. Um, but I think, I [00:43:00] think the, Uh, The emphasis on stepping back as a parent is important. Even, even when you don't like it. Even when it's, it's tough. Especially since you've been with them. Especially open education parents.

You've been with them for so long. You've seen so much of this kid's growth. You care so, so, so deeply. And then one day it comes and it's like, Okay, now I have to let go. And I have to let them, you know, let the little bird fly out of the nest. Like, it's, it's tough. But. Allowing your kids to, to take those steps is so important.

Because that's, I mean that's the whole point of open education, right? To make them capable of being the humans that we want them to be in, in the world.

Laura Feller: For sure.

Ela Richmond: I love it. Okay, so my rapid fire questions to you today, give me the first thought that, that comes into your mind. Um, question number one. What is a resource, curriculum, tool, online resource, something like that, that's been incredibly valuable and just something Awesome [00:44:00] for your family.

Laura Feller: Um, our math curriculum, Math UC. Uh, math is not my strong suit. It is where I struggled most in school and having the Math UC curriculum, which teaches to mastery. So each level is its own. It's entirely its own thing. So you have addition and then subtraction, then multiplication, then division, fractions, decimals.

It goes step by step in the elementary school years and through part of the middle school years. And then once you start pre algebra, then it takes the more traditional route of pre algebra, algebra, geometry, algebra two, all the way through this curriculum goes through calculus. I will never, I never took calculus.

I've never planned to take calculus, but my youngest son may get to calculus and this curriculum will help him do that because I certainly won't be able to, but it has video lessons [00:45:00] that come with it. Um, I've had to call in before to get like individual personalized help and they answer their phone ready to help.

Um, it's been a wonderful, wonderful curriculum that I just, that I just love.

Ela Richmond: Great points here. Um, especially for new open education families, it's very difficult in the beginning to believe that you have everything that you need in order to educate each of your kids to their maximum potential. Um, in all of these different subjects, because I mean, definitely exactly like you're saying, potential.

There are definitely subjects where I did not feel like I did extremely well in school in them, and looking back, I'm like, okay, I could not tell you how to do this. I would need to relearn it by myself, and then spend a lot of time on it, and then maybe I could teach it to you. Maybe. But recognizing that there are incredible educators all over the world that are putting together these curriculums for your kids, and they want to support, and [00:46:00] they want to help, and they want to give you the best of all that they have, and The hard part is finding them, of course, but whenever you lean on, on the families inside of this, this movement and inside of all of these different communities, just finding them is so, um, helpful and just gives you a breath of fresh air because it's like, okay, I don't have to be the one to be a master in this topic.

Okay, question number two. What is a challenge that you face throughout this whole open education journey that you've overcome? That you would love to share the problem and solution with another family, because they might be encountering something similar. Mmm.

Laura Feller: biggest thing was getting my boys to buy in to what we're doing and making sure that they stay focused on the path that we're on. Sometimes school is a [00:47:00] drag, no matter where you do it. You can be doing it in bed with your PJs and your stuffed animal and your hot cocoa, and you still don't want to open that language arts book and write a paper about whatever it is that they're asking you to write a paper on.

Sometimes you just don't want to do it. And so reminding my boys that this is their education. This is for their future, their future success and their future happiness so that whatever they decide to do, um, as a career, as, as a way to, um, to spend their lives that they have the ability to choose whatever it is that they want to do, that we're providing the foundation.

But it's up to them to do the work. And we have been making that point since we were brand new to homeschooling, that this is not for us, this is not something that we're doing for us, this is something that we are [00:48:00] doing for them, and that they need to decide if they want to do it as well. Uh

Ela Richmond: great thought and point. It's funny as you said that the PJs and, and the, and the hot cocoa, and just surrounded by all your stuffed animals, The same is true for adults as well. It's like, okay, put yourself in a remote environment, put yourself on your couch, put yourself, you know, in your comfiest clothes, and sometimes you still don't wanna do the work.

And it's so relatable. It's so true. But it is the same answer, like you were saying, for parents, as parents, adults, anybody, as it is for kids. It's find your why, understand why you're doing it. And then in those moments where it's like, okay, I really don't feel like doing this. Then remind yourself about your why and also root yourself in the fact that, um, I love James Clear.

I don't know if you've read James Clear's Atomic Habits. But he emphasizes the point that you should remind yourself that I am the person who. Like, make it a character thing as [00:49:00] well. I'm the person that shows up for these things. Um, and doing that for both you as an adult and on a, on a kid level. Like, kids are so, so smart and so capable of wrapping their heads around this.

I think that's a really, really solid reminder. Our third, third final rapid fire question. Um, what is your advice to a new open education family? Mm

Laura Feller: to a brand new family, I 100 percent recommend taking the time to de school. It is not the same as unschooling. Unschooling is something different and that works wonderfully for some parents, not all parents. But de schooling I genuinely feel is necessary for all families, no matter what. It is that time to Separate from the public school, um, training that we've all had and really take the time to learn, read [00:50:00] the books, read, you know, Thomas Jefferson education, read all the different books about.

How children learn, learn about child development and what stages are coming for you for your child, because in middle school they forget everything and it's it's a whole new phase and a whole new situation to navigate and so learning all of those things that you're going to need to help them in the future is so beneficial and taking that time to explore.

Parks and museums and read books together. And, um, we, when they were little, we started our day on a blanket on the floor and we would read books together and sing songs together. And, um, some people use that time for Bible study. Um, it's just that time in the morning when you can come together and group together and talk about what the plans are for the day, what [00:51:00] their dream was last night.

Um, just regroup and then, you know, start breakfast and all the activities of the day. But it's really that quiet time to come together before the busyness of the day starts. And

Ela Richmond: Yeah.

Laura Feller: just possible when you're de schooling and you're not set to a certain schedule, a certain clock. Um, it really just helps.

Ela Richmond: Yeah, that's incredible. I've absolutely enjoyed this conversation and loved all of the insights that you brought to it. Um, this has been so great to hear about your family's open education journey and all the things that y'all have learned throughout it. And I do think that the emphasis on de schooling is really important and especially the emphasis on de schooling the way that we kind of talked through it in the beginning of this episode where it's like, de schooling is about understanding and learning your child to understand what it actually means when you step outside of the one size fits all education model.

What does it actually mean to Create and [00:52:00] craft and personalize an education to your specific child. So thank you so, so, so much for everything.

Laura Feller: Thank you. Thank you so much for having me. This has been wonderful. I appreciate it.
