### Play

"Playing isn't learning" is the biggest lie in education.

When children play, they:

- Develop critical thinking
- Practice social skills
- Master physical coordination
- Create natural hierarchies
- Learn real consequences

The tragedy isn't that children play too much.

It's that we stop them too soon.

  

### Work with nature

  

Traditional education has a time problem:  
15 minutes for lunch  
20 minutes for play  
6 hours in a chair

What would happen if we flipped the script?

  

If we let kids:

- Eat when hungry
- Move when restless
- Rest when tired

  

Schools like Apogee are already doing it, and they’ve found:

- Better focus
- Stronger retention
- Natural body awareness
- Improved decision-making
- Reduced anxiety

  

### Test prep

You want to know what a month of test prep teaches a 6-year old?

- Scores over learning
- Competition over growth
- Performance over understanding

"Red marks" don't motivate.

Your child is more than a test score.

  

### You see, we see

You see: A distracted child who can't sit still  
We see: A body designed to move

  
You see: A student falling behind  
We see: Natural learning rhythms

  
You see: Resistance to traditional methods  
We see: A mind seeking meaningful connection

  
Stop pathologizing normal childhood development. Start questioning a system that does.

  

  

### Story time - math

True story: A student was struggling with math. Traditional school would’ve told this student to push harder, move faster, and keep up with grade level. But his open education allowed him to approach it differently:  

He moved back one level.  
He built confidence.  
He mastered fundamentals.  
  
A year later he had not only improved in math but gained confidence that spilled over into every other subject.  

Nobody asks a CEO what level math book they used in 5th grade.  

And results come from mastery, not race-to-the-top pressure.

  

### Grouping kids by age?

Traditional schools group kids by age. But real life doesn’t work that way.

Real world success comes from working with people of all ages, abilities, and backgrounds.

Here’s what Peggy Lowe from the Apogee schools finds when they put kids of all grades together:

The younger ones find role models.  
The older ones develop leadership.  
Everyone learns empathy.

  

### Give kids more credit

You've got to give kids more credit than you think they deserve.

When we step back, they step up.  
When we trust more, they grow more.  
When we listen, they lead.

Your child is more capable than you imagine.

  

### Build responsibility

If your child had to raise their hand to use the bathroom at home, would it feel strange?  
Then why do we accept it at school?  
Real education builds responsibility, not compliance.

  

### Real-talk

When you’re an adult, nobody's going to ask what level math you were in.

True freedom in education starts when we stop comparing and start completing.

Focus on mastery, not metrics.  
Build confidence, not competition.  
Embrace growth, not grades.

  

### Myth ✅

Your kid doesn’t need constant direction. Your kid needs space to fail forward.

Growth happens in the gap between attempt and achievement.

Can you confidently say you’re giving your child room to grow?

  

### Start with why

When children understand the purpose behind learning, motivation follows naturally.  
Stop pushing.  
Start explaining.  
Watch interest grow.

COLD OPEN:

"I knew what was best for kids with my human development background. They needed to be outside playing. Testing wasn't appropriate. Having my own children changed my perspective. Going back to teach after my first baby, I realized I couldn't support a system I knew wouldn't be good for my kids. Sitting behind desks and being repeatedly told they're failing wasn't developmentally appropriate. It didn't match who I was or my soul."

## Transcript

### Introduction [00:00]

Ela: Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. I'm Ela, your sometimes host, and today I'm joined by Peggy.

Peggy: Thank you, Ela. I'm looking forward to this conversation.

### From Public School Teacher to Alternative Education [00:13]

Ela: You're a mom of two who recently opened Apogee in Utah this September. Before we discuss that, I'd love to hear your story – you were a public school teacher for 12 years.

Peggy: Yes, it wasn't a lighthearted decision to leave. I had my college degree in human development and a master's in early elementary education. I started in a Title I school as a first-grade teacher, excited to change the world. I joined every committee possible – PTA and various subcommittees – thinking I could have input on education. But I wasn't seeing the changes I went to college for implemented.

I knew what was best for kids with my human development background. They needed to be outside playing. Testing wasn't appropriate. I was frequently at the district office advocating against testing. I'd spend a month each year teaching kids how to test, then giving tests – wasting valuable time for these little people.

Having my own children in 2020 and 2021 changed my perspective. Going back to teach after my first baby, I realized I couldn't support a system I knew wouldn't be good for my kids. Sitting behind desks and being repeatedly told they're failing wasn't developmentally appropriate. It didn't match who I was or my soul.

### Understanding Developmental Appropriateness [06:24]

Ela: What's an example of something not being developmentally appropriate?

Peggy: The biggest issues were recess time and desk time. We'd have kids sit at desks for 90-minute blocks without movement. They had to walk in single-file lines instead of naturally. We gave them 15 minutes of recess and 20 minutes combined for lunch and recess. Kids would rush through eating to get outside because their bodies craved movement.

Testing was another huge issue. We spent so much time teaching young children how to fill in bubbles rather than focusing on learning. We'd show parents test scores with red marks indicating negative performance, which was defeating for both parents and children.

### The Apogee Approach [12:10]

Peggy: At Apogee, we've spent our first eight weeks "unschooling" kids from traditional systems. We teach them autonomy – they don't need to ask permission for basic needs like using the restroom or getting water. They just need to be respectful.

We give them an hour for lunch and play. They can eat, play, come back to eat more – following their natural rhythms. We're teaching them to listen to their bodies while maintaining respectful behavior.

### Daily Structure at Apogee [26:36]

The day begins with students working on their interests – some work on RC cars, others read or build with materials. We then do our "physiology first" workout outside. During our work cycle, we focus on individualized learning at appropriate levels.

After lunch and outdoor time, we do project-based learning with themes that integrate core academics. We end the day with character call-outs, gratitude, meditation, reading, and cleaning our space together.

### Age Integration [25:10]

We have two studios: ages 4-6 and 7-12. While separated for academic work, we come together for morning workouts, lunch, and daily Socratic discussions. Watching the older kids interact with younger ones brings a wonderful perspective to education.

### Building Confidence Through Understanding [27:59]

One of our key approaches is meeting students where they are academically, regardless of grade-level expectations. We focus on building solid foundational skills and confidence rather than pushing students through material they're not ready for.

### Socratic Discussions [36:49]

We often use "would you rather" questions to help students develop confidence in expressing and defending their viewpoints. It's challenging for many to disagree with friends or stand firm in their opinions, but these skills are crucial for development.

### Final Thoughts on Growth [40:11]

Peggy: The most important lesson I've learned is that growth is essential at every stage of life. The Apogee program brought that mindset back to my front door. In just 11 months, I've grown more than I imagined possible, both personally and professionally. It's about creating strong families and maintaining a growth mindset for everyone involved.

## Rough Transcript

Ela Richmond (00:00.982)  
Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm Ella, your Sometimes host, and today I'm joined by Peggy. Thank you so much for being here, Peggy.

Peggy (00:09.705)  
Thank you, Ella, for having me. I'm looking forward to this conversation.

Ela Richmond (00:13.012)  
Yeah, so you are a mom of two and you recently opened Apogee, a program in Utah, right in September. So we're going to get into all of that and kind of how you have been running it and kind of like what the program even is about. But before we do that, I want I want to kind of like hear your story. So you were a public school teacher for 12 years.

Peggy (00:22.685)  
Yes, ma'am.

Ela Richmond (00:40.512)  
which is very, very unique in the sense that you got to experience the inside of the education system. You got to experience, you know, the ways that things are being taught and all the things that you had to do. But eventually you left it. And I'm curious to hear why, because, I mean, I would imagine that that's a pretty difficult decision to say, you know, I put my life into this. Now I'm going to leave it.

Peggy (01:09.791)  
Yep, absolutely. It wasn't a lighthearted decision, that's for sure, because I went and got my college degree in human development and then I went and got my master's degree in early education, early elementary education. And so I was committed. I was in it, you know, and I started out in a Title I school and I was a first grade teacher. So excited to go and change the world.

what I thought I was gonna do. And then I was in there and you know, and I became a part of every different committee you could be a part of. I was a part of the PTA. I was a part of, you know, all those different subcommittees that they have to make you feel as I like to think, like I was important. Like I had input on what was happening in the education system. And as I was a part of all these pieces, I wasn't seeing the changes and I wasn't seeing what I went.

Ela Richmond (01:37.654)  
Yeah.

Peggy (02:06.911)  
to college for actually implemented in the public school system. So I really struggled with it because I put so much time and effort into it. I wasn't seeing anything change and I knew what was best for the kids, especially being having the human development background. I knew that they needed to be outside playing. I knew that testing wasn't appropriate for them. So I was, you know, I was up on, I was up at the district office as often as possible telling, you know, the people that be.

Ela Richmond (02:08.694)  
Mm.

Ela Richmond (02:12.578)  
Hmm.

Peggy (02:36.607)  
You know, can we do something else? there any way we can avoid testing? You know, because I would spend a month of each year teaching the kids how to test, then giving the test, then, you know, just wasting such valuable time for these little people. And it just broke my heart. And then I had two babies of my own. One of them was born in 2020. And then my next one was born in 2021. And

Ela Richmond (02:47.19)  
Hmm.

Peggy (03:05.317)  
I went back to teach a little bit after I had my first baby. And it was this perspective that I had of being a mom that I just, couldn't support this thing that I was trying to change anymore because I knew it wouldn't be good for my kids, especially having a little boy in 2021. I knew that sitting behind desks and I knew that being...

tested and being told you're not good enough, you're failing here, here, and here over and over again was not developmentally appropriate. So I had to step back from that. It didn't match who I knew I was. It just didn't match my soul.

Ela Richmond (03:49.28)  
Wow. How long did that take for, so it was 12 years, but like, was it, you know, making its way into your head and just like your heart over that period of time or like, what was the experience of that? I mean, in the beginning you go in and you're like, I'm gonna change things, I'm gonna help, and then you're fighting this battle relentlessly. Did it ever get to you?

Peggy (04:15.659)  
It got to me but I always just thought that maybe we could change it at this little tiny level, right? And then it would impact everything else. But what I didn't realize was that we didn't have control. Like it didn't matter if I went to all the curriculum meetings and looked through the curriculum and documented you know how inappropriate something was curriculum wise. It wasn't... It was just going into like a box somewhere.

Right? Just someone wanted to say, okay, thank you for your complaint. We're not really going to do anything about it. And we know it's not right, but there's people with more money that have their hands in the game and it's not going to make a difference. So it just slowly tore away. Like I became a part of the union. I was a piece of that. was the, I was our school rep for the union and it was just, I tried every different avenue.

Ela Richmond (05:00.214)  
No.

Peggy (05:15.355)  
And the changes weren't happening. And I knew that it wasn't right for kids. I knew it wasn't developmentally appropriate. And I talked to people and they'd say, yep, you're right. It's not developmentally appropriate. And it wouldn't change anything. And so I just kind of, you know, you eventually go, all right, I can't change it from here. I have to do something better. And when you have those little babies that are then yours, right? And my friends started having babies and

These lives are not just kids walking through the door. They are the lives that you know will shape the future, right? You know you have to make a change. And I knew we could make that change and we had to make that change. We owe that to our kids.

Ela Richmond (06:06.198)  
Wow. You have said it's not developmentally appropriate. So what's an example of that? What is something that like, I mean doubly, what is an example of something where people agreed with you? It's like, yes, no, you're right. That is not the best way for us to do it, but for some reason we can't change.

Peggy (06:24.735)  
Well, the biggest ones that I fought for were like recess time, right? Or sitting at their desks for, we would do blocks of like an hour and a half and the kids would sit at their desks and they wouldn't get the opportunity to move. And, you know, we would have them walk down the hallway in their little lines instead of like moving, just walking like you do in a regular environment. That's not developmentally appropriate. And kids want to...

They want to move. They want to play. They want to talk to people walking down a hallway like, come on, you don't have to be single file walking down a hallway like you can teach them how to be respectful and they can understand that they can be they can empathize with someone and go, OK, that, you know, that makes sense. But just having them walk down the hallway in a single file line that, you know, that's something that I've shifted my perspective on. But then the 15 minutes of recess, the 20 minutes of

lunch and recess combined, you know, where the kids are rushing to eat their lunch and then they're rushing outside because they want to be outside because their bodies crave that. It's just giving them that time is so much more appropriate than what we were allowed in the system. And then also the testing that we would give them. my gosh, it took so much time to teach those little ones how to fill in a bubble and how to.

like show that they knew something and maybe they just got distracted and they knew the information but they didn't show it. And then we would pull their parents in and show their parents these test scores of things that we know the kids know or maybe it's not appropriate for them at their developmental level. And we would tell the parents over and over again all year. yep. You know, red was one of the colors that we didn't that was a negative color. Right. So it would think we'd give them their their paper and

it would be red in all areas. it's like seeing that as a parent would be defeating, but then seeing it as a kid, you can't quite comprehend what's going on, why you're getting these red scores, why you're getting all this negative feedback, right? And you can't really fix it. And it's like, well, if you give them a little recess time or give them something that is more appropriate for them or something they're really interested in, they're going to do much better. And you can build their confidence, which is something

Ela Richmond (08:35.927)  
Yes.

Peggy (08:49.343)  
that you kind of take away when you remove or when you're testing them and showing them that they can't do, you know, they can't sit there for an hour to do a test. Weird. They're five, six and seven year old. can't sit for longer than 20 minutes. So that all those pieces are just not developmentally appropriate. And looking back and the Apogee Utah that we are running now and looking back at the kids that I taught for 12 years.

I feel such guilt because I kept those kids in those seats, you know, and I've seen how much the kids can do now that they get to move and we get to play. And it just it breaks my heart that I did that to so many kids, but I'm going to fix it now. This is my opportunity.

Ela Richmond (09:40.834)  
Wow, that's powerful. And I definitely want to come back to that in a second, which you said that it breaks your heart. But before we go there, I want to touch back on the question of like, like whenever people are looking at the different components of the school system, or like a different components of educating your child, right, and everybody's education is going to look entirely unique because every child is entirely unique. But like the thing to think about is, OK, what are we actually trying to do here? What are we actually trying to teach? So you're talking about

know, single file lines and

And you briefly said, but I think it's actually a really interesting point, like we can teach self-respect, we can teach respect to others differently. Or like, what are the things that we're actually trying to teach and are there other ways that we can teach them? One of the things that you were also talking about is like failing, right? And like the association with failure that young people are making. And it reminded me of a post that Matt Bowman, who is our founder at OpenEd recently made. And he was basically like, we've failed to value

failing. We've made failing the worst thing that a young person can do. We've told them that their value comes from their scores and in doing so we've made a stressed and anxious generation so afraid of failing and trying anything out and I feel like that's very very accurate to what you're saying and like just reflecting on the question of what are we actually trying to teach here. Okay so like it was interesting I was at a friend's house and they have a young son and he came home one day and he was just crying and she's telling me this story.

Peggy (10:46.111)  
you

Ela Richmond (11:14.356)  
She was like, he was absolutely in tears because he didn't get to finish his lunch because it's 15 minutes. And she was like, administrators and the people, I went to talk them because I was like, OK, why is it 15 minutes? He doesn't have any time. They're like, well, he's gotten into kindergarten. He needs to learn that he can't just talk. He needs to eat. And so we've cut their time so that they can learn that they need to spend it correctly. to a degree, I understand. But then like,

The question is, OK, what are the underlying fundamental skills that they're learning there? And like, is that actually necessary? And is that important? And just being able to ask those questions is really, really, really valuable. So I want to go and now hit on what you were saying about it breaking your heart and the fact that you've been able to see what kids can do whenever they're given more freedom. How is the Apogee program structured and like, what have you seen inside of kids?

Peggy (12:10.553)  
So there's we've got a few kids that came from like your typical public school system. And then we've got a few kids that haven't ever been in the public school system. So they're just little kids, right? They're kids coming into someplace to be educated, to learn. Right. So we've been the first like eight weeks we went through kind of unschooling ourselves for those older kids. Right. Of like, guys, we don't

Ela Richmond (12:24.033)  
Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (12:34.295)  
Mmm.

Peggy (12:38.803)  
We don't need to ask to go to the restroom. If you need to go to the restroom, please go to the restroom. Be respectful, right? If we are having a conversation, you're not just gonna stand up and walk away and go to the restroom, right? Powerful skill, but it gives them this sense of like, hey, I own my body, right? And I am in charge of what's happening. Just like when you are in a corporate environment or when you get outside of that.

realm of 18 years old, right? You get to make decisions for yourself. Why we make kids wait till they're 18 to all of a sudden get all the decisions in the world doesn't make sense to me. But that's what we're working on, So we're working with these kids that came from public school and unschooling themselves. If you're thirsty, go get a drink, fill up your water bottle, just be respectful. know, learning these skills that are really important in life that

we just remove in the traditional system, right? And like even with lunch, you and eating food, we don't always get hungry at the same time every day. Right. Some days like you eat something and we're and you're really full that morning or you're not you don't wake up and you're super hungry. So we're trying to teach them to listen to their bodies as well so that they know when they're hungry. OK, we eat. We also give them an hour.

Ela Richmond (13:37.28)  
Mm-hmm.

Peggy (14:02.367)  
to eat their lunch and play. So they can even like eat a little bit of their lunch, go play, come back eat. And that's what a lot of our little ones try to end up doing. And it's really fun to watch just that dynamic of not like scarfing, scarfing, scarfing their food and then running and playing, right? Because all kids, it's just they're in their hearts to go and play. They love to play, they love to be outside. So we've been really working with them. But then like we've got this younger group of kids.

that are brand new to the schooling system or to like not being just at their mom with their mom or their dad all day, right? So they're coming in and they're trying to learn how to do things on their own and they're, you know, trying to find like that boundary. So we have that opportunity to show them like, okay, you need to listen to yourself, listen to your body, but you know, you don't get up, you don't.

Ela Richmond (14:48.972)  
Mm-hmm.

Peggy (14:58.259)  
walk away from somebody when you're speaking to them to go get a drink or go to the bathroom, right? So we have this really great dynamic that is teaching the big kids like this responsibility of themselves that they haven't had before. And also these little ones are learning responsibility for their bodies as well, but in a completely different way. So, you know, we don't want to make little lemmings for lack of a better word, but just follow what everybody else does. We want them to have their own

Ela Richmond (15:10.389)  
Hmm.

Peggy (15:27.485)  
mind and be able to think about, okay, think about the next step, right? If I get up and I walk away, I might miss something that the teacher, that the guide saying, or I might miss something that's happening in this lesson, you know? And those little risks that they start to take are really powerful because they, they learn so quickly from them. They learned from the failure of, I walked away during that, you know,

Ela Richmond (15:39.287)  
Mm-hmm.

Peggy (15:56.543)  
piece of the lesson and I missed it and or I walked away from something, you know, and they learn, next time I should go to the restroom during this time or, you know, but giving them that autonomy is so powerful to see. And like I said, it's just something I'm trying to make up for because I wasn't, I didn't do it when I was a public school educator.

Ela Richmond (16:06.676)  
Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (16:21.13)  
You mentioned a guide. I'm pretty familiar with the actin model. Is that very similar to actin?

Peggy (16:28.799)  
So we are, so our founder, Matt Boudreaux, he opened up a few Actons around the nation and he absolutely has nothing but great things to say about Actons. And from what I know, Actons are incredible schools. Matt just wanted to add a few pieces to that model. So we use guides or coaches. It just kind of depends on the location.

But Matt wanted to make it so that the parents, do whole family education. So the parents with the tuition get mentorship from the Apogee Network. And it's a 12 month mentorship program where you get different challenges each month that you get to complete if you choose. And if it's not for you, then you choose not to do it. It's not homework by any means, but it's just a way to kind of.

Ela Richmond (17:03.394)  
That's cool.

Peggy (17:27.699)  
grow as a family. So you get that piece and then Matt also really focuses, he knows the power of physical education, of moving your body, understanding the physiology of your mind and your body. And so he wanted to open up something that incorporated those two major pieces. So that's why.

Ela Richmond (17:31.374)  
huh.

Ela Richmond (17:52.15)  
That makes sense.

Peggy (17:53.545)  
So that's why there's a bit of that like act in language in there, but Matt wanted to add those additional pieces, which I think are really powerful and something that attracted both my husband and I to this particular model.

Ela Richmond (18:09.088)  
Yeah, I love that. wanted to dive a little deeper on the idea of a guide because I feel like lot of parents are wondering, what does it look like for me to be a good parent? What does it look like for me to be a good educator and home educator? Because a lot of them are doing the job on their own. I bet that there are insights that you can pull from being a guide. What does a good guide look like? What do they do? How do they engage with kids?

Peggy (18:33.407)  
sure.

I think the best piece of advice I could give, and this is just being like a parent and then also a guide at my apigee.

You've got to give kids more credit than you think they deserve. They're so capable that you just need to kind of remove yourself from that role of knowing everything, if that makes sense. Like, they can do it. They are capable. You've just got to step back and let them show you what they can do. So don't interject as much as you think you should.

Ela Richmond (19:11.884)  
Mm.

Peggy (19:16.411)  
I, you know, there were a lot of times in that first session that my other guide and I would look at each other and just be like, shh, just don't say anything. Like let them figure it out, you know? They can ask questions if they really get stuck, but then if they ask those questions, don't just give them the answer, you know? Ask them more questions. Guide them to what you think might be the right answer and they maybe will.

follow that route or maybe they're gonna come up with something better because they know some more information. So I would say just pull back more than you think you necessarily need to. Don't control so much.

Ela Richmond (19:57.418)  
Yeah, this makes me want to ask you more about the way that you educate. So like a lot of our listeners and a lot of the families inside of OpenEd are crafting their own education, you know, and they're trying to figure out what is the best way for me to do things. And some of them are encountering challenges like my kid doesn't want to read or my kid really has struggles with math. What have you found that's really helpful and or useful?

as tip and or to help kids just continue moving forward even when there are stuck points. Because like, let's be real, know, sometimes kids are not motivated. Sometimes they really don't want to do it. Yeah. So how do y'all, how do y'all deal with that?

Peggy (20:43.379)  
back to what you said earlier, you've got to let them fail. And through them failing, I think that they then, they fail forward, right? We just had our first showcase with our kids and we had to let a few of them fail. And through them failing us as guides, we also kind of felt like we were failing, right? Because they weren't.

Ela Richmond (20:57.25)  
Hmm.

Peggy (21:12.031)  
they weren't holding up to their standards, but with saying that and then failing, think, I don't think, I know they failed forward and then next time it's going to be even better for them and they learned, I think, a better way to approach our sessions and I really think that sometimes you have to let them fail. And also,

Ela Richmond (21:34.337)  
Mmm.

Peggy (21:41.641)  
help them find their passion. Through any passion that a kid finds, know, with what you were saying about reading, they find a passion. If they want to really learn a lot about something that they're passionate about, they're going to learn how to read. You know, they're going to learn how to do the math that might be associated with it. So I think you have to let the kids fail. And in that, you might feel like you're failing, but...

Ela Richmond (21:43.446)  
Mmm.

Ela Richmond (22:00.567)  
Yeah.

Peggy (22:11.581)  
I think it will be a huge accomplishment for the kids and you've got to find what they're passionate about. And I think they'll just soar based off of that.

Ela Richmond (22:23.434)  
Yeah, I would agree. I was listening to Isaac Morehouse. He was talking about his son and he was like every night that his son comes into

their room to like, you know, read a bedtime story. He's like, hey, he's like, how about you read to me tonight? And the kids like, I don't know how to read. And it's hilarious because he's like, literally, you know, a day that will go by and like, I'll see him reading his baseball cards. he's like, he sees them as two entirely different things. He's told himself that he doesn't know how to read, but he can read. But he reads the things that he wants to. And like that that's fascinating that like

Peggy (22:53.619)  
Sure.

Ela Richmond (23:06.144)  
I think the motivation piece, like why am I learning this, is such an important thing for kids. Growing up, there were definitely things that I just learned because I was told to, but the things that really stick and the things that I feel like enhance my life are the things that I have.

Peggy (23:19.743)  
Bye.

Peggy (23:26.559)  
it.

Ela Richmond (23:28.258)  
integrated into the things that I enjoy or like integrated into my passions. Like the things that really enhance my life. Like, I mean, I can recount, you know, the alphabet and like I can recount, you know, certain, certain like little quips from, from school and yes, I still remember them, but it doesn't enhance my life. And like finding the intersection between where the things that you're learning and, you know, your unique interests and passion can.

Peggy (23:40.969)  
Sure.

Ela Richmond (23:55.916)  
come together and enhance each other. That's where it's really cool.

Peggy (24:00.997)  
Absolutely. Yep. And you'll I mean, and even like in our studio spaces, right, we have four through 12 year olds, four year olds can't necessarily read. There's there are a few that can, sure, you know, but then we have the 12 year olds, right. And those four year olds look up to those 12 year olds and they're like, wow, look at that. Like he's reading something really interesting right now and something that really excites him and he can read it to me. I want to be able to do that one day. Right. So

Ela Richmond (24:29.878)  
Mm-hmm.

Peggy (24:30.831)  
That's another piece of that motivation, right? It maybe might not be a passion right now, but they see, like they think that other kid or, you know, they kind of have that interest of being in alignment with these other kids in the studio space, right? They want to be able to do what that other kid can do. It's a cool, unique little thing that that 12 year old can do, right? And it's just, I think the motivation can come from that piece too, but.

Yes, you make such good points. Just that intersection is really powerful.

Ela Richmond (25:00.822)  
Yeah.

Ela Richmond (25:06.702)  
So are all of your students together no matter what age?

Peggy (25:10.761)  
So we have two different studios. We have a four through six group of kids and then we have seven through 12 year olds in the other studio that is, we're spaced out at different points in the day, but there's quite a few times where we come together. Like we do our physiology first workout first thing in the morning. We do that all together. And then we do our lunchtime together and we have a Socratic discussion every day and we do that together.

gets a little wild. get a lot of differences between the four and 12 year olds. But I can't tell you, it is so fun to see like the 12 year olds interact with these four and five year olds and you know, the five year olds. We've got some of them that are the five year olds that are pretty shy. But man, these older kids, just the way they speak to these little ones, it just brings a whole different perspective to the education world of that, you know, everybody has to be.

Ela Richmond (25:41.896)  
Yeah, I can imagine.

Peggy (26:08.701)  
in the first grade on the same level all the time. They just learn and ebb and flow from each other so wonderfully. during like our work cycle where we're into like our more academic pieces, are in like this, we're more separate, but a lot of the day we integrate together, so.

Ela Richmond (26:11.233)  
Yeah.

Ela Richmond (26:29.37)  
that's awesome. And how would you explain the day in the life of an Apogee student? What does that look like?

Peggy (26:36.069)  
Okay, so we begin the day where we come into the studio and some of the kids are working on different pieces that they're interested in, you know, finding those, the things that they're passionate about. We have one kid that really likes RC cars. He's brought a few of his RC cars and he's been working on those, getting them back to working shape. We have some of the kids that really love to come in and breed.

Ela Richmond (26:38.39)  
Mm-hmm.

Peggy (27:02.089)  
Then we have those little ones, right, that want to come in and build something with the magnetiles. So we kind of come in and just work creating, you know, just kind of waking our bodies up, getting going, getting interested in the environment that we're in. And then we go outside and we do our physiology first workout and we then come back inside, do our work cycle. And we're all working on different areas, different pieces.

One of my favorite parts of this year is that we assessed, sorry, this is a random side note. But do you want me to finish a day in the life of it and then I can come back to that? Okay. One of my favorite parts was we were trying to figure out where each kid was in like this math book, you know, because we want math to be hands-on and so we assessed all the kids and we got them in these books and.

Ela Richmond (27:38.102)  
No, go for it.

Ela Richmond (27:42.89)  
No, no, keep on going, because I'm also intrigued.

Ela Richmond (27:50.53)  
Mmm.

Peggy (27:59.071)  
one or two of the kids we were watching struggle through these books and it was just like that frustration level was too much and it wasn't creating this space where we knew we wanted the kids to come to every day. So we pulled them back and we said, okay, we know this is what everybody says you should be on. Like this is your age and this is the grade you should be in. But we want to pull you back just like.

just a little bit, just one book, right? And we wanna see how this feels. And so we did that. And it took a few conversations of us explaining to them, listen, when you get outside of like your schooling years, nobody's gonna ask you what level you are. So please forget about the number on the front of this book. We want you to feel confident in your math skills. So please just, it took a lot of those conversations, but.

You know, after we pulled them back a level, we then had them start working through these books and these foundational skills that they were just they were just getting passed on in the traditional system, you know, that they just missed. We're building on those and we're making those solid and concrete, which I just love. So we're that's what's happening during this work cycle. It's that math and reading, writing, language arts piece. So that's.

Ela Richmond (29:18.751)  
Yeah.

Peggy (29:26.311)  
our work cycle, but I just really love that part where we're building these kids confidence and it's so great to see because they feel better about the knowledge they're gaining and it just is the confidence they're gaining in this one little aspect is translating to a lot of other pieces in the day, right? And confidence can take you so far in your life. And so we were really excited about that. But

Then after that, we do our lunch and our outdoor time, go just play, enjoy ourselves. And then in the afternoons, we do project-based learning, where we have a theme for a couple of weeks, and we focus on a project, and we dive into different pieces of the project and integrate all the core academics into that, but in a trickier way, I like to say, the kids.

get to it's that intersection you were talking about earlier, right? We're trying to find their passions and then integrate them into these projects so that then they're reading a little more. They're doing a little more math. They're learning about history, you know? And then we end the day with what we call character call outs where we let the kids call somebody out, say something that, you know, the other kids could have done to help them or just make them feel special. And our gratitude.

We do meditation, we read, and then we, it is our studio space. So we get to take responsibility and clean it up. We get to do the vacuuming, the wiping down, all this stuff that, you know, those magical custodians do when the lights go out at night in your traditional system. So we get to learn some life skills there of like cleaning, and this is our space. So it feels pretty magical to me when, when I came from the system that I did.

into this piece. It feels magical and just what it's what I want my kids to be in. I hope we can expand to a lot more kids in the future.

Ela Richmond (31:31.682)  
Why magical, specifically?

Peggy (31:35.891)  
Just because like I was saying, it feels developmentally what the kids should be doing. Kids should be playing. Kids should be kids. They have 18 short years of what we've told them they have to have before they move on to the real world. so I just love that we can put them where they need to be so that they can grow and they can experience the.

real world, but in an environment that's appropriate for them. And so I just, and the, you know, the play pieces for the kids, like my fourth or sixth year old studio, those little ones grow up so fast. The playing is so important and they love to play and they learn so many things through that. And I even have some of the older kids in the other studio come in and play sometimes. And it's like, you just, you don't get it for long.

Like me as a mom, sometimes I struggle to play, right? Because that's just something that's not a part of me anymore. And you only get so long to be a little kid. So why not let them enjoy that? And then, you know, throw in a few academics here and there for them to really pick up and find a passion towards something. And then really they just do it on their own. We're just there to guide them.

Ela Richmond (32:58.05)  
Yeah, I love that. The last thing I wanted to ask before I hit you with a couple of rapid fire questions was about trying to figure out, so well, I have two questions actually. I was going to pick one, but you know what? I have two. One of them was trying to figure out where each kid was, right? Like, I feel like that's really difficult for parents. They.

Peggy (33:14.416)  
Okay.

Ela Richmond (33:26.752)  
you know, don't want to measure their kids. They don't know how to figure out where their kids are. Maybe they pulled them out of a system and are like, OK, how do I even figure out what level you're at so I know where to start? How did you all do that inside of inside of Apogee?

Peggy (33:40.223)  
I'm gonna go get them.

Peggy (33:44.809)  
So this was really unique because this was our first year opening our campus, right? So we pulled the kids in and we're not in the system. So requesting transcripts, requesting test scores, any of that kind of stuff wasn't something that we did. And both myself and my other guide, we didn't really want to know, right? We both have the educational background, so we can kind of, we can talk to our kids, we can watch them, we can see what they can do.

Ela Richmond (33:49.862)  
huh.

Peggy (34:13.735)  
And we can quickly interpret that information and kind of go from there. But I could see like how a parent, right? They see other kids or they're wondering where their kids are, they're pulling them in to do the homeschooling aspect of life. I would say to watch the kids frustration level, right? Give them something, start someplace, and then if it's too easy, you're gonna know really quickly, right? Because they're just gonna go through it.

Ela Richmond (34:24.598)  
Yeah.

Peggy (34:42.377)  
But if they get to someplace where the frustration level is just too much and you know your kids, you know where that frustration is just at the, it's too much where they're not, where they're just gonna shut down, right? You don't want that to happen. So I would say it's just in the frustration level of that piece. And then there's a lot of online like pieces that you can go to these days. COVID really did show us that is that you can do a lot through.

online, you know, based off of like Khan Academy was one that we really leaned on and we said, okay, we'll go there. But then we also just my guide and I kind of went off of what we knew and watching the kids takes a couple of weeks and you can really learn where a kid is. And it's not just, you know, language arts, they're not in first grade level and math, they're at first grade level.

know, math they could be here and reading they could be here, but you know, then social skills and just, you know, the emotional skills and all of that. So just looking at all those pieces, but I am so grateful that we can do that at this campus and really provide the kids with what they deserve.

Ela Richmond (35:58.568)  
yeah. And the last question that I'm going to ask you before I hit you with a rapid fire, but technically this is kind of rapid fire. Can you give me a couple of examples of great Socratic discussion questions that you all have used? Because I feel like that is so impactful, that has been so impactful. for context, my littlest brother is the only one of my family that had an alternative education of any type. And he went to Acton. And Socratic discussions actually have

increased his confidence in just having a point of view and also being able to argue it or being able to explain it and share it. And also on the other side, being able to humble himself when he's wrong. what are some of your favorite Socratic discussion questions that you all have used so far?

Peggy (36:49.841)  
I love your question. I am going to. That's a hard one, though. So what we've been doing, because like I told you, a lot of our kids are coming from another system and we're trying to build confidence in the kids and we're trying to build that community through the first session. So most of our Socratic discussions were would you rather and why? And they have to pick a side. Right. That was our biggest challenge was.

Ela Richmond (37:03.03)  
Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (37:13.634)  
Mmm.

Peggy (37:19.368)  
we were telling the kids like, okay, would you rather be this or this? And they would have to pick one side. And that was really hard for a lot of them. And it was really hard for them to stand up and say, no, this is what I would actually do. And it doesn't matter that my friend is on the other side, right? So we were really trying to find that middle ground for them of it's okay to disagree. Back up your point, right?

Listen to everybody else and you can change your point of view, but stick solid with what you know in this moment, right? And so that's what we did a lot of building on this first session was would you rather, you know, would you rather live in a castle back in medieval times or in a cottage in medieval times, right? And then you'd have to tell why and kind of stick with that. And you could change.

your point of view, but you really had to stay solid on it. And I think that was really hard for a lot of our kids because it's hard to not, not necessarily not be liked, but it's hard to stand strong in an opinion that you have, right?

Ela Richmond (38:26.37)  
Yes.

Ela Richmond (38:36.052)  
Yeah, exactly.

Or mean even like granted like I even suffer from this sometimes where somebody will give me two options and I'm like, well, I could make an argument for both, you know, like I could choose both. It's just like, no, just pick a side, like pick one, go deep into it. And then like you can, you know, what's it called? Steel man argument and like the other side like that. But but having the confidence and the ability to just be like, OK, this is what I'm choosing.

Peggy (38:48.639)  
Exactly.

Peggy (38:58.623)  
Steel Man, Yep.

Ela Richmond (39:08.133)  
I think is really really important. I've put pressure on myself because for some reason I went through this period where my decision-making was so low just because I like I wanted to weigh every single potential variable and I think just having that confidence to be like look I'm not gonna know everything because that's life right it's like I'm not gonna know everything I can't know everything I can't weigh everything I'm just gonna pick something and it's gonna be good about I'm good enough so

Peggy (39:35.433)  
Yep.

Ela Richmond (39:36.33)  
I love that rapid fire questions very quickly. Did you always know that you wanted to work in education or was that something that came up eventually, something that you stumbled into?

Peggy (39:39.775)  
Okay.

Peggy (39:49.199)  
I knew from a very young age that I wanted to be an educator. So I was the little kid that would set up the classroom in her bedroom with all her stuffed animals. So I knew from a young age.

Ela Richmond (39:56.962)  
So cute.

Ela Richmond (40:01.024)  
I love that. What is the greatest thing that you've learned about parenting from Apogee and doing education and open education?

Peggy (40:11.967)  
growth is important no matter what way it comes and that you should always be growing. I was at a very stagnant point in my life. I had my kids, I'd gotten my degrees, I had, you know, I did all the check boxes, right? And I was, I then learned about Apogee and was hesitant to jump into it. And I learned that

If you're not growing, it's, it's, mean, what's the point really? Right? You should be growing in some way, shape or form. It shouldn't just be your little ones that are having to grow. But if you and your little ones are both growing, things are going to get better for everyone around you. So just that growth mindset, I'd really lost it. And the Apogee program just brought it right to my front door. And I am just.

excited with where I've gone just in the 11 months that I've been a part of the Apogee program, even outside of the Apogee campus. I'm just thrilled with where I am and how excited I am about the rest of my life that I'm not just checking off boxes anymore, that I'm growing and we're doing better things. so that's, I can't thank it enough.

Ela Richmond (41:30.38)  
I love that. What advice would you give?

yeah, mean like that's so impactful. What advice and or like what have you seen is valuable? like, there you're obviously not the only one that's experienced, you know, feeling stuck or feeling comfortable or feeling like, you know what, I don't feel the growth in myself as much as I used to. Where would you recommend somebody start if they're also feeling like, okay, maybe that's something that I'm willing to take on because you're right. Like being a parent that emulates the things that you want your kids to have. So it's like if I

want my kids to grow, I should be the one emulating growth. like, you if I want my kids to be excited about learning, I should be the one emulating, you know, that excitement. Things like that.

Peggy (42:10.855)  
Exactly. Yep, exactly. I mean...

Peggy (42:19.295)  
I just have to do like the shameless plug of the Apogee program. It's changed my life in ways I couldn't imagine. I'm healthier than I've ever been. I'm growing, I'm reading books like I've never read books before. And I just feel like my family is getting better. And I just think that what our nation needs is that growth mindset and we need strong families.

Ela Richmond (42:23.84)  
Mm-hmm.

Peggy (42:47.487)  
And I think that's what the Apogee program promotes. And they've allowed me that gift and I will keep telling and sharing that gift with anybody that will listen.

Ela Richmond (43:00.928)  
I love that. OK, and the last question that I have for you. What is a story of something that really has worked to help your kids learn something, either a kid inside of your program or a kid, one of your actual kids? What is something that has really helped them that you love?

Peggy (43:22.175)  
We need to go back to that same thing of failure. I, okay, I was, so my, what's that?

Ela Richmond (43:29.398)  
Or like a resource, potentially. Or like a resource, potentially. Like something that's really helped somebody learn maybe a resource, maybe a curriculum, maybe like a tactic. Something that people could use,

Peggy (43:44.187)  
Okay, explaining the why I think is really important. I think that we don't give our kids enough credit to understand why sometimes. And even if it's a really big concept, I think if you can teach them the why, they'll appreciate it so much more. Like we've been doing with our workouts with our kids. We've been telling them, you know, this is why we're doing this. This is how it helps you and how it will help you in your future.

Ela Richmond (44:01.516)  
Mm-hmm.

Peggy (44:13.531)  
Even though there's some days we get the, we got to do the workout. We got to run. We got to do the burpees or the pushups. They still, there's way more days that they just jump into it and they're so excited because they know the why. And so, and I think that applies for everything, you know, from potty training all the way up to learning all the rules of driving a car, right? If they know the why, it will be so much more powerful for them.

Ela Richmond (44:43.554)  
That's incredible. Thank you so much for coming on the podcast today. This has been so, so amazing to hear about you and your experience and especially the Apogee Network because we did have Matt Moudreaux on the podcast a little while ago and he shared some awesome things. He's great. He has an immense well of experience in this space. He knows what he believes and why he believes it I think that is one of the most important things, especially today. So thank

Peggy (44:58.376)  
He's incredible.

Peggy (45:13.383)  
Absolutely. Thank you, Ella. I appreciate it so much. It was nice talking with you and getting to know you a little bit.

Ela Richmond (45:13.508)  
Thank you so much.

Ela Richmond (45:18.114)  
Yeah. my gosh, yes. I'm going to leave probably some links in the description so that if anybody wants to check out Apogee, I do know that our open ed program does work with Apogee Utah. Is that correct? Do you have a couple students in there? Very cool. Well, yeah, if anybody wants to learn more, then they can go and find you. And I'm so glad that we got to do this.

Peggy (45:31.519)  
Yep. Yes ma'am.

Peggy (45:43.679)  
Thank you, Emma. I appreciate it.

  

  

## LinkedIN exceprts

Peggy: You've got to give kids more credit than you think they deserve. They're so capable that you just need to kind of remove yourself from that role of knowing everything, if that makes sense. Like, they can do it. They are capable. You've just got to step back and let them show you what they can do. So don't interject as much as you think you should.

Ela: Yeah, I would agree. How would you explain the day in the life of an Apogee student?

Peggy: We begin the day where we come into the studio and some of the kids are working on different pieces that they're interested in, finding those things that they're passionate about. We have one kid that really likes RC cars. He's brought a few of his RC cars and he's been working on those, getting them back to working shape. We have some of the kids that really love to come in and read. Then we have those little ones that want to come in and build something with the magnetiles. We kind of come in and just work creating, just kind of waking our bodies up, getting going, getting interested in the environment that we're in.

  

Peggy: Just because like I was saying, it feels developmentally what the kids should be doing. Kids should be playing. Kids should be kids. They have 18 short years of what we've told them they have to have before they move on to the real world. So I just love that we can put them where they need to be so that they can grow and they can experience the real world, but in an environment that's appropriate for them.

Ela: Can you give me examples of great Socratic discussion questions that you all have used?

Peggy: What we've been doing, because like I told you, a lot of our kids are coming from another system and we're trying to build confidence in the kids and we're trying to build that community through the first session. So most of our Socratic discussions were would you rather and why? And they have to pick a side. That was our biggest challenge. We were telling the kids like, okay, would you rather be this or this? And they would have to pick one side. And that was really hard for a lot of them. And it was really hard for them to stand up and say, no, this is what I would actually do.

  

Peggy: One of the biggest ones that I fought for were like recess time, right? Or sitting at their desks for, we would do blocks of like an hour and a half and the kids would sit at their desks and they wouldn't get the opportunity to move. And, you know, we would have them walk down the hallway in their little lines instead of like moving, just walking like you do in a regular environment. That's not developmentally appropriate. And kids want to move. They want to play. They want to talk to people walking down a hallway.

The 15 minutes of recess, the 20 minutes of lunch and recess combined, you know, where the kids are rushing to eat their lunch and then they're rushing outside because they want to be outside because their bodies crave that. It's just giving them that time is so much more appropriate than what we were allowed in the system.

Ela: How long did that take for, so it was 12 years, but like, was it, you know, making its way into your head and just like your heart over that period of time?

Peggy: It got to me but I always just thought that maybe we could change it at this little tiny level, right? And then it would impact everything else. But what I didn't realize was that we didn't have control. Like it didn't matter if I went to all the curriculum meetings and looked through the curriculum and documented how inappropriate something was curriculum wise. It wasn't... It was just going into like a box somewhere. Someone wanted to say, okay, thank you for your complaint. We're not really going to do anything about it.
