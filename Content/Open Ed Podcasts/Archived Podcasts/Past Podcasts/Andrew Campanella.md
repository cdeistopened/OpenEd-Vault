### Opening: School Choice as a Personal Decision [00:01]

**Ela Richmond:** Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm Ela Richmond, your sometimes host, and today I'm joined by Andrew Campanella. Thanks for being here.

**Andrew Campanella:** Thank you very much, Ela. I appreciate it.

**Ela:** Today I wanted to open up with one very specific question. Many people approach school choice as something very political, but in your opinion, it's not – it's something very human. What does choice mean to you, and what is its importance?

**Andrew:** We hear so much about school choice, and it's usually framed through the context of politics – somebody using it as a wedge to win an argument. At the National School Choice Awareness Foundation, we look at school choice as an intensely personal decision that a parent or caregiver makes for the benefit of their children. When a mother in the community chooses to send their child to a traditional public school, or the parent next door decides on a public charter school or private school – those aren't political decisions. They're personal decisions to help their kids pursue their dreams.

We want people to look at choosing schools as a matter of personal choice, just like deciding what park to visit on the weekend or what car to drive. Those aren't political decisions – they're personal choices. And so is school choice. That's how we frame it when we inform families about their options. We don't argue that one type of school is better than another, or that we need more options because one system isn't working. Instead, we emphasize that there are choices available, and families benefit from having these opportunities.

### Finding the Right Educational Fit [02:29]

**Ela:** The idea behind open education is that every family should have the flexibility to choose what works for them. There's an influx of options inside the education movement offering everything from charter to public to private to virtual to mix-and-match co-ops and homeschooling. How do you figure out what's right for you? For parents facing this critical moment in their kids' education, saying something's not working but unsure what will be the right fit – where do they start?

**Andrew:** The first place you need to start is by looking inward – examining your child, your family, and your hopes and goals for your child. Before considering school types or deciding whether one option is better than another, you need to identify your goals. Then work from there to identify what options are in your community and narrow your choices down.

We have numerous free resources on our website, [myschoolchoice.com](http://myschoolchoice.com/). We provide worksheets, state guides, and a seven-step process to help families find the right environment. It's not just about a school's test scores or what other people say – it's about what's right for your child as an individual learner.

### Breaking Traditional Education Models [03:50]

**Ela:** Inside of open education, we're really curious about the mental models people bring to these conversations. One thing we've encountered is the assumption that school has to look a certain way. How do you help people break free from these premises?

**Andrew:** That's an excellent question. This was a bigger challenge five years ago, before COVID. While nothing about COVID was good, it did help demonstrate to parents that there are different ways to educate kids. Some students thrived in alternative settings, while others struggled. This showed parents that we need to focus on what actually works.

What matters are the outcomes: your child's academic attainment, happiness, and ability to develop curiosity – which is really the building block of learning. If you can achieve these three things, the structure becomes less important. That's why we're seeing huge growth in microschools and mixed-and-matched learning right now.

We recently conducted a census-balanced survey of 2,800 parents and saw a 220% increase in interest in nontraditional education. Families are realizing things don't always have to look like they used to.

### Parents as Education Experts [05:15]

**Ela:** With this 220% jump in interest in alternative education, do you think parents are redefining their role in education as well?

**Andrew:** Absolutely. Parents are saying, "I am confident in different types of schools, but I won't trust until I verify, and I will trust myself more." That's what we want – we want parents to recognize that they know their kids better than anybody else. For decades, parents were told, either subtly or directly, that they didn't know enough to make good educational decisions for their kids.

During COVID, parents realized they are the only ones who can make these decisions because they know their children's strengths, weaknesses, challenges, and opportunities. They know what makes their kids happy. We're seeing a corresponding increase in awareness about school choice options, which was surprising but exciting.

### The Consumer Mindset in Education [06:12]

**Ela:** Going back to the beginning of school choice, why do you think parents haven't treated education as though they were consumers? We approach so many things as consumers, but education hasn't been one of them.

**Andrew:** There are two narratives here. First, parents didn't treat education as a consumer choice, and second, they were often blamed for not being involved enough in their children's education. These issues are connected – if you don't give parents initial choice in how they educate their kids, where they send them to school, and what model works best, you're telling them from the beginning that they aren't experts in this process.

But if you involve parents from the start, give them options, and let them pursue choices, you'll see more engaged parents. That's what we're seeing now with 25 states expanding school choice, more parents than ever looking at their options. These elements go hand in hand – parents need to remember they have choices and remind themselves constantly that they deserve a say.

### Rethinking Educational Success [07:31]

**Ela:** Every kid deserves the opportunity to choose what works best for them. What do you think we've gotten fundamentally wrong about educating kids? For instance, kids often go through school thinking they're "bad" at certain subjects, when really something just might not be working for them – whether it's the approach, teaching style, or classroom focus. What's wrong with our standardized, one-size-fits-all approach to education?

**Andrew:** I'll give you a gut answer rather than a policy answer. Think about a high school classroom with 25 or 30 students. A student takes a test – midterm or final – and gets a C or D. That grade goes on their report card, and they move on to the next grade or level. But they still haven't learned the material. Instead of finding a way to ensure they learn it, if it's really important, we just label them with a C or D and move on.

The grading system has been more punitive than designed to encourage knowledge acquisition. There must be a better way. If we really want people to learn things, we have to recognize that some people take longer to learn while others learn faster. Some students will achieve an A or B on the test more quickly. If education is truly about attaining knowledge, we need an approach that guides rather than labels.

### Immediate Intervention and Personalization [09:34]

**Ela:** So what are the right questions to ask to figure out a solution?

**Andrew:** We need to ask: if my child doesn't get a good grade on a test, how do we ensure they actually learn that information before moving to the next test? Some of this failure culture creates a snowball effect. A child might struggle in one or two classes, and not understanding that knowledge impacts years of their academic progression.

We need immediate intervention when there are challenges. This happens too rarely because people either don't want to figure it out or don't think it matters. This is why ensuring families have personalized, customized education for their children is so crucial.

### Breaking Free from the School Box: Reimagining Education [10:23]

**Ela:** Do you think we need to change conversations around education for people to understand how many opportunities exist for customization? Even in homeschool circles, families often start by trying to replicate traditional school because that's how they think school should work. What do we need to rethink to understand customized education properly?

**Andrew:** Families should explore different models and understand what's available in their community, even if they're not looking to make an immediate change. If you haven't been in a school environment recently, you'll find things have changed dramatically and there are many more options available. With homeschooling, for example, I wrote about this in my book where families often told me they couldn't homeschool because they didn't have specific hours available during the traditional school day.

When they learn there's no law requiring specific hours – that they can teach in the morning and evening, or on weekends – their eyes open wide. We often put things in mental boxes that don't need to be there, becoming our own worst enemy in terms of progress. Learning how other parents are approaching education can be incredibly helpful. We try to highlight these stories during School Choice Week each year, which is one of our foundation's three charitable programs. It's both fun and enlightening for people to see the available options.

### Inside School Choice Week: Opening Eyes to Possibilities [12:29]

**Ela:** Can you give us a sneak peek into School Choice Week? I'm excited – I saw there's one very close to me that I'll be attending. What opportunities are available for families during School Choice Week, and what resources can they access?

**Andrew:** National School Choice Week starts on January 26th – it's seven days, and this is our 15th anniversary. Every year, we work with more than 25,000 schools across the country, from traditional public schools to charter, magnet, private, online, home, and non-traditional schools. Everyone plans events and activities designed to raise awareness about educational opportunities in their communities. There are multi-sector school fairs and individual school celebrations.

Our goal is to shine the brightest possible spotlight on all the different ways kids can learn in this country and the options available to parents. Families can visit our [schoolchoiceweek.com](http://schoolchoiceweek.com/) website to find nearby events or learn about options in their state. We encourage families to start looking for new schools for the next school year now, rather than waiting until spring or summer – there are many benefits to starting earlier.

### The Power of Early Planning in Education [13:53]

**Ela:** That's true. We often see people identify that something's not working now, but they don't realize that unlike traditional schools, there's this amazing opportunity to use the time between now and the start of school to explore options, figure out what their kid likes, try different things, and start the year with a more informed approach rather than just saying, "Wait, where do we begin?"

**Andrew:** Exactly right. Another benefit of parents starting earlier is that they create a feedback loop for all the different types of schools. When a school sees strong parent demand, they can prepare to staff up for the next year. If schools don't hear this information until late summer, they may not be able to find additional teachers or expand their available seats. By starting early, everybody benefits – parents get more options because there are more seats, creating a positive synergy between searching, demand, and supply. I know it's cold and seems early to think about next school year, but it's really the right time.

### The Personal Journey to Educational Reform [15:18]

**Ela:** What has gotten you so passionate about this movement in education? Tell me about this journey.

**Andrew:** Aside from the caffeine, it's my own experience. I grew up in New Jersey, attended great traditional public schools, had amazing teachers, and I'm a huge champion of public education – as is our entire team. When I went to college in Washington, DC, I volunteered for a civics education program in DC schools. I met high school students who were the most earnest kids in the world, but they had challenges with reading and writing.

### The Moment That Changed Everything [15:30]

**Andrew:** One student told me they never had a teacher stay for the full year. I couldn't believe it – it was a complete shock. It jarred me. At that moment, I realized how privileged I was to attend a school that not only was considered good by others but actually worked for me. And how unfair it is for some kids to be stuck in schools that don't work for them.

From that moment, I knew I wanted to work in education. I never planned on it, didn't go to school for it – it never occurred to me. But I decided this was something I cared about. Why did I get these opportunities while others didn't? I started in teacher certification, which directly related to my experience with those kids – getting qualified teachers in the classroom. I did that for a few years before moving into multi-sector school choice, and I've been doing this work for over 20 years now.

### Breaking Through Misconceptions [17:02]

**Ela:** What was something that was the most surprising to you when you started working in this area?

**Andrew:** Honestly, the most surprising thing – and I'll be totally honest – is when I first got involved in education reform and talked to a recruiter for a job, I asked, "This isn't some crazy cultural movement, is it? I'm not joining some political crusade that might violate my beliefs?"

They said I should meet the people first, and I did. Throughout my 20 years in this movement, when I look at what opponents say about us, I have to laugh because it's so untrue. It's so untrue that we're advocates against one type of option and for another. I'm talking about the broader movement – obviously, our organization is pretty clearly in every camp. It just surprises me that this real movement of so many people who care deeply about kids' futures and their education isn't as well represented as it could be.

### The Human Element in Education [18:10]

**Ela:** I agree completely. Getting into this space, I have this fundamental belief that when individuals flourish, societies flourish, and that starts with childhood and education. But when you get to the nitty-gritty, every single human is different. Every person's perfect path looks different, and everyone will define that for themselves. When you have the freedom to make choices and bear the cost of those choices yourself – that's really important.

In this space and many others today, there are lots of strong beliefs, politics, and careful navigation to avoid saying the wrong thing. But at the most basic, fundamental level, this is just about humans. It's about humans succeeding, and when humans succeed, more humans succeed. That's the most important thing.

### Happiness as a Metric [19:12]

**Andrew:** I totally agree. I remember five to seven years ago, when I would speak about happiness, in some quarters I would see their eyes roll. I would say happiness is in our founding documents – the pursuit of happiness. It was important to our founders. But people looked at it as superfluous and unnecessary. This was right after No Child Left Behind and this achievement culture, which had its benefits, but also led to constant testing.

Talking about happiness was met with "Well, how do you measure happiness?" The truth is, parents can measure it for their own kids, kids can measure it for themselves, and families can measure it for their collective unit. This is about people, their lives, and their prosperity. All the ingredients matter – everything matters. We can't just focus on one factor; we have to look at all the different ingredients and ensure it's truly a good fit.

### Different Paths to Success [20:14]

**Ela:** Success looks different for everyone, and parents understand this implicitly. When you have multiple kids, you realize you just want them to be happy and fulfilled and successful – but success won't look the same for each child. One child might be fascinated by something specific – maybe success to them means becoming a doctor or lawyer. For another child, it might be something very different, like being very active in their community.

**Andrew:** Sure, so obviously there are legislative barriers. Some states just don't have enough choices. Some of these barriers include the lack of ability to transfer your child to a different public school outside your zone – open enrollment. People don't talk about it a lot, but it's important. States could do more. To me, it should be a nonpartisan issue.

There are artificial caps on programs like charter schools and private school choice, barriers that prevent microschools from opening, and onerous requirements on homeschooling families. Some states don't allow online schools to be charter schools. These are just some of the legislative and policy barriers.

There's also a big awareness gap. Unfortunately, lower-income families and disadvantaged families are less likely to know about the options available to them. That's one of the things we work on through our two awareness programs that operate year-round.

We also face transportation challenges. People don't want to talk about it within the movement, but it's a problem. We need to modernize transportation for education so it matches all the options provided. Programs need better administration too. We're seeing new and promising programs implemented in states, but the administration is lagging in terms of parents actually getting resources, information, and using the dollars effectively.

### Parent Advocacy [25:44]

**Ela:** What's the parent's role here? Let's say I'm an interested parent in options – all I want and care about is making sure that as many options are available to me and my family as possible so we can customize, build, mix and match whatever works best for us. What should I be aware of and doing to actively participate in what's happening in my state?

**Andrew:** First, follow along with what's going on. Most importantly, track how your child is doing in school, their progress, and how happy they are. Communicate with your child's teachers, get as involved as you can. These are the most important things. Follow along on the progress, and if you see opportunities being presented for families that you want to take advantage of but require legislative decisions, have your voice heard. Don't be afraid – every voice counts.

You might think it doesn't matter, that they have other people showing up, or these people are too important for your voice to matter. I'll tell you what – an authentic parent voice is ten times more powerful than somebody like me who does this for a living. People want to hear your story. They want to hear why a new option matters. Get out there and advocate for your child, your family, and for other kids you'll probably never have the chance to meet.

**Ela:** That's something actually very important that we're focusing on inside of OpenEd – because we give families so much choice, it's really important to highlight the stories of how they're using it. That's probably my favorite thing – there's almost no family using it in exactly the same way. There are families with many kids using it for every single one of them for flexibility in education. There are families dealing with medical conditions and illnesses that require flexibility.

I honestly think that's the key – how can we bring this back to the personal level? This is impacting humans, families, lives. That's something unique about this space – you get to share that. Everyone grew up in a family; it's not something people can't resonate with. Everyone grew up being educated. Everybody can resonate with the story of a family.

**Andrew:** That's right. Sometimes the stories that resonate most with parents aren't the hallmarky, sappy stories, even though those are beneficial, but just real practical things that worked for a kid. We always tend to go for the most dramatic possible story, and there are many out there, but parents need to be able to see themselves in these stories. Not every kid grew up in abject poverty, so we want school choice to be applicable to everybody, whether a child grew up in poverty or was in a middle-class family and the option just isn't working.

Parents need to be able to see themselves in those stories. So I encourage all the storytellers out there – don't discount your story because you don't think it's dramatic enough. If you can connect with people, that's what matters. It doesn't have to be an extreme example.

**Ela:** Yeah, and it's not even about connecting with people generally – it's connecting with somebody very specific. Maybe there's one other person who has a kid going through something very similar. To use my example, which I've used before on the podcast – my younger brother loves engineering and robotics. This has been his passion for so long. He started with very small things, taking free online courses, figuring out ways to do it without many resources. Then he started looking at other available resources through his school and other programs that have enriched his life so much.

Having the free options is great, but there are also so many other educational opportunities that people just don't even know about. If you can find those for your kids and then share them with somebody else or share what's working, even these small things – like even a small class, maybe it's a college class that your kid is taking or a summer camp or whatever – even these tiny things have the opportunity to change someone's whole life, to change someone's whole trajectory.
