Title:

This Professor Left Academia to Homeschool: The Neuroscience of Learning

  

### Excerpt:

### Thumbnail text:

NEUROSCIENTIST → HOMESCHOOL MOM

  

> "I got tenure so they couldn't fire me, so I quit."
> 
> – Dr. Claire Honeycutt

A tenured professor walks away from academia to homeschool her kids. Dr. Claire Honeycutt explains how her background in neuroscience revealed why traditional education often works against natural learning patterns, and what parents can do about it.

### Learn:

- Why handwriting activates different brain regions than typing and its impact on learning
- How exposure to complex language like Shakespeare shapes young minds
- The neuroscience behind why some "outdated" skills still matter for brain development
- When to push through resistance and when to change approach with struggling learners
- The balance between structure and freedom in educational environments
- Why ages 8-12 are crucial for developing learning patterns

## Transcript

Let me work on expanded clips first, then show notes, and finally article concepts.

EXPANDED CLIPS:

1. HANDWRITING & BRAIN DEVELOPMENT (with full context):

```Plain
"When you think about the brain, typing is actually a very different task than handwriting. When you're handwriting, you're actually having to deal with the postural control system, which is a lower part of your brain. And you're also having to use the parts of your brain that encode for speech... When kids are young, one of the most important things is trying to get as many parts of the brain to connect to each other as possible... We've demonstrated there's been a lot of studies around that people actually, when they're writing, they're more creative, they unlock different parts of their brain."
```

Social Caption:  
"A neuroscientist explains why your kid's brain develops differently when writing vs typing... 🧠"

1. SHAKESPEARE & LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT (expanded):

```Plain
"My kids are really into Shakespeare right now. They're 10 and they're 8. They're memorizing Shakespeare because I introduced it to them. The language, the children just love this language. They don't even fully understand what it means but it's so beautiful the way it sounds. He was very careful the way he would create words, complexes together... The reason my 10-year-old is a better writer than me is because her brain has been trained on this stuff."
```

Dr. Claire Honeycutt:

- Earned joint PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Georgia Tech and Emory School of Medicine, specializing in neuroscience
- Worked at Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, received NIH grant, and taught at Northwestern and Northeastern Illinois Universities, focusing on science-based teaching methods
- Served as Assistant Professor at Arizona State University's School of Biological and Health Systems Engineering, winning multiple teaching awards (Top 5% Faculty 2021/2023, Eric Guibeau Outstanding Teaching Award 2023)
- Began homeschooling her children in 2021 after observing their improved well-being during the 2020 pandemic lockdown
- Resigned from tenured position in May 2024 to focus on full-time homeschooling, running a science & history club for elementary students, and operating ClarifiEd, a platform to help parents become better teachers

Threads to pull

- Finding what lights your students/kids up
- Student motivation
- Intrinsic motivation
- Fostering a passion
- Grades versus education that changes your life
- Mental health and students
- Your kids don’t have to go to college (even though you’re a professor)

### ClarifiEd is for parents who👇

- Are seriously devoted to their kids’ education
- Want to raise formidable thinkers & generational leaders
- Desire the best of both ancient & modern teaching wisdom
- Are excited to take an active role in their child’s learning

### ClarifiEd is NOT for parents who👇

- Prefer to outsource responsibility for their kids’ education
- Are unwilling to be stretched or try new methods of teaching
- Expect quick fixes or one-size-fits-all solutions.
- See education as a box to check rather than a lifelong journey

I have 20 years experience not just teaching but improving teaching by developing new science-backed techniques. I’ve taught one-on-one and 150+ student classrooms. I’ve taught 5 year olds and graduate students.

### I quit my tenured Professor job to full-time homeschool my kids because I take my children’s education seriously, very seriously.

# Sample of posts:

https://www.theahimsamind.com/p/your-kids-math-program-wont-be-enough

Key arguments:

1. Modern professionals (like engineers) primarily use computers and functions to perform calculations, rather than doing them by hand (contrasting with Apollo 13 era where calculations were done manually)
2. However, the author strongly opposes eliminating traditional math education, drawing a parallel to how removing classic literature has harmed literacy
3. Instead, she proposes that students need to learn:
    - Understanding of mathematical concepts (like long division and calculus)
    - When and how to apply these techniques
    - How to program computers to perform these calculations
    - Critical thinking skills to validate computer-generated results

The author presents a compelling case for teaching history without focusing on date memorization, using her 10-year-old daughter as an example. Her daughter demonstrates comprehensive understanding of historical relationships and causality across various civilizations and time periods, despite never having memorized specific dates.

Key aspects her daughter understands include:

- The chronological relationship between major civilizations (Greeks vs Romans)
- Complex historical transitions (Roman Empire's fall, Byzantine Empire)
- Cross-cultural connections (like the link between Maori people and the Trojan War)
- Architectural history (Hagia Sofia, Versailles)
- Global historical developments across multiple continents and cultures

The author claims this deep understanding comes from using "The Classical Method" of teaching history, which she suggests creates a comprehensive mental model of how world events connect across time.

thread about why she homeschools her children, from her perspective as a university professor:

She outlines five main academic reasons:

1. Traditional Lecture Learning is Ineffective

- Promotes linear thinking
- Leads to students simply mimicking their teacher's thought patterns
- Results in poor conceptual understanding

1. Active Learning is Superior

- Involves projects, discussions, and experiments
- Increases both knowledge acquisition and retention
- Leads to deeper understanding

1. Mixed-Age Learning Environments are Beneficial

- Younger and older students learning together
- Older students benefit from teaching younger ones
- Promotes kindness and community-mindedness
- Develops caring attitudes and community values

1. Student-Directed Learning Builds Independence

- Gives students choice in what they study
- Increases intrinsic motivation
- Leads to deeper, more applied knowledge
- Students often choose more interesting subjects than teachers would plan
- Results in broader learning across more topics

1. Homeschooling Creates Engaged Citizens

- Produces adults who are "citizens of the world"
- Results in higher rates of community service and participation
- Develops people who actively work to improve society

## **The Ultimate Education Reading List**

"I'd been teaching for nearly 20 years when I started homeschooling my kids," writes veteran educator Dr. Claire Honeycutt on **[her Substack, ClarifiEd](https://www.theahimsamind.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=089-when-teachers-stop-teaching)**. "But teaching college students and teaching 5-year-olds? Turns out those are pretty different things."

Her candid reflection led to an essential reading list for parents diving into home education. Here are our top picks from her recommendations:

- _**[Wild + Free Family](https://amzn.to/4ftoPi5?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=089-when-teachers-stop-teaching)**_ by Ainsley Arment
- _**[How Children Learn](https://amzn.to/4hri2XS?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=089-when-teachers-stop-teaching)**_ by John Holt
- _**[Dumbing Us Down](https://amzn.to/4fkXSgc?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=089-when-teachers-stop-teaching)**_ by John Taylor Gatto

The full list includes 15 carefully chosen books covering everything from classical education to child development.

## **The Case Against Grammar Worksheets (And What To Do Instead)**

Remember the joys of learning about the past perfect progressive tense or diagramming prepositional phrases? Yeah… neither do we.

When **[Claire Honeycutt (@HippyMomPhD)](https://x.com/HippyMomPhD?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=088-the-case-against-grammar-worksheets-and-what-to-do-instead)** tweeted that "most kids don't need grammar lessons, they need great books," she sparked quite the debate. While we're neutral on specific educational approaches, she raises an interesting point:

Kids are learning machines. They picked up their first language without a single worksheet on gerunds. So we may be overthinking this whole grammar thing.

Here's a simple framework for the natural grammar approach:

1. Surround them with great books
2. Save formal grammar for when they need it (like learning a second language)
3. Focus on the practical stuff (yes, knowing where commas go is useful)

And if your kid genuinely loves diagramming sentences… that's cool too. We're all about letting learners follow their interests – even if those interests involve subordinate clauses.
