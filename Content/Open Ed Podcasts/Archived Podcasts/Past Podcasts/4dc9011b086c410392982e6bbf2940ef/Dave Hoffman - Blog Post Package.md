# Why a Public School Principal Told Me to Homeschool My Kids

_By Ela Richmond_

We put up the video for this podcast YouTube with a title that, admittedly, could be accused of clickbait: "[A Public School Administrator Reveals the Truth About Homeschooling.](https://youtu.be/Jks8gPht4n8)"

Very quickly, the comments flooded in with parents sharing their experiences. Clearly the message resonated. Dave Hoffman is a principal who not only _defended_ homeschooling and unschooling, but raised six kids outside the system while running the very schools he was supposed to defend. That tension — educator by day, homeschool dad by night — is the best argument I've heard for education freedom.

## From FBI Rejection to a Classroom Mission

Dave came to education almost by accident. He studied Spanish and communications because he wanted to join the FBI. He made it to the final interview with nine agents, failed, and suddenly had a degree with no plan. “I figured I’d teach while I waited,” he told me. “And I never reapplied. I started subbing in Salt Lake City, then we moved to Southern California so I could launch a full-time teaching career.”

He fell in love with the classroom fast. “I couldn’t believe I got paid to do it,” he said. He coached basketball and water polo, ran peer tutoring, covered hospital-homebound instruction — anything the school needed. Teaching Spanish, he refused to march page by page with the textbook. He cracked jokes, slowed down when the class needed it, and created the kind of room where teenagers begged to stay. This is the part of Dave’s story that sounds familiar to every great teacher I know. They live to watch the lightbulb flicker on.

## The Homeschooling Turn That Started in Kindergarten

The plot twist arrived with kindergarten. Dave and his wife, Diana, enrolled their oldest daughter in a charter school run by friends. Within weeks, their bubbly five-year-old turned sassy and distant. “We shadowed the class and thought, ‘There’s nothing happening here we couldn’t do at home,’” Dave said. “Her two younger sisters missed her like crazy. So we brought her back.” They tried first grade the next year; same result. Eventually the Hoffmans stopped trying to make conventional school fit. They joined local co-ops, stacked library cards, and slid toward full-time homeschooling.

To be precise, they slid toward unschooling. “If it looked anything like school, we threw it out,” Dave said. “Schooling and education are different things.” They stopped worrying about grade-level benchmarks and started chasing curiosity. The kids picked their own homeschool curriculum piecemeal: a welding class at the district’s ALC here, a debate league there, water polo with the local high school, mock trial sponsored by OpenEd. “We mixed and matched everything,” Dave said. “If something stopped working, we quit. If something lit them up, we doubled down.”

## Inside the Charter School Machine

Meanwhile, Dave climbed the administrative ladder. He wanted a bigger paycheck — six kids, one income — but he also wanted a larger impact. The reality was darker. “Half my time was discipline or damage control,” he said. “Parents came in hot. Teachers melted down in my office. I had the police on speed dial at supposedly ‘good’ charter schools. We dealt with theft, drugs, even staff affairs. The soap opera never stopped.” He loved assemblies, dances, and the rare hours spent observing great teachers. But the job made him an enforcer more than an educator.

## School Choice as an Education Freedom Strategy

That’s when the dissonance between the system and his own family became impossible to ignore. Dave watched his kids thrive in a homeschool community built on choice, while his campuses fought to keep attendance from slipping. He describes himself as a market realist. “Choice is already reshaping everything, and that’s a good thing,” he told me. “Education Savings Accounts and vouchers force every school — public, charter, private — to become the place families actually choose. Once schools operate in a competitive environment instead of a monopoly, innovation follows.”

Critics argue that school choice lets the privileged escape while everyone else stays stuck. Dave pushed back hard. “It’s limited thinking,” he said. “We had at least twenty percent special education students in every school I led — just like the neighborhood campuses. We took whoever came. We couldn’t turn them away even if we wanted to.” He pointed to the new wave of ESA programs leveling the financial playing field. “For decades I paid taxes into a system I never used because we homeschooled. Now those dollars can follow kids to micro-schools, pods, private campuses — whatever fits. Choice isn’t about skimming the cream. It’s about acknowledging families have different needs and letting them pursue them.”

## Designing a Mobile Homeschool Curriculum

What does pursuing it look like? In the Hoffman house, it looked like packing up and moving — repeatedly. Because Dave could get a teaching or principal job in any district, he treated geography like a curriculum. The family lived on five acres with chickens one year, downtown in another state the next. “All of it counted as education,” he said.

They Googled local homeschool groups, walked into curriculum stores, and let one introduction lead to a dozen more. “My oldest daughter only attended the local high school for two hours a day, but she was still homecoming queen,” he laughed. “She toured with a choir, competed in pageants, and did debate. The boys played sports, learned welding, knocked out college math online. We just kept asking, ‘What do you want to try next?’”

## The Myth of Learning Gaps

If you’re a rule-following parent, you might break out in hives hearing this. I did. Dave and Diana decided their kids would learn to read when they were ready, not when a scope-and-sequence said so. “All their Sunday school teachers worried because they couldn’t read at six,” Dave remembered. “We’d say, ‘We’re good. They’ll read when they’re ready.’ They all started around seven or eight, and then they never stopped. They still devour books.” When other parents warned that unschooling would leave “gaps,” Dave had a stock answer: “Everybody has gaps. The question is, can they learn and can they solve problems?”

That obsession with problem-solving might be the thread that ties Dave’s two lives together. “I work with grown adults who can’t think past, ‘What do you want me to do?’” he said. “They’ve been trained to wait for instructions.” His antidote is to let kids solve real problems early — build something, run an event, negotiate a schedule. That’s why he didn’t panic when his son struggled with algebra. “Now he does laser-leveled excavation for construction companies,” Dave said. “He calculates things that actually matter. None of my kids have gone to college. They all make more money than I do, and they’re happy.”

## BYU Independent Study and the New Homeschool Tools

Dave’s day job now is at BYU Independent Study, where he helps families stitch together custom learning plans without surrendering structure. The program has 215 middle and high school courses — everything from STEM to nine different language tracks to niche PE like cycling. But the secret sauce is a design framework he calls KSA: Knowledge, Skills, Attributes. “In biology, for example, they still learn the standards, but they also practice critical thinking and explore resilience,” he explained. Students can even earn micro-credentials for going deeper, a digital badge they can attach to scholarship apps or resumes. It’s the opposite of conveyor-belt schooling. It’s an à la carte menu for families who want academic rigor without losing flexibility.

And yes, he still breaks rules. “I work for a big institution — we’re not always agile,” he admitted. “We have set policies, and I buck them on behalf of the customer.” Last week he pushed through a scholarship for a fourteen-year-old foster student to take psychology. “Technically against policy,” he said. “But she’s about to age out. If she can take college classes now, she’ll see she’s smart enough to keep going. So I broke the policy, got her the scholarship, and she starts this year.” That, to me, is what real school leadership should look like: say yes first, then figure out the paperwork.

## Parents as Education Designers

I’m persuaded that the most interesting educators in America are the ones refusing to pick sides in the old wars of public versus private versus homeschool.

Dave Hoffman is still in the building. He’s also at his kitchen table. He’s designing programs at BYU while telling parents to pull their kids out if that’s what the child needs. The surprise isn’t that a principal supports homeschooling. The surprise is how obvious he makes it sound.

So here’s my invitation to you, especially if you feel your child is wilting in a classroom that was never built for them: become an education designer. Talk to the homeschool community down the street. Audit an online course. Ask for the exception. Bend the rule that isn’t serving your kid.

The future Dave describes isn’t one where schools disappear; it’s one where they have to earn our trust every single day. That’s a future worth choosing — and it starts with parents willing to do what the Hoffmans did: follow curiosity, trust competence over compliance, and say yes to the adventure.

## [00:25] The Accidental Teacher: An FBI Dream Deferred

**Ela Richmond:** Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm your sometimes host, Ela, and today I'm joined by Dave Hoffman. Dave, can you give us a little bit of a background? How did you get started in education?

**Dave Hoffman:** I got started in education after studying Spanish and communications with the grand goal of becoming an FBI agent. I took all the tests and got to the final interview with nine agents, but I didn't pass. It was a crazy time, and I thought, "What am I going to do?" I couldn't reapply for a year, so I decided to try teaching while I waited. I never reapplied to the FBI. I just continued to teach and eventually became an administrator. My career started with subbing in Salt Lake City before we moved to Southern California, where I began teaching full-time.

---

## [01:03] A Passion for the Classroom and the Rise of Choice

**Ela Richmond:** And why'd you stay in teaching?

**Dave Hoffman:** I just love teaching; it's one of my passions. I loved the interaction with the students—they got my humor, and I could joke with them. I couldn't believe I got paid to do it because it was fun every day. Granted, it was emotionally exhausting sometimes, but I'd get off at 3:30, go home in Southern California, and just jump in the pool to de-stress. It was a great time. I coached basketball and water polo and was involved in almost everything you could think of, from being the senior class advisor to a peer tutoring mentor. I pretty much did it all.

**Ela Richmond:** And you've also had experience in charter and private schools. What brought you to these different models of education?

**Dave Hoffman:** I was raised in public education, and at the time, there was nothing different. But as my own children were getting older, all of these choices started to appear. We realized we could customize education according to our kids' needs, and my wife and I really jumped on board with that. It opened my mind to different areas, and I thought, "Wow, these charter schools are serving a cool purpose."

That interest led me to work in charters and private schools. I worked at one charter where I taught at-risk boys from 7th to 12th grade, all in one class. Some were homeless. That was quite an experience; those kids really left an impression on me. Just seeing them get to school in a clean uniform was awesome. We did a lot of hands-on, experiential work with them. So I've been around the block with different kinds of education. And at the same time, I was homeschooling my own kids, which was never really popular with anyone in my professional realm.

---

## [04:35] The Homeschooling Catalyst: When Kindergarten Changed Everything

**Ela Richmond:** So why did you decide to homeschool initially? It sounds like your first step into alternative education was driven by an interest in choices. From my experience, most families don't intend to get into this space; it's more that they need other options because something isn't working for their kid. Why were you so intrigued by the idea of options?

**Dave Hoffman:** That's a good question. It started with our first daughter. We sent her to a local charter school for kindergarten, run by people we knew. We thought it would be great. But a couple of weeks in, her personality changed quite a bit. She became more aloof, kind of sassy, and we were wondering, "What's going on with our five-year-old?"

We visited the school and realized there was nothing about kindergarten we couldn't do at home. Plus, her two younger sisters missed her horribly. We felt we could provide a customized educational plan for our daughter while keeping her best friends—her siblings—with her. So it started there. We put her in first grade the next year, the same thing happened, and we thought, "Okay, we can do this first-grade stuff, too." It just kept going.

That got my mind going. Education isn't just about going to a school, listening to bells, and doing homework that might not be meaningful. I thought about my own education, and I couldn't remember hardly anything significant that changed me. Relationships did, and my efforts in athletics did, but on an academic level, I couldn't remember anything unless I had done something, gone somewhere, or built something meaningful. We realized there are so many ways to educate. We started reading books, attending conferences, and supplementing with so many different things. We became the biggest unschoolers that ever existed, even as I went to a school every day with bells, rules, and conveyor-belt learning.

---

## [08:15] The Rebel Within the System: Impacting Kids from the Inside

**Ela Richmond:** It seems almost contradictory. If I were a teacher next to you, I'd be confused. You were doing something so different at work than you were at home. Why the different approaches?

**Dave Hoffman:** For a few reasons. First, I felt I could still have a positive impact on kids in the classroom because my classroom was way different than the average one. Kids loved coming to my class. My work became very impactful, and I know it did from the letters I'd get from parents and students years later. I felt it was part of my mission. I was great at communicating and persuading kids to learn Spanish, and I made it the most fun class it could be while still learning a ton. We did things out of the ordinary. I was always behind the other teachers, and they'd say, "Hey, you're not on this chapter." I'd say, "I know, because we did this other activity that was more meaningful, and they know how to speak better because of it." So I was a bit of a rebel in the public school system, even while teaching in it.

At home, I didn't get a lot of flack for homeschooling. It was becoming more common. In fact, as I studied it, I learned that public school teachers and administrators homeschool their own kids at a higher rate than the general population. They see the other side and think, "Hey, I can provide better options for my kids, and I'm going to." So, it worked out great.

## [10:44] An Administrator's Life: More Money, More Problems

**Ela Richmond:** That's awesome. And then you ended up moving to Utah at some point. Where does that fit into the story?

**Dave Hoffman:** We moved around quite a bit because we homeschooled and we could. I could get a job anywhere. If we decided we wanted to move somewhere, I'd go there in the summer, interview, and have three or four job offers. We went from California to Colorado Springs, and I got offered jobs at all four districts I interviewed with. We were just on an adventure, seeing the country. In some places, we had five acres and a farmhouse; in others, we were in city neighborhoods. It was part of our kids' education. Eventually, we came back to Utah and, funnily enough, settled in my wife's quaint little hometown.

**Ela Richmond:** At a certain point, you started doing administrative work. What were you trying to change or impact in those roles?

**Dave Hoffman:** First of all, I was pursuing more money because I had to support six kids and a wife as a single-income family. Administration was the way to do it. But I also felt I could have a larger effect on the whole student body, not just the 150 kids in my classroom each year. And that did happen. I hosted assemblies, I spoke, and I was able to be more of an influence.

However, I disliked my administrative time because the majority of the work was negative. You have so many stakeholders to please, and it seemed like parents were always a little miffed. I had hard, emotional, negative meetings with parents. Teachers were always going AWOL on me, griping and crying. Then there was student discipline, which takes a ton of time. At one K-8 charter school, I told the board that over 50% of my time was spent on student interaction, but most of it was negative because it was about accountability and discipline. It's heavy, it's hard. At any local high school here in Utah, I dealt with the police on a monthly basis. I had them on speed dial for everything from theft to drugs. You could not believe what goes on in a typical high school, even a great one.

Kids will be kids, but even adults... I ended up firing adults for stealing computers and pawning them off. I had to fire a lady for busting into the state reporting system and changing student data. It's just crazy. Affairs between teachers... it was like a soap opera. Dealing with that on an administrative level was heavy and not enjoyable. The great parts were the time with kids at activities, dances, and assemblies, or being in classrooms as an instructional leader. But a lot of the administrative stuff was just heavy and negative.

## [16:02] Why Competition Will Save Public Schools

**Ela Richmond:** Despite those challenges, you seem very optimistic about where education is headed. Where would you like to see public and traditional charter schools going?

**Dave Hoffman:** That's a great question. The fact that there's now choice in where you can send your student—with ESAs and voucher-like systems—is forcing all schools (public, charter, and private) to be the best they can be. They have to offer a product that students and parents actually want. The more that public schools have to participate in a competitive market instead of acting as monopolies, the better the product will be. We'll get more innovative thinking and better educational opportunities. Ultimately, that creativity and innovation will make the jobs of teachers and administrators more fulfilling.

If you have a hamburger business next to McDonald's and you sell crappy hamburgers, you're not going to stay in business. Closing a public school here or there isn't a bad thing; it's a great thing, because the other schools will become stronger. They see that kids don't have to come here anymore. Choice is causing real improvement.

**Ela Richmond:** I've spoken with people who are very opposed to choice. They argue that when you give people the ability to choose, the most privileged families leave, and everyone else is left to miss out in a failing system. What's your take on that?

**Dave Hoffman:** That's very limited thinking. I was accused of that all the time at charter schools—of skimming the cream off the top. But I'll tell you what: 20% of the population at every school I ever administered was special education, with an IEP or 504, just like the public schools. You can't refuse anyone in a public charter school. If a parent says, "I want the small class size, the leadership program, the service element for my child," you take that child and help them rise to the occasion. So I don't buy that choice skims the cream.

Obviously, those with more means can afford private school, but charter schools are free. And there are unique charters for every need: for pregnant teens, for special education, for autism, for STEM, for leadership. They're built to be a special magnet that attracts you. Furthermore, programs like the Utah Fits All ESA are leveling the playing field. They're taking government funds to help the average family afford private school or other alternatives. For 27 years, I homeschooled my kids and never got a dime of public money, but I paid my taxes just like everyone else. ESAs give every family a chance to find the right fit.

---

## [23:18] Becoming the Education Designer: A Proactive Approach

**Ela Richmond:** I've seen this move toward a consumer view of education, where parents can mix and match to create a custom-built experience. How can parents start thinking of themselves as "education designers" instead of just dropping their kids off?

**Dave Hoffman:** The first thing is that parents have to be proactive. They can't just default to what's always been done, because when we do what's always been done, we get the same result. Parents have to think, "Hey, these alternatives exist." All they have to do is Google. It's not hard to find things. But you have to be engaged. If I didn't care what my kids learned, how they learned, or the social influences they had, I would default to what was easiest—just put them on the bus and not worry about it. Parents have to think beyond that and do the research if they want the best for their kids.

And there are a ton of options. My oldest daughter was homecoming queen, but she only went to the school for two hours a day. She sang in a traveling choir and participated in local pageants. My sons played on local sports teams. We picked and chose exactly what we wanted. They were in debate leagues, did mock trials, and one of my sons even took welding classes from the local school district. We encouraged them to follow their passions. Some things didn't work, and we just pulled them out. But some things were great, and the other kids would want to do them, too.

And you know what? None of my kids have gone to college because they haven't seen the need to. They followed their passions, went an alternative route, and saw that book learning wasn't the only way. They all make more money than I do—and I have an undergraduate degree, a teaching credential, and a master's. They have everything from construction to modeling in my family, and they all do really well.

---

## [29:15] The Unschooling Playbook: No Master Plan, Just Passion

**Ela Richmond:** From a practical standpoint, how did you and your wife introduce your kids to enough things to expand their palette and help them find their interests? Was there a master plan?

**Dave Hoffman:** We were the most unschooling homeschoolers that ever existed. If it looked anything like school, we threw it out the window. We defined schooling and education very differently. Anything that looked like real education, real learning, and passion, we fostered. It wasn't a master plan; it was about being around like-minded people who would do their own research and share what they found. Once you get involved in that realm, there are so many opportunities.

Our plan was to encourage a growth mindset—the idea that if you're bad at something, it's only because you haven't done it long enough or tried hard enough. My son thought math wasn't for him, but he found a curriculum called Teaching Textbooks that helped him a ton. He ended up getting a B+ in college algebra, a class I never passed. He found something that worked for him. Not one of our kids did the same math program in high school; we just let them do what worked.

My kids consumed library books at an insane level because we never pushed them. All their Sunday school teachers worried because they couldn't read at age six. We'd say, "We're good. They'll read when they're ready." And they all started reading around seven or eight, and then they never stopped. They still read tons and learn on their own. Sometimes, doing things a different way pays off.

## [33:23] Fearless Parenting: Why We Weren't Afraid to Break the Rules

**Ela Richmond:** A lot of families are afraid of that unpredictability. When you homeschool, you bear the full burden of responsibility if your kid doesn't turn out "correctly." Why were you and your wife so comfortable with what many would consider risky choices, like letting your kids read on their own timeline?

**Dave Hoffman:** First, it was probably my wife's personality. She's a Pippi Longstocking at heart; if she had her way, we'd be gypsies traveling in a tent. She's fun-loving and carefree. I was more regimented and left-brained, always thinking we needed structure. But then I learned that kids hate being forced to do anything. It's human nature to rebel. So we just decided to set things out there for them and let them make their own decisions.

We just weren't scared about how it would turn out. We had a lot of support through our homeschool community and saw other kids thriving. Our kids interacted with everyone just fine; they were almost _too_ social. There was just no fear that it wouldn't turn out right.

People, especially teachers, would worry. They'd say a homeschooled kid has "gaps" in their learning. But who says algebra has to come before geometry? My son wasn't great at textbook math, but now he does construction and uses laser-leveled excavation, calculating things that actually mean something. He's great at solving problems. If you teach kids to solve problems, you don't have to worry about the textbook learning. I work with grown adults right now who can't think past, "What do you want me to do on this?" They can't create a strategy because they've learned how to learn differently—they've learned to be told what to do, and they're good at that, but not at solving problems.

---

## [38:05] Breaking the Box: Why the World Needs Problem-Solvers

**Ela Richmond:** It's fascinating because the requirements for work have changed the way we approach school, and vice versa. We've created a system that values predictability, putting workers in boxes where they are told exactly what to do. The result is that we're missing out on developing crucial skills, like the confidence to take a risk and bear the responsibility for a decision. Instead of confident individuals, we have kids who can check boxes.

**Dave Hoffman:** Oh yeah, my kids are super strong and confident. They might be wrong, but they're confident they're going to succeed. I've learned that at Google, they offer 20% of an employee's time as innovative time to work on anything they want. That's where the "Search Inside Yourself" emotional intelligence program came from—an engineer wanted to solve that problem. He eventually left and now makes millions. That came from an innovative approach that says, "You don't have to work in the box."

I fight that at my work all the time. I work for a big institution, BYU, and because we're big, we're not always agile or creative. We have set policies, and I buck them all the time on behalf of the customer. Just yesterday, I gave a 14-year-old a scholarship for a university course. That's against policy. But this was a foster child who was going to age out of the system without much of a future. If she could take some college classes now, it might show her she's intelligent enough to get an education. So, I bucked the policies, got the kid the scholarship, and she's starting a psychology course this year.

I did the exact same thing in public school. I'd just bust through the fences. If you can talk people into it and show it's better for the kids, a lot of times your superiors will say, "Let's try it." And a lot of it worked.

---

## [41:10] The Future is Flexible: Final Thoughts

**Ela Richmond:** That's a great place to end. What are you working on now, and where can people find you?

**Dave Hoffman:** I work for BYU, and we have an online high school and a middle school program. We also have a program called BYU Flex, which is a concurrent enrollment program where kids can earn college credit while in high school. It's a great way for them to get ahead. My son did it and started college with 30 credits. We have students from all over the world taking these classes.

My advice to parents is to trust your gut. You know what's best for your kids. You're the one who tucks them in at night. Don't let anyone—not a teacher, not a principal, not a school board member—tell you what's right for your child. Do your research, find what works, and don't be afraid to do something different. It's your kid, and you're in charge.

**Ela:** Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. I'm your sometimes host, Ela, and today I'm joined by Dave Hoffman. Dave, can you give us a little bit of a background? How did you get started in education?

**Dave:** I got started in education when I studied Spanish and wanted to be an FBI agent. That was my grand goal. I took all the tests and got to the final interview with nine agents, but I didn't pass. It was a crazy time and I thought, "What am I going to do?" Because I couldn't reapply for a year. I had a Spanish degree and a communications degree—that's what I was going to the FBI for. I thought, "Well, I'll teach while I'm waiting."

I never reapplied to the FBI. I continued to teach and became an administrator. I started subbing in Salt Lake City a little bit, then we moved to Southern California to start my teaching career.

**Ela:** Why'd you stay in teaching?

**Dave:** I love teaching. It's one of my passions. I love the interaction with the students. They get my humor and I can joke with them. Teaching was like—I couldn't believe I got paid to teach because it was fun every day. Granted, it was emotionally exhausting sometimes and I would come home dead. But I got off at 3:30 or 4, right? So I'd go home in Southern California and jump in the pool. I de-stressed quickly.

It was a great time. I coached high school basketball and water polo. I participated in almost everything you could think of—from home and hospital teaching to water polo coach to senior class advisor to peer tutoring mentor. I pretty much did it all.

**Ela:** You've also had experience in charter and private schools. What brought you to these different sides of education? You were a teacher, then an admin, and then suddenly you start foraying into these different models of education.

**Dave:** I was raised through public education, as was my whole family. We knew nothing different at the time—there was nothing different at the time. But in the days when my children were young, there started to be all these choices in education. All these things we could participate in that let us customize education according to our kids' needs.

My wife and I really jumped on board with that. It took my mind into different areas. I thought, "Wow, these charter schools are serving a cool purpose." I wanted to try teaching and maybe being a principal in one that aligned with our values or our focus. My kids attended some of those schools. As we homeschooled, they would come with a partial schedule or even attended full year at a couple of them.

Thinking about alternative ways to educate got me interested in working at charters and private schools. I worked at a charter where I taught seventh through twelfth grade boys all in one class—all at-risk kids. Some were homeless in Southern California. That was quite an experience. Those kids really left an impression on me. Just the fact that they could get to school, that they could get a uniform that complied with school policies—it was awesome. We did a lot of hands-on, exploratory, experiential stuff with those kids.

I've been around the block with different kinds of education. At the same time, I homeschooled my kids, which was never really popular with anybody in my realm.

**Ela:** So I'll ask about why you decided to homeschool initially. It sounds like you were interested in choices—that was your initial step into this alternative education space, customizing your own education. From my experience, the majority of families I talk to didn't intend to get into this. It was just kind of like, "I need other options. I need to find something else because something's really not working for my kid." Why were you so intrigued by just the idea of options? Why was that something so interesting to you that you were like, "We don't necessarily need it, nobody's struggling too bad, but why not step into this?"

**Dave:** There are many reasons for that. First, my first daughter went to kindergarten at a local charter school run by people we knew. We thought it would be great. A couple weeks in, her personality changed quite a bit. She became more aloof and kind of sassy. We were like, "What's going on with our five-year-old?"

We visited the school, shadowed a few days, and thought, "You know what? There's nothing about kindergarten that we couldn't do at home. And her two sisters miss her horribly." So it was a combination of thinking we could provide a customized educational plan for our daughter, and she could still remain best friends with her siblings who weren't in school yet.

It started there. We put her in first grade and the same thing happened. We thought, "Okay, we can do this first grade stuff too. This is easy." It just kept going and going. We figured out a lot of things. We participated in co-ops that helped support us in the homeschool world.

It really got my mind going—that education really isn't going to a school and listening to bells ringing, going class to class, having homework that may not be very meaningful. I thought about my own education. I could not remember hardly anything. There was nothing significant about my childhood education that really changed me. Relationships did. Sometimes my efforts in athletics did because those were very memorable, poignant times that etched history into my heart. But for the most part, I couldn't remember anything from middle school and high school, let alone elementary—unless I had done something or gone somewhere or built something that formed an impression on me.

There are so many ways to educate. We started reading books and attending conferences. We supplemented with so many different things. Our kids did so many different things. We became non-diploma seekers. We became the biggest unschoolers that ever existed. And I went to a school every day with bells and policies and rules and conveyor belt learning.

**Ela:** Why? It almost seems confusing. If I was a teacher next to you asking questions about the way you're educating, I'd be kind of like, "Wait, what? You're doing something that is so different for work than you are at home." Why did you do that differently?

**Dave:** A few reasons. First, I feel like I could still have an impact on kids in the classroom because my classroom was way different than the average classroom. Kids loved coming to my class. I sponsored everything. My work became very impactful on other kids—I know it did from letters from parents, even years later, saying "You had such an impact" and "This little thing you did, I'm so grateful."

Teaching—I was great at communicating, great at persuading kids to learn my subject. I took nothing too personally. We were going to learn Spanish because I taught Spanish in high school, and it was going to be the most fun class I could make it while still learning a ton. We were going to do things out of the ordinary. I was always behind the other teachers and they would say, "Hey, you're behind, you're not on this chapter." And I'd say, "I know, because we did this and this and this, which was more meaningful, and they know how to speak better because I did this."

I was a little bit of a rebel in the old public school system, even though I taught in it. At home, I really didn't get a lot of flack for keeping my kids at home. Nobody really cared. It was becoming in vogue a little bit. I learned as I was studying homeschooling that public school teachers and administrators homeschool their kids at a higher percent ratio than just the average person. I thought, "Well, there you go." They know why they want to. They see the other side and think, "Hey, I can provide options for my kids and I'm going to."

**Ela:** That's awesome. And then you ended up moving to Utah at some point. Where does that fit into the story?

**Dave:** We actually moved around quite a bit because we homeschooled and we could—I could get a job anywhere. Seriously, if we decided we wanted to move somewhere, I would go there in the summer and interview and have three or four offers. First instance, we went to Colorado Springs from California and I interviewed at four different districts. I got offered jobs at all four districts. I could take my choice.

We were just on an adventure. Let's go see the country a little bit. In some places we had five acres and a farmhouse, other places we were in neighborhoods, sometimes in cities and downtown. We got to see a lot of the world, and I think that was part of our kids' education. Coming back to Utah, we'd done enough of that. We thought, "Let's just go back." It's funny because we ended up settling in my wife's hometown. We'd always been looking for a quaint little town to settle in, and lo and behold, it was where my wife came from.

**Ela:** So you've done a lot of work inside public schools, inside charter schools, and at a certain point you started doing administrative work. What were the different things you were trying to change and impact? Were you trying to help teachers see the classroom more like you did, where you would go a little bit slower sometimes, but it would be fun? What were you actively pursuing as an administrator in all these roles?

**Dave:** First of all, I was pursuing more money because I had to support six kids and a wife at home. We were a single-income family, and administration was the way to do it. But also, I felt like I could have a larger effect on the whole student body instead of just the 150 kids they would shovel through my classroom every year.

That really did happen. I could do that. I hosted assemblies, I spoke, I was able to be more of an influence as an administrator. Even though my administrative time I disliked because—I'll say this—the majority of the work I did was negative work.

You have so many constituencies you need to please, stakeholders you need to be responsible to. It seemed like parents were always just a little bit miffed. There was always somebody who wasn't getting treated right. I had all kinds of hard, emotional, negative meetings with parents. Teachers were always going AWOL on me—they would come in and gripe and cry about things in their life or the situation or the kid or whatever.

Then I was doing discipline at school. Discipline takes a ton of time. At one charter school, a K-8, I told the board, "Look, I'm spending 50 percent or more of my time with student interaction, but most of it's negative because it has to do with accountability and discipline. It's heavy, it's hard, I need help."

**Ela:** What?

**Dave:** You would not believe. At any local high school here in Utah, I dealt with the police on a monthly basis. We didn't have a student resource officer—I had the police on speed dial. Everything from theft to drugs to—you couldn't believe what goes on in a typical high school. And these are great high schools. These are leadership high schools or charter high schools built to serve a community that's a little closer, where the kids maybe are a little more motivated.

Holy cow. Kids will be kids and they'll make dumb decisions—even adults. I ended up firing adults for stealing computers and pawning them off at local pawn shops. I fired someone for changing students' grades on the state website for their whole career. She busted into the state reporting system. It's just crazy. Affairs at schools where two teachers have to be fired. It was like a soap opera. Dealing with that on an administrative level was heavy. Not enjoyable.

I liked time with the kids and activities—hosting dances, assemblies, being in a classroom as an instructional leader. That was great. But to tell you the truth, a lot of administrative stuff was heavy and negative.

**Ela:** It sounds like it. What is the future that you'd love to see inside of public schools? Because I know you're very future thinking, future forward. And from our past conversations, you also are very optimistic about where education is headed. You've seen the trends, you've seen how it's evolved. Where would you like to see public schools and traditional charter schools going?

**Dave:** The fact that there's choice in where you can send your student now, and there's all these ESAs where the money's like a voucher system—I think that's going to force and is forcing schools, both public charter and private, to be the best they can be. To be a product that students want to come to and parents want to send their kids to.

I think the more that public schools participate in the capitalist society we live in and aren't monopolies, we'll get a better product. We'll get more innovative thinking. We'll get better educational opportunities for the kids. And ultimately, because of the creativity and innovation, teachers and administrators will be happier. It will be more fulfilling.

I feel like that's the way things need to go, and I feel like they're going that way. That's great. If you have a hamburger business right next to McDonald's and you sell crappy hamburgers, you're not going to have a business. To close a school down here or there, a public school, is not a bad thing. That's a great thing actually, because the other schools are going to become stronger, no matter what kind of schools they are. They see that kids are making the decision now—they don't have to come here. We can't force them to come here.

Choice has become embedded into our school systems, and it's really causing improvement, innovative thinking, new forms and styles and opportunities for kids.

**Ela:** That's super fascinating. I've had conversations with people who are quite opposed to choice, actually. Something they say—which I'd love your take on because you've been in the administrative role, you're not opposed to public schools, you've been inside them for so long—is that once you give people the ability to choose, you take out the structure that exists. The people who are the most privileged will be the ones who can leave, and everybody else stays and misses out.

Whenever you were talking about how it's not bad for a public school to close, I've had this conversation before and people will throw at me, "But what about all these families that are going to lose out and whose parents don't care as much?" What have you seen in this choice movement that makes you have other opinions?

**Dave:** I think that's really limited thinking. I got accused of that all the time at charter schools—of skimming the cream off the top of the student body and taking the elite because they wanted to come to my school and wanted a different experience.

You know what? I'll tell you—I had 20 percent of the population of every school I ever administered at that was special education. They had an IEP or 504 just like my public school did. We pulled in anybody. You can't refuse anybody in a public school. You can't say, "No, you can't come." You can say, "Hey, this is what we do. We think the school might be too hard for you or might not fit your values." But you can't say you can't come.

If mom and dad say, "I don't care. I want the small classroom size. I want the leadership program. I want the service element. I want all of this for my child," you take that child and try to help them rise to that level.

I don't buy into the fact that choice skims the cream off the top. Obviously, those with more means could afford private school. But charter schools are free to everyone. There are unique charters for everything—from teen pregnant schools to special education schools to autistic schools to deaf schools to leadership schools to STEM schools. You could pick something that fits your fancy. That's what they're all built for—to have a special magnet that attracts you to them.

With Utah's Fits All program, they're taking government funds and helping the average homeschool kid or private school kid pay for alternative education. I homeschooled for 27 years and never got a dime of public money except in the last couple years when I worked with MyTech High and Open Ed. Other than that, I paid taxes just like everybody else and never benefited one ounce from the local schools.

I think the ESAs are leveling the playing field. Some of them are more lucrative, and most offer the standard child a chance to do anything. If you want to homeschool or private school or a country day school and can't afford it, you can take these monies and try to do it. I think that's the way it should be.
