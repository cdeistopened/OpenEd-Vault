        Speakers: Stop wasting people's time with small talk 🔥  
          
        When someone gives you their attention, they're literally giving you a portion of their LIFESPAN.  
          
        Don't fumble it with "thank you for having me" and all those filler words.  
          
        BE A THERMOSTAT. SET THE TEMPERATURE.  
          
        Come in there and SET IT OFF from the jump. Set the tone. When you do that? They start raising their temperature to match YOURS.  
          
        I gave this advice recently on the @openedhq podcast. They're building a movement of engaged parents transforming their kids education.  
          
        But this applies whether you're:  
        → Speaking to a crowd of thousands  
        → Defending your parenting choices at a family dinner  
        → Advocating for your kid's education  
        → Having any conversation that matters  
          
        Don't reflect the energy in the room. CREATE the energy you want.  
          
        People don't move unless they're moved emotionally. It don't matter what facts you got. Move them FIRST.

        ```Plain
        "What if there was a different way to have my child self-direct their own learning?"
        
        That question changed everything for our family.
        
        I couldn't unhear it after Matt Bowman planted that seed. Here I was, a transformation speaker who helps people break free from limiting systems, but I was accepting traditional school as the only option for my kids.
        
        When Matt suggested I could pull them out for educational adventures, my first thought was: "This dude is trying to get my kids expelled."
        
        But that "what if" question sat with me.
        
        What if it wasn't career suicide or sabotage? What if it wasn't closing doors or shutting down opportunities? What if it was actually one of the most powerful, empowering things we could do?
        
        So we tested it.
        
        The result? My kids are way smarter. They listen to my business calls in the car and are ready to run companies. They've seen the Grand Canyon. They missed more school than the attendance secretary wanted but maintained honor roll and student council leadership.
        
        Most importantly, they learned they have a say in their future.
        
        The law of exposure is real: the mind when stretched never returns to its original form.
        
        What "what if" question might be sitting with you about your child's education?

Thumbnail: “Is this even allowed?”

What happens when you challenge everything you've been told about education? Darryll Stinson discovered the educational freedom most parents don't know they have—and his family will never be the same.

From surviving suicide attempts in college to becoming a transformation speaker with over 2 million TED Talk views, Darryll has always been a disruptor. But when it came to his children's education, he was trapped in the same paradigm as everyone else—until one conversation changed everything.

In this raw and powerful episode, Darryll shares:

- Why his first question about pulling kids from school was "Is that even allowed?"
- How they "broke the system" while keeping kids on honor roll
- The law of exposure that changed their family forever
- Why they don't tell grandma about their educational choices
- How your freedom reminds people of their lack thereof

**What You'll Learn:**

- The hybrid education approach that's completely legal (but rarely discussed)
- Why traditional school felt like sending kids "into the belly of the beast"
- How to navigate family resistance to educational alternatives
- The mindset shift from "only option" to "intentional choice"
- Why sometimes what you don't know won't hurt you

**Key Moments:**  
00:00 - Your Freedom Reminds People of Their Lack Thereof  
02:00 - From Overprotective Mother to Identity Crisis

07:00 - The Athletic Dream That Became a Nightmare  
13:00 - Finding Purpose Through Pain and Faith  
21:00 - Marriage, Family, and the Challenge of Parenting  
26:00 - The Moment Everything Changed: Meeting Matt  
29:00 - Breaking the System: Our Hybrid Education Experiment  
34:00 - Why We Don't Tell Grandma About Homeschooling  
42:00 - Turning Your Message Into a Movement  
48:00 - The Future of Authentic Communication

Darryll's story proves that you have more educational freedom than you think. The question isn't whether you can do this—it's whether you're ready to discover what you and your kids are truly capable of.

## COLD OPEN - EXPANDED

**[25:30 to 27:00]**

```Plain
[COLD OPEN - 25:30 to 27:00]
"I've always been a disruptor by nature. I never wanted to fit in any box, so I already hated traditional education. Then I met you and you said, 'Dude, just try it out for a bit. Just pull them out of school for a couple weeks and take them on some learning adventures and see how they go.' And I'm like, 'This dude is trying to get my kids expelled.'

Matt: I remember your first question was, 'Is that allowed?' Right.

I'm like, 'Is this dude serious?' And then I'm like, 'It is because he's white and I'm black. I can't do that. I'm going to jail. I don't know what's going on.' But I couldn't unhear it. I couldn't unhear the question: What if there was a different way that wasn't career suicide or sabotage, wasn't closing doors or shutting down opportunity, but was actually one of the most powerful, empowering things we could do? What if?"
```

  

# My Kids Missed 100+ Days of School

  

"Is that even allowed?"

That was my first question for Matt Bowman when he suggested I could pull my kids out of school for a couple weeks.

I didn’t ask "Would that be good for them?" or "How would that work?"

My first instinct was fear.

"This dude is trying to get my kids expelled." I thought.

Here's the thing—I've always been a disruptor by nature. I never wanted to fit in any box. As a former college football player turned speaking coach, I've spent my career helping people break free from systems that don't serve them. After surviving suicide attempts and discovering my authentic voice, I've built a business around helping others turn their message into a movement. My TEDx talk has been viewed over 2 million times, and I work with executives, entrepreneurs, and leaders who want to communicate with conviction and create real change.

But when it came to my children's education, I was just like everyone else—following rules without question, accepting that traditional school was the only option. Even though I often hated the way things were taught, I felt trapped by the system.

"Just try it out for a bit,” Matt suggested, “You don't have to make a fork in the road decision right now. Just pull them out of school for a couple weeks and take them on some learning adventures and see how they go."

I couldn't wrap my mind around it. My paradigm was completely stuck. But that conversation planted a powerful question in my mind: What if there was a different way?

What if it wasn't career suicide or sabotage? What if it was actually one of the most powerful, empowering things we could do?

So we decided to test it. First we took the summer and said, "Let's pretend we're doing home education to see if we want to send them to school for the year."

The kids were going wild. They wanted to be in school. My oldest two wanted the social interaction, the schedule, the friends. But we stuck with the experiment.

We took trips across the country. We saw the Grand Canyon. We were learning so much more than they ever did in a classroom. Our kids got way smarter. They'd listen to me do sales calls in the car and were ready to run businesses.

It was amazing. But they still wanted to go back to school when summer ended.

So we let them.

## The Law of Exposure

What happened next illustrates the key principle every parent needs to understand – the law of exposure: The mind when stretched never returns to its original form.

Now they were back at school, but they noticed the rigidity. They missed the adventure. They would see me going to Colorado for work and want to go.

Having been exposed to the idea, I knew what to say: "Well, you can just come."

"Really?"

"Yeah. My friend Matt said we can do whatever we want as long as we send the school a note."

So I pulled them out and took them on my business trips. We took extended vacations.

My kids missed over a hundred days of school that year. They still had good grades. They were still student council leaders. It worked out fine.

Why? I knew that they could catch up (they'd probably be messing around half the time in school anyway).

## What You Need to Know

Here's what most parents don't realize: You have more educational freedom than you think. Every state allows homeschooling. Most allow educational travel. Many support hybrid approaches where kids mix traditional school with other learning experiences.

The key is understanding your state's requirements. Some need more documentation than others, but none force you to keep your kids in a system that isn't working. Organizations like the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA.org) can help you understand your specific state's laws.

Today, my kids have the entrepreneur bug. My daughter starts a new business every 90 days (and burns through our money just as fast). But here's what matters: They're expressed. They're learning. And most importantly, they see that they have a say in their future.

They've learned something no curriculum could teach—they don't have to accept systems that don't serve them. They can create their own path.

Is it perfect? No. Is it messy? Absolutely. But it's ours.

Remember what I said earlier: "The mind when stretched never returns to its original form."

Once you see what's possible—once you witness your child thriving outside the traditional box—you can't unsee it. That's when real change happens.

Here's my challenge to you: Start with one question. The same question that changed everything for our family:

**"What if?”**

What if there was a different way for your child to learn? What if it wasn't educational suicide or sabotage? What if it was actually one of the most powerful, empowering things you could do?

You don't have to overhaul everything tomorrow. Try a week-long educational trip. Pull them out for a meaningful family experience. See how it goes.

But most importantly, trust yourself. You know your child better than any system ever will.

The question isn't whether you can do this. The question is: Are you ready to discover what you and your kids are truly capable of when you stop accepting limitations that don't actually exist?

**Matt Bowman:** Hello everyone. Welcome to the Open Ed podcast today. This is Matt Bowman, the host today. We're so excited to have one of my favorite people on our show today. His name's Darryl Stinson. You're gonna get to know his story and I've always just been an admirer of what he's accomplished in his life. So buckle up, stay tuned, listen in, and you're gonna enjoy the journey with me.

So Darryl, welcome to the Open Ed podcast.

**Darryl Stinson:** Yeah, thank you for having me, bro. I'm so excited to get into it with you today.

**Matt Bowman:** It is great to see you again. So we're gonna start with your childhood and I just want to hear where you grew up, what was schooling like, what was learning viewed as, the contrast between the two, what motivated you in schooling. Then take us through childhood into high school and we'll stop there.

## 02:00 From Overprotective Mother to Identity Crisis

**Darryl Stinson:** Cool, man. Yeah, I'm originally from Jackson, Michigan—home of Tony Dungy for all the sports fans out there. About an hour west of Detroit, hour south of Michigan State.

My mom was between junior and senior year when she had me. My father was a freshman in college. They had just lost my brother before me a few days after he was born, so I was sort of like the child that was the makeup for the one that they were grieving.

My mom really clung to me. She was really overprotective because I had some of the same health complications that he died from—lots of real severe asthma, pneumonia. My mom was really frightened by that. My dad was chasing the dream in college, trying to make it to the NFL. He's a really good athlete, just like I was—I got it from him. It runs in our family.

Mom was just trying to make it. She actually ended up going to school for a little bit, trying to work out being a mom, trying to still keep this guy around to be around his son, and trying to figure out how to take care of me. She just couldn't keep up with it. So she dropped out of school even though she was really smart—she was studying to be an engineer.

She was real hard on me, the old way of parenting where she used to spank me a lot. Anytime I would want to cry or talk back, she just threatened me or hit me in the mouth and said, "You better stop crying, boy, I gave you something to cry about." It just sort of created this thing in me where I thought my emotions, my authentic self, was not okay. I wasn't supposed to be emotional in the ways that I was.

It wasn't just her—it was my community that didn't respect it. Growing up low income in the streets, it wasn't cool to be an emotional dude or creative, even though that's who I was at my core.

I always ask questions to your child about what they're going through, and ask more than once. Because sometimes the first answer—kids learn their parents and we learn how to tell them what they need to hear or enough just to check their box of the check-in. I sort of played that system with my mom and it was a very dangerous system because she was living with the illusion that I was fine, and I was building internal hatred for myself because I wasn't being who I was meant to be in the world. I was being what other people liked and loved and accepted.

I actually changed everything about myself to fit in. I went from being an all-A student who was on this trajectory to be probably summa cum laude, to skipping school, selling drugs, living the wrong lifestyle—all because I wanted to fit in with this group of black students who were teasing me for talking white.

Sports was the thing that enabled me to not have to deal with that emotional insecurity. People didn't care if I was going to the basement party with the black people or the bonfires with the whites. All they cared about is that I was playing against a lot of soon-to-be NFL and NBA athletes. So I fell in love with what that was doing for my ego and how that was causing people to give the illusion of love towards me, while meanwhile developing a deep insecurity—not knowing who loved me for me, and who loved me for what they could get from me.

I was just conflicted inside. Because of the way that I was raised both by my mother and my community, I didn't know how to express that I was even struggling and needed help. I didn't have the tools internally to access my emotion. I told myself somehow I wasn't an emotional person. This was the guy who was called a crybaby when he was younger, but because of the suppression and identity shifting, I then became a person who didn't believe he was emotional and couldn't access emotion at all because I had suppressed my ability to feel it for so long, both with busyness and with drugs.

## 07:00 The Athletic Dream That Became a Nightmare

Long story short, I ended up getting hurt after going to Central Michigan on a full ride scholarship to play football. I was supposed to be one of the next greatest athletes to come out of the state of Michigan. Many people know I played with Antonio Brown, Eric Fisher. Draymond Green came out of my state for basketball—he was number one, I was number three. High-level athlete, supposed to be the next thing.

Got injured, actually played after back surgery for two years because of opioids and drug addiction, nerve killers and epidural shots in my back. Everything changed when they kicked me off the team because my opioid abuse was thinning my blood to the point where every time I made contact on the field, my nose would bleed.

**Matt Bowman:** Really?

**Darryl Stinson:** The coaches kicked me off because they knew that clearly it wasn't allergies like I was telling them it was.

I was forced to face all that emotion that I had suppressed. I truly didn't know who I was outside of sports. I didn't know if people liked me for me or if they just liked me for sports because I wasn't showing them me. At this point, this had been going on from seventh grade till college, my junior year in college. I didn't even know me. I didn't know my authentic laugh. I didn't know my voice. I didn't know who I was on the inside.

## 13:00 Finding Purpose Through Pain and Faith

Long story short, I ended up in the psychiatric unit from multiple suicide attempts and a very low, dark wrestle with depression. I found faith there. Two people came and witnessed to me about Christ, and I put my faith in Christ in a psychiatric unit. It gave me hope. It gave me purpose. It gave me a belief that I was here for a reason.

Then I found out about self-care. I did my first journal entry, saw my first counselor, did my first mindfulness exercise, and I started to see that there was this whole world that I could access in here that would inform the success that I wanted and craved so bad.

I say I had a system of success as a high-level athlete. I didn't have a system of self-care. I left there determined to follow my purpose, but not at the cost of my personal health. It was a new paradigm for me where self-care was first instead of left to the margins of my life, and I had a lot of success growing up.

**Matt Bowman:** Well, thank you Darryl for being so raw on those emotions and sharing all of that. I'd heard snips and pieces of that story in our conversations before, but that's some deep emotions you've learned to manage and deal with. So congratulations for getting to that point. That's super cool. Thanks for sharing.

Before we move forward, because I want to hear where your career took you, reflect back for those parents who have kids in middle school and high school that are struggling with some of these things. Great advice to just talk to them, ask them questions multiple times, different ways.

Reflect back on what schooling was—was it anything, or was it just your means to play sports? What has been the learning part of that from an academic side? Did that matter as much as you thought it should have back then?

**Darryl Stinson:** Yeah, well, I mean, I was a knucklehead kid, so I didn't know. I think deep inside, because I was a nerd on the inside, I knew schooling and education was important and I desired to be all that I was here on the planet to be. But I was running the streets. School was just the thing that was in the way of sports. It was just the thing that was taking a long time to learn. It was busy work. I just kind of knew how to get by and knew how to cheat and all of that stuff. I graduated high school with like a 3.5, 3.6 GPA.

**Matt Bowman:** Because you could perform, you knew how to jump through those hoops.

**Darryl Stinson:** And actually college I did start to have very low academic performance because it was harder to get by in college. You actually had to write papers. I couldn't sweet talk the teachers. But I always tell people I had the fortune to have the right degree, but when I graduated I didn't have the experience because I knew how to get through class, but class wasn't getting through me.

I was fortunate—one of my first real jobs outside of college was to work for the university. I actually got a paid internship as a senior working for my alma mater in the communications department. As a university employee, once they hired me in, I had the benefit to take classes for free. So as a graduate student, I actually went back and took undergraduate courses and some of those core communication classes. Public speaking 350—Introduction to Public Speaking was one of the first courses I retook as a graduate student. One of the best decisions I've ever made.

I had a professor, Adam Barto—shout out to him—who saw my potential, my trajectory, and took me under his tutelage. Made me a teacher's assistant immediately, even though I couldn't even put two sentences together. I was coming off of a suicide attempt, so I was still deeply insecure. I had concussions from sports and ADHD and all these things, so I was a terrible communicator, but I had a story to share.

He helped me to learn the craft and helped me to learn about being myself as a communicator. Then helped me also to become better at teaching others how to do the same. Education, once I awakened, became extremely important and that wasn't the only class I went back and retook.

**Matt Bowman:** Well, that's a great point. We often say choose your why or know your why, and learning needs to start with a why, especially as you get older into the college age years. If you don't know why you're studying something or learning something, it just doesn't stick. But you had your why. You wanted to go back to undergrad classes that you were choosing. You weren't being compelled to take those. You wanted to take those, and just that effort of wanting ignites learning in a way that a compulsory program never does.

**Darryl Stinson:** Exactly. Now I will say, I teach and I worked with a lot of students in higher ed as well and mentored a lot of students over the course of the years. Spoke at a lot of high schools and colleges as a speaker. This whole conversation around "Am I living my dream or my parents' dream for me?" is a really big conversation, and it is challenging when parents sometimes have a limited view of who they think their kid is, because sometimes the kid doesn't even feel safe to be fully expressed in the home.

Unbeknownst to the parents, they don't know. But you can always tell when your kids feel more free around their friends than they do around you. You might not know what else is in their heart to do because they're not being all of who they are around you.

I would find myself a lot as a faculty staff member on campus, and even as our church was on a college campus so we did a lot of mentorship of students in college—everyone trying to find their career path. I just think that we need to do more due diligence as parents of really helping our kids to discover their dream work situation in life and how they want to spend their talents.

I would just double click there and say for anybody in that phase with people, just ask more discovery questions. I wish I had parents that would've asked me more questions and didn't assume just because I said I wanted to be a professional athlete, that that was everything in my heart to do. I wish they knew me more holistically.

Sometimes when you've got a kid who's really good at something, you're like, "But you're great at it, but you're great at math, but you're great at sports." And it's like, yeah, but I would be great at something else if I developed it. So just be more curious instead of prescriptive.

**Matt Bowman:** Oh, I love that. And also, just to add to what you were saying, a chapter in our book that we just published is "Parents, don't let your reputation get in the way of your kids." It's so easy to have the parent reputation drive what you are allowing your children to do and learn, and you just gotta get out of that. You gotta let the child lead and do and become instead, and give up your "Oh, I get to be able to say this at a family reunion or at the church setting." Sometimes that reputation of the parent is the biggest stumbling block for a child to become creative.

**Darryl Stinson:** Right. Yeah, no, I'm glad you brought that up. That's a great point. A hundred percent.

**Matt Bowman:** So what was your next job after that?

**Darryl Stinson:** So then I did really well there. Won two awards in higher education for marketing and branding as part of that team, and took that success and took a leap of faith and became a speaker. I felt the calling to do so. I started as a marketing consultant and basically ran that play for about seven years where I was a marketing consultant by day and a volunteer pastor by night. Marketing consulting just paid better, so that's why I say by day—because they paid the bills. Pastor, they paid nothing.

I was doing that for seven years—lots of teaching, preaching, discipleship in churches, primarily a local church but obviously some guest appearances here and there. And then a ton of marketing consulting, training, a handful of athletic teams that wanted me to come be a motivational speaker. I just kept hiring coaches, hiring coaches, getting better, getting better, getting out there, getting better, getting out there. I was just so committed to changing as many lives as possible because I had to survive suicide. I wanted to save as many people as I could.

Then after my TED Talk came out and it did 2.1 million views in a year and a half, and I was on tour doing all these stages in the spirit of changing the world, I realized—this is embarrassing to admit—but I realized that my story alone wasn't gonna change the world. I know that everyone's like, "No duh, Sherlock, that was your epiphany?" But when you watch people pull out a sandwich bag of pills that they were getting ready to overdose on that night, but they came to hear you because they saw your banner, and when you've got droves of people coming and putting their faith in Christ because of this moving testimony, you think you're gonna change the world.

I poured my heart out, everyone was in awe of what just happened, but there's this dude in the back with his arms crossed with glasses on. I had done everything that I could to reach this person. Then I realized, "Oh okay, I'm just not his cup of tea, or he doesn't need encouragement, he needs training."

It was this moment where I'm like, it's only gonna change—the world is only gonna change when I help other people to articulate their genius, to share their story with other people. When we all do that, because I believe all of our world's problems are locked into a person. Every problem that exists is because some person is unwilling to share their solution to that problem. And if they are sharing it, they're sharing it on a small level instead of a big level. They're hoarding it instead of sharing it with as many people as possible, because I believe that God locks solutions inside of people.

I started to really pour into other communicators so that they can get their messages out there, and that's where you and I met.

**Matt Bowman:** That's how you amplify that impact.

**Darryl Stinson:** Exactly. And what I learned is when you speak in congruence with who you are, while you are giving speeches, God is working on you. Everything you teach, you have to ingest first, so it becomes one of the greatest forms of personal development. Because if I'm gonna teach people to be creative, innovative, forward thinking, have better mental health, grow their business, whatever the thing is, then I gotta practice what I preach and it makes me accountable to my own transformation.

I do a lot of transformation work and personal development because you can't separate what you say with your lips from how you're living your life. That's a big part of what I help people with.

**Matt Bowman:** So true. Well said, Darryl. Again, listeners, you're getting gold nuggets from an expert here. Thank you, Darryl.

## 21:00 Marriage, Family, and the Challenge of Parenting

**Matt Bowman:** Let's continue down a personal path. Your family. Tell us a little about what you can about your wife and kids.

**Darryl Stinson:** Yeah, totally man. I met my wife when I was a freshman in college. It's not a pretty story. It wasn't like I saw her across the room and knew she was my wife. In fact, I was dating somebody else. She was doing her thing and it was not a good experience. We kind of messed around in college a bit and went our separate ways.

When we both gave our hearts to Christ, we ended up attending the same church. We were in Mount Pleasant, Michigan—I was still doing my thing, working for the university and all. We started doing Bible studies, trying to keep it together, hold it till marriage as Christians. One time we're supposed to go to the library to have Bible study and she says, "You should just do it at your place." I tell people that Bible study turned into body study, and we had a baby after that.

I have three daughters—11, 8, 6—and my son is 2. We have one in the oven.

**Matt Bowman:** Oh, you do? I did not know that. Congratulations.

**Darryl Stinson:** Thank you. So baby number five is on the way. We're not having more—we wouldn't have had this one if I didn't reschedule my surgery. Three girls, a boy, and another mystery child on the way.

I can tell you vulnerably for this audience—I know this will probably serve some people—it was really challenging for me to be a parent in the beginning. I told you about my father. He did end up coming into my life more actively around three, then a little bit more around five. Then he was pretty much joint custody from there on up. But I was always like little brother to him more than son, because his father was the most disconnected father you could ever imagine. He never mentored, never taught, never did any of that stuff dads do. He was just kind of around.

My mom and dad were never together, so I didn't grow up with this family unit. My mom moved to Detroit from Jackson, Michigan when I went to high school, so there's a big part where mom was in Detroit and I'm just growing up with dad in Jackson and doing my own thing. So I didn't have a good model for how to be a father or a husband.

I always tell people we didn't have a formal dining room growing up. We used to just eat kind of standing up. So I ate like that for the first couple years of our marriage. My wife would make a sit-down dinner and I would be standing up and I'd scarf it down, and she'd be ready to say prayer and I had no idea why she's taking so long to eat. It took me a long time to rewire my nervous system to where I felt normal sitting down at the dinner table having a connected family meal.

On top of that, parent-wise, it was very much physically present but emotionally absent parenting. So it was challenging for me to connect on an emotional level with my kids. I always felt like they had joy that I didn't have. I had to grow up real fast. My mom had two younger sisters by another man, and so I was often babysitting a lot growing up. My ability to just play and giggle and board games was very low with my children. My attention span for that stuff was very short.

You add that on top of the fact that I was a suicide survivor and living with this urgency of life, so it was very hard for me just to be like, "Oh, I just spent this time playing a video game for an hour instead of doing a webinar and changing someone's life."

The parenting journey was extremely hard for me, and if I'm honest, it still is one of my biggest insecurities.

## 26:00 The Moment Everything Changed: Meeting Matt

I've always been a disruptor by nature. I've always wanted to go against the grain. I never wanted to fit in any box, so I already hated traditional education. Especially when I learned how to communicate and actually shift and transform behavior, I hated how things were being taught because they were not transformative and they were the slowest way to learn information ever. I already was like, "I wish I could find a different way for my kids."

So then I met you and I'm like, "Wait, what? People are doing this?" I'll never forget our conversation we had and you're like, "Dude, just try it out for a bit. You don't have to make a fork in the road decision right now, man. Just pull them out of school for a couple weeks and take them on some learning adventures and see how they go." And I'm like, "This dude is trying to get my kids expelled."

**Matt Bowman:** I remember your first question was, "Is that allowed?" Right.

**Darryl Stinson:** I'm like, "Is this dude serious?" And then I'm like, "It is because he's white and I'm black. I can't do that. I'm going to jail. I don't know what's going on." My—I am telling you, we talk about paradigms, right? I just couldn't—I couldn't wrap my mind around it. I was like, "It's a scam. It's only because whatever."

But it opened—it sat with me and I couldn't unhear it. I couldn't unhear like, "What if? What if it was possible that there was a different way to have my child self-direct their own learning? What if there was a different way to do it that wasn't career suicide or sabotage, wasn't closing doors or shutting down opportunity or ruining a child's future? It was actually one of the most powerful, empowering things we could do. What if?" And I just couldn't unhear that question.

Long story short, I think we just ended up trying and doing it. What it was is we took the summer and we said, "Okay, let's pretend that we're running home education during the summer to know if we want to send them to school or not for the year." That's kind of what we were doing.

## 29:00 Breaking the System: Our Hybrid Education Experiment

The kids were going wild, by the way. They wanted to be in school. My oldest two wanted to be in school. My youngest one could care less, but the oldest who really wanted the social interaction, the schedule, they were used to the friends that they were around. So they did not want to be missing out on anything. And it was challenging because again, I was like, "They're kids, right? They don't know what they don't know. They might hate me now and love me later for this tough choice that I made." So I'm like, "I owe it to them to just be like, I'm not gonna let a 7-year-old and a 9-year-old tell me what to do." All right, we're gonna run this play and we're gonna do summer school.

So we did it. It was fun. We took trips, we went across the country. We saw the Grand Canyon and loved it. We're learning so much more stuff. Our kids are way smarter. They would listen to me do sales calls in the car. They're ready to run businesses now. This is the dream. And they did not want to keep the dream. They wanted to go back to school. So I was like, "Okay, Matt told me about this. It's fine. Let them do what they want to do. It's self-directed. It's not forced. All right, cool."

**Matt Bowman:** And especially, let me just make a point here for our listeners. We never criticize the choice to send your child to the boundary district school. If that's the choice you're making, kudos. We applaud that. Just make that a choice instead of a default. There's "it's my only option."

**Darryl Stinson:** Yes, a hundred percent. So they chose to go back. But here's what happened. The law of exposure: the mind when stretched, never returns back to its original form.

**Matt Bowman:** Wow. Well said.

**Darryl Stinson:** So now they're at school, but they notice the rigidity. Now they're at school, but they miss the adventure. Now they see dad's going to Colorado and they want to go, but they can't go because they got choir. And then they're like, "Oh." And I'm like, "Well, you can just come."

**Matt Bowman:** It's your choice.

**Darryl Stinson:** "Hey, my friend Matt said we can do whatever we want. Just send him a note." And we did, bro. We pulled them out. We took them on some of my travel trips. We took longer extended vacations. We broke the system. We had high levels of anxiety thinking we were foolish, we were gonna get our kids kicked out.

We also were kind of worried about the social perception that like, "Oh, they can just do whatever they want and we're in the matrix." So that sucks. "What are you doing going on an adventure while we stay in school?" And it's like, we felt bad about that. I felt like our kids were becoming a little bit better than others.

I know it was a weird dynamic. It's still one of my concerns, to be honest with you.

**Matt Bowman:** Because why? Why do Darryl's kids get to do that?

**Darryl Stinson:** Why, because they missed—it was more than a hundred days of school or something crazy. It was like they missed like half of school. Still had good grades and still were student council leaders somehow. And still it worked out perfectly fine because they'd be dinking around half the time in school anyways, and you could just catch up. Now my kids got the entrepreneur bug. Now my daughter starts a new business every 90 days and just burns our money to the ground, but they're expressed, they're learning, and they see that they have a say in their future.

Currently we're running that play right now, and we're still like a hybrid model where there's a lot of self-directed learning at home and experience, which a lot is just job shadowing us and being exposed. Then they're in school, enrolled in doing all the normal things all the other children do.

**Matt Bowman:** Oh, Darryl, that summary is priceless. That is such a great way to capture that mix, that hybrid that people don't know what to call it. We call it open education, which is just tapping into all the resources available, merging those with your child's interests and wrapping around the resources you can find. You are doing exactly what we advocate, Darryl, that parents do.

And it's still not easy, it's messy. We want to make sure parents grant themselves permission to be messy and know that it's still in the benefit of your children. You're teaching them principles of taking control and ownership of their own life, their own education, their own learning. Those are skills and values that you're passing on that are infinitely more important. So that's just so awesome.

## 34:00 Why We Don't Tell Grandma About Homeschooling

**Matt Bowman:** Tell us about your wife's experience with that, because a lot of dads and moms have these conversations back and forth of, "Oh, but you're just off working and I've gotta deal with the hybrid schedule." Talk about that negotiation because we talk a lot about family needs need to be also identified and can't be ignored. There are family needs that need to be mixed in with the education design. So tell us about her thoughts and perceptions and experience.

**Darryl Stinson:** Totally. So my wife actually has her master's degree in science administration. I just have a bachelor's. I do actually want to get my master's for whatever reason. I just want to get—I would love to have my PhD to be honest with you. It's weird because I'm so non-traditional, but I want it for other reasons.

**Matt Bowman:** You have a why.

**Darryl Stinson:** Yeah, but my wife is my point. She has her master's degree. Her parents are all traditional. They're like "don't break the box." That's their MO as a family. They have for decades—every holiday ate dinner at two o'clock. Just running the same play forever. Like dinner's not even at two, bro. It's like somebody over the course of the last 40 years would've been like, "Maybe we should try five." But no, two o'clock.

**Matt Bowman:** So she's had to first face that.

**Darryl Stinson:** Yes. And one of the people—I love her family—one of the people we both respect the most out of that side of the family is her grandma. Her grandma was an assistant to the president of the university for her entire career, tenure. So I say all that to say the thought of pulling our children out of school—you would've thought we were switching religions.

**Matt Bowman:** Right.

**Darryl Stinson:** And doesn't it feel like that sometimes when we think about pulling our kids and doing something different than what culture says is acceptable? We feel like we're changing religions here. We're violating sacred cows. It feels vulnerable and exposed and scary. So for her it was a lot. She was just like—and because she didn't have the—she didn't meet you. She just knew I always talk to people and say, "Everybody's amazing, right?" So I'm like, "Oh, I met this guy, My Tech High at the time, and he's amazing. He said we can pull our kids out of school." And she's like, "So I'm like, bro, you're gonna have to help me with this conversation. Send me a podcast, some resources. Explain this to her." So you got on a call with us.

It did help that I was coaching you on your TED Talk at the time. That just helped her to start to see like, "Hey, this is not an unwise decision. This is just an option. Let's just look at it as an option." I think that was helpful to go from "I'm not forcing you to do this right now. It isn't as scary as you think. Let's get you in the mindset of possibility and thinking of it as an option."

**Matt Bowman:** Yep.

**Darryl Stinson:** So that was really helpful for her journey. And then from there, that experiment was helpful too to be able to have that summer with our kids where we could see the benefit of alternative education and supplemental education and a different way of educating. And then their own lack of fulfillment when they went back into the belly of the beast. So after we tried it for that summer, I think she was on the other side. I think she flipped and changed and saw it, and she was more like, "Man, now I feel bad. Now I feel like I'm sending them into something that's less good for them."

**Matt Bowman:** Right. That's a tough emotion too.

**Darryl Stinson:** Oh it is. It's a big thing. Am I now—again, I had to ask myself a question. They want to go, but now am I doing the thing where it's clearly better and I'm letting them choose their life? And am I making a decision that's not the best for them as a father? That's a worry or a concern that I had—not a truth that I was facing, but a worry or a concern that I had. So we're still navigating that, man. There's part of us that still feels like that.

Not just because of the education, but if I can be honest with you, the food. The food is terrible. And there's a whole level of what I'm learning about healthy eating and what we're putting in our food that I don't even want them to stay after school for practice and eat processed food that doesn't serve them and their body well.

**Matt Bowman:** Interesting whole tangent that we could go down. But it's just the idea that our kids are more than just students in a desk that are empty brains that need to be filled with a lecture. There's so much more in schooling that happens around food, fitness, nutrition, knowledge, social, attitudes, political—all of that is wrapped up into what happens and it's hard to know how to navigate that. Very interesting that you brought up a completely different category of something that matters to your family. Each of your children are different and have different needs on nutrition. So I can totally see that. So well, super interesting.

Anything else on the learning journey of your wife or how has she dealt with her family? What tools and strategies did she do to embrace that difference with a family that's not used to change?

**Darryl Stinson:** Totally. All right. I know this is a podcast, but I need all the listeners to help your boy out. Don't tell nobody downtown, but I don't think her parents know. I don't think they know, man. What you don't know won't hurt you.

**Matt Bowman:** All right.

**Darryl Stinson:** So they—I don't think they really know. The times that we kind of tried to poke and mention, "Oh, well, don't they have school?" It's like, "Yeah, it's cool. It's all right." Because it's not worth the argument. Because here's the thing—I think this is important for your listeners. Sometimes your freedom reminds people of their lack thereof. And the truth is, all the feedback that we were getting where we were putting our toe in the water with letting them know what was going on—the deep part of it, it was all a response because if this was a better pathway, then that would remind them that they could have thought of something different or a better way to parent. And I think they were rubbing off on like, "Well, if you're doing a different, quote-unquote, better way, we did a way that wasn't of highest service," and that is confronting to face that reality.

So we had to learn that that's what we were dealing with and just be like, we don't want to create that tension, and that's not even our belief, but that's their interpretation of our behavior. So we just left it alone.

**Matt Bowman:** Yeah. I respect that. I really do. I think sometimes when new things are discovered in one's life, you push that on everybody because you want them all to know. And sometimes, even what you said earlier, you could never unhear what you and I chatted about. Sometimes people would rather not hear some of that because it makes them question, makes them feel some guilt, anxiety, doubt of what they chose, even though you don't want them to. You're definitely not retro-applying judgment, but you don't want them to feel that. So you're being sensitive to that. I respect that 100 percent.

Super interesting. Well, good.

## 42:00 Turning Your Message Into a Movement

**Matt Bowman:** Well tell us now, as we wrap up here, I want to have people hear about your leadership coaching programs. What have you found from that? I know you're doing your own podcast. We're gonna—I hope to be on that one day. So tell us about your leadership coaching services as well as who have you had on your podcast? What are some interesting stories you've heard that others can learn from, and then how do they find you?

**Darryl Stinson:** Yeah, totally. Thank you, man. Appreciate that. Number one, I help people to turn their message into a movement. A lot of people come to me because they're like, "Hey, I know that public speaking and storytelling is a great way to make an impact, and it's a great way to generate leads for a movement, a cause." Everything is a story. Your brand is a story. Your products that you sell is a story. Your personal identity and signature speech includes a big hero's journey of a story in it. So storytelling is a very valuable skill and our ability to articulate it is something that often has to be coached and trained out of us.

The old paradigm of communication training is like you learn mechanics, vocal tonality, where to stand on stage, sort of this loose framework of what to say, structure your speech this way, and then you go be a professional, polished speaker. I think that paradigm is very much fading to black. Now people want authenticity, connection, experiences, that type of thing.

It takes a person who can help you to read the label when you're inside the bottle. We oftentimes have expert's curse where what's foundational to us is revelational to other people. We have this way of explaining what we do that is techie and geeky and industry jargon, but it is not clear to someone to follow those beliefs and that path. So even some of the language you hear me describe open ed with, I'm sure y'all can take and go use, right? Because I'm condensing decades into today's—I'm making something short and concise and potent.

There's a lot of tools that you can learn to be able to communicate in that way, but what's most important is that you are able to be sensitive and read the room. That just has to be trained. It's hard to learn it without really training. Like you train for a gym, you gotta train to speak because there's so much of it that's just in your—because we communicate all the time. Talk on the cell phone, talk to our wives. We have a lot of programming in how we say things.

We never intentionally said, "Well, if I were to say it intentionally, how would I say it? If I were to say it with more passion, how would I say it?" We didn't build it that way, and so we're not used to just being in that mode, and so we gotta have it provoked out of us. We gotta have it pulled out of us. I always say, I know your authentic voice when I watch you argue. You don't gotta think about how you sound. You don't gotta think about if your points or your PowerPoint is matching. You're like, "I got something on my heart and I'm gonna express it. You gonna hear this." And I'm like, "Oh, okay. So you don't have to sound like a robot, so you don't need notes, so you don't need this. What you need is permission to say what's on your heart and mind and enough craft and skills so that you're not just emotionally vomiting on people."

So any person who has a story to share, they understand that I want to use this as a means to make an impact in the lives of other people, and I want to do it in a way that grows a movement, an organization, a cause. Man, I'm one of the best in the world at being able to help people do that. And the reason why is because it was one of my greatest areas of insecurity and weakness. I used to be so afraid to speak in front of people that I used to fake like I had to go to the bathroom so nobody would call on me and ask me to say, "What's your name and your favorite animal?"

One of my first speeches, I wrote it out word for word, read it into a recorder, strung the headphones up through my jacket, left one headphone in to give the audience the appearance that I forgot to take my headphones out, hit play on the recording and started to recite what the recording was saying. The problem is that I got off sync because I talk a lot faster than I read, and so I started to repeat multiple sentences.

I have ADHD, PTSD, dyslexia, clinical depression, concussions from sports. So there was a whole period of time where I had to learn how to focus on mindfulness, and my counselor made me practice on focusing on one tooth at a time that I was brushing, and I couldn't think about work, couldn't think about what I was doing next, could think about nothing but the sensation of the tooth that I was brushing in order to train my mind to stop losing its train of thought.

When I started to put together my early speeches, I used Robert Plutchik's emotion wheel chart to pick which emotion I was feeling because I didn't even have vocabulary for emotions. But what I had, Matt, was a calling to speak and a willingness to overcome that insecurity, to overcome that inadequacy, to overcome that lack of ability to surrender to that calling to speak because I felt like I was living a second chance life, Matt. I still feel like I'm living a second chance life.

## 48:00 The Future of Authentic Communication

So I believe that if you're gonna communicate, you better do it like you're called to. Principle number one: you gotta be a thermostat, and not a thermometer. You gotta stop coming in there flopping in the beginning. "Thank you for bringing me out today and having me out here," and taking five minutes to warm up before you say something worth listening to. People are giving you a portion of their lifespan. Say something worth listening to. Be a thermostat. Set the temperature.

So when there's a 500-person room and 300 people show up, or there's a 500-person room and 120 people show up and it's awkward and it's a lot of space and it's quiet, don't be like, "Ah, man, well, you know, it's kind of—" No. Come in there and set it off. Come in there and set the tone, be a thermostat. And guess what's gonna happen? They're gonna start to raise their temperature to you.

A lot of people always ask me, "Sometimes I get event planners that are like, 'Hey man, can you do something engaging?'" And I'm like, "Oh God, their last speaker was boring." I said, "Man, I can do something engaging. I don't do engagement. I am engaging, so I'm the show, right? I don't need PowerPoints, flickers, gimmicks, tricks, card games, tools." Although I do know how to do a lot of that stuff. I don't need none of that. All I need is this conviction because people don't move, take action unless they're moved emotionally. It don't matter what you say. "Open education, better pathway." Who cares until they're moved emotionally? Until they feel like, "Oh man, maybe I'm limiting the possibility by being stuck in a paradigm," until they feel that, they ain't changing their behavior.

So we have to access that part in ourselves as communicators and allow ourselves to feel the depth of our message, lest we rob the audience of its possibility of execution. Vulnerability is not a tactic or a tool. It is a way of life that says, "If I'm gonna ask you to change, I must first go there within myself."

And man, I think we're coming into an age, Matt, where if you're not communicating like that, you're not gonna get a spot because everything else that you're gonna say, I can save money and I can put it in ChatGPT and it can say it quicker, better, and more thoroughly for free or for the pro subscription. So you better have something to say that moves me. So you better have something to say that has some conviction in it. So you better have something to say that only comes from being so deeply connected to something that you pull out an angle that can only be extracted from human application or else you're gonna be out of a job and thumbing for donations.

**Matt Bowman:** Wow, Darryl, you have provided some insights that are beyond what I even had hoped for. So that was super, super nice, impactful, value oriented. Anyone listening can really feel that passion you have, Darryl, and I've always loved it and always been an admirer of it. So how do people find you?

**Darryl Stinson:** Man, at Stinson Speaks, my last name speaks, on most of the platforms. So you can just Google my name, I'm pretty Googleable. Email darryl@daryllstinson.com. Just reach out any way that I can be helpful. I got a retreat coming up in August—I want you to come out if you can, but anybody that's just listening to this is welcome to join. We do them once a quarter.

I do a lot of networking events throughout Franklin in the Nashville region. And then I'm hosting our TEDx conference in the spring of '26 here and better believe Matt Bowman's on our radar because it is a TEDx Cool Springs youth event. So we'll only have about two adult speakers, and I just think you'd be a great addition to the lineup while we elevate these brilliant students in our community and bring a couple of heroes from abroad.

I think you'd be a good headliner adult speaker that's speaking to a very relevant topic that all the parents in the room are gonna want to know about. And a lot of their kids are gonna be doing a little bit of that anyways. So I don't know, there's some alignment there. We should chat about it. So man, tap in. Maybe you'll see Matt at the TEDx conference.

And if not, man, just get your message out there to the world because our world needs it. People are hurting, they're confused, they're questioning, they're worried about their future. And they're looking for answers that many of the listeners on this podcast have within them. So I hope—

**Matt Bowman:** Well, it's been a pleasure, Darryl, and I've got a copy of our open education book.

**Darryl Stinson:** Let's go. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate you.
