# Stop raising kids who wait for permission 🚫

**Connor Boyack:** [00:00:00] those schools operate effectively like prisons where you can't even go to the bathroom without permission.

It creates a permissioned society where people are used to requesting "oh, I need licensure. I need this permit."

I want them to learn that they can just do things. They can go create value.

They can go start whatever they want. That is a spirit, a personality trait that I think will serve them and our society very well.

2. From 14:10-14:30: "Our whole goal is exactly what you're talking about. Sure, we want kids to make money and learn entrepreneurship, but I want them to learn that they can just do things.

### Instagram Caption

Schools train kids to ask permission for everything - even using the bathroom.

Is it any wonder we've created a society where people think they need permission to start a business?

@connorboyack is teaching kids they can "just DO things" through @tuttletwins and children's entrepreneur markets.

What if we raised a generation that didn't wait for permission to create value?

### Twitter/X Caption

"Traditional schools train kids they need permission for everything. We want kids to learn they can just DO things."

@cboyack explains how the permission-based mindset harms innovation and why his Children's Entrepreneur Market is teaching the opposite.

### Facebook Caption

School: "Raise your hand to speak. Get a hall pass to use the bathroom. Wait for the bell to eat lunch."

Then we wonder why adults think they need permission from the government to start a lemonade stand.

Connor Boyack explains how we're creating a "permission society" and why teaching kids they can "just do things" is critical for a thriving future.

## Aphoristic-Style Tweets for Bonus Clip (Permission Society)

Option 1:  
"Schools teach kids to ask permission to use the bathroom, then we wonder why adults think they need government approval to sell lemonade. The permission mindset is a learned behavior that stifles human potential."

Option 2:  
"Children don't need permission to create value in the world. They need examples, tools, and the confidence to act. A society of permission-seekers becomes a society of permission-deniers."

Option 3:  
"The ability to 'just do things' without seeking permission is perhaps the most underrated skill we can develop in children. It's the seedbed of entrepreneurship, innovation, and a freer society."

Option 4:  
"Most skills that truly matter in life—curiosity, initiative, resilience—are systematically discouraged in environments where permission is required for everything. Freedom to act precedes freedom to thrive."
