[00:00:00-00:00:40] "When I was in like third grade, I was convinced that I didn't like science... we spent like a half hour doing a writeup on this thing where she dictated in front of the entire class, verbatim what we were supposed to write... even though matter and energy were not created or destroyed, my interest in science at the time was totally destroyed."

[00:06:26-00:07:00] "I think that traditional education spends maybe a little bit too much time on the theoretical side... tends to start with the theory and then kind of move towards application and problem solving... typically the practical side isn't even touched in a lot of education. That's why kids ask 'When are we gonna use this in real life?'"
