"What happens when kids miss over 100 days of school? Darryll Stinson found out - and the results might surprise you. Sometimes breaking the system works better than following it."

```Plain
[SHORT CLIP - REARRANGED AND EXPANDED]

[30:15-30:30] "They missed over a hundred days of school or something crazy. Still had good grades and still were student council leaders somehow. And still it worked out perfectly fine because they'd be messing around half the time in school anyways, and you could just catch up."

[28:45-29:30] "But here's what happened. The law of exposure: the mind when stretched, never returns back to its original form. So now they're at school, but they notice the rigidity. Now they're at school, but they miss the adventure. Now they see dad's going to Colorado and they want to go, but they can't go because they got choir. And then they're like, 'Oh.' And I'm like, 'Well, you can just come.'"

[29:45-30:15] "'Hey, my friend Matt said we can do whatever we want. Just send him a note.' And we did, bro. We pulled them out. We took them on some of my travel trips. We took longer extended vacations. We broke the system."

[31:30-32:00] "And now my kids have the entrepreneur bug. Now my daughter starts a new business every 90 days, but they're expressed, they're learning, and they see that they have a say in their future."
