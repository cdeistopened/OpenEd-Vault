# Why Your ADHD Kid "Won't Listen" (It's Not What You Think)

  

  

  

**Ela Richmond** _OpenEd Daily_

You're standing in the kitchen, trying to finish one math lesson before lunch. Your child has been staring at the same problem for ten minutes. Frustration builds on both sides. Finally, you raise your voice: "Just focus! Why won't you listen to me?"

Your child looks up. Silent. Defiant, you think.

But what if they literally can't hear you?

[Dr. Amy Moore](https://www.thebrainymoms.com/) is a cognitive psychologist and host of the Brainy Moms podcast. She's also the Psychology and Research Director for LearningRx. But her expertise runs deeper than her credentials. Diagnosed with ADHD in college after failing out twice, she understands the struggling kid from the inside out.

**"It looks like they're ignoring you. Honestly, they're struggling to hear the words that you're saying when you're yelling, because they're in fight or flight."**

## The Brain Science Behind 'Not Listening’ (Attention Isn't the Real Problem)

Dr. Moore explained [auditory exclusion](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6043156/)—a neurological phenomenon where the brain under stress can't process language. When a parent raises their voice, the child's amygdala sets off an alarm. Danger. Crisis. The prefrontal cortex—responsible for reasoning, thinking, planning—gets hijacked.

"[The brain is] intelligently designed to only be able to hear low-frequency sounds like that tiger rustling in the bush behind us, not mom's voice yelling at us."

When it looks like a kid is ignoring you, they're in neurological shutdown. Their ears can't process words. They're not refusing to listen—they're unable to hear.

This misunderstanding goes even deeper. ADHD stands for "Attention Deficit." So when kids struggle, parents naturally try to fix their focus. But what if we've been targeting the wrong problem all along?

Dr. Moore and her team studied more than 5,000 children and adults with ADHD. They found something shocking: **attention was NOT the weakest cognitive skill.**

"Working memory, long-term memory, and processing speed all fell below the 38th percentile. We have this tendency to go, my kid has ADHD, let me fix his attention and focus, when attention and focus was not the real issue."

ICYMI, this is the same point Andrea Fife—OpenEd's Chief Academic Officer—made in her recent deep dive on ADHD.

Moore and Fife agree that we’ve been attempting to solve the wrong problem.

When a child is frustrated and stressed, they need strong working memory to hold potential options in mind—and strong processing speed to access those options quickly. Without it, they stay dysregulated.

## How to Stop the Meltdown Before It Starts

Dr. Moore talked about mirror neurons—"smart cells in our brains" that make emotions contagious.

"My emotions as a mom are contagious to my child. The easiest way to illustrate that is when someone yawns and you yawn back, that's a mirror neuron kicking in."

When parents are dysregulated, kids become dysregulated. When parents yell, kids shut down. [Research on mirror neurons](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3510904/) shows this emotional contagion is strongest between people in close relationships—like parent and child.

"We cannot access grace when we're emotionally dysregulated. We have to learn how to regulate our own emotions first so that we can help our child co-regulate theirs."

The primary intervention isn't medication or therapy for the child. It's the parent learning to regulate first.

Lower your voice. Soften your facial expression. Relax your posture. Remove excess noise and light. Dr. Moore calls it "lowering the temperature on the fire."

Then get curious. Ask: "I'm noticing this seems hard for you. I wonder what we could do to make it easier."

Invite them into problem-solving. Give them power and control. Build "relational equity"—the sense that you're on their side.

## How to Actually Remediate (Not Just Accommodate)

Dr. Moore's youngest son couldn't spell his own name in fifth grade. Low self-esteem, constant bullying, crushing inadequacy.

Instead of accommodating his struggles—extra time, front-row seating—she remediated the underlying cognitive skills. She put him through 36 weeks of cognitive training and reading remediation at LearningRx.

By ninth grade, he was earning A's in college-level English. He became a competitive rock climber and elite musician. Now he's a music performance major in college.

"We had to make his bucket so big that it built resilience to that ADHD diagnosis."

What's the difference between accommodation and remediation?

Accommodations work around a weakness. Extra time on tests. Preferential seating. Audio versions of textbooks. These help a child succeed _despite_ their struggles, but the underlying weakness remains.

Remediation strengthens the weakness itself through targeted cognitive training—exercises that build working memory capacity, increase processing speed, and improve long-term memory retrieval.

## **What does cognitive training look like?**

Programs like LearningRx use one-on-one brain training exercises delivered by a trained clinician. Sessions typically run 60-90 minutes, three times per week, for 12-36 weeks depending on the severity of cognitive weaknesses.

The exercises are game-like and progressively challenging—designed to push cognitive skills just beyond current capacity. Think of it like physical therapy for the brain: targeted, repetitive, increasingly difficult exercises that force neural pathways to strengthen and new connections to form.

Dr. Moore's research shows measurable IQ gains averaging 15 points after cognitive training, with the greatest improvements in working memory, processing speed, and long-term memory—the exact skills that fall below average in individuals with ADHD.

Homeschool families and those pursuing an open education have an advantage here. Traditional schools must serve 30 kids at once. They can't pause the curriculum for weeks of intensive cognitive training. Accommodations are the only practical option.

Homeschoolers have time and flexibility. You can dedicate three mornings a week to cognitive training sessions—either in-person at a LearningRx center or delivered remotely via Zoom. You can adjust your academic pace while building foundational skills. You can remediate, not just accommodate.

## Steps to Support Your ADHD Learner

Here are practical steps Dr. Moore suggests you can take today:

**Start with sleep.** Tired children cannot regulate their emotions. The brain's glymphatic system washes away toxins during sleep and consolidates memories. Without restorative sleep, nothing else works.

**Address sensory needs.** Most ADHD kids are either sensory seekers (running laps at 8 p.m.) or sensory avoiders (can't stand scratchy pajamas). Match the environment to the need—swings for seekers, soft quiet spaces for avoiders.

**Focus on real cognitive weaknesses.** If your child has a formal diagnosis, you have a neuropsych report showing subtest scores. Look at working memory, processing speed, and long-term memory—not attention.

**Build islands of competence.** Neuropsychologist Robert Brooks says "Kids with ADHD swim in oceans of inadequacy." Find what they love and do well. Nurture those passions. Make the bucket big enough that the struggle seems small.

**Regulate yourself first.** Emotions are contagious. Before you can co-regulate a child, you need to regulate yourself.

Dr. Moore's team found that cognitive training delivered over Zoom is as effective as in-person training. Parents can access these interventions from their dining room table without disrupting their homeschool day.

## TRANSCRIPT

**Ela Richmond** (00:00)  
Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. I'm your host, Ela. Today I'm joined by Dr. Amy Moore. Let me jump straight into it. What led you to education?

**Dr. Amy Moore** (00:17)  
That's a great question. My undergraduate degree is in psychology. After graduating, I took a job as a teacher's assistant at a preschool and fell in love with working with kids. I went to the University of South Carolina for their new master's program in education, and I loved it so much I pursued that instead of traditional psychology grad school.

I spent ten years as a child development specialist with Air Force child development and youth programs. I also spent time in the classroom as a teacher. But working with so many children and families struggling with neurodivergent diagnoses, I kept thinking: we're missing something in the classroom. The curriculum is great, but something's missing.

So I went back to school and got my PhD in psychology to really understand the brain—how it learns and what we need to bring back to classrooms, whether homeschooling, traditional, or early childhood, to help struggling kids. Now I straddle the psychology and education space because that's where my passion lies.

**Ela Richmond** (02:07)  
That's beautiful. I'm curious why you were so interested in understanding the underlying why. Your teaching background adds another layer—you experienced what teachers experience: kids not being receptive. But you didn't take the easy road. You didn't label these kids as troubled or just move on. Why was your initial reaction to get curious about helping families solve these underlying issues?

**Dr. Amy Moore** (02:59)  
I was a struggling student. I was smart and did well academically, but I spent more time in the hallway than the classroom in middle school because I talked too much, was constantly distracted, or distracted the class. I was diagnosed with ADHD in college—after failing out twice. Not because I couldn't do the work, but because I wouldn't go to class, would sleep through class, or didn't feel like it.

My mom, also a child development specialist, said, "I think you have ADHD." This was the eighties when hyperactive boys were mainly diagnosed, but she saw the symptoms. I was assessed and was off the charts ADHD. Once medicated, I did really well through college and grad school and got my life back on track.

As I worked with children and families, I thought: we can't miss these things. We have to identify this early so kids don't struggle so much. I was drawn to struggling kids with ADHD—kids everyone else was frustrated with but that I understood. I wanted to help, but I didn't have enough tools because medication was the only ADHD intervention available. These kids spend eight to ten hours with us daily. We have to be able to do more.

**Ela Richmond** (04:55)  
That makes so much sense. You had personal understanding of what it was like being that kid. You found a tool that worked, got through college, succeeded, and then looked at struggling kids and said, "Let me help you find more tools." I love that.

What's the common experience of families with ADHD? Our audience is mostly homeschool families who aren't getting teacher reports—they're experiencing it themselves. What's step one when you chat with families?

**Dr. Amy Moore** (06:31)  
Do you want the conversation before official diagnosis or after?

**Ela Richmond** (06:48)  
The first conversation—when a parent doesn't know if their kid has ADHD or what to look into.

**Dr. Amy Moore** (07:15)  
We tend to say "my kid can't focus" or "can't pay attention," but our brains shift attention four times a second. That's normal. Your brain focuses on a task, scans the environment for threats, comes back to the task. It's designed for survival—checking for tigers while working. That's healthy brain function.

The ADHD brain struggles to distinguish between minor inconveniences and crises. Everything feels important. ADHD brains are also super curious, so they're easily pulled into environmental distractions.

The first question I ask parents: Is your child tired, hungry, sick, or stressed? That's where we start. If not, let's talk about stress. A child can lose focus because the task is too hard or they lack the skill. That causes stress and frustration.

When stressed, the amygdala sets off an alarm—"danger, crisis, you're frustrated"—and hijacks the prefrontal cortex, which handles reasoning, thinking, planning, and execution. Then we can't think or learn.

What we interpret as defiance is typically not defiance. "I'm not doing this" isn't willful. It's "this is too hard and I'm frustrated, and I don't know how to communicate that." So we have to get curious. We have to be patient and learn to regulate our own emotions first.

**Ela Richmond** (10:32)  
Are there ways to give kids more ability to communicate instead of seeming defiant?

**Dr. Amy Moore** (11:06)  
It's probably ninety-nine percent emotional response. We have to get curious and flexible—put on our detective hat and wonder what's happening. This is an opportunity to teach problem-solving skills. When we involve kids in solving problems, we give them power and control, building relational equity. They feel heard and respected.

But something very important happens when we yell. That alarm bell goes off, they go into fight, flight, or freeze. The ears can't process language in fight-or-flight. It's called auditory exclusion.

**Dr. Amy Moore** (12:32)  
The brain is intelligently designed to only hear low-frequency sounds—like a tiger rustling in the bush behind us—not mom's voice yelling. So when you yell at your child, it looks like they're ignoring you, but they're struggling to hear the words because they're in fight-or-flight.

Everything that comes out of your mouth either strengthens or weakens the connection with your child. Yelling weakens that connection. You destroy relational equity and have repair work to do.

We have to get curious, be patient, and learn to regulate our own emotions first. Start by lowering your voice volume, softening your facial expression, relaxing your body posture, removing excess noise and light. Lower the temperature on the fire at the dining room table. Then say something like, "I notice this seems really hard for you. I wonder what we could do to make it easier. Let's talk about some options."

Go into problem-solving mode. Create an invitation for your child to safely say, "Yes, it is too hard." Then: "Yesterday you mastered this concept. Let's go back to what we talked about. Go back a step to where you could do it, then build slowly on this next concept you're struggling with."

When we're in emotional fight-or-flight, that part of the brain is most active. But if we can name the emotion, it activates the language center, pulling us out of our amygdala. You've probably heard "have to name it to tame it"—that's absolutely right. Tell your child: "It seems like you're frustrated. Yeah, I get frustrated when I can't do something hard too. This is what I do."

**Ela Richmond** (15:38)  
From a parent perspective, what's the hardest part about raising children with ADHD and how do you help parents? What you're describing—not yelling, staying patient—is very hard. But especially with ADHD kids, the way they respond to you is really important. Parents have responsibility to be the way their child needs them to be. Where do you help parents begin?

**Dr. Amy Moore** (16:45)  
We parent the way we were parented. Just because you were parented that way and turned out okay doesn't mean it'll work for your child. You need to parent your child, not the way you were necessarily parented. We didn't wear seatbelts, we turned out okay, but seatbelts are safer. Just because your parent yelled and you behaved doesn't mean that's how your child will respond or that it's the healthiest way to raise a child.

If your current parenting strategy isn't working—if you're here asking for help—something needs to change. We have to regulate our own emotions first. We cannot access grace when emotionally dysregulated. Recognize when you're getting upset or frustrated. Take a step back and say, "I need a ten-minute break. You take a break too."

Learn breathing exercises, grounding exercises. Keep a frozen eye mask in your freezer—put it on your eyes for thirty seconds and it lowers fight-or-flight activation. Vibrate your vagus nerve to activate your parasympathetic nervous system and regulate your emotions.

**Dr. Amy Moore** (18:12)  
Emotions are contagious. We have smart cells in our brains called mirror neurons. Their effect is strongest between people with close relationships. So my emotions as a mom are contagious to my child. The easiest illustration: when someone yawns, you yawn back. That's a mirror neuron. We have to regulate our emotions, which helps co-regulate our child's emotions. This starts with us.

Adopt a mindset of curiosity. Say, "Hey, this isn't working. What should I do differently?" That's the first step—learning to regulate our emotions and recognizing there are real, measurable differences in ADHD brains.

There's less blood flow to the prefrontal cortex, so less oxygen in the area responsible for thinking, reasoning, planning, and execution. The connection between amygdala and prefrontal cortex is disrupted. Brain volume is smaller. Electrical activity is different. There are problems with dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmitters. Either not enough dopamine crosses the synaptic cleft, sending neurons reabsorb it too quickly, or dopamine receptors can't catch the dopamine.

When parents understand there are connectivity differences, oxygen differences, brain volume differences, and chemical differences, empathy builds. "That's why my child is struggling. They aren't doing this to me. They're struggling, and it's my job as a loving parent to help." Homeschooling parents already have the mindset that their child needs something different. That's half the battle.

**Ela Richmond** (21:56)  
There's education—fitting it to how your child's brain works. But also regular life and behavior. How do we help kids develop the skills to live in the world, respond to frustration, respond to stress? These are foundational. What frameworks should homeschool families start with?

**Dr. Amy Moore** (23:40)  
First, make sure children get restorative sleep. Tired children cannot regulate emotions. Sleep deprivation reduces dopamine sensitivity and the ability to recognize facial expressions accurately. If we can't read faces accurately, we might respond emotionally inappropriately.

During the day, as we think, learn, walk, talk, and live, we use up neurotransmitters and leave toxins. During sleep, the brain shrinks slightly to allow the glymphatic system to release cerebrospinal fluid that literally washes the brain—like a car wash rinsing garbage and toxins left behind during the day. Without this, toxins build up and neurons can't communicate effectively.

Sleep also consolidates memories. Everything learned during the day is consolidated during sleep. That can't happen without adequate sleep. Help your kids get restorative sleep. Make bedtime part of your structured day, like math or reading time, not just when you're exhausted and want them gone.

Most ADHD kids have sensory processing issues—they're sensory seekers or avoiders. Sensory seekers are running laps around the living room at 8 p.m., throwing themselves on couches. They haven't gotten enough sensory input, so they seek it. They need swings in bedrooms, movement during stories, tight pressure therapy, weighted blankets.

Sensory avoiders can't stand clothing tags or electric toothbrushes. They need soft tagless pajamas, soft sheets, minimal bedroom clutter. Even toothpaste flavor matters. Sensory seekers choose bold, bright flavors.

Reduce screens—they produce blue light, which tells the brain it's daylight and inhibits melatonin release. If kids haven't gotten enough physical activity, they won't sleep well either. Work on restorative sleep and recognizing contributors to sleep deprivation first.

**Ela Richmond** (30:15)  
You mentioned curating environments for kids' needs. Most parents want to do that, but don't know where to start—from swing bedrooms to toothbrush sounds to toothpaste flavor. How do families find resources? Do they need to curate if they want to? What are the most important things to start with?

**Dr. Amy Moore** (30:15)  
If your child has ADHD, you already know these patterns. You know they're constantly seeking activity, worse in evenings—that probably means sensory seeker. You know if they can't stand itchy fabrics or insist you cut tags out. You know from behavior patterns.

A great resource is the Homeschool OT—Sarah Collins. Occupational therapists are experts on sensory issues. Her podcast and website discuss sensory seekers and avoiders. You can Google "bedtime ideas for sensory seekers" or "sensory avoiders"—there are checklists everywhere. Also look up Dr. Sensory—she had great ideas on my podcast.

# BLOG POST: Why Your ADHD Kid Can't Hear You (And Why That Changes Everything)

I had a realization recently, sitting across from Dr. Amy Moore while recording this podcast. She said something so simple, so obvious once you know it—yet so contrary to everything I'd been assuming as a parent—that I had to stop her mid-sentence and ask her to repeat it.

"When you yell at your kid," she said calmly, "their brain literally cannot process language. It's not defiance. It's neurology."

Dr. Amy Moore is a cognitive psychologist and host of the Brainy Moms Podcast. She has her PhD in psychology and spent years working with neurodivergent kids and families before realizing something was missing in classrooms and homes: a real understanding of how ADHD brains actually work. Her research spans over 5,000 ADHD brains, and what she's discovered is both humbling and hopeful.

But first, let me tell you about her own journey, because it's the real reason she's so passionately pursuing this work.

## The Personal Connection (Why This Matters)

Dr. Amy was a struggling student. Not because she couldn't do the work—she did well academically—but because her brain worked differently. She'd spend more time in the hallway than the classroom. She'd fail college twice. Not because the material was too hard, but because she wouldn't go to class, would sleep through it, or just... didn't feel like it.

"It wasn't until I was in college that my mom said, 'I think you have ADHD,'" Dr. Amy told me. "This was in the eighties, when we were mainly diagnosing hyperactive boys. But she saw the symptoms."

Medication changed her life. Suddenly, college became possible. Grad school became possible. Her life got back on track.

But as she worked with children in educational settings—first as a teacher's assistant, then as a child development specialist for Air Force youth programs—she kept running into the same wall. Kids who were struggling. Kids with ADHD that nobody was catching. Kids whose potential was being buried under frustration, confusion, and adult misunderstanding.

"I thought," she said, "we're missing something."

## The Myth That's Costing You (The Counterintuitive Insight)

Here's the thing that changed my whole perspective: **We've been diagnosing ADHD wrong.**

For decades, when a kid with ADHD is struggling, we say: "They can't focus."

But Dr. Amy's research shows something different.

"Our brain shifts attention four times a second," she explained. "That's normal. Your brain focuses on a task, scans the environment for threats, comes back to the task. It's happening at light speed. You're not seeing it, but that's healthy brain function."

So if attention isn't the problem, what is?

"Attention was not the weakest cognitive skill in our research," Dr. Amy said. "Working memory, long-term memory, and processing speed all fell below the 38th percentile. Attention? Average."

Let that sink in. We've been training attention when we should be building working memory. We've been solving the wrong problem.

## The Auditory Exclusion (Why Yelling Backfires)

But the insight that really shook me came when she explained what happens when you yell at your ADHD child.

"When you yell at them, they're in fight-or-flight," Dr. Amy said. "And when we're in fight-or-flight, our brain is designed to hear only low-frequency sounds—like a tiger rustling in the bush behind us. Not mom's voice yelling at us. They're not ignoring you. They literally cannot hear you."

This is auditory exclusion. An evolutionary survival mechanism. Your child's brain is doing exactly what it's supposed to do—protecting them from danger by narrowing their sensory focus.

Except there's no tiger. There's just your frustration.

And here's the part that cuts deepest: "Everything that comes out of your mouth either strengthens the connection with our child or weakens the connection. So yelling at our child is going to weaken that bond."

## What You Can Do Instead (The Actionable Path Forward)

So what do you do if your child truly can't hear you when you yell? You regulate yourself first.

This is where Dr. Amy brings in neuroscience's coolest finding: mirror neurons. Your child's nervous system mirrors yours. When you're dysregulated, your child becomes dysregulated. Your calm is contagious.

"My emotions as a mom are contagious to my child," Dr. Amy said. "That's not woo-woo. That's neuroscience."

She walks parents through practical steps: lower your voice volume, soften your facial expression, relax your body posture. Lower the temperature on the fire. Then say something like, "I notice this seems really hard for you. I wonder what we could do to make it easier."

Go into problem-solving mode instead of punishment mode. Create an invitation for your child to safely say, "Yes, it is too hard." When they do, you can go back a step—back to where they could do it—and build slowly from there.

The framework she uses is elegant: **Don't accommodate the weakness. Remediate it.** Build the cognitive skills instead of just working around them. And here's the hope: the brain responds. Skills can be built.

She told me about a kid who couldn't spell his own name in fifth grade. By ninth grade, he was getting A's in college English. Same ADHD diagnosis. Different development trajectory.

## Why This Reframe Matters for Homeschooling Families

For homeschooling parents, this might be the most important insight: you have a unique advantage. You're not locked into a classroom structure. You can actually remediate these skills.

"Why accommodate when we can remediate?" Dr. Amy said simply.

You can slow down for working memory. You can break tasks into pieces for processing speed. You can build the cognitive muscles instead of just reducing the load.

The "bucket theory" she uses is this: your job isn't to fix the size of your child's bucket. Your job is to make the bucket as big as possible. Then the struggle seems smaller by comparison. Build on their strengths. Remediate their weaknesses. The brain is plastic.
