Basic Summary: Common myths about learning science and math include the belief that science must be serious, following instructions equates to learning, expensive materials are necessary, learning follows a linear path, mastery of theory is required before practice, natural talent is essential for creativity, and project-based learning lacks structure. In reality, encouraging exploration, creativity, and hands-on projects fosters better problem-solving skills, motivation, and confidence in children.

## Slide 1: MYTH #1: Science Should Be Serious

"Even though matter and energy were not created or destroyed, my interest in science at the time was totally destroyed."  
—Jack Casdorph, Mechanical Engineer

REALITY: Science should be the subject where kids get to play, explore, and experiment. When we prioritize formal write-ups over discovery, we kill natural curiosity.

## Slide 2: MYTH #2: Following Instructions = Learning

"What did the kid really learn when all they're doing is just following instructions? Basically their kit was just IKEA furniture that they assemble."

REALITY: True learning happens when children have creative input and can make decisions—not just follow pre-determined steps.

## Slide 3: MYTH #3: You Need Expensive Materials

"I've started making it a habit of anytime I go to throw away something that would be recycling, instead of throwing it out, I ask my son, 'Do you want to add this to your robot stuff kit?'"  
—Rachael Davie, Former Math Teacher

REALITY: Cardboard boxes, toilet paper tubes, and other household items can fuel more creativity than fancy kits.

## Slide 4: MYTH #4: Learning Always Follows a Linear Path

"The scientific method doesn't always follow these rigid steps. It's not always in order. Sometimes you go a little bit and then you have to go back because you discovered something and screwed something up."

REALITY: Real learning is messy and nonlinear. The best version might be as simple as: "I wonder, what if, let's try."

## Slide 5: MYTH #5: You Need to Master Theory Before Practice

"Traditional education tends to start with the theory and then move towards the application and problem solving. But what if people didn't start on the left hand side of the spectrum? What if they start on the far right?"

REALITY: Starting with hands-on projects often creates natural motivation to learn the theory.

## Slide 6: MYTH #6: Children Need to Be Naturally Talented to Create

"Anyone who's gotten to be pretty good at something, that skill comes from two sources. One is natural aptitude and abilities. The other is learned skills. In order to be really good at something, it's a required unskipable step to start by being bad at it."

REALITY: All skills begin with awkward first attempts. Let them try, let them be bad at it, and watch them improve.

## Slide 7: MYTH #7: Project-Based Learning Has No Structure

"I think all in all, I probably spent like 120 hours of really self-motivated learning doing these things. And my dad probably put in like five or 10 hours of giving me some feedback or presenting me with a new challenge."

REALITY: The best approach offers structure and guidance while allowing for creativity and exploration.

## Slide 8: The Truth About Learning

Kids who learn through projects develop:

- Better problem-solving skills
- Higher motivation and engagement
- Real-world application capabilities
- Confidence in their ability to figure things out
- A foundation for lifelong learning
