### Full Edited Transcript

**Ben Somers:** In San Francisco now, it's high status to homeschool. Like it is the opposite. If someone in San Francisco hears another person in San Francisco is homeschooling, they assume that means those parents are really smart. They're doing something really good, different. The stigma is for sure falling away.

**Ela Richmond:** Isn't that fascinating that the privileged thing to do now is to be able to teach your own kids and take them out and choose how they learn and imbue your culture?

**Ben Somers:** It makes a lot of sense. It means two things. One, you're dissatisfied with the quality of the education, which means you've got high standards. And two, it means you've organized your life in such a way that you can solve childcare and good instruction. You've figured out how to carve out enough time to be able to do a good job with that in an expensive city. It means that you've got really high standards and you have a lot of control over what your lifestyle looks like.

### Caption/Description

"The cultural narrative around homeschooling is shifting—fast.

In San Francisco, if you tell someone you're homeschooling, they assume you're smart, intentional, and have high standards. The old stigma has flipped entirely.

Why? Because choosing to homeschool means two things:

1. You're dissatisfied with the status quo (high standards)
2. You've organized your life to solve for what matters (control + intentionality)

Homeschooling used to signal isolation. Now it signals agency.
