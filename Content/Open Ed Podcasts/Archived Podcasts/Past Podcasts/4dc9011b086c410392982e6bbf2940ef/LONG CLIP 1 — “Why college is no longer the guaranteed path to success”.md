**Michelle Rhee:**

I think it was only when we began to see that lots of the kids that were going through successful charter management organizations…

They were going on to higher ed and getting into a lot of debt, not necessarily graduating, or graduating and not really having the job prospects that we had expected.

And I think the landscape has changed significantly now because young people just think differently about work.

I tell this story: we moved into a fancy apartment in LA, realized we were the oldest people there by far.

My husband asked everyone, ‘What do you do?’ The answers were cannabis, crypto, gaming, content creation…

Jobs that didn’t even exist 10 years ago. Their parents must be freaking out.

**Isaac Morehouse:**

And those are things that they couldn’t have even tried before—they didn’t exist.

**Michelle Rhee:**

Exactly. So the challenge now is—what are all these new jobs? How do kids even prepare for them?

**Michael Horn:**

It’s actually really hard to create change in K–12 because it’s tied to higher ed. Good high schools are measured by getting kids into good colleges.

But if colleges are misfiring, everything downstream misfires too.

That’s why we have to shift the whole structure. The mindset used to be: go to college, have a 40-year career.

But now people change jobs every 4 years. They swirl, loop, stack gigs, try things.

And we still have schools pretending this is a straight line.

**Michelle Rhee:**

Exactly. There’s no clear map anymore—and that’s what’s scary for parents and schools alike.
