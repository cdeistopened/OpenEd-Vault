## Final YouTube Package

- **Primary Title:** A Public School Administrator Reveals The Truth About Homeschooling
- **Thumbnail Text:** "They'll Read When They're Ready"

### Cold Open (Final Cut)

**Dave Hoffman:** People, especially teachers, would worry. They'd say a homeschooled kid has "gaps" in their learning. ~~But who says algebra has to come before geometry?~~ My son wasn't great at textbook math, but now he does laser-leveled excavation—calculating things that actually matter. If you teach kids to solve problems, you don't have to worry about the textbook learning. ~~Because they'll figure out what they need to learn.~~ I work with grown adults who can't think past, "What do you want me to do on this?" None of my kids have gone to college. They all make more money than I do—and they're happy.
