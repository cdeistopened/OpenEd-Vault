[CLIP #1 - 36:12 to 37:05]

**Corey**: "I mean, just look at a lot of the stories you see coming out of the public school system and its failures in Chicago. They have 30 to 40 schools with zero percent math proficiency rates. Come on, you can do better than zero percent. So just try things out and don't let anyone tell you that you don't have what it takes to raise your own kid because you do. How did you figure it out before kindergarten? Well, you are your child's first and foremost educator, and I would argue the best educator your child's ever going to have."

**On-Screen Text Options:**

1. "You taught them before school started..."
2. "Zero percent? You can do better"
3. "Your kid's first teacher was YOU"
4. "Parents taught kids before schools existed"
5. "You already know how to teach"

[CLIP #2 - COMBINED - Extended]

[https://share.descript.com/view/y3GRzBqJzOQ](https://share.descript.com/view/y3GRzBqJzOQ)

**Corey**: [23:52-24:08] "It's not one size fits all. It's one size fits none. We should let a thousand flowers bloom instead. And by definition, this system is set up to fail because families are fundamentally going to disagree about how they want to raise their kids and how they want them to be educated."

**Isaac**: [12:47-13:03] "That's why we're like, education is just opening up so fast that the boxes don't matter. And that's what happens when parents get to take that money where they want, we see new formats that we just didn't even know about before."

**Corey**: [14:25-14:55] "How do people learn how to walk without the government? How do kids learn how to talk without the government? The reality is most of our learning, even with the status quo, happens outside of the government school system anyway. So it should be self-directed. And in Arizona, they've been using these ESAs for over a decade now already."

**On-Screen Text Options:**

1. "Learning happens everywhere BUT school"
2. "Kids learned to walk without curriculum"
3. "Most learning already happens at home"
4. "Your kid is already self-teaching"
5. "School isn't where learning happens"
