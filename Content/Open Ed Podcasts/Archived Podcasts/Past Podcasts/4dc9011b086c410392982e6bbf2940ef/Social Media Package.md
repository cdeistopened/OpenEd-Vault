P.S. The verschlimmbessern callback was too perfect not to use. Medicating kids to fit a broken system is textbook "making it worse by trying to improve it."

Sound familiar?

Ben Somers spent years building education platforms and realized something profound: kids you'd label as 'unmotivated' completely transform in the right circumstance.

The issue isn't your child. It's the environment.

In this episode, Ben shares:  
• Why he was put on meth at age 11 to fit the school model  
• The shocking stat about what ACTUALLY makes kids want to learn (it's not curriculum)  
• How parents can become education designers instead of teachers  
• The Montessori principle for building safe digital spaces

**Asset:** Clip #4 - "Education Designers" (90 seconds)**Format:** Reel

**Caption:**  
"I never thought I'd be a good homeschool mom.

I thought it meant standing at a whiteboard teaching every subject forever. That didn't excite me.

Then I learned about this shift: you're not a teacher. You're an education designer.

Instead of teaching everything yourself, you're curating the right mix of resources, mentors, experiences, and communities for YOUR unique child.

That reframe changes everything.

### LinkedIn (OpenEd Company Page)

### LinkedIn Option 1: "Contrarian Take" Framework ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Hook Structure:** Challenge conventional wisdom with data

**Post:**  
We spent $10 million on curriculum.

It had less impact than something that was free.

Ben Somers worked at Synthesis School (the SpaceX school) and discovered the #1 predictor of student retention wasn't:  
• Teacher credentials (even Illinois Teacher of the Year)  
• Game quality (despite investing $10M in games)  
• Win/loss record in competitions

It was whether the kid had a friend in class.

Kids with a friend:  
→ Stayed forever  
→ Performed better  
→ Took criticism better  
→ Kept learning outside of class

Kids without a friend:  
→ Churned in 3-6 months  
→ No amount of content quality changed this

For homeschool parents obsessing over finding the "perfect curriculum":

Stop.

Focus on helping your child find learning partners who share their interests. That's the unlock.

Full conversation with Ben in the comments 👇

He also shares:  
• Why he was medicated at 11 to fit the school model (and why 25% of boys in his town were too)  
• The Montessori principle for curating digital environments  
• Why parents should think of themselves as education designers, not teachers

### LinkedIn Option 2: "Personal Story" Framework

**Hook Structure:** Vulnerability → Insight → Solution

**Post:**  
"We had to go see a psychiatrist and I went on 70 milligrams of Concerta when I weighed like a hundred pounds."

Ben Somers was 11 years old.

He wasn't medicated because he had a problem.

He was medicated because the system did.

"It was really about the other kids. It wasn't about me. I was disruptive and probably talked a lot and was running around all the time. So it was to make it easier for the teacher."

A quarter of the boys in his town were on stimulants that year.

Fast forward to today: Ben is the CEO of Recess, a platform where kids choose their own classes and make friends who share their interests. No medication required to "fit the model."

In our latest conversation, he breaks down:  
→ Why friend-in-class beats $10M curriculum every time  
→ How to apply the Montessori principle to digital spaces  
→ Why parents should be education designers, not teachers  
→ The cultural shift happening in San Francisco (homeschooling is now high status)

When did being an active, curious boy become something we medicate away?

### LinkedIn Option 3: "Myth vs Truth" Framework

**Hook Structure:** Bust common assumptions

**Post:**  
MYTH: "My kid can't focus. They're unmotivated."

TRUTH: Your kid can memorize 372 Pokemon but can't remember 50 state capitals.

That's not a motivation problem. That's an environment problem.

Ben Somers (CEO, Recess) has watched this play out hundreds of times:

Kids labeled as "unmotivated," "distractible," or "lazy" completely transform when given:

1. Choice in what they learn
2. Friends who share their interests
3. A curated environment that aligns with how they naturally learn

The issue isn't the child. It's the system demanding compliance over curiosity.

In our conversation, Ben reveals:  
• The data behind why "friend in class" beats expensive curriculum  
• His personal story of being medicated at 11 to fit the school model  
• How parents can become education designers (not teachers)  
• The Montessori framework for safe digital learning

### LinkedIn Option 4: "Data Insight" Framework

**Hook Structure:** Lead with surprising stat

**Post:**  
25% of boys in Ben Somers' school were on stimulants.

Not because they needed it.

But because it made the teacher's job easier.

"It was really about the other kids. It wasn't about me."

This is what happens when we design education systems for compliance instead of curiosity.

Active, energetic, talkative boys aren't broken. The model is.

Ben went on to work at Synthesis School (SpaceX school) where he discovered something remarkable:

The #1 predictor of learning success wasn't curriculum quality or teacher credentials.

It was whether kids had a friend in their class.

That insight led him to found Recess—a platform where kids:  
→ Choose their own classes  
→ Make friends who share their interests  
→ Learn because they want to, not because they have to

### LinkedIn Option 5: "Question Hook" Framework

**Hook Structure:** Provocative question → Reframe

**Post:**  
What if your "unmotivated" kid isn't the problem?

Can't focus in class → Can memorize 372 Pokemon  
Won't read assigned books → Reads fantasy novels for hours  
Disrupts the classroom → Builds complex Minecraft worlds

Ben Somers (Recess CEO) asks: What if we stopped labeling kids and started redesigning environments?

He experienced both sides:  
• At 11, he was put on 70mg of Concerta to "fix" him  
• At 25% of boys in his town were similarly medicated  
• Now he builds platforms where kids thrive without needing to change who they are

Key insight from working at Synthesis School (SpaceX school):

Friend in class > $10M curriculum investment

When kids have:  
✓ Choice in what they learn  
✓ Friends who share their interests  
✓ A curated environment that respects how they naturally operate

They don't need to be medicated into compliance.

• The Montessori principle for digital spaces  
• Why parents should be education designers, not teachers  
• How homeschooling became high-status in San Francisco

### Ela Richmond's Personal LinkedIn

**Framework:** "Behind the Scenes" + Personal Reflection

**Post:**  
One of my favorite questions to ask guests:

"What got you interested in education?"

Ben Somers' answer stopped me in my tracks:

"When I was 11, I had a teacher who was really frustrated that I was kind of like a foot tapper and wiggler. We had to go see a psychiatrist and I went on 70 milligrams of Concerta when I weighed like a hundred pounds."

A quarter of the boys in his school were on stimulants that year.

Not because they had learning disabilities.

But because the system couldn't accommodate active, curious boys being... active and curious.

Now Ben is the CEO of Recess, where kids choose their own classes and make friends who share their interests. He's proving there's a better way.

Three insights from our conversation that stuck with me:

1. **The $10M lesson:** Synthesis School spent millions on games/curriculum. What actually drove retention and learning? Having a friend in class. (Which is free.)
2. **The Pokemon test:** Kids who "can't memorize" 50 state capitals will memorize 372 Pokemon with perfect recall. It's not a motivation problem—it's an environment problem.
3. **The identity shift:** Parents don't need to be teachers. They need to be education designers. Curating resources, not delivering lessons.

This conversation challenged how I think about learning, motivation, and what "good education" even means.

### Tweet Thread (Launch Day)

**Tweet 1:**  
We spent $10 million on curriculum.

It had less impact than something that was free.

Ben Somers (@ben_m_somers) discovered this at Synthesis School (SpaceX school).

Thread on what ACTUALLY makes kids want to learn 🧵

**Tweet 2:**  
The #1 predictor of student retention wasn't:  
• Teacher credentials  
• Game/curriculum quality  
• Win/loss records

It was whether the kid had a friend in class.

Friend = stayed forever  
No friend = churned in 3-6 months

**Tweet 3:**  
Kids with friends in class:  
→ Performed better  
→ Took criticism better  
→ Kept learning outside of class time  
→ Made projects and sent them to friends

$10M in games couldn't compete with basic human connection.

**Tweet 4:**  
Ben's story gets more interesting.

At 11, he was put on 70mg of Concerta (meth) because he was a "foot tapper and wiggler."

25% of boys in his town were on stimulants.

Not for the kids. For the teachers.

"It was really about the other kids. It wasn't about me."

**Tweet 5:**  
Fast forward: Ben founded @recessgg

Kids choose their own classes. Make friends who share interests. Learn because they want to.

No medication required to "fit the system."

**Tweet B:**  
Hot take from @ben_m_somers:

Parents shouldn't be teachers.

Stop trying to deliver every lesson yourself.

Start curating the right mix of resources, mentors, and experiences for YOUR kid.

**Subject:** Your 'unmotivated' kid isn't the problem—the environment is

Hi [Name],

Can't memorize 50 state capitals.

Knows all 372 Pokemon.

If that's your kid, they're not lazy or unmotivated. They're in the wrong environment.

This week's podcast guest, Ben Somers, has seen this pattern hundreds of times. Kids labeled as "distracted" or "difficult" completely transform when given two things:

1. Choice in what they learn
2. Friends who share their interests

Ben learned this the hard way. At 11, he was put on 70mg of Concerta (meth) because he was a "foot tapper and wiggler." A quarter of the boys in his town were similarly medicated.

Not because they had problems. But because the system couldn't accommodate active, curious boys.

Now Ben is the CEO of Recess, where kids choose their own classes and make friends around shared interests. No medication required.

In our conversation, he shares:

→ The data behind why "friend in class" beats expensive curriculum  
→ How parents can become education designers (not teachers)  
→ The Montessori principle for building safe digital spaces  
→ Why homeschooling became high-status in San Francisco

**[LISTEN NOW]**

One insight that stuck with me:

"We spent $10 million a year on games at Synthesis School. They had less impact on retention than having a friend in class, which is close to free."

### Clip Details

**Name:** "Can't Memorize 50 States, But Knows 372 Pokemon"**Timestamp:** 19:52 - 20:36**Length:** ~44 seconds

### Full Edited Transcript

**Ben Somers:** I've been surprised at how often kids you would label as unmotivated totally morph into absolutely those things in the right circumstance. When you get them going about their thing, we all know this intuitively. You ask some kid who can't memorize state capitals and then you ask them and they can list all 372 Pokemon and which ones were a part of the different leagues and memorize them perfectly and all their moves. This doesn't make sense.

### Recommended On-Screen Text (Final)

**Primary Option:** "Your kid isn't lazy. School is boring."

**Alternate Options:**

- "50 state capitals ❌ 372 Pokemon ✅"

### Caption/Description

"Every parent with a 'distracted' kid needs to hear this. The issue isn't motivation—it's environment. When kids care about something, they'll memorize 372 Pokemon. When they don't, they can't remember 50 states. What does that tell us about our education system?

### Clip Details

**Name:** "I Was Medicated to Make the Teacher's Job Easier"**Timestamp:** 02:31 - 03:34**Length:** ~63 seconds**Hook Type:** Dark revelation - conversation starter, emotionally powerful**Platform Priority:** YouTube, Instagram, Facebook (parent groups)

### Full Edited Transcript

**Ela Richmond:** The purpose of the pill was just to keep you paying attention?

**Ben Somers:** It was really about the other kids. It wasn't about me. I think I was disruptive and probably talked a lot and was running around all the time. And so it was to make it easier for the teacher to deal with the classroom and make it a better experience for the other kids. In my town that year, I think almost a quarter of all the boys in the school were on stimulants.

### Recommended On-Screen Text (Final)

**Primary Option:** "We don't drug kids for them. We drug them for everyone else."

**Alternate Options:**

- "25% of boys medicated to make the teacher's job easier"
- "It wasn't about fixing me. It was about controlling me."
- "Your kid's ADHD diagnosis might not be about your kid"

### Caption/Description

"This is an uncomfortable truth about why so many boys are medicated in school. Ben Somers was put on 70mg of Concerta at age 11—not because he needed it, but because it made the teacher's job easier. A quarter of the boys in his town were on stimulants that year.

When did being an active, curious boy become something we medicate away? The system isn't broken—it's working exactly as designed: to create compliance, not curiosity.

⚠️ This isn't anti-medication. This is anti-medicating kids to fit a broken system.

### Clip Details

**Name:** "You're Not a Teacher. You're an Education Designer."**Timestamp:** 33:18 - 35:47**Length:** ~2 minutes 29 seconds (can be trimmed to 90 seconds)**Hook Type:** Paradigm shift for homeschool-curious parents**Platform Priority:** YouTube, Instagram (longer format), LinkedIn

### Full Edited Transcript

**Ela Richmond:** I never thought I'd be a good homeschool mom. Cause I always thought homeschooling was I'm gonna sit in front of a whiteboard and I'm going to personally be the one to teach you every single subject forever. And that never excited me. Like I'm not a teacher. I don't think I could explain it well. I think I'd get frustrated. And really expanding my idea to, okay, I'm not necessarily having to open myself up to being the teacher of everything. Rather, I'm becoming like an education designer. What could my child's education become? And I'm designing the education that aligns with our values, that aligns with them.

**Ben Somers:** Yes. Yes.

**Ela Richmond:** And that becomes something that can help them to become who they could possibly be, kind of back to what you and I were talking about. You get into education thinking, oh, if I had these different experiences, who could I possibly be? And as a parent, you now get to look down at your kid and you're like, okay, who could you possibly be? Let's figure it out. And that is infinitely more exciting to me than the alternative.

### Recommended On-Screen Text (Final)

**Primary Option:** "You're not a teacher. You're an education designer."

**Alternate Options:**

- "From 'Can I do this?' to 'What could this become?'"
- "Who could your child possibly be?"
- "Design the education your child deserves"

### Shortened Version (90 seconds - Timestamp: 33:18-34:48)

**Ela Richmond:** I never thought I'd be a good homeschool mom. Cause I always thought homeschooling was I'm gonna sit in front of a whiteboard and personally teach every single subject forever. And that never excited me. Rather, I'm becoming like an education designer. What could my child's education become? And I'm designing the education that aligns with our values, that aligns with them.

**Ben Somers:** Yes.

**Ela Richmond:** And as a parent, you now get to look down at your kid and you're like, okay, who could you possibly be? Let's figure it out. And that is infinitely more exciting to me.

### Caption/Description

"The biggest misconception about homeschooling: that you have to be the teacher.

You don't. You're the education designer.

Instead of standing at a whiteboard teaching every subject, you're curating the right mix of resources, experiences, mentors, and communities for YOUR child. You're asking 'Who could they become?' instead of 'Can I do this?'

That shift—from teacher to designer—changes everything.

**Name:** "Turn Your Kid's iPad from Bad to Great"**Timestamp:** 28:00-29:44 (Part 1) + 30:44-32:10 (Part 2) - Combined/Edited**Length:** ~90 seconds (edited)**Hook Type:** Practical solution to universal parent pain point**Platform Priority:** Instagram, Facebook, YouTube

### Full Edited Transcript (Combined & Trimmed)

**Ben Somers:** The Montessori idea—she really wanted to give the kid a lot of freedom and have the kid learn independence and self-motivation. And so she would let the kids choose whatever they wanted within a curated environment. So you couldn't bring your toys from home in. But anything she had in her space, you could take out and play with.

If you grew up in a nice town that's super safe where your parents have good value systems, the kid can have a ton of freedom from the time they're eight years old. If you grew up in environments where there are tons of bad influences around, you shouldn't get a lot of freedom as a kid. So the better you can make the environments—and this is where I get super obsessed—is the digital environment.

Almost every parent I know with a kid under 10 is terrified of screens. Has a lot of anxiety about them, frustrations about them, doesn't want their kid on them, worrying about how much time to spend on them.

**Ela Richmond:** How do you determine when is the right point to expose them to things that are highly addictive?

**Ben Somers:** You can't rely on the tech to raise your kids correctly or to teach the kids how to use them safely. They will not do that. That really has to be you. Or you work on the thing I'm working on, which I hope will have this effect. You download an app on your iPad and it turns your iPad from bad to great. It goes from something you really are nervous about giving your kid to something you are absolutely hyped to give your kid.

### Recommended On-Screen Text (Final)

**Primary Option:** "Screens aren't bad. Bad environments are."

**Alternate Options:**

- "Turn your kid's iPad from bad to great"
- "Freedom within a curated environment"
- "From terrified to hyped about screen time"

### Caption/Description

"The screen time debate is asking the wrong question. It's not 'screens or no screens'—it's 'what environment are we creating?'

Montessori understood this: kids need freedom, but within a curated space. You can't bring any toy from home, but anything in the learning environment is fair game.

The same principle applies to digital spaces. Instead of banning screens out of fear, we should be building curated digital environments where kids can explore freely within our values.

That's what Ben Somers is building—turning iPads from something parents dread into something they're excited to give their kids.

### Production Notes

- Split screen showing anxious parent vs. engaged child
- Visual metaphor: messy internet vs. curated garden
- Hopeful, solution-oriented tone
- Great partnership opportunity for tech/parenting brands

## Platform-Specific Strategy

### **INSTAGRAM** (Primary Platform for Reach)

### Post 1: Meme - Drake Pointing Format

- Top: "Spending $10M on perfect curriculum" [Drake disapproving]
- Bottom: "Your kid having one friend in class" [Drake approving]

**Caption**:

```Plain
What actually makes kids want to learn (backed by data from Synthesis School)

Ben Somers spent years at the SpaceX school watching them invest millions in educational games. You know what beat everything?

Whether the kid had a friend in class.

Not teacher credentials. Not curriculum quality. Not winning games.

Friend in class = stuck around forever, performed better, talked about learning outside class.

No friend = churned in 3-6 months.

Everyone's sleeping on friends—both to make learning stick and to make kids actually enjoy it.

This is why @recess.gg built their entire platform around kid choice + friend-making. Kids pick classes, meet others who like the same stuff, and motivation spreads through actual friendships.

Stop agonizing over the perfect curriculum. Focus on connection.

### Post 2: Reel - "Education Designer" Text Over Video

**Visual**: Simple branded video or stock footage of parent + kids**On-screen text progression**:

1. "I'm not qualified to homeschool"
2. "I'd have to teach every subject"
3. "I'd need to be an expert in everything"
4. [REFRAME]
5. "You're not a teacher."
6. "You're an education designer."
7. "You curate. You don't deliver everything."

**Audio**: Trending sound (something contemplative/empowering)

**Caption**:

```Plain
There's a guy who tried to make a chicken sandwich completely from scratch.

Grew the wheat. Raised the chickens. Harvested salt from the ocean.

Six months later... he had a terrible sandwich.

Most parents think homeschooling means becoming that guy.

But here's the shift: You don't need to personally deliver every lesson. You need to curate the right mix of resources, experiences, and relationships that work for YOUR unique child.

You're the architect, not the general contractor.

The tools exist now. The question is: are you designing, or are you trying to be a one-person school system?

**Slide 2**:  
"❌ WRONG: You have to teach everything yourself  
✅ RIGHT: You're an education designer, not a teacher of everything"

**Slide 3**:  
"❌ WRONG: Curriculum quality is everything  
✅ RIGHT: Whether your kid has a friend matters more (backed by $10M research)"

**Slide 4**:  
"❌ WRONG: Homeschooling is for weird families  
✅ RIGHT: In San Francisco, it's now high-status (signals high standards + life control)"

**Slide 5**:  
"❌ WRONG: You need to replicate school at home  
✅ RIGHT: The best approach adapts to your child, not the other way around"

**Slide 6**:  
"VOCABULARY:  
Verschlimmbessern (German)  
When you make something worse by trying to improve it.

Like medicating 25% of boys to fit a broken system.

Time to design something better."

The homeschool reframe that changes everything →

Swipe to see what most parents get wrong (and what actually works)

These insights come from Ben Somers, who was medicated at age 11 to fit the "sit still and listen" model, then went on to work at Synthesis School (the SpaceX school) and discover what actually drives learning success.

Spoiler: It's not what you think.

Now he's built @recess.gg around those insights—a platform where kids choose classes, make friends who share their interests, and motivation spreads through connection (not coercion).

### Post 1: Question Post with Background Image

**Visual**: Background image of kids playing/learning together

**Text**:

```Plain
In San Francisco, homeschooling is now high-status.

When parents there hear another family is homeschooling, they assume those parents are really smart—doing something good, different. The stigma has flipped.

Why? Because it signals two things:
1. You have high standards (dissatisfied with conventional quality)
2. You've organized your life to actually do something about it

I know this can sound elitist. And it is, in some ways.

But here's what's actually making homeschooling more accessible: realizing you DON'T have to do everything yourself.

You're not supposed to be the teacher of everything. You're the education designer.

For OpenEd families: What made you decide to design your child's education instead of defaulting to the system?

### Post 2: Heavy-Hitting Quote Graphic

**Visual**: Quote over branded background or photo of kids

**Quote**:  
"To fit into the standardized model of how you're supposed to learn, we load up hundred-pound 11-year-olds with methamphetamines. That seems really crazy. There has to be a better way."  
— Ben Somers, [Recess.gg](http://recess.gg/) founder

**Caption**:

```Plain
Ben Somers was one of those 11-year-olds.

He was put on 70mg of Concerta—not because he needed it, but because the system did. He was a foot tapper. A wiggler.

In his town that year, 25% of all the boys were on ADHD medication.

Not to help them learn better. To make the classroom run more smoothly.

The system adapts children to fit the model instead of adapting the model to fit children.

This is why OpenEd exists—to help families design education that adapts to THEIR unique child.

### **LINKEDIN** (Thought Leaders & Education Innovation Crowd)

### Option 1: Personal Story Format (Long-Form)

```Plain
I interviewed Ben Somers this week.

When he was 11, a teacher sent him to a psychiatrist because he was a "foot tapper and wiggler."

The psychiatrist put him on 70mg of Concerta. That's a really large dose of methamphetamines for a kid who weighed about 100 pounds.

The medication wasn't prescribed to help Ben learn better. It was prescribed to make him easier to manage.

In his town that year, 25% of all the boys were on some kind of ADHD medication.

---

Fast forward: Ben dropped out of high school, eventually worked at Synthesis School (the SpaceX school), and now runs Recess—a platform trying to solve the problems he experienced firsthand.

Here's what he discovered that should make every parent relax a little:

At Synthesis, they spent $10 million a year on educational content. Best game designers. Complex simulations. Constant iteration.

The #1 predictor of whether a kid stuck around and learned?

Whether they had a friend in their class.

Not teacher credentials. Not curriculum quality. Not the games.

If a kid had one friend in class, they stayed forever and performed better. Without a friend, they churned in 3-6 months—regardless of how "good" everything else was.

---

Everyone's sleeping on what actually drives learning: connection.

And here's the reframe that changed how I think about alternative education:

"You're not supposed to be the teacher of everything. You're the education designer."

You don't need to personally deliver every lesson. You need to curate the right mix of resources, experiences, and relationships that work for your unique child.

The tools exist now. Platforms like Recess (recess.gg) are building around the insights we've learned: kids need choice, and kids need friends.

The question isn't whether we're qualified to design our children's education.

The question is: Can we afford to keep adapting our children to fit a system that was never designed for them in the first place?

### Option 2: Data-Driven Format (Shorter)

```Plain
$10 million spent on educational content.

$0 spent on the thing that actually worked.

At Synthesis School (the SpaceX school), they invested heavily in creating the best educational games possible. Best designers. Complex simulations. Constant iteration based on data.

The #1 predictor of learning success?

Whether the kid had a friend in their class.

→ Not teacher credentials
→ Not curriculum quality
→ Not winning games

If a kid had one friend: stayed forever, performed better, talked about learning outside class.

No friend: churned in 3-6 months, regardless of everything else.

This insight shaped how Ben Somers (who experienced being medicated at 11 to fit the "sit still" model) built Recess: a platform where kids choose classes based on interest and make friends who share those interests.

Connection unlocks everything.

Maybe it's time to stop optimizing curriculum and start optimizing for human connection.

🧵 I interviewed Ben Somers, who was put on methamphetamines at age 11 because he was a "foot tapper."

What he learned about education will surprise you.

When Ben was 11, a teacher sent him to a psychiatrist. Not because he was failing or violent. Because he moved around in his seat.

The psychiatrist put him on 70mg of Concerta. He weighed 100 pounds.

(2/9)

The medication wasn't about Ben. It was about making the classroom easier to manage.

"It was really about the other kids," he told me. "It wasn't about me."

In his town that year, 25% of all boys were on ADHD medication.

(3/9)

Fast forward: Ben works at Synthesis School (the SpaceX school). They're spending $10 million a year on educational content.

Best game designers. Complex team simulations. Constant iteration.

Then they discover something that changes everything.

The #1 predictor of whether a kid sticks around and actually learns?

Whether they have a friend in their class.

Not teacher credentials. Not curriculum quality. Not the games.

Friends > $10 million in content.

(5/9)

---

If a kid had one friend in class:
→ Stayed forever
→ Performed better
→ Could take criticism
→ Talked about learning outside class
→ Made projects in free time

No friend? Churned in 3-6 months, regardless of how "good" everything else was.

(6/9)

This is the insight that shaped Recess (recess.gg):

Kids browse classes taught by YouTubers and professionals. They REQUEST what excites them. Parents approve.

When kids join, they meet others who like the same stuff. Friend suggestions. Discord-style chat.

(7/9)

But here's the reframe that matters for every parent:

"You're not supposed to be the teacher of everything. You're the education designer."

You curate the mix. You don't have to deliver it all yourself.

The tools exist now.

We spent decades medicating kids to fit the system.

Maybe it's time to build a system that fits the kids.
