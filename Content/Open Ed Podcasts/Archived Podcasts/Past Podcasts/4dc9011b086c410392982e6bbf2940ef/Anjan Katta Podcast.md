For families choosing alternative education—homeschooling, unschooling, microschools, hybrid approaches—this matters. The false dichotomy has always been: Chromebook versus textbook. AI apps versus pen and paper. Digital versus analog. But that's not the real choice. The real choice is between technology that enhances without extraction, and technology that extracts without enhancing.

There are adaptive learning apps like Khan Academy, Mentava, Synthesis, and Recess.gg that offer a much more efficient and personalized way to help kids learn. But on a screen that dysregulates them, the learning comes with a steep cost.

The goal is less screen time, but more focused. It should get out of your way as fast as possible.

That sticker on my monitor—"Finish your work and go outside"—used to feel like an indictment.

I used to think it was my fault I couldn't live up to it. That I just wasn't good enough at managing my relationship with technology.

But society imposed this on us. Want to work? Stare at a screen. Want to communicate? Stare at a screen. Want your kids to access quality education? Stare at a screen.

It's not your fault if you're stuck.

But you are responsible for what happens next. Especially for what you pass on to your kids.

The hippie ideals that birthed Silicon Valley—computers as tools for expanding human potential, as bicycles for the mind—didn't die. They just went underground for forty years, waiting for someone uncomfortable enough, and stubborn enough, to bring them back.

Anjan didn't set out to fulfill Steve Jobs' abandoned vision. He just wanted to learn without destroying his eyes. "Our goal is just to show people there can be hope," he told me. "Computers don't need to be so terrible for you. There is another way and these big companies will not let you know this."

The sticker stops being a rebuke when the computer actually helps you finish so you can go outside sooner. When technology amplifies your capability without replacing it. When the screen gets out of your way instead of trapping you inside.

That future isn't theoretical anymore.

# v1 Draft

Anjan Katta was the kind of kid who couldn't tolerate what everyone else accepted uncritically.

He was sensitive. Probably ADHD. He'd later be diagnosed with seasonal affective disorder, but as a kid, he just knew that fluorescent bulbs made him want to crawl out of his skin.

In a small town with not much to do, he found refuge in books. His dad was a psychiatrist, so their house was covered in texts revealing what Anjan calls the "deep truth" behind surface reality—about the way the world actually works versus the story we're told.

Computers promised even more knowledge—a veritable library of Alexandria times a hundred, all accessible from a glowing rectangle.

He thought he’d found a way to get smart enough to understand everything.

Then came the eye strain so severe that doctors thought it was glaucoma. He recalls spending hours reading, but absorbing nothing.

"I was so dysregulated," he told me.

The promise of digital enlightenment had been a mirage.

At first, he blamed himself, thinking he just lacked willpower.

Next he blamed the software—the diabolically designed algorithms, the slot machines of YouTube and TikTok and infinite feeds.

But he also stumbled upon a deeper root cause:

"I didn't quite appreciate how the light and appearance of a computer screen actually deeply plays a role in the way it's dysregulating."

This insight would take him on a six-year journey to solve a technological problem that every expert in the field said was impossible:

Creating a screen that’s as fast as any other device, but with the e-ink technology popularized by Amazon’s Kindle for being so much easier on the eyes.

By the time he finished, he'd built the Daylight Computer—a screen that works like paper, readable in direct sunlight, with none of the mechanisms that put your nervous system on high alert.

But first, he had to understand exactly what those mechanisms were. <this might not be the actual chrnologiy, let’s find a better bridge>

## **Your Computer Is a Vegas Casino**

The simplest way to describe it is that your computer is trying its best to simulate a Vegas casino. Casinos figured out how to design a light environment that makes people most susceptible to dopamine loops:

1. Block out all natural light.
2. Crank the brightness.
3. Make everything flicker.
4. Oversaturate the colors.

Basically, you out the nervous system on high alert, and suddenly people become maximally vulnerable to getting stuck in consumptive, stimming loops <eliminate some redunancy here>.

Your kid's Chromebook or iPad was designed—unwittingly or not—the same way.

Anjan breaks down the 5 mechanisms at work with the precision of someone who's spent years studying the physics of displays:

1. **Blue light.** Blue light from screens affects your vagal tone, your nervous system, your breathing patterns, your blink rate. It disrupts your dopamine system, your melatonin production, your circadian rhythms, and all the metabolic processes that cascade from those systems. Your body thinks it's noon when it's midnight. Every screen session is a small jetlag.
2. **Flicker.** Thought invisible to your conscious perception, your nervous system detects tge LED backlight pulsing on and off, sometimes hundreds of times per second. Your brain registers this as subtle, chronic stress. Even "flicker-free" screens aren't actually flicker-free—they just flicker faster than you can consciously detect.
3. **Brightness mismatch.** Your screen is always either brighter or dimmer than your environment, which forces constant adaptation. This creates what researchers call "accommodation stress"—your pupils are perpetually adjusting, your eye muscles are perpetually straining. It's subtle, but chronic. The equivalent of having someone randomly turn a dimmer switch up and down all day while you're trying to focus.
4. **Oversaturated colors.** Modern displays can produce colors engineered to be more vivid, more intense, more attention-grabbing than anything in the natural world. This isn't by accident—it's by design. Oversaturated colors overstimulate your dopamine centers. Your brain gets a little hit of novelty with every scroll, every swipe, every new notification.
5. **Indoor captivity.** Lastly, backlit screens are nearly impossible to read in direct sunlight, which means you're trapped inside. The screen doesn't just occupy your attention—it dictates your physical location.

The combination of these five mechanisms leads to something call "screen apnea" (like sleep apnea, but for screens).

"Basically, because you have sympathetic overregulation and not enough parasympathetic, you actually breathe less when you're on a computer," Anjan explained. "You take less breaths per minute, and your tidal volume is less, meaning you breathe shallower. The combination of these two is you're dysregulated. You're a bit more anxious."

You're dysregulated before you even open TikTok.

Seen through this lens, your kid's post-iPad meltdown makes more sense. Their nervous system has been in subtle fight-or-flight for however long they've been on the screen, and when you take it away, they crash.

Adults aren’t immune either—we just have better emotional regulation (most of the time), so it manifests as irritability, difficulty focusing, that vague sense of being fried after a long day of screen work.

## Finish Your Work and Go Outside

<this section would benefit from more quotes from Anjan about the ultimate philsophy and idea behind his company>

I have a mantra taped to my computer monitor that reads "Finish your work and go outside."

On any given weekday, I'm glued to my seat for the majority of my waking hours—headphones blocking out sound, the monitor blocking out natural light from the window behind it. I hunch over in what feels, on a good day, like productive focus but is probably closer to a trance.

It's only when I actually emerge that my view expands—literally. My eyes relax. My shoulders drop. I remember why I needed to go outside so badly.

Media theorist Marshall McLuhan called this "the hypertrophy of the eye." Modernity, McLuhuan, thought had led to a grotesque overdevelopment of one sense at the expense of all others. Ever since Gutenberg, life has centered more and more around the printed word. And in the past 50 years, that word has moved to the screen. McLuhan wasn't speaking metaphorically. Your eye muscles actually lock when you stare at closeup screens for hours. My own eyesight became “progressively myopic” (read: nearsighted) around sophomore year of high school and kept getting worse for the next decade.

The hours of Nintendo 64, iMovie projects, and being terminally online before anyone called it that. It was fun and novel until I realized it was making me depressed.

When one sense hypertrophies, the others atrophy. Hyperfocus on the visual means loss of proprioception (where your body is in space), peripheral vision, and awareness of your environment.

Have you ever wondered why your best ideas never come when you’re hunched over a laptop?

"Unstructured time is the fundamental substrate for creativity," Anjan told me. Your clearest thinking happens with a notepad under a tree, looking up occasionally, letting your eyes relax into the distance. Not trapped in the tunnel vision of a backlit screen.

The logical conclusion of hypertrophy might be the Apple Vision Pro. The final stage of locked-in, zoomed-in, hunched-over computing: Just strap the computer directly to your face.  
Big educational bets are being made on VR—millions of dollars flowing toward a future where kids learn strapped into headsets.

But there's also a growing chorus against the widespread adoption of computers in schools, from Chromebooks to VR.

(Think Mark Zuckerberg lets his kids hang out unsupervised in the metaverse??)

<note this line is here… might need a better bridge> Kids already spend hours on screens outside of class. Adding more screen time during school sounds like a disaster.

## The Impossible Problem and the Naive Outsider Who Solved It

<needs a better bridge/intro - this is too opaque>

According to every expert in the field, the answer was no. You could not make a screen that worked like paper but was fast enough for real computing.

E-ink displays—the technology behind Kindle e-readers—had existed since the 1970s. They worked through reflected light, like actual paper. No backlight, no flicker, readable in direct sunlight. None of the five Vegas casino mechanisms. But they were impossibly slow. "It's good for Harry Potter," Anjan said, "and it's not good for what I wanted." You couldn't scroll smoothly, couldn't type on a keyboard, couldn't watch the cursor move in real time. All the things a computer needs to do.

Generation after generation of researchers tried to speed them up. Generation after generation failed.

By 2018, it was a graveyard. Professors who'd dedicated decades to the problem had run out of funding and moved on. Companies had burned through investor money and shut down. Everyone agreed: fast e-ink was _theoretically_ possible but practically _im_possible. The breakthroughs always seemed three years away. And they'd been three years away for thirty years.

Anjan didn't know any of this when he started.

He was in his mid-twenties, no formal training in display technology, just a sensitive kid who'd spent his whole life fighting with screens. He started reading papers, going to conferences, and teaching himself the physics of how displays actually work.

Within two years, he'd reached what he calls "the edge of human knowledge" in the field—not because he was a genius, but because the field had stagnated for so long that even an amateur could catch up.

And that's when he saw it.

A Japanese professor who'd been working on this for thirty-plus years. A material science breakthrough from the Netherlands. Another from Florida State. None of them were from display research. Nobody had connected them. The crucial papers came from other opto-electronic applications—adjacent fields that the display specialists weren't reading. But if you put them together—if you combined this specific electrophoretic technology with these particular optical materials—the math suggested it should work.

Every expert he showed it to said no. Not because they could prove the math wrong, but because they'd been burned too many times. "It won't work," they'd say. "Trust us."

"But can you prove my math is wrong?" Anjan would ask.

Nobody could.

"I think the entire reason I was able to come up with this is because I was not in the field," he told me. "I was completely new and completely naive to this."

The same neurological wiring that made Anjan vulnerable to screens also made him acutely aware of problems that neurotypical people might not consciously register. He could feel the difference between good light and bad light in his body. Most people just experience vague discomfort or fatigue after hours on screens. Anjan's nervous system was telling him something specific was wrong. <is this necessary? tightne it and fix up>

This is the pattern with a lot of breakthrough innovations. The traits that make someone "difficult" in conventional systems—hypersensitivity, refusal to accept arbitrary limits, inability to just tolerate what everyone else tolerates—are often exactly what's required to notice problems that have become invisible through habituation.

In 1972, Steve Jobs dropped out of Reed College but kept sneaking into one class: calligraphy. Everyone thought it was useless. Ten years later, it became the reason the Macintosh had beautiful fonts.

"If I had never dropped in on that single course," Jobs said later, "the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts."

Jobs learned something useless that became essential. Anjan had a deficit that became a superpower. <is this forced?>

The Japanese professor was generous enough to let Anjan use his lab. Two years of prototyping turned into six. But it worked. You _can_ make e-ink fast enough to replace a traditional computer screen. You just need to be naive enough—or desperate enough—to ignore everyone telling you it's impossible.

What he built isn't "a faster Kindle," though that's what everyone thinks at first. It's a return to first principles.

Paper is what Nassim Taleb would call a Lindy technology—it's lasted thousands of years because it works with human biology, not against it. No flicker. No blue light. No brightness mismatch with your environment. It requires natural light, which means it forces you outside, connecting you to circadian regulation. It's passive, not demanding. It doesn't regulate you—you regulate yourself.

The Daylight Computer uses the same principle. A screen that works like paper but is computational. Readable in direct sunlight. Fast enough to actually replace your laptop or your kid's Chromebook. You can write, browse the web, use apps.

Technology is at its best, Taleb says, when it's invisible. It gets out of your way so you can do what you actually need to do.

## The Bicycle, the Tool, and What You Pass On

In 1990, Steve Jobs had a favorite metaphor that nobody remembers correctly. Everyone quotes "bicycle for the mind," but they miss what he was actually saying.

He'd read a study about the efficiency of locomotion—how much energy different species use to move. Humans ranked poorly. But humans on bicycles crushed everything. More efficient than condors, cheetahs, everything.

"That's what a computer should be," Jobs said. "It should amplify human capability."

Not a car that does the work for you. A bicycle—where you're still doing the work, still in your body, still moving—just more efficiently, more joyfully.

Ivan Illich saw this coming in 1971. In "Deschooling Society," he described a vision of the internet before the internet existed—a catalog where people could find others with similar interests and learn together. We have that now. Outschool.com is getting closer.

{fixx this whole section— two separate ideas… He called it "tools of conviviality." <he didn’t call it tools of convivliaty - this was a related idea though) Tools that serve you versus machines that enslave you.}}

  

But here's what happened: computers evolved as machines, not tools. It's like commuting in bumper-to-bumper traffic. The car is fast, but you're stuck. Your Chromebook has processing power, but your creativity is locked down. The speed becomes irrelevant when you can't actually use it.

"The point of daylight is the least computer possible," Anjan told me. "You do what you need to do and you put it away and you go outside. And you put your hands in the dirt and you play with other people."

It’s not about rejecting technology entirely, but choosing technology that doesn't dysregulate. Technology that remembers what it was supposed to be.

One mom told Anjan she went from limiting her kids to 45 minutes per week on an iPad to giving them unlimited screen time on a Daylight. Why? The dysregulation disappeared. As Anjan put it: "More interesting than picking on your sister, but less interesting than your backyard."

That's the sweet spot.

For families choosing alternative education—homeschooling, unschooling, microschools, hybrid approaches—this matters. The false dichotomy has always been: Chromebook versus textbook. AI apps versus pen and paper. Digital versus analog. But that's not the real choice. The real choice is between technology that enhances without extraction, and technology that extracts without enhancing.

Adaptive learning apps exist—Khan Academy, Mentava, Synthesis, [Recess.gg](http://Recess.gg), and others—that can genuinely help kids learn. But on a screen that dysregulates them, the learning comes with a steep cost.

The goal is less screen time, but more focused. Tt should get out of the way as fast as possible.

Here's the thing about that sticker on my monitor—the one that reads "Finish your work and go outside."

I used to think it was my fault I couldn't live up to it. That I just wasn’t good enough at managing my relationship with technology.

  

But society imposed this on us. Want to work? Stare at a screen. Want to communicate? Stare at a screen. Want your kids to access quality education? Stare at a screen.

It's not your fault if you're stuck.

But you are responsible for what happens next. Especially for what you pass on to your kids.

The hippie ideals that birthed Silicon Valley—computers as tools for expanding human potential, as bicycles for the mind—didn't die. They just went underground for forty years, waiting for someone uncomfortable enough, and stubborn enough, to bring them back.

Anjan didn't set out to fulfill Steve Jobs' abandoned vision. He just wanted to learn without destroying his eyes.

{this veers off the rails a bit… let’s find a good quote from Anjan to end with>

The sticker stops being a rebuke when the computer actually helps you finish so you can go outside sooner. When technology amplifies your capability without replacing it. When the screen gets out of your way instead of trapping you inside.

## EPISODE DESCRIPTION

Explore how screens affect children's nervous systems with Daylight Computer founder Anjan Katta. Learn about e-ink technology creating healthier alternatives for education, ADHD support, and personalized learning. \#EdTech \#ScreenTime \#DigitalWellness

Your kid isn't "addicted" to screens by accident. Their devices were engineered using the same psychological tricks as Vegas slot machines—and it's doing real damage to their nervous system.

Anjan Katta dropped out of high school, struggled with ADHD and screen addiction, then spent 6 years solving what experts said was impossible: making a computer screen that doesn't destroy your health. In this conversation, we break down exactly how modern screens dysregulate kids (hint: it's not just "blue light"), why the education technology we're giving our children might be making them worse at learning, and what the alternative actually looks like.

**Key Insights:**

- The 5 mechanisms screens use to hijack your nervous system (the Vegas casino effect)
- Why "screen apnea" is making your kid anxious (and you probably have it too)
- How reading more on screens can actually mean learning less
- The "least computer possible" philosophy for families
- Why naive outsiders solve impossible problems (and what that means for parents redesigning education)

**About Anjan Katta:**  
Founder of Daylight Computer, creator of the first fast E-Ink screen that can replace traditional laptops and tablets. Former ADHD kid who turned his sensitivity to screens into a solution for millions of families.
