**Brenna Clarke Gray:** My eight-year-old loves mythology from anywhere in the world. Stacks of books, mythology podcasts, facts about mythology. ~~That came from boredom, particularly during pandemic closure. He was three or four, just starting to read.~~

But I've also noticed that my kid doesn't want to do a school project about mythology just because he loves it. Nothing kills intrinsic motivation like assigning grades to it. Everybody who's good at a craft, then opens an Etsy store and hates that craft. As soon as you impose external standards on something you loved for its own sake, that kills motivation for a lot of us.

_Hard for education systems though—do a project on this thing you love, now you hate it and I killed it._

**OPTION 1: Personal Anecdote Hook** (Story-driven)

Brenna Clarke Gray's son became obsessed with mythology during the pandemic. Books, podcasts, ancient history—he couldn't get enough.

Then she made it a school project.

And he stopped.

Nothing kills what a kid loves to learn like turning it into homework. The moment you add grades to something they're naturally passionate about, you destroy the intrinsic motivation that made it beautiful.

It's like that feeling when you open an Etsy shop for your craft and suddenly hate making it.

---

**OPTION 2: Cause and Effect** (Principle-focused)

Grades on passion projects usually lead to lost interest.

Brenna's eight-year-old loved mythology. The moment she suggested making it a school assignment, something shifted.

Nothing kills intrinsic motivation like external standards. The instant you grade something they love, you've destroyed their desire to keep learning it.

Think about your own experience: something you loved until you had to monetize it, grade it, or prove your competence in it.

Same principle.

---

**OPTION 3: Contrarian Post** (Challenge conventional wisdom)

Unpopular opinion: Making kids do school projects on their passions kills those passions.

Brenna's 8-year-old was obsessed with mythology—stacks of books, mythology podcasts, encyclopedic knowledge. The moment she suggested: "Let's make this a school project," something died.

Nothing kills intrinsic motivation like external standards.

Most parents think turning a child's passion into curriculum is _supporting_ their learning. It's actually destroying it.

---

**OPTION 4: The Observation Post** (Pattern recognition)

One pattern Brenna Clarke Gray has noticed in kids who love learning:

Their passion exists outside the grading system.

Her son was obsessed with mythology. Books, podcasts, endless questions. Self-directed. Joyful.

Then she said: "Let's turn this into a school project."

And suddenly, he didn't want to do it anymore.

Nothing kills intrinsic motivation like external standards imposed on something someone loves for its own sake.

---

**OPTION 5: Hard Truth / Problem Diagnosis** (Direct, uncomfortable)

==Hard pill to swallow: You might be killing your child's love of learning right now.==

The moment you assign a grade to something they're naturally passionate about—a hobby they chose, an interest they developed on their own—you've shifted it from intrinsic motivation to extrinsic.

Brenna's son loved mythology until she made it homework.

Same thing happens in classrooms constantly: "You love creative writing? Great! Here's your assignment."

Motivation dead.

---

**OPTION 6: Universal Success Ingredients** (Principle-based)

Intrinsic motivation has two enemies: grades and expectations.

Brenna's eight-year-old developed a genuine passion for mythology during pandemic downtime. Self-directed. Joyful. Endless.

The moment she suggested making it a school project, both enemies appeared.

And the passion died.

This applies beyond childhood. Monetize your hobby. Same thing happens. Add external standards to anything you love for its own sake, and you've destroyed what made it beautiful.

**On-Screen Text:** How I accidentally killed my kid's love of learning

**Caption:**

So your child is developing a genuine, self-directed passion for something. They're learning, asking questions, diving deeper on their own. So naturally, you think: "Let's make this part of their education."

Then you assign a grade.

And suddenly, they don't want to do it anymore.

What is that about?

Here’s one theory: Nothing kills intrinsic motivation like external standards imposed on something someone loves for its own sake. It's not just about schooling—it's a fundamental principle of human motivation that extends across everything we do.

Think about something you loved before you had to monetize it, grade it, or prove your competence in it. How did that shift change your relationship with it?

The challenge for educators and parents: How do we nurture the passions kids develop naturally WITHOUT turning them into curriculum?

## Guest Cross-Promotion Package

### For Brenna Clarke Gray's Platforms

**Bluesky Post (Copy-Paste Ready):**

Just joined the @OpenEdDaily podcast with @ela to talk about something I see constantly: the moment we turn what kids love into schoolwork, we destroy it.

My eight-year-old became obsessed with mythology during the pandemic—books, podcasts, encyclopedic knowledge. The moment I suggested making it a school project, the magic disappeared.

Nothing kills intrinsic motivation like external standards.

We discussed why information transfer ≠ learning, the measurement problem in education, how boredom fuels lifelong learning, and more.

• Why information transfer ≠ learning  
• The measurement problem in education systems
