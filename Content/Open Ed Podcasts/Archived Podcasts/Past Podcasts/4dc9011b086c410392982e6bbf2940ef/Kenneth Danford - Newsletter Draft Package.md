**SUBJECT**: "Have you considered not going to school?"

**PREVIEW**: A former teacher's first question to struggling students: 'Have you considered not going to school?' How 70% of families found an exit ramp. PLUS: Two paths for families with no alternatives.

Greetings!

Ken Danford had spent six years teaching eighth-grade U.S. history in public school when a colleague handed him _==The Teenage Liberation Handbook.==_ In it, he found case studies of teens who left school and turned out better than fine, and decided quit his job. That was 1996. Since then, he's been running [North Star](https://northstarteens.org/)—a physical community center where teens can legally homeschool, connect with mentors, and rebuild their lives outside of compulsory classrooms. His first question to struggling students isn't "try harder." It's something parents aren't supposed to say out loud.

Let's dive in.

## THE INVITATION

When a kid who's struggling in school comes to Ken Danford, his first question comes as a surprise:

"Have you considered not going to school?"

But he backs this question up with an exit ramp that keeps teens safe and on track: file a homeschooling plan, use North Star as your headquarters, keep a weekly advisory to stay accountable, and rebuild a life around interests, jobs, college classes, or rest.

Over the past 30 years, he's helped hundreds of teens trade hall passes for autonomy while keeping their college and career options open.

When critics ask if teens are ready for that autonomy, Ken flips the question: "Why assume they aren't? That's insulting."

## SCHOOL REFUGEES NEED INFRASTRUCTURE

70% of North Star's teens came directly from school—leaving because of anxiety, bullying, neurodiversity needs, or straight-A culture that was breaking them. They wouldn't have homeschooled without an exit ramp.

Homeschooling used to signal ideology. Now it's one option in a growing ecosystem of learning centers, mentors, and programs that provide structure without rigid requirements.

Ken's [Liberated Learners network](https://liberatedlearners.net/) includes Launchpad (NY), Compass (VA), Lighthouse (NYC), and new centers in Texas, Oregon, and the UK. These are physical buildings with couches, kitchens, and drop-in hours—teen coworking hubs, not virtual programs.

The model is spreading because infrastructure for school refugees didn't exist before. Now it does.

## TWO PATHS FOR FAMILIES WITH NO NORTH STAR

Ken's blunt with parents who say, "We can't pull out—we have no alternative."

His answer comes in two parts:

**Path 1: Stay for the social piece, not the grades.** If school still provides friendships or activities, use it like a community center. Let your child skip assignments that trigger panic. Assume they'll eventually leave, take a GED, and pursue community college or work. That diploma isn't the only ticket forward. Treat the school as a service provider, not a master.

**Path 2: Build a patchwork week.** If staying is untenable, stitch together a life from what you already do after 3 p.m.: music lessons, youth theater, church groups, part-time jobs, volunteering, online classes. Yes, relatives will assume you're ruining your kid. They're wrong. The only barometer that matters is your child's health and curiosity.

In both scenarios, the job is to listen when your teen says, "This is hurting me." Ken's advice: Assume they're right. Celebrate that they're standing up for themselves.

## BONUS BOOK SUGGESTION:

_[The Teenage Liberation Handbook: How to Quit School and Get a Real Life and Education](https://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Liberation-Handbook-School-Education/dp/0962959170)_ by Grace Llewellyn is the book that convinced Ken to quit teaching and start North Star.

Published in 1991, it's been called "required reading" and "a dangerous book" that "contradicts all the conventional wisdom about dropouts."

The dangerous idea? Teenagers can design their own education. Missing algebra at 15 doesn't doom your life.

# Your Teen Can Quit School (and Still Win)

_Preview: Former teacher Ken Danford shows exactly how teens leave school legally. PLUS: learning centers replacing GPA culture._

Greetings!

Ken Danford spent six years teaching eighth grade, cracked _[The Teenage Liberation Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Liberation-Handbook-Without-School/dp/0962959170)_, and resigned to help teens leave school. Thirty years later, his center is busy proving “falling behind” is a myth. This week’s podcast breaks down his playbook. Today’s newsletter gives you the TL;DL (too long; didn’t listen).

Let’s dive in.

**THOUGHT:** School Is Optional, Misery Isn’t Required

**TREND:** Learning Centers Replacing Transcripts

**TOOL:** North Star & the Liberated Learners Network

---

## Learning is Natural, School Is Optional

Ken’s opening line to a miserable student is, “Have you considered not going to school?” No drama, no loopholes. File a homeschooling plan, plug into [North Star](https://northstarteens.org/) (more on that in a minute), meet with an advisor once a week, rebuild the week around interests, jobs, community college—or rest. Three decades of alumni later, he’s still watching teens walk out, catch their breath, and re-engage when learning matters again.

Parents rewatch this part on loop: “There’s no such thing as falling behind. You can learn something today or tomorrow.” The real risk isn’t leaving school; it’s staying in a system that makes your kid sick and calling it resilience.

## Learning Centers Replacing Transcripts

North Star’s hub-and-advisory model now fuels [Liberated Learners](https://liberatedlearners.net/) sites from Launchpad (NY) to Compass (VA) to Lighthouse (NYC). They look more like teen coworking spaces than classrooms: flexible drop-in hours, à la carte classes, community college partnerships, portfolios instead of GPAs.

The shift matches a broader trend. Mastery Transcript Consortium schools, My Tech High, and even public districts piloting learner profiles are moving from seat-time credits to evidence of work—micro-credentials, internship logs, “here’s what I built” videos. Admissions officers aren’t panicking. They’re bored of inflated report cards. Portfolios are a clearer signal.

## North Star & the Liberated Learners Network

- **North Star (MA):** Ken’s flagship center—weekly advisories, 50–60 teens, zero compulsory anything.
- **Liberated Learners:** Directory + support for launching similar hubs.
- **DIY Playbook:** Treat school like a community center if the friendships still matter, or build a patchwork week from youth theater, jobs, volunteering, online classes, sports, and grandparents. Pair it with a weekly check-in so freedom doesn’t feel like free fall.

Ken’s parting shot: if your gut says something is wrong, you’re probably right. Celebrate the squeaky wheel—it’s your kid refusing self-sabotage. School is optional. Learning isn’t.
