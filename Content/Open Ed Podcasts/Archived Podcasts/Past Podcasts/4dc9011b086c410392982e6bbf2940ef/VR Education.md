## **TRANSCRIPT TO INCLUDE**

**Opening Hook:**  
"I have been really interested and focused on AR and VR in education since I came on board at the firm. I had an early conversation with Bill where he was like, 'Michelle, people have been telling me that VR is right around the corner for 30 years. Guess what? It was never around the corner.'"

**Data Revelation:**  
"The data came back and it's like 30% of kids have a headset, 50% have used one, and only 20% have no clue what it is."

**Perfect Storm Prediction:**  
"I think there are several things right now that might very well come together and create the perfect storm of a significant change in the equation. I think the AR, VR piece is fascinating and that could be one. I think ESAs - Educational Savings Accounts and the fact that more and more states are adopting them and more families are utilizing them. And then obviously AI. Because of those three factors, putting a lot of pressure and bringing innovation in a different way to the equation, I think we very well could set us down a wildly different path over the next few years."
