## Blog Post: "7 Things Career Expert Ken Coleman Says Parents Get Wrong (And How to Fix Them)"

_By Isaac Morehouse_

I just sat down with Ken Coleman, the Ramsey Solutions career expert who's helped thousands of people find work they're wired to do. As a parent myself, I was struck by how much of what he shared challenged my own assumptions about preparing kids for success.

Ken's not just another career coach. He's developed a framework around what he calls our "three wires" - talent (what we do best), passion (what we love to do), and mission (the results we care about). His [Get Clear Career Assessment](https://ter.li/krbn8l) helps identify these wires, and it comes with his new book that shows you exactly how to use the results.

Here are the seven biggest mistakes Ken sees parents making - and his surprisingly counterintuitive solutions.

### 1. **We're obsessed with raising "well-rounded" kids**

Ken didn't hold back on this one: "I'm so sick of hearing this. I want a well-rounded kid, not me, not me. I don't want a well-rounded kid."

His analogy hit home: "Nobody goes to Lowe's or Home Depot and walks in and goes, I want a well-rounded sander. I want a well-rounded blade... anything that does really good work and that is efficient has an edge to it."

**What to do instead:** Focus on sharpening your child's natural edges. The assessment Ken created identifies your top talents - those things you naturally do better than others. Instead of forcing kids to be decent at everything, help them become exceptional at their strengths.

### 2. **We spend too much time fixing weaknesses**

This one stung a bit. Ken explained: "I can work my tail off if I'm a three in something on a scale of one to 10. And I bust my butt. I might be a five. I can tell you this. The world doesn't pay for fives. The world pays for nines and tens."

But here's what really got me: "The soul doesn't thrive when it's stuck doing threes, fours and fives. The soul thrives when we're in the eight, nine and 10 area."

Ken practices what he preaches. When his kids bring home a C, he told me: "All I'm looking at is effort... If they did a pretty good job and their effort was there and they just, the best they could do is a C, guess what we do at our house? Nice job. You're never going to do that after school. No one's ever going to pay you to do that kind of stuff."

**What to do instead:** Check for effort, not grades. Accept C's in weak areas while celebrating and developing their natural A's. The assessment helps identify exactly which talents to develop - what Ken calls your "wow factors."

### 3. **We dismiss kids' career dreams as fantasy**

Ken shared a heartbreaking story about a 27-year-old woman who called his show: "When I told my mom and dad that I wanted to work with horses, my dad said to me, you'll never make any money doing that and you'll struggle your whole life."

The woman started crying on air. "I love my dad. He's a good dad. I don't think he meant anything by it, but he crushed my..."

Ken's warning was clear: "If we're not careful, we squash our kid's heart."

He also mentioned research showing that many adults in their 20s and 30s return to work ideas they had at ages 9 or 10.

**What to do instead:** When your 8-year-old mentions a career interest, lean in with curiosity. Ken's assessment includes a section on passions - those activities where two hours feel like 20 minutes. Use it to explore whether their interests align with their natural wiring.

### 4. **We project our own regrets onto our kids**

This question made me say "Oof" out loud during our conversation: "Does my opinion, my belief or my desire for them have anything to do with regrets in my own life?"

Ken didn't let up: "I know it's dark. But I do think you have to have that context because you've got to check yourself and you have to realize how much influence you have on your kid."

I shared my own story about how my mom still thinks I should have learned small engine repair - something she associated with being a "useful man." Even though I'm doing work I love and can afford to pay people to fix my lawnmower, she still brings it up.

**What to do instead:** Before every career conversation, ask yourself Ken's hard question. The assessment helps by giving objective data about your child's actual talents and passions, separate from your hopes for them.

### 5. **We think degrees guarantee success**

"They don't care where you went to school," Ken said bluntly. "They do not care. Nobody cares."

He explained what employers actually want: "They're looking for potential. They're looking for high character... A lot of companies are going, we'll train you. If you've got the talent and the skill, we'll train you and hone you."

**What to do instead:** Focus on building character traits like coachability (can you take instruction and correction?) and adaptability (can you handle change?). These matter far more than the name on a diploma.

### 6. **We protect kids from financial failure**

Ken shared a story about his son coming home broke after freshman year of college: "Guess who's got a real strong work ethic this summer. Him, you know why? Cause he's broke."

His philosophy: "Let them fail. Let them learn how to handle money and fail with money so that when I come in and give a little advice, it's actually applicable and appreciated because they feel pain."

**What to do instead:** Allow safe financial failures while stakes are low. Ken emphasized knowing each child's natural money personality - some are natural savers, others spenders. Guide based on their wiring, not generic advice.

### 7. **We use a one-size-fits-all approach**

Ken's core message centers on this truth: "There are really three wires to every human being... Talent. That's what you're naturally good at doing. You came into this world hardwired with some talent."

His final advice was beautifully simple: "Think back, if you have multiple kids, how you taught each of the individual kids to ride a bike. It was different... However you did that, that's your guide on any subject with any of your kids as they get older."

**What to do instead:** Use tools like Ken's [Get Clear Career Assessment](https://ter.li/krbn8l) to identify each child's unique wiring. The assessment takes just 10-15 minutes and provides a personalized purpose statement that brings together their talents, passions, and mission.
