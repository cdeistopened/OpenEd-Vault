Isaac: "Someone in high school who's like, they're the kid who's really into Fleetwood Mac. And it's like, well, nobody likes Fleetwood Mac, some weird folk band from the seventies. That's just the weird kid. You get to college, that is suddenly the coolest thing ever. You have a unique interest that is not just part of mainstream pop radio that's being fed to you. You develop this identity as somebody who likes something that's different than everyone else."

TK: "What if we took that Fleetwood Mac phenomenon, right? And we unhooked it from this is how the world changes for you when you go from high school to college. And we say, this is how the world has always been. And instead of forcing you to wait until college for you to experience yourself that way, we're gonna facilitate experiences early on in life so that you can see whether it's Fleetwood Mac, Star Wars or physics. You are already cool and you just have to learn how to navigate the world in a way that helps you connect with people in a manner that makes it easier to see."

"That 'weird' interest making your child stand out in middle school?

It could be their superpower in college and beyond.
