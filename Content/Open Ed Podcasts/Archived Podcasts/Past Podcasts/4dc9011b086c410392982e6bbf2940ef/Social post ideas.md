## **POST 5: The "Wrong Question" Post**

**Framework:** "The Wrong/Right Question Post" (Framework #63)

**Caption:**

```Plain


Parents asking: "Is my child on grade level with reading?"

Better question: "Is my child making consistent progress with reading?"

The grade-level obsession misses what matters most: progress.

If your kindergartener isn't reading yet, that's okay!
If your 8-year-old is behind, that's okay too!

What's important is that they're making consistent, measurable progress.

And if they're not? That's when high-dosage tutoring makes all the difference.

## **POST 7: The "What If" Question Post**

**Framework:** "The Curiosity Post" (Framework #25)

**Caption:**

```Plain


What if everything we've been told about tutoring is wrong?

What if one hour, once a week is the LEAST effective way to help struggling readers?

What if your child's frustration isn't a behavior problem, but a reading problem?

What if 25-minute sessions, four times weekly could transform your child's relationship with reading?

And what if this approach was proven to be 20X more effective?

This isn't theoretical. This is high-dosage tutoring, and it's changing everything.

## **POST 10: The Pro Tip Post**

**Framework:** "The 'PRO TIP' Post" (Framework #44)

**Caption:**

```Plain


PRO TIP: Stop making reading a chore.

Instead of forcing 60-minute reading marathons that leave everyone frustrated, try the "high-dosage" approach:

✨ 25 minutes
✨ 4x per week
✨ Consistent schedule
✨ Make it fun enough they want to return

Research shows this approach is 20X more effective than traditional tutoring because it works WITH children's natural attention spans, not against them.

# **LinkedIn Post: The Reading Crisis Solution**

Using Framework #24 (The Study Summary Post) and Framework #63 (The Wrong/Right Question Post) with elements of Framework #35 (The Failure Story Post)

```Plain


The reading crisis no one's talking about (and the 25-minute solution that's changing everything)

📊 ALARMING STATS:
- 66% of American children are behind on reading
- 70% of those children never catch up
- Half of U.S. adults read below a 6th-grade level

But here's what's truly shocking: We've known the solution for years, yet most parents have never heard of it.

The WRONG approach:
Traditional tutoring - 60-minute sessions, once weekly

✅ The RIGHT approach:
High-dosage tutoring - 25-minute sessions, four times weekly

The research is clear: high-dosage tutoring is 20X more effective than traditional approaches. Why?

1️⃣ It works WITH children's attention spans, not against them
2️⃣ It builds momentum through consistent frequency
3️⃣ It keeps sessions short enough to maintain engagement
4️⃣ It creates enthusiasm to continue learning

I recently spoke with Tony Mickelsen, CMO at Savvy Learning (@savvy-education-inc), on the OpenEd podcast about this revolutionary approach.

"What child is going to have fun learning to read for 60 minutes?" Tony asked. "That's tough for me as an adult, let alone for the little kids."

The solution seems obvious in retrospect: shorter, more frequent sessions that match children's natural learning rhythms.

But what's truly revolutionary is that Savvy Learning is bringing this research-backed approach directly to parents. No waiting for school districts to implement it. No bureaucratic delays. Just immediate access to what actually works.

For decades, we've watched reading scores decline while repeating the same ineffective interventions. Isn't it time we tried something different?

If you're a parent concerned about your child's reading progress (or know someone who is), I'd encourage you to check out their free assessment: [link]

🔑 The key insight: What presents as behavior problems is often frustration from reading struggles. Address the reading, and you often solve the behavior.

Have you experienced this connection between reading struggles and other issues? I'd love to hear your stories.
