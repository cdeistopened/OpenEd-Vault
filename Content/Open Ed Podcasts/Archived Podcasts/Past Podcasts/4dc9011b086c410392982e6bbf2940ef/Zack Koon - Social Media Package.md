## PRIMARY CLIP #1 - The Teacher Conversation That Changed Everything

```Plain
[CLIP #1 - DIALOGUE - 00:42 to 01:32]
Zach: "We were trying to figure out whether we wanted to put our kids in public school or private school. And we looked at a lot of the schools in our area and I have some friends who are teachers..."

"...and some of them said that they didn't really enjoy working at the schools that they were at."

Ela: "Why?"

Zach: "Because they felt pressure to push students through subject matter when the students weren't ready to go through. That really kind of bothered me. I didn't want my kids to feel like they had to do something they couldn't do yet or weren't ready to do yet."

"And all of my kids have different personalities and I know their learning styles."
```

From mediating sibling squabbles in close quarters to discovering how this lifestyle has actually strengthened our marriage - this is the unfiltered truth about what happens when there's literally nowhere to hide from family chaos!

The biggest surprise? How this extreme togetherness has forced us to become better at communication and conflict resolution - skills our kids are learning through daily real-world practice.
