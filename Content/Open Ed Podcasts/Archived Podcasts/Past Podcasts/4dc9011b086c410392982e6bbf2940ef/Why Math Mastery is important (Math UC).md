# Math UC is great

Ela Richmond: What is a resource, curriculum, tool, online resource, something like that, that's been incredibly valuable and just something Awesome for your family.

Laura Feller: Um, our math curriculum, Math UC. Uh, math is not my strong suit. It is where I struggled most in school and having the Math UC curriculum, which teaches to mastery. So each level is its own. It's entirely its own thing. So you have addition and then subtraction, then multiplication, then division, fractions, decimals.

It goes step by step in the elementary school years and through part of the middle school years. And then once you start pre algebra, then it takes the more traditional route of pre algebra, algebra, geometry, algebra two, all the way through this curriculum goes through calculus. I will never, I never took calculus.

I've never planned to take calculus, but my youngest son may get to calculus and this [00:01:00] curriculum will help him do that because I certainly won't be able to, but it has video lessons that come with it. Um, I've had to call in before to get like individual personalized help and they answer their phone ready to help.

Um, it's been a wonderful, wonderful curriculum that I just, that I just love.

"Math is not my strong suit. It's where I struggled most in school."

Sound familiar? For many parents, teaching math feels like reliving their own academic nightmares. That's why we were captivated by Laura Feller's experience with Math-U-See in our recent parent interview.

---

"Having the Math-U-See curriculum, which teaches to mastery, has been wonderful," Laura shared. Each concept is taught thoroughly before moving on, with a building-block approach from addition through calculus.

---

What makes Math-U-See stand out for hesitant math parents?

---

- Video lessons that explain concepts clearly
- A step-by-step progression that builds confidence
- Responsive customer support that "answers their phone ready to help"

---

Math-U-See consistently ranks as one of our most popular math programs among OpenEd families for good reason. It transforms even the most math-phobic parents into confident guides.
