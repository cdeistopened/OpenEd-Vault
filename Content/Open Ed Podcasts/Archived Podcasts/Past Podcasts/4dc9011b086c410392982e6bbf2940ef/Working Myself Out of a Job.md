### CLIP 1: "Working Myself Out of a Job" (30-40 seconds)

**First 3 Seconds Hook:** "I basically am working myself out of a job with my kids..."

**Full Clip Transcript:**  
"I basically am working myself out of a job... What I found in the beginning was to teach them habits, to help our home run. When we did laundry, it was an event, but we all did it together. It wasn't me trying to stay up on my husband's and five little kids' laundry. It was a full family event... everybody would hook all their clothes into the kitchen and we'd do a humongous pile. They would learn how to sort right then and there... And I didn't realize that these skills I was teaching them was going to help me to make homeschool feasible long-term."
