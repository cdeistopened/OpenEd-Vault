Super cool to be featured on the @OpenEdHQ podcast. Thanks to Isaac for the chat.

They ask which candidate you'd hire. I was definitely Candidate B haha.

No degree, no fancy internship. Just a lot of cold outreach and a belief that showing what you can do is better than a piece of paper.

Crazy to see it all laid out like this.

If you're young and hungry, go build stuff and show people. It works.

## How I Landed a B2B SaaS Job at 18 (With No Degree)

**(Alternative Hooks - Choose One)**

**Option 1 (The Discovery Hook):**

I got my first full-time tech sales job before I even graduated high school.

I didn't have a degree, an internship, or any connections. All I knew was that the normal way—sending resumes into a black hole—wasn't going to work.

I prospected companies, built a portfolio of proof instead of a resume, and closed the deal without ever submitting an online application.

People keep asking how I did it, so I’m laying out the exact 4 steps I used. Here’s how you can do it too.

### Step 1: Stop Applying, Start Prospecting

The biggest mistake people make is spraying their resume everywhere and praying.

Your resume is going into a black hole. You need to change the game.

I decided to treat my job search exactly like a sales process. The companies were my accounts, the hiring managers were my prospects, and the job was the deal I needed to close.

This mindset shift is everything. It puts you in control.

Instead of asking, “Do I meet the requirements?” I started asking, “What is this company’s problem, and how can I prove I can help solve it?”

I looked at job descriptions not as a list of requirements, but as a list of pain points.

Your job isn't to have the right credentials. It's to be the best solution to their problem.

### Step 2: Build Your Network from Scratch

I knew nobody. So I went where the people I wanted to be like were: LinkedIn.

But just being on LinkedIn isn't enough.

Here's the simple networking play I ran for two months straight:

1. **Find the Top Voices:** I identified the biggest influencers in software sales. The people with 50k, 70k, 100k followers.
2. **Scour the Likes:** I went to their posts and opened up the 'likes' section. This is a goldmine. It's a pre-qualified list of hundreds of people interested in sales.
3. **Max Out Connections:** Every single day, I maxed out my weekly connection requests by adding people from those lists. No fancy note, just a connection request.
4. **Send the Message:** Once they accepted, I sent a simple, non-pushy message. Something like:
    
    _“Hey [Name], saw you’re in the sales world. I’m 18 and trying to break into the industry. How did you get your start?”_
    

That’s it. I wasn’t asking for a job. I was asking for their story.

People want to help you more than you think, especially if they see a young person with ambition. I got on calls with VPs and Directors just by doing this. They gave me advice, told me what they look for, and helped me understand the game.

### Step 3: Create Proof, Not a Resume

A resume lists what you’ve done. A portfolio _shows_ what you can do.

Since I didn't have sales experience, I had to create it.

1. **Document Everything:** I ran a small landscaping business in high school. I treated it like a case study. I wrote down my process for finding clients, pitching them, and keeping them happy. That was my first piece of sales proof.
2. **Build a Prospecting Portfolio:** I picked my #1 target company. I spent a weekend building a full-blown prospecting plan for them. I identified 20 companies in their target market, found the right contacts, wrote out the email sequences I’d use, and even recorded a personalized video explaining my strategy.

I put it all into a presentation. I didn't just _tell_ them I could do the job; I showed them I was already doing it.

### Step 4: Go Straight to the Top

I never submitted a single application through an online portal.

I sent my portfolio directly to the VP of Sales at my target company.

The subject line was simple: “My plan for [Company Name]”

The email was short. I introduced myself, said I was hungry and ready to fail, and attached the portfolio I built for them.

I got a call the next day.

The conversation wasn't about my GPA or where I went to school. It was about the plan I had built. He said, “Dude, we need to hire you.”

### It’s Your Turn

This isn't about some special talent. It’s about being hungry and strategic.

Volume negates luck. The more you do, the luckier you get.

Stop waiting for permission. Go build something, show it to the right people, and ask for the opportunity.

If an 18-year-old with a landscaping business can do it, you can too.

### What do you think?

This is what worked for me. The biggest lesson was that you have to create your own opportunities.

What's one unconventional tactic you've used to land a job or get your foot in the door? Drop it in the comments below. I'm curious to know.

I landed a B2B SaaS job at 18 with no degree or connections.

Here's the 4-step playbook I built from scratch:

**1. Stop Applying, Start Prospecting.**  
I treated companies like sales accounts. The goal wasn't to meet requirements, it was to solve their problems. Changed the whole game.

**2. Network from Scratch.**  
Found top sales voices on LI, then connected with people who liked their posts. Maxed out my requests every week. My message was simple: "How'd you get your start?" People want to help.

**3. Create Proof, Not a Resume.**  
I built a portfolio showing my target company how I'd do the job. I created a full prospecting plan for them before I even spoke to them. Show, don't tell.

**4. Go Straight to the Top.**  
I never used an online application portal. I emailed my portfolio directly to the VP of Sales. Got a call the next day.

Don't wait for permission. Build proof and create your own opportunities.
