Mike: "When we realized we needed tons and tons of tutors, we came up with this crazy plan that we would build it out as a dorm."

Mike: "Imagine like a college dorm. We'd build 14 triples, like, you know, those bedrooms for like three kids with the bunk bed."

Mike: "These 40, 22 year olds will come downstairs and then all they'll do all day is tutor our students. And that was how we built enough capacity for our little school."

# YouTube Description

What if schools are measuring the wrong things? Mike Goldstein built a charter school with 42 tutors living in a dorm above the classrooms, proving that one-on-one attention changes everything—but that's just the beginning of what's broken in education.

Mike founded Match Charter School in Boston in 2000, revolutionizing education with high-dosage tutoring and unconventional approaches that actually work. After scaling his model internationally with Bridge International Academies (serving 1.4 million students across Africa), he's now focused on helping parents understand why so many "average" kids are struggling. His insight: every child needs to discover something they're genuinely good at—not for college applications, but for the confidence that comes from earned excellence.

Every child needs to discover something they're genuinely good at. Not for college applications or report cards—but for the confidence that comes from earned excellence. Sometimes the best education investment isn't another program, it's finding that one thing they can win at.
