🎧 **COLD OPEN — MONTAGE STYLE (30 sec)**

```Plain
[00:00:30] Isaac: "You’re 18. No degree. And you graduated high school with the kind of job most people hope to get after college."
[00:03:00] Kade: "I didn’t even know software sales was a thing… but once I did, I knew I had to get on LinkedIn."
[00:06:00] Kade: "For two months, I just scrolled the likes on top voices’ posts… and connected with everybody."
[00:17:00] Kade: "My post said: I’m 18, just graduated, ready to work, ready to fail… DM me numbers I can call."
[00:20:00] Kade: "Two weeks later, they called back: ‘We’ve gotta hire you right now.’"
```

🎯 **Ends on:**

> “We’ve gotta hire you right now.” [CUT]

This opening quickly sets up the _“Wait… how did that happen?”_ moment, while hinting at the creative, proactive steps Kade took — without revealing the full playbook.

If you want, I can also create a **Single Moment version** that just uses the job offer moment and builds suspense around how he got there. Would you like me to do that?

# Transcript

## **You're Actually Not a Child Prodigy**

**Isaac:** Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I am your host, Isaac Morehouse. Today I have child prodigy, Cade Hinkle, who happens to be my nephew, but that's not why I brought him on. Maybe it's a little of why I brought him on, but he's got a great story. Child prodigy, Cade Hinkle. How are you?

**Kade:** Might be a stretch but I'm doing good how are you?

**Isaac:** So that was the setup just so that I can let you down and crush your ego. You're actually not a child prodigy at all. And that's kind of the point of what I want to talk about is you're 18, you don't have a degree, and yet you graduated high school with a career job ready for you. The kind of job that most people are trying to get after they've gone to college for four years or even a year into their career. But that's not because you have some special genius or something that's unattainable for most people. You just did something that most people don't realize they can do. So sorry to burst your bubble and say you're not actually a child prodigy. You're a sharp guy. But I think it's more about doing some things that are not out of reach. Like you don't have a level of super genius that's utterly unattainable for most people who are reasonably intelligent, reasonably ambitious. For many of the parents listening to this, who worry about what their kids are gonna do and they think that like, maybe if I just send them off to college, that will take care of it. I think your story is a great one to kind of illustrate some of the possibilities that are right there that people don't realize. So is that a fair setup that I build you up and then crush you back down?

**Kade:** That's alright usually I under promise over deliver, but this time I'll have to over promise over deliver.

## **I Have to Get on LinkedIn Now**

**Isaac:** Man. So I wanted to start with, and you can correct me if I'm wrong. I'm like my timeline or where you were in school, but you're homeschooled. And from my understanding, I think you've had a pretty, maybe closer to the unschooling side of the homeschool spectrum. So pretty loose, pretty free, pretty flexible, pretty self-driven education. And probably a year ago. So I guess this would be like your senior year of high school. You did something, you spent a lot of time kind of using that year to probe around mostly on LinkedIn and learn about the software industry. Can you tell me like what prompted that? What made you start to think that way and how you ended up using your time instead of just focusing on like typical academic subjects, getting ready for your career?

**Kade:** Yeah, so about a year ago, I was working by myself in landscaping and you know, it's super hot here in South Carolina. So I was like, well, if I could just do sales all day, that would be ideal. Cause you know, I liked selling to people my services. So then I went and looked online, just like different sales industries. You know, the only ones I'd heard about was like car sales and insurance sales, like the slimy, slimy people, but I don't remember how I actually found software sales, but when I did, was like, okay, I have to get on LinkedIn now and just make connections because that's the only way I'm going to get in. You know, don't have any experience. So then for about like six months, I was just connecting with people on LinkedIn and reaching out. And then one guy was like, Hey, I love what you're doing. I'll give you these two internships that I'm, I'm working with these two companies. So then I got some good experience then. And then as soon as I graduated high school, then I was ready to get a job so I made one post and I got an inbound interview which is crazy in this terrible job market. So yeah.

## **People Want to Help You More Than You Think**

**Isaac:** And you are doing a good job of under selling yourself right now, because that's all very simple and matter of fact. But I kind of got to watch this and see it because at the time I was working in the, people call it B2B SaaS. That's just a fancy way to say it's an industry where it's software companies that are selling software to other software companies who are using that software to help them go sell to some other customer, right? And a lot of people don't even know that that exists as an industry. Like it's kind of crazy when you phrase it that way. There's like a whole industry and it's thriving and it's vibrant. And a lot of names that people have heard of, Oracle or Microsoft or Amazon or lot of these are sort of big giant players at the peak of that. But there is a whole raft, thousands and thousands of companies who have anywhere from 10 to a thousand employees who make various software. I mean, we're using Riverside.fm to record this. That's a software company that somewhere has developers and it has salespeople who are going and trying to find customers who want to pay for Riverside premium. And there's this whole industry and they get to your point. Whenever I meet young people and say, you interested in sales? If they have that personality, they're like, because the only thing they think of is like the used car salesman from the movies, right? And but that you kind of took a minute to say, well, what kind of sales jobs are there? And realized that this particular industry software sales, they pretty much all hang out on LinkedIn. And I like to call it live in market. You kind of have to go where that market is. Okay, if I want a job here, I got to see where all the people who work there, who are they? What are they doing? Where are they hanging out? So I'd love to ask you how you were able without experience or expertise to offer of your own, how do you get other people to invest time in you? I know you're very curious, but when you found someone that's like, this person works in software sales, what are you doing to try to connect with them and to try to get insight or input or advice from them?

**Kade:** First I found the top voice of software sales. This guy has 70,000 followers. For two months I just scrolled through the likes on his post and I connected with everybody on there, maxing out my connection requests for a week. And then once they accepted, I would send them a message, because, hey, how'd you get there? Can you tell me your process? Stuff like that. Any advice? And people loved that because I was 17. I made sure to have that in my bio so I wasn't just another random person reaching out to them. But I mean, other people really like that. So and everybody in sales is super nice. Like everybody in sales want to help each other. You know how it is.

**Isaac:** And that's one of the things that I think a lot of people don't realize, like young people in particular, there is a big difference between being a burden to someone and asking for something in a way that people actually are flattered by. So if you're bugging somebody and like, hi, we've never met, will you go vote for my GoFundMe or something like that, right? That's kind of a burden. That's an ask. People are like, who is this person? Why are they asking me to do favor? If you take a minute to actually learn what somebody's all about and you send them a message and say, hey, it looks like you're really good at sales. I'm just a young person who's new to sales trying to break in. I'd love your advice. That's immediately flattering to people. Like when people flatter me by saying, I think you know a lot. You have a lot of wisdom. Will you give me some? Of course I'm going to. I'm not going to shut up about it. I'm going to be like, well, let me tell you. People love that. It feels good to be asked to sort of mentor. So it's amazing how many people will reply. I remember you telling me one time when I saw you and asked what you were, because I had kind of seen you create a LinkedIn profile and I was like, oh, I wonder what Cade's up to. Because nobody in your family works in this industry. This is something that's not like, it wasn't obvious to me that you would be there. I knew you were doing landscaping. And you told me that all these different people who I had seen on LinkedIn, who were pretty influential in the software sales world, that you were just doing Zoom calls with them, just asking them for input and advice.

## **What Do I Need to Do Now?**

**Isaac:** And I think that's so cool that you just had the courage to say, hey, would you be willing to hop on a call? Can I ask you some questions? Tell me, what was your, how did you go about realizing what are the gaps I need to fill? What questions do I need answered? And how do I go figure it out from people who have those answers?

**Kade:** Let's see, I know I had a set of questions that I really wanted the answer to, that I asked a lot, and I got a lot of bad answers, but I got a lot of good ones. I think one of them was like, I was like, because I had a lot of time until I was actually going to graduate, so it was like February, and I was like asking people like, what do I need to do now to have the best chance to actually get hired so I don't have to waste more time as soon as I graduate? Like stuff like that, and then think one of the other ones was, what can I be like? there any AI tools I can be learning? Just like I used AI a bunch for my interviews. I know my interviewees really liked that.

**Isaac:** And I know you went and found a couple of classes like some HubSpot certification or some other types of courses. Did people recommend those to you or did you just find those on your own?

**Kade:** I found two on my own. One of them is actually on my LinkedIn profile because they don't have a picture. But the one guy, I mean his course is like 50 bucks but he just gave it to me for free. So that one was really good because there was a whole list in it of like the things, the little abbreviations. You know there's so many in tech sales like B2B, SaaS. So that was good to understand the lingo more so when I was actually talking to people I could speak their language.

**Isaac:** That's actually a really underappreciated, you know, like everybody knows if you're going to go visit a new country, you know, get your vocab book or hop on Duolingo for a while, try to learn a few things. When it comes to a career, often one of the highest ROI activities you can do is just learning a handful of the words and phrases and abbreviations that are unique to that industry. Like that can be the difference between sounding like an idiot or actually being an idiot and not. It's like it's not, it's just like with vocab, right? If you learn 50 words of Spanish, you can get around okay and survive there for a couple of weeks and then you can learn more as you go. But if you know zero words, you're totally helpless. And I think it's like that with a lot of careers, like literally just learning the lexicon. That's a really good insight.

## **Get Out of the South Carolina Heat**

**Isaac:** So when you were spending time, were you systematic about it? Did you schedule an hour block each day to go on LinkedIn or to do certain tasks? Or were you just filling it in the gaps in between your landscaping and whatever other studies you might've been doing?

**Kade:** No, I'm not really a big schedule guy. I would usually just do it when I get back home from work. And I'd get like messages throughout the day because I'd send out lot of connections and you know, people would message me too because they see what I was trying to do.

**Isaac:** And this was all motivated by your desire to get out of the South Carolina heat.

**Kade:** Not particularly, but that's part of it.

**Isaac:** Listen, sometimes the most basic motivations are the best. It's funny you mentioned it though that you framed it up that way because there's this pressure a lot of people feel like I have to know like my calling, my true passion, the career that I love. And I think that's really overwhelming. Like most of us won't know that, especially when we're 18. But if you start doing stuff, you can learn pretty quickly things you don't like. And the fact that you're like, hmm, I don't like being outside in the summer all day in South Carolina. So if I could find a way to make as much or more money doing something in air conditioning, and then it forces you to do an assessment of your skills. Well, I do enjoy convincing people to hire me to do their lawn. That part is actually really fun. So maybe if I could just do the selling and then you start asking yourself, what other areas could you sell? Like just the fact that a pain point or a list of something that you don't like and don't want to do anymore. That's often the best starting point to take you somewhere better.

**Kade:** Yeah, I like that you said that. I like that you said that because I tell that to a lot of people. I know what I want to do because I was homeschooled and I had the ability to work on like somebody who's in school their whole life and then they go to college and then they're like 24, then they get to work. Then they get to figure out what they like to do. So like I already know what I want to do and now I'm 18 and doing it.

**Isaac:** Yeah, it's amazing. Just any kind of work experience, it's not like, well, I learned landscaping skills. That doesn't transfer. You learned how to talk to customers. You learned how to figure out pricing and profit margins. You learned how to maintain a good reputation on Nextdoor or whatever it might be. I know because your grandmother would send me little things, nice things that people said about your landscaping. She was very proud. Hi, mom. I know you're listening. But I think that's such a great point that just by doing some things, some kind of work, getting some kind of experience, it helps you stumble into that next thing.

## **I Made One Post and Got an Inbound Interview**

**Isaac:** So what I also love about what you said is, again, this is subtle, but I want to tease it out. When you decided software sales might be something you're interested in, you did actually what a good salesperson does. You found the people first rather than just seeking the knowledge. So a lot of people with kind of a more academic or schooled approach would say, okay, if I want to enter software sales, I got to go like find the books, find the courses, find the research. And yes, you did end up doing some courses and even getting some certifications, but you understood it's like, I need to know who to know. Cause some of those things could be a waste of time or it could be out of date or could be irrelevant. And at end of the day, as an 18 year old, no matter how many books on sales I've read, it's probably not gonna help me get a job if I don't know anybody who can vouch for me. So I like that you went people first and tried to find people, even that you didn't have any previous connection with. You just came onto LinkedIn, you kind of used that to your advantage. Hey, I'm young, I don't know anything. Are you willing to connect with me? And then they get to do you a favor.

**Kade:** Yeah, I wouldn't be here without LinkedIn. As cringy as that sounds to some people, like, I've used that for everything. And now I'm at like 4,700.

**Isaac:** It's a gold mine. I don't think people realize for most kind of white collar jobs, especially if they're around software technology, jobs where people are at a computer a lot, a lot of those people are on LinkedIn all the time and they're using it to learn, to share, to have fun. And like it really is a gold mine. And because it's associated with your work, it tends to be a lot nicer and not have a lot of the toxic like political type commentary that you get on other social media. So even though it has a reputation for being cringy and it kind of is, it can be cheesy and people can be self-promotional and all those things are true. But if you're willing to just say, who can I find? Like it is, it really is a gold mine to find those people in places. Okay, so this leads me to, this is my favorite part of the story, but I want to get that backstory because during your senior year, you're working a lot, you're going in the evenings and throughout the day and spending time on LinkedIn, connecting with people, doing Zoom calls, asking for advice, learning more stuff about sales, and that's what made that one LinkedIn post that you mentioned lead you to getting a job. It's not like anyone just goes and creates a LinkedIn account and says, I'll do one post and someone will offer me a job because you had all these connections. You had kind of this reputation behind the scenes. You had some people who were rooting for you. You had some, knew what you were saying from these conversations. and I think that, that use of time, if somebody asked me, you know, my senior year or any year of my schooling, if I spent an hour a day on LinkedIn doing what you did, I can't think of a single academic subject that would be more valuable use of time than that. Were you doing other more traditional academic stuff or was it pretty much just your landscaping business and your LinkedIn stuff?

**Kade:** Probably not doing any school. I don't want to say that but I was probably not doing any school.

**Isaac:** But that's what's amazing. Like the fact that you say, don't want to say that is really funny because we all have this like inherited guilt. Like that's what we should have been doing. But if you ask people like, what is the point? Why are you doing that? Well, so I can get into a good college. Why do I get into a good college? Well, so I can get a good job. The job you got is the kind of job people hope to get coming out of college. Like you already got it. And I know you're like a smart kid, a curious kid. You read. It's not like you're stupid and not well rounded, but you didn't find more time doing one more lesson of algebra or trigonometry or world history to be the next most valuable thing for you to get where you want to go in life. I think that's great. No need to apologize. Okay. So this LinkedIn post, what was this post? What, what made you decide, okay, now I'm to do a post about trying to get a job. And how did that lead to a job offer? What, did you post?

**Kade:** Let's see... I did reach out to a lot of people like asking not specifically but like is your company hiring something along the lines of that people that I have good connections with and then I was working with this other guy like scheming how to get a job the guy that gave me the two internships and I was like I'm gonna make a post and I like sent him the draft and he was like yeah that looks good looks pretty authentic and then it was basically like hey I'm 18 just graduated high school ready to work I'm hungry ready to fail and I was like DM me some numbers I can call I was like a CTA kind of. And then I think it just got like a hundred likes. And then one of the guys at the company and network, I commented on it. Like one guy had connected with. And then when I was on the call with my manager, like the interview, he was like, yeah, I saw it because one of my colleagues commented on your posts. So it kind of went like full circle.

**Isaac:** That's amazing. What I love about it too is the post itself, not like, you have to brilliantly scientifically craft it, but you've got a couple of things really, really right, especially for a sales job. So first, right out the gate, you lead with what could be perceived as a weakness. Hey, I'm 18. Like basically telling everybody, I don't have any experience. I don't have a college degree. Like this is who I am. This is what could be perceived as a weakness. So I'm gonna lead with that. And then I'm just gonna say, I am willing, I think I remember your post like, I'm willing to grind, I'm willing to do the stuff people don't like to do, I'm willing to put in, and then willing to fail, like not afraid of that, recognize that you're going to fail because you're new at this. And then I love that your ask was not, so please hire me. Your ask was, hey, if you know anyone that's hiring, give me their number and I'll call them. And that's what a good salesperson is not afraid to do, get on the phone and call. And so you're asking your friends, you're not asking them for the favor. You're just asking if they know anybody and all they got to do is give, give your contact info. And I love that because that's so much more, um, inviting. it just conveys that you're not asking anybody to do the heavy lifting for you. You're not even saying, you give me a good recommendation? Will you write me a letter? Will you do an endorsement on LinkedIn? Right. You're just saying, all you gotta do is give me their number. I'll do all the work. And I just felt like that conveyed just the right thing, especially for a sales role. So I'm not surprised because I I've been at companies hiring for sales roles all the time and just that's what you need is that attitude. Everything else can be taught. That attitude of like, I'll go make the call. I'll go learn. I'm not afraid to do it. So I'm not surprised you got an offer. So you go through the interview process. What was that like? Were you just like, my gosh, what am I doing? I've never interviewed for this kind of thing. How did you prepare for it?

**Kade:** No, I was definitely ready because it had been a long time coming. I knew I wanted to do that. So the initial interview was just like a 15 minute like intro call, seeing if we would be right for each other. That was from my manager. And then from that, we had a skills interview with like the head of marketing and then the same guy. And that was where we did like a mock call and I had to write two emails to two good fit companies. And then they liked me. So they gave me a final interview. And in the final interview, the guy was like, yep, you should hear back from us next Friday. And I was like, sounds good. But then the guy gave me a call after he's like, dude, we need to hire you. He was like, the guy that you just had the interview said, interview with said, we got to hire you right now. So it only took about two weeks after I made that post. So it was pretty exciting.

**Isaac:** I love it. It's amazing. I actually went on your LinkedIn profile. It was very funny to do like a history. It's like, you know, a year ago, whatever, like you create a profile and then you like some stuff. You comment on a few things. Maybe you had like one or two posts saying like, I just got my HubSpot sales certification or whatever. And then all of a sudden it's like, Hey guys, I'm looking for a job. And then like two weeks later, so excited to be starting my first job, which I just love it. Like tells the whole story. And it's been fun, too, to see like recently, I saw that you just like blew up on LinkedIn. You've got thousands of followers now because some guy in like the real estate industry who's also last name is Hinkle, but no relation, like made a post about you. It's it's hilarious.

**Kade:** Yeah, we got on a call, we did some scheming. I was like, we can do some funny stuff with this, we have the same last name. So I got like 500 followers from that.

## **Figure Out What You Like to Do**

**Isaac:** That's amazing because LinkedIn, as a salesperson, the more connections you have and the more people that know you there, that's only gonna make your job easier and compound over time. So what advice would you offer if there's some parents or some kids out there who are teens and they're ambitious and hardworking, maybe they're doing a landscaping business or something like that, and they're just kinda like, I don't know what I wanna do to get my career started. I don't feel like it's worth going into debt and going to college because it doesn't really help me know any better. Like, what advice would you give for them trying to trying to get started? Or maybe if you specifically want to keep it to the software world? I don't know, just in general, what are your thoughts?

**Kade:** Well, I can say what worked for me, is number one, I was homeschooled, so I had the ability to work and figure out what I like to do. So if you have the ability to work, even if it's just three months in the summer, like do it, don't just mess around with your buddies. You can do that too, but you can work as well and just try to figure out what you want to do. I know that's hard. That's pretty vague advice, but if you're getting into sales, then get on LinkedIn and connect with people or if your market, whatever you're trying to get into just connect with people because people want to help you more than you think. And if they see a young guy, young girl trying to get into something and they have ambition, I mean, that'll take you far.

**Isaac:** Yeah, it really is. And in that watering holes, I like to call them. Every industry has watering holes, conferences, podcasts, social media groups, whatever, figure out where those are, whatever industry you're trying to get into. Go hang out there. Ask if you can shadow someone. Find a conference, an industry conference, and message the people organizing it say, hey, would you let me get a free ticket? I'll come and help clean up trash or do some stuff. I'm just trying to learn the industry. Don't be afraid to try that kind of stuff. You'd be amazed how many people are willing to bring you into their world and introduce you to it. And the great thing, Kate, is I don't want to set this up like, you've arrived. Like you found the perfect job. You're going to crush it. Your career is set. Like maybe you'll suck at this job. Maybe you'll hate it. Maybe the company will go under. Maybe that's not the point. The point is now you've seen that first hurdle is often the biggest one. I'm getting a job that most people competing for have a degree or a couple of years experience with. And I got it without those things. Now I know I can replicate that. Even if this isn't where my path, it's not where your path ends for sure, but it's not like it's just some perfect progression where you'll just like be promoted through the ranks at a single company. That's not how it works, but you know, you have that adaptability. What you've learned through this process is exactly why I'm never going to be worried about your professional life from here on out. I'm betting on you, not just because you're my nephew. It's a quick thing, it's funny when I was going through the interview with this good company, they didn't even ask me about my diploma, they don't care. But I took an interview with a worse company that's more official because the one I'm in is technically still a startup and they were like, so do you have your diploma? What was your GPA? And I was like, I don't know. I don't know what my GPA is.

**Isaac:** When a homeschooler gets asked that they're like, GPA six, what? I don't know what number a hundred. What's my, what number is this supposed to be? SAT, ACT? Yeah. I never knew what grade I was in as a homeschooler. So I love that. And sometimes that's actually a good filter mechanism. There are companies who, if they're putting you through some formalized bureaucratic HR type process, or they can only think within those boxes, probably isn't the best fit. If you want a two way fit, you know, and that's where I love about a lot of the startups that are earlier stage or have, you know, a hundred or fewer employees. They tend to be a lot more flexible and you tend to learn a lot of those experiences as well. So Kate Hinkle, not child prodigy, but absolutely a hardworking, very intelligent dude.
