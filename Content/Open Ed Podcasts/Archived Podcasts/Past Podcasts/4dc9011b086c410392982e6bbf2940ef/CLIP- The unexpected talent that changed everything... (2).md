**Darrin Fletcher:** [00:00:00] There was one kid who was kind of a goth kid.

He was a dark soul to be sure. He would come to the building almost every day,

I knew right away that this kid was a talented writer.

Just by reading his scripts, I was like, oh, okay. This kid is way ahead of his age, as a writer, he wanted to direct. I kept saying, man, if I were you and I had your skill, I'd start with being a writer. Directing will come, start with being a writer. That's what you're really good at.

He wrote several of the films, that year, and we entered all these films in a local film festival and all these kids just cleaned up at the festival. But it was fun to watch him who's this kind of hunched over short little kid, go down the aisle and pick up his award because he kept winning over and over and over. by the time I think he won three or four or even five, trophies that day, and each time he would go down and get a trophy, he would grow a little, just like,

he was so proud. And so by the time he was done, that kid was like 10 feet tall.

and it changed his life.

"There was one kid who was kind of a goth kid, wore trench coats and dyed his hair black and wore makeup. He was a dark soul to be sure. And he would come to the building almost every day. It was a long drive for them, about 45 minutes just to get to the building.

And I knew right away that this kid was a talented writer. Just by reading his scripts, I was like, 'OK, this kid is way ahead of his age as a writer.' He wanted to direct and I kept saying, 'If I were you and I had your skill, I'd start with being a writer. Directing will come, but start with being a writer. That's what you're really good at.'

And so he wrote several of the films that year and we entered all these films in a local film festival, and all these kids just cleaned up at the festival.

And each time he would go down to get a trophy, he would grow a little. He was so proud. So by the time he was done, that kid was like 10 feet tall.

And it changed his life. And now he sells his scripts for six figures a piece in Hollywood. And he's been produced multiple times."
