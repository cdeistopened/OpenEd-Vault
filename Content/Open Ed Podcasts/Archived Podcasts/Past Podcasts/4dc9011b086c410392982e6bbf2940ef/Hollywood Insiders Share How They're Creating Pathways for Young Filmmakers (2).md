## Slide 1: Meet the Visionaries

Chet Thomas and Darrin Fletcher have impressive Hollywood careers (Dreamworks, Spielberg films, Angel Studios) but their greatest legacy may be "Sneak On The Lot" – an innovative film education program helping students break into the industry.

## Slide 2: Born from Tragedy

After the Columbine shooting in 1999, they wanted to make a difference. "All we knew was how to make movies," says Fletcher. What started as a desire to provide students with positive creative outlets has evolved into a comprehensive 25-year educational movement.

## Slide 3: A Place for Everyone

"Film reaches every type and allows people of every walk of life to have an important part in the filmmaking process." Whether you're analytical, creative, technical, or social – there's a role for you on set. Every classroom subject can find application in filmmaking.

## Slide 4: Learning Through Experience

Their curriculum focuses on hands-on experience with real professionals. Students work alongside industry veterans, building confidence and skills by solving real production challenges. The line between student and professional becomes "blurred" by the end of their workshops.

## Slide 5: The Back Lot Innovation

They've created a digital "Back Lot" – a 3D virtual environment where students can navigate a studio lot, talk to industry professionals, upload their work, and even get cast in real productions. "Our plan is to cast everything we do through the lot."

## Slide 6: From Students to Professionals

Success stories include Broadway actors, TV anchors, equipment rental company owners, and filmmakers working on Spielberg productions. "We've got our eye on students who have been through the system" for upcoming television series.

## Slide 7: The Big Picture

Beyond teaching technical skills, they're fostering positivity in the industry. "Life is too short to create more stress... it's great to have fun while getting it done and lifting others." Their approach proves filmmaking doesn't have to be cutthroat to be successful.
