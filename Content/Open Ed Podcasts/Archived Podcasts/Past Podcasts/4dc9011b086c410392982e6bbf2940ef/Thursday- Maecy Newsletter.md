## **THE HOMESCHOOLING MISNOMER**

"I think homeschooling is a misnomer for us. The amount of time that we're home is maybe three hours for the book work academics. Everything else is out, about, with friends, field trips, co-ops, fun things."

– Maecy Palke

In this week's episode, veteran homeschool mom (and OpenEd support team member extraordinaire) Maecy Palke shares how her family abandoned the "school at home" approach for something far more powerful: education as a lifestyle.

After 13 years homeschooling five children (including four adopted with special needs), Maecy discovered that traditional academics need only a fraction of the day—while the real learning happens everywhere else.

## **THE THREE-HOUR SCHOOL DAY**

Forget the image of kids sitting at the kitchen table for 8 hours. Modern homeschooling looks radically different:

"We'll take off and go ski. We've had skiing passes the last five years. We ski several times a week with friends. They do kayaking, we go see the salmon when they spawn at our lake."

This lifestyle approach transforms education from isolated academics into immersive, real-world learning:

- Science happens while observing salmon spawning
- Physics principles come alive on ski slopes
- History unfolds during travel
    

  

The family even spent six months living in a trailer and traveling across the United States—a form of "roadschooling" where geography isn't just studied, it's experienced.

### 🛠️ THE ESSENTIALS

## **EMOTIONAL WELLBEING FIRST**

For Maecy's adopted children with trauma backgrounds, attempting academics before addressing emotional needs proved futile.

"It's hard to do academics when you've got challenges going on. I really needed to meet those fundamental needs first."

This meant:

- Some days involved simply holding crying children
- Other days featured audiobooks and cooking together
- Traditional subjects waited until emotional stability was established

The results validated her patience: "My oldest adopted student didn't catch up academically for probably three or four years because it just took that amount of time to meet the emotional needs."

Yet once that foundation was secure, academic progress followed naturally.

### 🔦 RESOURCE SPOTLIGHT

## **THE DIPLOMA MYTH DEBUNKED**

When Maecy's oldest daughter applied to work at the Mayo Clinic, a moment of panic struck: they requested a high school diploma, but as a homeschooler, she never received an official one.

The solution was surprisingly simple:

"I printed a homeschool diploma out and I signed it and they accepted that. They don't care if it's accredited or not. They just want a paper to file in their diploma spot."

This revelation challenges the fear many homeschooling parents face about future opportunities. Despite the non-traditional education path:

- One child works at the Mayo Clinic
- Another completed HVAC certification at a technical school
- A third with significant learning disabilities found rewarding work

The key was giving each child ownership of their educational journey: "If the student feels like they have ownership over what they're doing, it makes them just want to soar."
