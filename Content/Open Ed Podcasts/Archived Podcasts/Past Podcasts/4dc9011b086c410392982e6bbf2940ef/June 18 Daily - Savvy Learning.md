### 💡 1 THOUGHT

## **READING IS CONNECTED TO EVERYTHING**

"Reading is connected to everything. It's the foundation of civilization."

Andrea Fife made this observation during our recent podcast about the reading crisis, and it cuts to the heart of why 69% of kids struggling with reading is more than an education problem—it's a civilization problem.

When children can't access the written word, it impacts everything: social confidence, future career options, self-esteem, family relationships.

What presents as behavior problems is often reading frustration in disguise. One parent told Savvy Learning: "The improvement we've made on reading has improved my relationship with my daughter so much."

If you can read, you can learn anything. If you can't, every door begins to close.

### 📊 2 TRENDS

**1. THE MICRO-TUTORING SHIFT**

A new approach to reading intervention is gaining ground: high-dosage tutoring with 25-minute sessions, four times weekly. Early research suggests it's significantly more effective than traditional hour-long sessions.

"What child is going to have fun learning to read for 60 minutes?" Tony Mickelsen from Savvy Learning points out. The method works with children's natural attention spans rather than against them.

**2. READING SCORES CONTINUE DECLINE**

The latest [2024 NAEP data](https://ignite-reading.com/insights/naep-reading-test-results/) shows 69% of 4th graders reading below proficiency levels. This continues a troubling trend that predates COVID, suggesting systemic issues with how we teach reading fundamentals.

### 💡 THOUGHT

## **THE 60-MINUTE MISTAKE**

"What child is going to have fun learning to read for 60 minutes?"

Tony Mickelsen, CMO of Savvy Learning, dropped this simple question that exposes everything wrong with traditional tutoring.

**[Watch Tony explain the 25-minute solution →](embedded clip)**

Here's the uncomfortable truth: 66% of children in the US are behind on reading. 70% of those never catch up. Half of adults read below a sixth-grade level.

We've been treating this crisis with the same failed approach for decades: hour-long tutoring sessions that exhaust children and produce minimal results.

The solution? Do the opposite.

"High-dose tutoring is 20 times more effective than standard tutoring," Mickelsen explains. The secret: 25-minute sessions, four times weekly.

Children stay engaged. Progress accelerates. "The kids at the end of a session with Savvy, they are hyped. They are having so much fun that they want to come back."

We've been forcing marathons when children need sprints.

### 📊 TREND

## **THE READING CRISIS HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT**

A national crisis is unfolding in classrooms and homes across America, yet most parents don't realize how widespread it is.

The statistics paint a sobering picture:

- 66% of American children are behind on reading
- 70% of those children never catch up
- Half of U.S. adults read below a sixth-grade level

This isn't just an educational challenge—it's a societal emergency that affects everything from career prospects to civic engagement.

What's driving this trend? Several factors converge:

**The COVID learning loss:** Remote learning widened existing gaps, with reading skills suffering the most.

**Outdated intervention methods:** Schools still rely on traditional tutoring models proven ineffective decades ago.

**The fourth-grade cliff:** Around grade 4, education shifts from "learning to read" to "reading to learn." Children who haven't mastered basics by then fall further behind each year.

But there's hope. High-dosage tutoring—shorter, more frequent sessions—is showing 20X better results than traditional approaches. Parents are increasingly bypassing institutional gatekeepers to access evidence-based solutions directly.

Two-thirds of children struggle with reading. But it doesn't have to be your child.
