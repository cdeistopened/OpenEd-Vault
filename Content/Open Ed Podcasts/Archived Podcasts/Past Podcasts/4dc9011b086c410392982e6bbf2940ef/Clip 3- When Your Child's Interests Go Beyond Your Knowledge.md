**Isaac (22:42):** "My son said on his own, 'I want to learn how to make mods.' And I was immediately stressed because I want to say yes to my kid. But I don't know how to code."

**Isaac (23:02):** "I bet there's something on Outschool. So I go to Outschool and I'm like, 'Minecraft mod creation classes.'"

**Isaac (23:32):** "He hops on Zoom and there was only one other kid in the class. This great instructor gets on there. He's got his cat walking around on his desk. My son thinks he's great."

**Isaac (23:46):** "After the six weeks, he's like, 'let me show you. I created like this custom block.' And I'm like, good. I don't know how to do that. He already knows more than I do about this."

  

**The Big Picture Insight:Isaac (24:25):** "What I love about it is rather than think of it as like a Lyft or Uber or Marketplace, it's almost like YouTube, if instead of just having a passive consumption of a video, it was like, can I find a person who will walk me through live and I can ask them questions while they're going? That's OutSchool."

**Second Example:Isaac (24:42):** "It's just so cool that there's all these niches. Then my other daughter who wanted to learn hair braiding found someone to do a hair braiding course with her and she went through and got a mannequin head and now she's doing all kinds of different hair braids."

  

**Transition to Teacher Side:Amir (44:40):** "We aim to treat all of our teachers as creative entrepreneurial professionals, which is what teaching is. Unfortunately there's so many roadblocks within the traditional system to teachers acting like that."

**The Vision:Amir (45:16):** "It's truly exciting to think about what could happen if a generation of kids are educated by a generation of creative entrepreneurial teachers who are genuinely passionate about their subjects."

**Powerful Conclusion:Amir (45:27):** "They're given the freedom to teach the way they always wanted to teach. That sounds like the future to me."

Have you ever felt stressed when your child wanted to learn something you knew nothing about? ✋

That was me when my son wanted to learn Minecraft modding. Instead of saying no, I found an @OutSchool class that connected him with the perfect teacher.

Now both my kids are exploring their passions - from coding to hair braiding - with experts who make learning interactive and fun.

What skills do your kids want to learn that aren't taught in traditional schools?

"The joy of modern parenting: when your kid wants to learn something you have zero expertise in...

My son: 'Dad, I want to make Minecraft mods!'  
My daughter: 'Dad, I want to learn hair braiding!'  
Me: _has skills for neither_

@OutSchool connected them with experts who actually love teaching these things."

For Isaac on X

"My kid now teaches ME about coding. When your 7-year-old wants to learn something you have zero expertise in... @amir and @OutSchool to the rescue."  
"That moment when your 7-year-old wants to learn something you have zero expertise in... @amir and @OutSchool to the rescue. My kid now teaches ME about coding."  
"Parents: We don't have to be experts in everything. Sometimes the best thing we can do is connect our kids with people who are. Thanks @OutSchool for making this possible."  
"The look on my son's face after his @OutSchool Minecraft class was all I needed to see. He wasn't just entertained—he was empowered. Hat tip to @amir for building something that lets kids go beyond what their parents know."  
"My parenting hack: When your kid wants to learn something you know nothing about, don't fake it. Find them a real expert. @OutSchool has been a game-changer for our family."  
"The future belongs to kids who can find and learn from the right people. Thanks @amir for creating @OutSchool where my son could learn Minecraft modding when I couldn't teach him."

When your kid wants to learn something you know nothing about... 😅

My son said, 'I want to learn how to make Minecraft mods.' I was immediately stressed because I want to say yes, but I don't know how to code.

Enter @OutSchool: In just 6 weeks, my son went from zero coding knowledge to creating custom blocks—skills I still don't have!

What makes it special? It's not passive learning like YouTube—it's interactive guidance with passionate teachers who answer questions in real-time.

From Minecraft modding to hair braiding, kids are discovering their passions through specialized, small-group classes with instructors who truly care.

As @AmirEducator puts it: 'It's truly exciting to think about what could happen if a generation of kids are educated by creative entrepreneurial teachers who are genuinely passionate about their subjects.'

That sounds like the future to me. ✨

Have your kids discovered unexpected passions through online learning? Share below! 👇

"🔎 WHEN YOUR KID WANTS TO LEARN SOMETHING YOU CAN'T TEACH... 🔎

'My son said, 'I want to learn how to make Minecraft mods.' And I was immediately stressed because I want to say yes to my kid. But I don't know how to code.'

That's how we discovered OutSchool. Within minutes, we found a Minecraft mod creation class with a great instructor (complete with a cat walking across his desk during lessons 😺).

Six weeks later, my son proudly showed me the custom block he created—something I still don't know how to do myself!

What makes this approach special isn't just the content—it's the interactive experience:

'It's almost like YouTube, if instead of just having passive consumption of a video, it was like, can I find a person who will walk me through live and I can ask them questions while they're going?'

The opportunities span every interest imaginable. My daughter found a hair braiding course, got her own mannequin head, and now she's creating all kinds of braids!

But there's something even more powerful happening here—teachers are finally getting to teach with passion and creativity:

'It's truly exciting to think about what could happen if a generation of kids are educated by a generation of creative entrepreneurial teachers who are genuinely passionate about their subjects…  
That sounds like the future to me.'

Has your family discovered any unexpected learning opportunities online? What passions have your children developed that surprised you?
