### Post 1: The "Contrarian Hot Take" (Framework 10)

```Plain
Hot take: The best online schools are stepping BACKWARD technologically.

Stanford Online High School discovered something shocking:
• Asynchronous, self-paced courses had 30% dropout rates
• Live, synchronous classes dropped that to 3%
• Teachers who optimized their jobs to 3 hours/day... quit
• Teachers complaining about live teaching workload... stayed

After 30 years pioneering online education (starting with $45 CD-ROMs in 1991), Ray Ravaglia concluded: Technology was never the point.

"If we had Star Trek transporters to beam kids into a classroom, we'd use those instead of video conferencing."

The future of education isn't about better tech.
It's about better relationships.

Agree or disagree?

### Post 2: The "What No One Tells You" (Framework 15)

```Plain
Here's what no one tells you about online education:

• Even gifted students drop out at 30% rates when learning alone
• Teachers hate their jobs when they become "tools of the machine"
• The first online AP course cost $4,000 for hardware + $3,000 for software + $45 per CD-ROM
• Stanford Online High School's first students weren't choosing between schools—they had NO other options
• AI will replace educational tools, not educational creators

Ray Ravaglia spent 30 years building online schools to learn this truth:
"Education is about relationships. Technology can enable those relationships or destroy them, but it cannot replace them."

Every Silicon Valley startup trying to "disrupt" education fails for the same reason—they're solving the wrong problem.

What uncomfortable truths have you discovered about education?

### Post 3: The "Fire Your School" Post (Framework 43)

[https://share.descript.com/view/XFEXKa5lEgL](https://share.descript.com/view/XFEXKa5lEgL)

```Plain
"Fire Your School."

That's what Stanford Online High School founder Ray Ravaglia tells parents.

"Don't view schools as authorities you owe something to. You're fundamentally their employer. If you're not happy, make demands. And if you don't see changes, go somewhere else."

This isn't libertarian ideology.
It's practical advice from someone who's watched families accept mediocrity for 30 years.

Whether you're considering:
• Homeschooling
• Microschools
• Hybrid learning
• Online education

The principle remains: Parents need to take ownership of their child's educational design.

"If people demand options and alternatives, those options will appear."

Time to stop accepting what doesn't work.

What changes would you demand from your child's school?

### Post 4: The "Behind the Scenes" (Framework 19)

```Plain
Behind the scenes of "revolutionary" online education:

1989: First online AP Calculus course
• $4,000 for CD-ROM hardware
• $3,000 for software license
• $45 per blank disc
• 5 minutes to explain what "online education" even meant

1992: Real-time virtual classrooms
• Students dialed in on modems for shared screens
• Separate phone call for audio
• 8 people max could connect

2005: Stanford Online High School launches
• Everyone said synchronous classes were "backwards"
• Attrition dropped from 30% to 3%
• Teachers stopped quitting

2025: The truth emerges
After 30 years and millions in technology, the conclusion is simple:

"Access without relationships will unravel."

What "overnight success" in education took decades to figure out?

### Post 5: The "Real Conversation Share" (Framework 7)

```Plain
Just interviewed Ray Ravaglia, who founded Stanford Online High School.

Me: "So after 30 years in online education, what's the secret?"

Ray: "There is no secret. We keep trying to solve the wrong problem."

Me: "What do you mean?"

Ray: "We had teachers who optimized their entire job down to 3 hours a day. Perfect efficiency. They built answer libraries, streamlined everything."

Me: "That sounds amazing—"

Ray: "They all quit."

Me: "Wait, what?"

Ray: "When you become a tool of the machine instead of a human in relationship with other humans, you hate your job. Even if it's easier."

This hit different.

How many of us are optimizing ourselves out of what makes our work meaningful?

### Post 6: The "I Was Wrong" Variation (Framework 35)

```Plain
I used to believe self-paced, personalized learning was the future.

Kids could move at their own speed.
Learn what interests them.
No more one-size-fits-all.

Then I learned about Stanford Online High School's data:
• Self-paced courses: 30% dropout rate
• Live, scheduled classes: 3% dropout rate

Even GIFTED students couldn't sustain self-directed online learning.

Ray Ravaglia put it perfectly: "Education is fundamentally about relationships—between students, teachers, and peers. Technology should enable that, not replace it."

We've been so focused on personalization, we forgot about connection.

The future of education isn't AI tutors and adaptive algorithms.
It's human beings showing up for each other.

Even if that means Zoom at 8am.

What education myth did you have to unlearn?

### Post 7: The "Agree or Disagree" (Framework 1)

```Plain
Your school is not an authority—it's your employee.

Agree?

Had this conversation with Ray Ravaglia yesterday (he founded Stanford Online High School).

He said: "Parents need to realize they're the employer. If a school isn't meeting your child's needs, make demands. If they don't change, fire them and find something better."

Coming from someone who's spent 30 years in education, this hit hard.

We treat schools like they're doing us a favor.
We accept mediocrity because "that's just how it is."
We worry about being "that parent."

But here's the thing: If enough parents demanded better options, the market would create them.

Your child's education is too important for politeness.

What would you change if you truly saw yourself as your school's employer?
