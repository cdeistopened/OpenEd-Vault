**Primary Hook (34:27-34:50):**  
"Raising kids isn't just about raising a productive worker. I want them to know that they're more than that. Their childhood is not about preparing them to enter the workforce. Yes, that's a part of it, but from a very early age, letting them know that they have control is really important."

**Extended Context (19:46-20:13):**  
"We do it all together as a family. She's a part of all of that. She was part of renovating this building. I think of school and learning the same way - it's all part of life. That's how our lives always were historically. You learn what you need to learn to do what you need to do to survive, or to get better, or what interests you."

**Evidence/Results (29:30-29:57):**  
"I've seen my sister's unschooled children from birth to now - four of them are out of the house. One ended up with a master's from Johns Hopkins, one's in the military, one joined the Carpenter's Union, and one's managing Chipotle. So like they've all chosen very different paths."

**Text Caption for Social Media:**

"Most schools train kids to be future employees. This mom microschool founder is taking a completely different approach—integrating real business experience, community learning, and self-direction. The results might surprise you."
