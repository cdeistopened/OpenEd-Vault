# Should my child go to college???

**Connor Boyack:** [00:00:00] You have to be intentional about what you're doing so that you know the cost benefit. And often if you're intentional, you can get your degree much faster don't just go through the motions, right?

It's I don't want for parents to be caught in a trap or the conveyor belt. not that any particular route or process is bad. When we open parents' minds and they see the choices, then they can now say, "okay, I'm now gonna be much more intentional about what I'm doing."

### Clip Composition

Combine these segments:

1. From 04:25-05:00: "It's not that any particular route or process is bad, but that you have to be intentional about what you're doing so that you know the cost benefit analysis. And often if you're intentional, you can accelerate through these systems. You can get your degree much faster than like, don't just go through the motions, right?"
2. From 05:06-05:25: ISAAC: "I love that you chose the word intentionality because when we open parents' minds and they see the choices, they can become much more deliberate about what they're doing. What I don't want for parents is to just be caught in a trap or on the conveyor belt, reactive to their environment."

### Instagram Caption

"Don't just go with the default because that's what your parents did with you."

The most important parenting decision isn't which educational path you choose - it's whether you're choosing intentionally at all.

### Twitter/X Caption

"The educational conveyor belt keeps running until someone decides to step off."

@cboyack isn't anti-public school or pro-homeschool. He's anti-autopilot. The key is intentionality in whatever educational path you choose.

### Facebook Caption

"If you choose public school, private school, or homeschool - great. But do it with your eyes open."

Connor Boyack isn't pushing one educational model over another. He's pushing for parents to make intentional choices rather than defaulting to what they experienced.

It's not about bucking tradition. It's about knowing why you're doing what you're doing.
