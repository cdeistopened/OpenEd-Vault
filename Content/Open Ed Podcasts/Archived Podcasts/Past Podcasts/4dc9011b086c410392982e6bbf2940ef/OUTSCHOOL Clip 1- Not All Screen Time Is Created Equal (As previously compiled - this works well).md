Building virtual worlds is completely different from passive watching - it's where kids can safely practice real-world skills they naturally want to learn.The difference is visible: a child after watching YouTube has a different look than one who comes away from creative classes brimming with excitement and ideas.#screentime #parenting #digitallearning #virtualworlds #kidseducation #creativity"

**FOR OUTSCHOOL**  

**Amir (25:33):** "Not all screen time is created equal. Just watching stuff on YouTube is completely different to building a virtual world or learning a tool or building a virtual world with others."

**Amir (25:47):** "The great thing about kids interacting and building virtual worlds is, ultimately they want to build in the real world. But when you're a kid, it's not safe to let kids do real world building..."

**Amir (26:01):** "But in virtual worlds they can practice, and you can start that practice young. And kids instinctively want to learn the powerful tools of adult society."

**Isaac (26:34):** "You can see the difference. If I have a kid who has spent the last hour watching YouTube videos, they have a different look on their face and they need a few minutes to detox or they're a little edgy."

**Isaac (26:47):** "Versus he would come away from those Outschool classes brimming with creativity and excitement. And you could not convince me that was a bad use of his screen time."

  

  

‘Not all screen time is created equal.'  
Watching videos passively is completely different from building virtual worlds, learning new skills, or connecting with teachers and peers in a live class.  
We've seen it countless times—kids who come away from interactive learning experiences 'brimming with creativity and excitement' rather than the glazed-over look that comes from passive consumption.  
Quality matters more than quantity when it comes to digital learning. What positive screen experiences have you noticed with your kids?
