Notes/Contributors: When a child feels frustrated, they often feel forced or trapped. Step back and say, ‘You design your plan. What do you want to learn this week?’ That small shift can reignite their love of learning.

# Ask them, "What do YOU want to learn?"

**Matt:** So, you know, this parent mentioned the oldest fights on everything. Uh, there's a part in our book where we say, [00:00:00] give your child a voice.

So, when a child feels frustrated, oftentimes, not always, it means that they feel like they're being forced into something or trapped or don't have options or don't have a voice. So, step back and, and if I were meeting with that oldest and, and again, depending on their needs and interests, say, you know what, you design your education plan, you tell me what it is you're, you want to learn over the next week or month, and let's see what resources we have to feed that interest.

And not have it be a parent driven education plan, have it be a child driven education, a learner driven experience, and maybe, maybe just couch it in a two week sprint. Those are other things we talk about in the book is.
