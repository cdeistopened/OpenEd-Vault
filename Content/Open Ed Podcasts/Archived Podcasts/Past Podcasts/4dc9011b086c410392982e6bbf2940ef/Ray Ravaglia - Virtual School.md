🍎 Access gets you in; relationships keep you there

🍎 Live cohorts crush attrition and mastery

🍎 A tool that proves you know it (by teaching it)

---

### 💡 Access gets you in. Relationships keep you there.

Tech solved the first problem in education: access. The second problem is why kids (and teachers) stay. Ray Ravaglia’s rule of thumb from the pod: make it accessible with tech, then make it human with relationships—or it unravels. Self‑paced works… until it doesn’t. Cohorts, live discussion, and the “dude, check this out” moment—that’s the glue. Parents: design for both. Use tech to remove age and place limits; use people to make the learning stick.

### 📊 Live > self‑paced (again)

Async looked efficient. Then the data rolled in. Gifted kids in self‑paced courses attrited north of 30%; the same content delivered synchronously dropped attrition to 2–3%. Teachers trimmed async to a 3‑hour‑a‑day job—and quit from boredom. Put them live with students, they complained about the workload… and stayed for years. The pattern is obvious: real‑time cohorts drive completion, belonging, and mastery.

**The Rise Of Intentional Education Is Reshaping The School LandscapeBy[Ray Ravaglia](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rayravaglia/),**  
**Contributor.** Ray Ravaglia covers education, focusing on technology and innovation.**Follow Author**Apr 24, 2025, 07:00am EDTApr 24, 2025, 12:22pm EDT**ShareSaveComment1**The convergence of technology and telecommunication tools is creating the environment for a new type of "intentional education" school to flourish.**getty**  
The landscape of K-12 education is rapidly evolving as new educational models emerge, driven by the convergence of communications technology, educational technology, and artificial intelligence. Virtual classrooms, enabled by platforms like Zoom, connect students across the globe, while adaptive learning systems such as Khan Academy and Lexia deliver lessons tailored to individual paces. Artificial intelligence further enhances this by providing personalized feedback, addressing unique student needs with precision. Together, these innovations seem to have birthed “intentional education,” a student-centered approach prioritizing critical thinking, personal growth, and practical skills over traditional, standardized curricula. Leading this movement are three pioneering schools, all rooted in Austin, Texas: The Socratic Experience, Acton Academy, and Alpha School.  
**The Pioneers Of Intentional Education**  
**The Socratic Experience: Intentional Education Through Socratic Dialogue**  
[The Socratic Experience](https://socraticexperience.com/about/), founded by Michael Strong, is a virtual school serving students in grades 3-12. It centers on Socratic dialogue, where open-ended questioning fosters intellectual autonomy and critical thinking. Students engage in 3–4 hours of daily synchronous classes, including discussions of classic and contemporary texts, writing workshops to hone analytical essays, and adaptive STEM programs like Beast Academy. Afternoons are dedicated to student-led projects, such as coding apps or researching historical contexts, supported by weekly one-on-one coaching. Strong’s philosophy, outlined in “The Habit of Thought,” emphasizes nurturing each student’s “unique genius,” blending classical education with self-directed exploration. Students are given great flexibility, including the opportunity to take university courses while in middle school. For instance, eighth graders have completed Harvard’s CS50 course, showcasing the program’s rigor. Tuition ranges from $12,600 to $14,400 annually, reflecting its personalized approach.  
**Acton Academy: A Global Network of Intentional Education**  
[Acton Academy](https://www.actonacademy.org/), established in 2009 by Jeff and Laura Sandefer, began in Austin and has grown into a network of over 300 microschools worldwide. Built on the “Hero’s Journey” philosophy, Acton inspires students to discover their calling through curiosity and character development. A typical day includes two to three hours of academics using adaptive tools like Khan Academy, followed by Socratic discussions and project-based “quests,” such as launching a mock business. Students in mixed-age studios set personal goals and demonstrate mastery through public exhibitions, not tests. Parents report that their children “love school,” with some fifth graders advancing multiple grade levels in math. Each Acton Academy operates independently, leading to varied experiences as the network has scaled, with some campuses being more highly regarded than others. Tuition at the Austin Westlake campus is $13,200 annually.  
**Alpha School: AI-Powered Intentional Education**  
[Alpha School](https://alpha.school/), co-founded by MacKenzie Price in Austin, leverages AI to redefine learning efficiency. Its “2-Hour Learning” model condenses core subjects—math, reading, writing—into two morning hours using AI-driven platforms like Lexia. This approach, which claims to improve efficiency, leads students to learn up to twice as fast, enabling afternoons to be used for workshops in coding, entrepreneurship, or public speaking. Small class sizes and “Guides” (not traditional teachers) ensure tailored support, with frequent check-ins to align learning with students’ interests. For example, students might design a startup pitch or practice financial literacy. Tuition at the Austin campus is $40,000 annually. Alpha is expanding, with new campuses being planned in cities like Miami and Houston and a virtual campus in Arizona.  
**Austin Is Ground Zero For Intentional Education**  
Remarkably, all three schools trace their origins to Austin, Texas. The Socratic Experience, although virtual, was shaped by Strong’s work in the region; Acton Academy launched its flagship campus there; and Alpha School established its first location in Austin. The city’s entrepreneurial culture and tech ecosystem likely foster such experimentation, positioning Austin as a leader in reimagining education. The newly established University of Austin further substantiates Austin’s status as ground zero for education innovation.MORE FOR YOU**[Student Loans With This Servicer Will Be Transferred Within Months, Says Department Of Education](http://www.forbes.com/sites/adamminsky/2025/08/20/student-loans-with-this-servicer-will-be-transferred-within-months-says-department-of-education/)[Elon Musk’s Self-Driving Tesla Lies Are Finally Catching Up To Him](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2025/08/20/elon-musks-self-driving-tesla-lies-are-finally-catching-up-to-him/)[Target CEO Cornell Steps Down As Sales Continue To Fall](http://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2025/08/20/target-ceo-brian-cornell-will-step-down-as-sales-continue-to-fall/)**  
**The Four Pillars Of Intentional Education**  
Despite their distinct approaches, these schools share four operational principles that define intentional education, with tuition reflecting their high-touch models:**CEO: C-suite news, analysis, and advice for top decision makers right to your inbox.**Email Address**Sign Up**By signing up, you agree to receive this newsletter, other updates about Forbes and its affiliates’ offerings, our [Terms of Service](https://www.forbes.com/terms-and-conditions) (including resolving disputes on an individual basis via arbitration), and you acknowledge our [Privacy Statement](https://www.forbes.com/privacy).

1. **Efficient Class Time**: Each school optimizes the school day to avoid prolonged traditional instruction. The Socratic Experience limits synchronous classes to three to four hours, focusing on high-impact dialogue. Acton Academy allocates two to three hours for academics, leaving room for hands-on quests. Alpha School’s two-hour AI-driven block maximizes efficiency, freeing afternoons for exploration.  
2. **Independent Learning Empowered by Technology**: Students take ownership through self-paced projects, supported by adaptive platforms. All three embrace using adaptive instructional technology to provide self-paced learning opportunities. In each case, technology acts as a scaffold, enabling personalized progress.  
3. **Cultivating Meaningful Interactions**: Rich interactions are central. The Socratic Experience’s seminars spark peer debates over texts like Plato. Acton’s mixed-age studios foster mentorship, with older students guiding younger ones in Socratic discussions. Alpha’s workshops encourage teamwork, such as collaborative startup pitches, while Guides facilitate dialogue, ensuring social and intellectual growth.  
4. **Personalized Mentorship**: One-on-one coaching tailors education to individual needs. The Socratic Experience offers weekly sessions to align projects with goals, like a student writing a novel. Acton Guides monitor progress, though mentoring varies by campus. Alpha’s Guides use AI data for frequent check-ins, helping students refine skills like public speaking.  
**The Future Of Intentional Education**  
The intentional education movement appears poised to expand, as technological advancements and innovative funding models like Educational Savings Accounts make alternative schooling more accessible without the operational drawbacks of charter schools. Alpha School [will launch a virtual charter school](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rayravaglia/2025/02/10/alpha-school-using-ai-to-unleash-students-and-transform-teaching/) in Arizona in Fall 2025 and is exploring private micro-schools in states with ESAs. Efforts to establish physical charter schools have faced resistance, but Alpha’s strategic focus on virtual and micro-school models aims to broaden its reach. Virtual platforms enhance accessibility for schools like The Socratic Experience, while AI and adaptive tech, as seen in Alpha, continue to refine personalization.00:0103:12Read More  
However, scaling poses challenges, particularly regarding quality maintenance. Acton Academy’s growth to over 300 schools showcases the potential for replication but also highlights the pitfalls of decentralized management. While some campuses produce students who launch businesses or leap grade levels, others face criticism for lacking structure, as noted in online discussions. This suggests that robust training and quality control are critical for scaling to occur without diluting impact.  
**Will Intentional Education Become The New Normal?**  
The rise of intentional education, exemplified by The Socratic Experience, Acton Academy, and Alpha School, shows that the moment is finally at hand for the long-standing promise of educational technology to prioritize individual learning. It is not surprising that this is occurring outside the confines of the traditional educational establishment because the technology and instructional models come with a reimagining of roles and structures—something difficult to achieve when positions are defined by district-wide contracts. What is clear is that by prioritizing efficient time use, independent exploration, meaningful connections, and personalized guidance, these schools are demonstrating how significant increases in learning can be achieved within the traditional school-day framework. As technology advances and access grows, new approaches like these will continue to emerge and expand. Whether these types of schools become the norm will ultimately depend on their ability to maintain quality and culture as they scale.[Editorial Standards](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesstaff/article/forbes-editorial-values-and-standards/)[Reprints & Permissions](https://www.parsintl.com/publications/forbes/)Find [Ray Ravaglia](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rayravaglia/) on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rayravaglia/) and [X](https://www.x.com/zzenofon). Visit [Ray's](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rayravaglia/) [website](https://ravaglia.substack.com/). Browse [additional work](https://www.amazon.com/Books-Raymond-Ravaglia).**Follow Author**
