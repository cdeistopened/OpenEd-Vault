[35:08.238-35:34.41] Andrea: "That's what I've been talking to my recent graduate about is how exciting it is to enter adulthood because adulthood is just filled with do-over after do-over. You just get to try anything you want to try. And there are of course some limitations, mostly money. But if you can figure out the money piece, adulthood is just one adventure after another, pursuing any learning that you want to pursue for the rest of your life."

[19:41.681-20:10.913] Rose: "A great example, my son, first job ever, he was in a mail room of this huge company. He was excited because it was a rock climbing company, right? So it was rock climbing and outdoors and he was in that mail room and was miserable. And so I said to him, great, I love it. Now you know what you don't want to do. And that's just as important as knowing what you want to do or what you want to try."

"Why College Might NOT Be The Next Step For Your Teen

'I want students to know you don't have to go to an Ivy League school. You don't have to go somewhere where you're coming out with $100,000, $200,000 of debt because of a college degree.'

In our latest podcast episode, education experts Rose Ybaben and Danielle Randall challenge the societal pressure of the 'high school, college, work' conveyor belt and share why discovering what you DON'T want can be just as valuable as finding what you DO want.

For the social media clip, I still believe the combined clip with the mailroom story would be most effective:

## On-Screen Text Options (Updated)

1. "What if failure is just valuable information?"
2. "The hidden power of knowing what you DON'T want"
3. "Adulthood = endless do-overs"
4. "Permission to get it wrong"
5. "The post-high school myth nobody talks about"
