**Amir (39:23):** "My son goes to an alternative micro school in San Francisco, and he spends also a lot of time on Outschool. He has multiple other memberships."

**Amir (38:54):** "It's an ecosystem. The other kind of verbiage I started to play with is networked schooling and that you're members of multiple networks."

**Isaac (40:22):** "We don't live in a world where our entire existence is contained in one box and one set of networks. We have our friends that we only do sports stuff with. We have our work friends."

**Amir (42:04):** "It's a better structural model for how humans actually are. You have these different parts to yourself, different interests, different identities and they're intersectional."
