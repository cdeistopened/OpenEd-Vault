## Clip 1: "Stop Obsessing Over Learning Gaps"

- **Segments:** 33:20-34:45 (Polished transcript)
- **Hook:** A principal-turned-unschool dad demolishes the fear of "gaps" and proves problem-solving beats perfect curricula.
- **Story Arc:** Fear of gaps → Real-world proof (son’s career) → Core philosophy → Credibility (all kids out-earn him)
- **Edited Transcript:**
    - **Dave Hoffman:** People, especially teachers, would worry. They'd say a homeschooled kid has "gaps" in their learning. ~~But who says algebra has to come before geometry?~~ My son wasn't great at textbook math, but now he does laser-leveled excavation—calculating things that actually matter. If you teach kids to solve problems, you don't have to worry about the textbook learning. ~~Because they'll figure out what they need to learn.~~ I work with grown adults who can't think past, "What do you want me to do on this?" None of my kids have gone to college. They all make more money than I do—and they're happy.

## **Long Form 1: “Why We Threw School Out the Window”**

### Title:

- “Why We Threw School Out the Window”
- “The Difference Between Schooling and Education”
- “How We Unlearned Everything We Knew About Learning”
- “The Most Unschooling Family You’ve Ever Met”

### Description:

In this deeply reflective segment, longtime educator **Dave Hoffman** explains why — despite being a public school teacher and administrator — he and his wife decided to homeschool their six children in the most unconventional way imaginable. What begins as a story about curiosity becomes a powerful meditation on freedom, trust, and the true purpose of education.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

  

**Ela:** From a practical standpoint — you and your wife — how did you tackle this “problem” of helping your kids explore enough to find what they truly loved? Was it conscious? Planned? Or more on a whim?

**Dave:** I told you — we were the most _unschooling_ homeschoolers that ever existed.

If you did it in school, we didn’t do it at home. Anything that _looked_ like school — we threw out the window.

Because schooling is different than education. We define those very differently. And anything that looked like schooling went out the window. Anything that looked like _real learning_ — curiosity, passion, doing — we fostered.

We didn’t have a master plan. Our plan was to encourage our kids to learn new things and not have a fixed mindset. If they said, “I’m bad at this,” we’d say, “You’re just early in the process.”

One of my sons wasn’t great at math — until he found a curriculum that worked for him. It was called _Teaching Textbooks_. Suddenly he said, “Hey, I can do this.” He passed college algebra at 17 — something I couldn’t do at 23.

We tried everything: different math programs, co-ops, teachers. Some worked, some didn’t. We just kept going.

And you know what? My kids loved to read — but we never forced them. All of them learned to read at seven or eight. Their Sunday school teachers used to panic — “Your kid can’t read yet!” — and we’d say, “We’re good.”

Then one day they started reading — and they never stopped.

That’s what happens when you trust the process.

**Ela:** That’s fascinating.

**Dave:** People are terrified of unpredictability. Homeschooling feels risky — because if it doesn’t work, there’s no one else to blame.

But we were never afraid. We saw our kids thrive. We saw other homeschool families whose kids were doing great. And we realized — fear is a bad reason to send your kids to school.

**Ela:** Why were you so comfortable with that uncertainty?

**Dave:** My wife, honestly. She’s like Pippi Longstocking. If she had her way, we’d be living in a tent.

I was the structured one — left-brained, always saying, “We need a plan.” But I learned kids _hate_ being forced. If you let them make decisions and own their learning, they’ll surprise you.

People worry about “gaps.” Teachers say, “This homeschool kid missed algebra!” But who says algebra has to come before geometry? Who decided that sequence?

My son wasn’t great at math — but now he’s doing laser-level excavation work, calculating slopes and grades in the real world. He’s learning what matters.

That’s the point. You teach kids to solve problems — not just to follow instructions.

### Title:

- “Teach Them to Solve Problems — Not Follow Instructions”
- “Why I Want Employees Who Think Like Homeschoolers”
- “What the Classroom Forgot to Teach”
- “How to Raise Creative Problem Solvers”

### Description:

In this energizing and practical exchange, **Dave Hoffman** draws on decades in education and management to expose the real crisis in learning: our inability to solve problems without a script. From his son’s construction career to his own experience leading adults, Hoffman argues that education’s highest goal isn’t memorization — it’s _initiative_.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

  

**Dave:** People always worry, especially teachers — “Oh, this homeschool kid came into my geometry class and they have so many gaps in their algebra learning.”

And I’m like — who says algebra _has_ to come before geometry? Who made that rule?

My son wasn’t great at math, and now he does construction. He specializes in **laser-level excavation** — calculating slope, grade, and elevation to the inch.

You teach kids to solve problems — and you’ve covered half of education right there. You don’t have to worry about textbook gaps.

I manage grown adults now, and I can’t get some of them to think past, _“What do you want me to do on this?”_

And I tell them, “I don’t want you to do it. I want you to _figure it out._ Create a strategy.”

And they freeze. They can’t — because they were never taught how. They were taught to follow instructions.

If I had a boss who said, “Here’s a problem — solve it however you want,” I would thrive. That’s how I think now — innovative, creative, growth-minded.

But most adults? They were trained to check boxes. Not to think.

**Ela:** That’s so true. There’s a book I read about how we optimized work for predictability — we made companies into machines, and now everyone just wants to know their box.

**Dave:** Exactly. And that’s why we’re missing confidence. Nobody wants to take responsibility anymore. They want data to justify their decisions — research firms, reports, permission slips for thinking.

That’s what school trained us to do. Don’t risk, don’t fail, don’t think — just comply.

My kids aren’t like that. They’re confident, creative, and maybe a little reckless — but they _own_ their choices. And that’s the point. You have to let them spiral sometimes. You have to let them fail. That’s how they learn to stand up again.

### Title:

- “In a World Full of No, Be a Plane Full of Yes”
- “Why I Break the Rules (and You Should Too)”
- “How to Change Systems from the Inside”
- “The Secret to Saying Yes in a Bureaucratic World”

### Description:

After decades working in education and administration, **Dave Hoffman** shares the philosophy that guides his leadership: saying yes whenever possible. From breaking rules at BYU to make space for a foster child’s dream, to adopting Southwest’s motto as his own, Hoffman offers a masterclass in creative defiance, compassion, and courageous thinking.

### Transcript (Long Clip)

  

**Dave:** I fight policies all the time. I work for a big institution — BYU — and because it’s big, it’s not very agile. We’ve got fences everywhere.

But yesterday, I gave a 14-year-old a scholarship for a university course. Totally against policy. I don’t care.

It was a foster child — aging out of the system, convinced they weren’t smart enough for college. Their parent came to me desperate. And I thought, if this kid can take one class, just one, and feel confident, maybe they’ll change their life.

So I broke the rule. And it felt right.

I’ve always done that — in public schools, in charter schools, wherever. There’s always a fence, and you have to ask, _“Why is it here?”_

If the reasoning is weak, build a gate.

I flew on Southwest Airlines once and saw this on a napkin:

**“In a world full of no, we’re a plane full of yes.”**

That’s my motto.

When I train my team, I tell them — the customer’s always right. And if you think you’re right, refer to rule number one.

I say yes to almost everyone, in some form. Even if I have to modify it — I’ll find a way to make it work.

That’s how we should approach education, too. Could this kid learn this way? Could we make an exception?

**Ela:** I love that so much.

**Dave:** Right? Be the plane full of yes.

### Platform-Specific Captions

**Instagram Caption:**

```Plain
Everyone obsesses over homeschool "gaps" — missing algebra, skipped geometry, incomplete transcripts.

But Dave Hoffman, a former public school administrator who unschooled all 6 kids, noticed a DIFFERENT gap:

Schools teach kids to follow instructions, not solve problems.

His son wasn't great at textbook math. Today he calculates laser-level excavation for a living.

Meanwhile, Dave manages adults who freeze when asked to strategize. "I can't get some of them to think past, 'What do you want me to do on this?'"

None of his kids went to college. All six out-earn him.

Turns out the gap that matters isn't algebra — it's initiative.

**Facebook Caption (Shorter):**

```Plain
Everyone worries about homeschool gaps.

But this public school administrator who unschooled all 6 kids noticed schools create a BIGGER gap: they teach compliance, not problem-solving.

His son who was "bad at math" now calculates laser-level excavation for a living.

None of his kids went to college. All six out-earn him.

**LinkedIn Caption:**

After decades as a public school teacher and administrator, Dave Hoffman unschooled all 6 of his kids.

His observation? Everyone obsesses over homeschool "gaps"—missing algebra, skipped geometry.

But there's a bigger gap:

Schools train kids to follow instructions, not solve problems.

Today, Dave manages adults at BYU who freeze when asked to create a strategy.

"I can't get some of them to think past, 'What do you want me to do on this?'"

Meanwhile, his son who was "bad at textbook math" now calculates laser-level excavation for construction—real-world problem-solving that actually matters.

None of Dave's kids went to college. All six out-earn him. All are confident, independent problem-solvers.

The gap that matters isn't algebra. It's initiative.

What would education look like if we optimized for problem-solving instead of coverage?

## SEGMENT 2: COMBINING THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS (Tool)

### Primary Format Recommendation

**Text Post with Background Image (Facebook) OR Long-form LinkedIn Post**

This segment is more educational/informational than visual, so it works best as text content.

### Facebook Post

**Format:** Question post with background image

**Copy:**

```Plain
Are you choosing between "all traditional" or "all alternative" education?

Here's what a BYU administrator who unschooled all 6 kids taught me:

You don't have to pick one.

Programs like BYU Independent Study let you take the best that actual educational institutions offer while maintaining the flexibility of open education.

His family tried co-ops, different math programs, tutors. Some worked, some didn't. "We just kept going."

That's the superpower of open education: you're not stuck with what doesn't work.

What mix is working for your family?
```

**Suggested Background Image:** Simple branded graphic or photo of kids learning at home

### LinkedIn Post

**Format:** Value-dense educational post (link to full newsletter in comments)

**Copy:**

```Plain
Working inside a major educational institution, Dave Hoffman still unschooled all 6 of his kids.

The contradiction isn't what you think.

Dave regularly recommends programs like BYU Independent Study to families—one of the most popular curriculum options for open education.

Because here's what he learned:

You're not choosing between "all traditional" or "all alternative."

You're building the mix that works for YOUR family.

His family's approach:
→ Tried multiple math programs until Teaching Textbooks clicked
→ Used co-ops when they made sense
→ Hired tutors for specific subjects
→ Leveraged institutional resources like BYU Independent Study
→ Kept what worked, dropped what didn't

His son went from "I'm bad at math" to passing college algebra at 17—just by finding the right fit.

That's the power of open education:

You're not trapped by what doesn't work. You have permission to experiment. You can combine the rigor of traditional institutions with the flexibility your family needs.

None of Dave's kids went to college. All six out-earn him. All are thriving.

The future of education isn't either/or. It's both/and.

What unexpected combinations are working for your family?
```

### Instagram Post

**Format:** Carousel post (optional - lower priority)

Could create a simple 3-5 slide carousel:

1. "You don't have to choose"
2. "Traditional OR Alternative?"
3. "Why not both?"
4. BYU Independent Study example
5. "Build the mix that works"

## SEGMENT 3: BE A PLANE FULL OF YES (Trend)

### Primary Format Recommendation

**Heavy-Hitting One-Liner + Story (Multiple Formats)**

This segment is the most emotionally resonant and shareable.

### Option 1: Text Over Branded Visual (Instagram/TikTok)

**Text Overlay:** "In a world full of no, be a plane full of yes."

**Caption:**

```Plain
Dave Hoffman works at BYU and fights rigid policies constantly.

Yesterday, he broke the rules to give a 14-year-old foster child a scholarship for a course they weren't technically eligible for.

The kid was aging out of the system, convinced they weren't smart enough for college.

"If this kid can take one class, just one, and feel confident, maybe they'll change their life."

So he ignored the policy.

He learned this from a Southwest Airlines napkin:

"In a world full of no, we're a plane full of yes."

Decades inside Big Education taught him which fences to ignore.

What if every parent approached learning this way?

Default to yes. Question the arbitrary nos. Trust your instinct.

\#homeschool \#parenting \#education \#openeducation \#yesculture
```

### Option 2: Facebook Question Post

**Copy:**

```Plain
"In a world full of no, we're a plane full of yes." [Show the napkin]

A BYU administrator saw this on a Southwest Airlines napkin and made it his life motto.

Yesterday he broke university policy to give a 14-year-old foster child a scholarship they weren't eligible for.

Why? Because one class could change their life.

He's spent decades inside Big Education learning which fences to ignore.

His question: There's always a fence—but why is it here? If the reasoning is weak, build a gate.

What if every parent approached education this way?

What "no" are you questioning right now?
```

### Option 3: LinkedIn Long-Form (Inspirational)

**Copy:**

```Plain
"In a world full of no, we're a plane full of yes."

I saw this on a Southwest Airlines napkin once. It became my motto.

I work at BYU. Big institution, lots of fences.

Yesterday I gave a 14-year-old a scholarship for a university course. Totally against policy.

They're a foster child, aging out of the system, convinced they're not smart enough for college.

I thought: If this kid takes ONE class and feels confident, maybe it changes everything.

So I broke the rule. And it felt right.

I've always done this—in public schools, charter schools, universities. There's always a fence, and you have to ask:

"Why is it here?"

If the reasoning is weak, build a gate.

I unschooled all 6 of my kids the same way. People would say, "You can't do that." And I'd ask, "Why not?"

None of my kids went to college. All six make more money than I do. All are confident, creative problem-solvers.

Because I taught them to question the arbitrary nos.

In education, in work, in life:

Be the plane full of yes.

What fence are you building a gate through today?
```

### Option 4: X (Twitter) Thread
