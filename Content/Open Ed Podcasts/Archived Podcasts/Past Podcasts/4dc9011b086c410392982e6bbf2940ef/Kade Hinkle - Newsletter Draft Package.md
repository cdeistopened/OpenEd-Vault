Let's dive in.

# From the Source

> "Someone who's in school their whole life... they go to college and then they're like 24, then they get to work. Then they get to figure out what they like to do. I already know what I want to do and now I'm 18 and doing it."

# The Inbound Job Offer

Kade Hinkle didn't get his job by submitting a resume. He created the sales industry calls an inbound opportunity.

After months of networking on LinkedIn, he made a single, authentic post: "Hey I'm 18, just graduated high school, ready to work. I'm hungry, ready to fail... DM me some numbers I can call."

That post got seen by a colleague of his future manager. Soon he had an inbound interview request. Two weeks later, after a skills test that involved mock calls and writing sample emails, he had an offer. He didn't ask for permission; he created proof and let the job come to him.

# The College-Bound Playbook

Kade's path is one way to win. For those on the traditional college path, the game is different, but the principle of creating proof is the same.

Our friends at [Prisma wrote the definitive guide for homeschoolers getting into college](https://www.joinprisma.com/blog/how-do-homeschoolers-get-into-college). Here are the key takeaways:

1. **Build a "Spiky" Portfolio:** Colleges are tired of "well-rounded." They want kids with a deep, demonstrated passion in one area. A simple portfolio website showcasing projects is the best way to prove it.
2. **Treat the Transcript as a Story:** You have the power to craft a transcript that tells a unique story, not just a list of courses. Plan it from the start of high school.
3. **Lean into Standardized Tests:** For non-traditional students, the SAT/ACT is a crucial, objective data point that validates your entire application. Don't skip it.

Greetings!

Today we're sharing a story about a real 18-year-old who landed a full-time job in tech sales with no degree and no fancy connections.

He never submitted a resume.

Let's dive in.

**THOUGHT**: The Resume is a Confession

**TREND**: The "Proof-of-Work" Portfolio

**TOOL**: Gamma.app

# The Resume is a Confession

Let's be honest: the resume is a document of surrender. It's a confession that you have no better way to prove your value than a formatted list of places you've been and things you've complied with.

It's a relic from a time when information was scarce and employers had nothing else to go on. Today, it's a joke. Everyone hates writing them, hiring managers hate reading them, and they predict future success about as well as a horoscope.

Kade Hinkle didn't write a resume. He created proof. He understood that the game isn't to _list_ your skills; it's to _demonstrate_ them. Sending a resume signals you're willing to stand in line. Submitting a portfolio of work shows you don't need a line at all.

# The "Proof-of-Work" Portfolio

The quiet revolution happening right now isn't in AI or crypto. It's the shift from credentials to proof. Developers have GitHub. Designers have Behance. And now, everyone else is catching on.

The "proof-of-work" portfolio is simple: it's a collection of tangible evidence that you can do the job. For Kade, that meant building a full prospecting plan for his target company _before_ he even had an interview. He showed them how he would make them money.

This isn't just for kids with no experience. It's for anyone who wants to stop being judged on keywords and start being judged on competence. The trend is clear: the people getting hired aren't the ones with the best resumes, but the ones with the most compelling proof.

# Gamma.app

So, how do you build a portfolio that doesn't look like a messy Google Doc? You could use Canva or Notion, but if you really want to stand out, there's Gamma.

Gamma.app lets you create beautiful, interactive presentations that feel more like a webpage than a slide deck. You can embed videos, GIFs, and even other websites. It's the perfect tool for building a "proof-of-work" portfolio that looks like you hired a design agency.

Imagine sending a hiring manager a single link that opens a polished, professional walkthrough of your 90-day plan. While everyone else is attaching a PDF, you're delivering an experience. It's not a fair fight, and that's the point.
