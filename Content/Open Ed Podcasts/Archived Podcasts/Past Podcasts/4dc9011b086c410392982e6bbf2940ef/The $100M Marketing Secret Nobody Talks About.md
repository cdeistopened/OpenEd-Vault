Basic Summary: Hiring comedians instead of traditional marketers can lead to more effective advertising by earning audience attention through entertainment. The shift from captive to earned attention requires marketers to provide value and engage audiences. Successful campaigns like Squatty Potty and Poo-Pourri demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, which balances storytelling and data-driven insights without letting data dictate creativity.

## Video 1: "Why Entertainers Make Better Marketers Than MBAs"

### Full Script:

**[OPENING - The Hook]**  
"It's really not that hard to train a marketer, but it's really hard to train an entertainer. And so we actually found we would go out and we would hire comedians, you know, improv comedians or standup comedians. People who have, you know, put in a lot of time honing their craft, you know, working on presentation and, and being in front of an audience and all that stuff.

That's hard. Those are hard skills to develop. And then we would bring them in and say, Hey, let us teach you how to market. Because marketing's actually not that hard. You know, you provide value, you present the problem, you show a solution, you build some credibility, you overcome some concerns. You have a call to action. Um, you know, you have an offer. Like that stuff is like, it's almost, you know, it's almost mechanical. It's almost, you know, you're following a recipe, but the entertainment side of it. That is much more nuanced. It's much more difficult to learn.

**[THE SHIFT - Why This Matters Now]**  
Well, if you think back to, you know, go back to the 1990s and before like advertising was typically, you know, these commercial breaks, you know, during TV or between the songs on the radio or whatever. And for the most part, advertisers kind of thought of their audience as captive and it's like, oh, you know, my audience is there, they're not going anywhere.

They're kind of stuck, so I'm just gonna kind of force feed them. Whatever crappy advertising I want to, because they're, you know, they're captive. There's nothing they can do about it. Well, that's not the world we live in today. Right. You know, whether it's a skip button on YouTube or just a scroll right past on Facebook or Instagram or whatever else, you have to earn people's attention.

'Cause you know. They're not captive. They can go right by. And so when you think through that, when you kind of think through the filter of like, I can't just force feed any message or any advertising, I actually have to earn people's attention. And the way that I do that is I have to entertain them.

I have to make them smile. I have to make them laugh. I have to provide value. This is not a take type of relationship. This is a give and a take.

**[PROOF - The Campaigns That Worked]**  
And so, you know, when you look back over our history at Harmon Brothers and kind of the campaigns that we became famous for, right? You've got Poopourri and Squatty Potty and Purple mattresses, and Chatbooks and Lumi deodorant. And, you know, if your, if your listeners are familiar with any of those, kind of the common thread is that they were fun. You know, they put a smile on your face. Yes, they were effective as an ad. They sold a product, they earned money.

They, you know, they did all those things. But that was all after we earned attention and put a smile on people's faces and provided value. And so I think, you know, that's kind of the key as a marketer, you really have to provide value.

**[THE EVOLUTION - Data vs. Story]**  
I remember at Harmon Brothers in our early days, we would always say that we were a data-driven company. You know, we're following the data. But what I discovered is after a few years, data-driven became like the cliche, the industry standard. Everybody says they're data-driven.

And I realized that the data always needs to be balanced with, you know, call it the art, the brand, the story. You need an opposing force that's saying, well, is that message, even though the data says it's more effective, is it who we want to be? Is it the message we want to put out there?

Is it the way we want to be perceived? And so you're balancing it with the art. And so over time we shifted from the term we're data driven to we are data informed, meaning our creative, you know, the story, the brand, the entertainment. It's all informed by data. We're still using data to tell us, oh, this is working.

This isn't working. Uh, this is resonating, this is falling flat. You know, we're still looking at the data, but ultimately we're story driven. We're entertainment driven, and the data helps with that. The data doesn't drive that. So you, you just want to be careful to not put, you know, don't let the proverbial, you know, tail wag the dog.

You, the data is very valuable. It's an essential part of the process, but it can't be the end all, be all."
