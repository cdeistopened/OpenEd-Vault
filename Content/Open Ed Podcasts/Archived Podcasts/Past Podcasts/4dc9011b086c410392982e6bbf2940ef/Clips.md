Clip 1: **The education hack nobody talks about**

📍 📍 📍 📍 if you have a school nearby that you love, enjoy it. Be happy. Most people don't.

If you're some, uh, if you're someplace where a school is meeting half of your need, to them about, my kid wants to come half time. the stuff that isn't meeting your need, like, you know, say your kid's bath science off the charts. let them go to school and do the English and humanities stuff, and then they go online and do the math and science, you know, three years ahead.

  

Clip 2: **What Stanford insider knows about Ivy League**

📍 📍 📍 📍 first question is what's the goal?   I would always tell parents,  look, if your goal is get them into an Ivy Plus institution. Just remember that getting in isn't what's gonna matter at the end of the day.

The kids often times don't want to be there.  If they know what they're interested in or if there's someone who wants to go someplace smaller and more intimate, where the faculty are there to help develop their abilities rather than to do their own research and look at them as grudging taxes on their time.  the parents need to like calm down. And especially too, there's this sense of failure.  Like if your child has been producing phenomenally high SAT scores and then they decide not to go to someplace that demands phenomenally high SAT scores,  you feel you've set yourself up.
