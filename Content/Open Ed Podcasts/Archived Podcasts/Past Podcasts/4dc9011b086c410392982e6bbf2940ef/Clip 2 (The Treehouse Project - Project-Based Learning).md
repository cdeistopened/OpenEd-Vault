"When I was about eight or nine, I came up to my dad and I asked him if he could build me a tree house and his response was, 'Nope. But I can help you build a tree house.' I was kind of a bit confused by that, but I was like, well, whatever. I'm getting a tree house. So he told me that before we could actually start building in a tree, he wanted me to get better at climbing a tree. So we went out, he showed off a little bit of his own climbing skills, and told me some benchmarks that he wanted me to meet before I could be considered 'monkey enough' to build a tree house in a tree."
