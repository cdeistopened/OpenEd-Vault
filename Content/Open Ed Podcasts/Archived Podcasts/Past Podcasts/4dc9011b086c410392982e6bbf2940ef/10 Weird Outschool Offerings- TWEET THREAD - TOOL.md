Traditional school: 'Today we'll continue our worksheet on fractions'  
Outschool: 'Today we'll build a Minecraft roller coaster while learning physics'  
Check out our new blog post featuring 10 of the most unique classes you'll never find in a traditional curriculum - from Cryptozoology to Cosplay Design!  
The education revolution isn't happening in policy meetings. It's happening one curious kid at a time. ✨

I'll continue the Twitter thread and create a Pirate Wires-style article version that incorporates elements from the conversation between Amir and Isaac while focusing primarily on the unique Outschool classes.

## Twitter Thread (Continued)

[Opening Tweet]  
Most schools: "Here's our standard curriculum. Your kid loves unusual topics? Too bad."

@Outschool: "Your child is obsessed with cryptozoology, Minecraft engineering, or wizard cooking? We've got teachers for that."

10 classes for kids with unique interests that traditional schools would never offer: 🧵

[Tweet 1]  
In "Weird History: The Bizarre, the Insane, and the Foolish," kids ages 8-13 learn the eccentric historical events purposely left out of textbooks.

Because let's be honest—the strangest parts of history are the ones kids actually remember.

[Tweet 2]  
There's a class called "The Weirdest Things Animals Do – And Why!" where kids learn that ostriches don't actually hide their heads in the sand (and other myths we've all believed).

Science through weird facts? That's how learning sticks.

[Tweet 3]  
Teens can take "Zombie Apocalypse Survival" classes.

Is it about fictional zombies? Yes.  
Is it also teaching real emergency preparedness skills? Also yes.

Who said practical life skills can't be ridiculously entertaining?

[Tweet 4]  
My own son wanted to learn Minecraft modding. I had zero coding knowledge to help him.

Six weeks of Outschool classes later, he was building custom blocks and teaching ME how the code works.

When your kid's interests go beyond your knowledge, there's someone out there who can help.

[Tweet 5]  
"Pokémon Mammals" is a 4-week science course where kids study actual mammal taxonomy through Pokémon characters.

They compare fictional Pokémon to real mammals and create their own species with scientific classification.

Learning taxonomy has never been less boring.

[Tweet 6]  
In "Circus Socks," kids make poi (those spinning tethered balls) out of—you guessed it—socks.

Then they learn circus-style spinning tricks that build coordination and spatial awareness.

PE class? Arts and crafts? Circus training? Yes to all three.

[Tweet 7]  
"Cryptozoology: Do Mythical Animals Exist?" has kids examining "evidence" of creatures like Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster.

Kids practice critical thinking and media literacy by analyzing supposed evidence, learning to spot fake news through monster hunting.

[Tweet 8]  
Harry Potter fans can take "Cook Like a Wizard" and learn to make Exploding Bon Bons and Pumpkin Pasties in their own kitchen.

Math, chemistry, following instructions, AND they get to eat their homework.

[Tweet 9]  
"Escape from Math Mystery Mountain" turns math into a virtual escape room. Kids solve puzzles to "escape" a mountain.

Because solving for x feels a lot more urgent when you're trapped on a virtual mountain with only math problems as your way out.

[Tweet 10]  
The future of education isn't about choosing between standard school OR homeschool.

It's about finding the perfect combination of learning experiences that match your child's unique interests and needs.

What weird, wonderful class would your child love?

# The Weird and Wonderful World of Outschool: Where Kids Learn Bigfoot Science and Zombie Survival

## How a marketplace for online classes is enabling the quirky education traditional schools could never provide

The traditional education system wasn't built for the weird kid. You know the one—the eight-year-old obsessed with cryptids who can tell you the difference between regional Bigfoot variants, or the teen who'd rather master Minecraft redstone circuitry than memorize the periodic table.

"It's impossible for a single institution school to satisfy all the needs of even one kid, let alone all the needs of all kids," says Amir Nathoo, CEO of Outschool, a marketplace of live online classes for children ages 3 to 18. In a recent conversation with OpenEd CEO Isaac Morehouse, Nathoo described how education is being fundamentally unbundled as parents seek more personalized approaches.

While policy makers debate traditional reforms, a quiet revolution is happening at the edges: families are piecing together custom educational experiences that look nothing like conventional schooling. And what they're choosing is often delightfully bizarre.

## 10 Classes That Make Traditional School Look Boring

A deep dive into Outschool's catalog reveals classes you'd never find in any conventional curriculum—taught by instructors who are genuinely passionate about their niche subjects. These aren't the substitute teachers reluctantly covering material they barely understand. These are the weird experts your quirky kid has been waiting to meet.

### 1. Weird History: The Bizarre, the Insane, and the Foolish

History class usually means memorizing dates and treaties. On Outschool, kids ages 8-13 instead learn about history's strangest episodes and worst decisions—the eccentric tales purposely left out of textbooks. Because let's be honest: no one remembers which king signed which treaty, but everyone remembers the emperor who made his horse a senator.

### 2. The Weirdest Things Animals Do – And Why!

Did you know ostriches don't actually bury their heads in the sand? This zoology class busts animal myths while teaching legitimately disgusting animal facts that elementary schoolers love. It's science by way of "ew, gross!" and that's exactly the point.

### 3. Zombie Apocalypse Survival for Teens

If you want teens to learn emergency preparedness, framing it as zombie survival training is a stroke of genius. This class teaches practical survival skills through the lens of a fictional apocalypse. The zombies may be fake, but the first aid, emergency planning, and resource management skills are very real.

### 4. Minecraft Modding and Redstone Engineering

The Minecraft phenomenon has spawned entire educational ecosystems. When Isaac Morehouse's seven-year-old son wanted to learn how to create Minecraft mods, Morehouse was at a loss. "I don't know how to code, whatever," he recalled. "I go to Outschool and I'm like, 'Minecraft mod creation classes.' He hops on zoom and there was only one other kid in the class."

Six weeks later? "Let me show you. I created like this custom block and this, this, and this," Morehouse's son demonstrated. "And I'm like, good. I don't know how to do that. He already knows more than I do about this."

For teens, there's even an 18-lesson self-paced course on Minecraft Redstone Roller Coaster Engineering, where kids learn circuitry and physics principles while building virtual coasters.

### 5. Pokémon Mammals

In this ingenious four-week science course, kids study actual mammal taxonomy through the lens of Pokémon characters. They compare fictional Pokémon to real mammals and create their own species with scientific classification. It's taxonomy by way of Pikachu, and it works.

### 6. Circus Socks – Make and Play Poi

Kids make their own poi (spinning tethered balls) from socks, then learn circus-style spinning tricks that build coordination and spatial awareness. It's PE class meets arts and crafts meets circus training—a combination no traditional school could offer.

### 7. Cryptozoology: Do Mythical Animals Exist?

This might sound like pure fantasy, but it's actually a masterclass in critical thinking. Kids examine "evidence" of legendary creatures like Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster, learning media literacy and scientific skepticism by analyzing supposed cryptid sightings. They're becoming fact-checkers through monster hunting.

### 8. Cook Like a Wizard! Harry Potter Desserts

Harry Potter fans learn to make magical treats like Exploding Bon Bons and Pumpkin Pasties in their own kitchen. They're measuring, following complex instructions, and practicing kitchen chemistry—all while immersed in a fictional world they love. And yes, they get to eat their homework.

### 9. Escape from Math Mystery Mountain

This ingenious virtual escape room uses math puzzles as the key to freedom. Kids solve math problems to "escape" a mountain, turning abstract equations into urgent challenges with immediate consequences. Suddenly algebra has stakes.

### 10. Cosplay Costume Design and Creation Workshop

For creative teens, this workshop provides guidance on designing and creating cosplay costumes, covering everything from armor crafting to wig styling. It's practical art, engineering, and design all in one—skills traditional schools rarely teach but that can lead to careers in theatrical design, special effects, or fashion.

## The New Learning Ecosystem

What makes these classes work isn't just their quirky subject matter—it's the instructor passion behind them. "It's truly exciting to think about what could happen if a generation of kids are educated by a generation of creative entrepreneurial teachers who are genuinely passionate about their subjects," Nathoo explained.

Rather than force-fitting curious kids into standardized boxes, Outschool enables highly specialized learning. A child in rural Kansas can learn Korean from a native speaker. A teen obsessed with special effects makeup can get tips from a working professional. A kid struggling with traditional math can suddenly excel when it's presented as an escape room.

"Not all screen time is created equal," Nathoo emphasized. "Just watching stuff on YouTube is completely different to building a virtual world or learning a tool." This is why his own six-year-old son takes Minecraft classes on Outschool despite Nathoo's own programming background—some domains of expertise are simply too niche for even tech-savvy parents.

This unbundling of education is part of a larger trend Morehouse calls "open education"—where families mix approaches rather than choosing between traditional school or homeschooling. "Anyone who's doing two or more education approaches at the same time has basically opened the box to varying degrees," he explained.

The most profound shift may be how this approach mirrors actual adult life. "We don't live in a world where our entire existence is contained in one box and one set of networks," Morehouse pointed out. "We have our friends that we only do sports stuff with. We have our friends at church. We have our work friends and our life over there."

Education is finally catching up to this reality. Your weird kid with obscure interests no longer has to hide them or pursue them only after school. Now they can find their people—even if that means joining a class with just one other kid who also wants to debate whether Mothman is real.

That future—weird, wonderful, and uniquely tailored—is already here. No zombies required.
