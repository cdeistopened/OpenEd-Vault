I'll create a newsletter based on the podcast with Laura Feller, formatting it with Thought, Trend, and Tool segments. Here's what I've put together:

## 💡 THOUGHT

### Don't Start With The Chalkboard

  
The first instinct is to recreate what we know.

"I was going to be the teacher and my kids were going to be the students. I was going to have a chalkboard and the whole nine yards," shares Laura Feller in this week's OpenEd podcast.

But that's not what happened.

Laura soon discovered that learning doesn't need a classroom. It happens in the driveway with hopscotch math. In the car with audiobooks. At museums, parks, and everywhere in between.

"Learning became second nature in everything that we did," she explains.

After 8 years of doing open education, Laura says that if you're recreating school at home, you might be missing the forest for the trees.

Hear how Laura went from 'overwhelmed and scared' to confidently guiding three boys through personalized learning (including one who went from struggling with dysgraphia to thriving in college courses).

And check out the full episode to discover the simple observation technique Laura used in her first month that completely changed how she approached her children's education – and how you can use it too.

  

## 📊 TREND

### THE POWER OF "DESCHOOLING"

"De-schooling is necessary for all families," Laura emphasizes.

This growing movement isn't the same as unschooling. Rather, it's a deliberate transition period—a decompression from conventional education—where families:

- Observe how children learn naturally
- Identify peak alertness times
- Discover what sparks genuine interest
- Rebuild family connections
- Explore the community through museums, parks, and field trips

Only after this observation period did Laura slowly integrate educational elements into daily activities.

## ⚒️ TOOL

### MATH-U-SEE: MASTERY-BASED MATH FOR EVERYONE

"Math is not my strong suit," Laura confesses. It's a common fear among parents considering open education—how do you teach subjects you struggled with yourself?

Enter Math-U-See, which breaks concepts into digestible pieces: addition, then subtraction, then multiplication—each fully mastered before moving forward.

What makes mastery-based math different:

- Each concept is its own complete unit
- Students move forward only after demonstrating understanding
- Video lessons support parents who aren't "math people"
- Help desk actually answers when you call (revolutionary, we know!)

The curriculum spans from basic counting through calculus, but here's the key insight: You don't need to master calculus to help your child master addition.

"I never took calculus. I've never planned to take calculus," Laura explains, "but my youngest son may get to calculus, and this curriculum will help him do that because I certainly won't be able to."

The step-by-step approach helps break the "I'm not good at math" cycle for both parents and kids.

## 📚 WORD OF THE DAY

### Dysgraphia

**Dysgraphia** (dis-GRAF-ee-uh), _noun_: A learning disability that affects writing skills, making it difficult to form letters, space words properly, or express thoughts in writing.

Laura's oldest son was diagnosed with dysgraphia, which explained why he could spell words perfectly when taught orally but struggled to write them down. By understanding this condition and adapting their approach, he developed such strong coping skills that by 11th grade, he no longer qualified for the diagnosis.

Sometimes, what looks like a behavioral problem is actually a learning difference waiting to be understood.
