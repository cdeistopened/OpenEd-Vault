Basic Summary: The focus is on building trust between schools and parents, emphasizing that schools should collaborate with parents to tailor education to their children's needs. OpenEd Academy operates on the principle that parents know their children best, allowing them to co-create the learning experience, choose curricula, and have their child's unique learning style recognized. The goal is to foster a partnership based on trust in education.

[CLIP #3 - 34:58 to 35:50]
"It's just this lack of trust, I think, is what it comes down to, is that schools don't typically seem to trust parents. And what does it look like when a school trusts parents to know their child and then works with them to create the education that the parent and child are saying to them that they need, that they want, and that would work best for them? That's really where we want to start. The fact that we will listen and trust and understand the learning that's taking place outside our school. That is a foundation based on trust. The fact that we really want to partner with parents, that is part of our foundation based on trust."

**On-Screen Text for Clip #3:**  
"What if a school actually trusted parents?"

**LinkedIn Post for Clip #3 (Using "The Question" template):**  
QUESTION: If your child's school actually TRUSTED you to be a partner in their education, what would that look like?

For most families, this feels like a hypothetical question. But at OpenEd Academy, we've built our entire model on this foundation:

Parents know their children better than any system or expert.

Our virtual private school operates on a radical premise - what if we designed education by TRUSTING parents and students to co-create the learning experience?

The result? A fully accredited K-12 school where:  
• You help choose the curriculum that works for your child  
• Your child's unique schedule and learning style are honored  
• Real-world learning counts for transcript credit  
• Teachers support rather than dictate

What would you change about your child's education if you were truly trusted as a partner?
