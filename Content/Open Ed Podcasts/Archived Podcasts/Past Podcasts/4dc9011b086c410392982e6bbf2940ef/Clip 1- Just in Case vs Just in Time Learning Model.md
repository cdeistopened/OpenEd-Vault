Basic Summary: Connor Boyack discusses the difference between "just in case" and "just in time" learning models in education. He argues that traditional education focuses on memorizing information that may never be used, while effective learning occurs when individuals seek information as needed, similar to troubleshooting a broken refrigerator. Boyack advocates for an educational approach that prioritizes context and genuine interests over rote memorization, emphasizing the importance of teaching children how to find and apply information in real-time.

### Clip Composition

Keep as one continuous segment from 38:16-39:10 where Connor explains:  
"I think there's two different models of how people learn information. One is how the traditional school system works. I call it the 'just in case' model. Just in case you're going to become a rocket scientist when you're older, you need to memorize the quadratic equation right now. Just in case you become a marine biologist, you need to know that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.

The problem is that's not at all how humans learn. It's not how we as adults learn. The way we all learn, I think, is what I call the 'just in time' model. When your refrigerator breaks down, at no point do you say, 'Gee, I'm so glad that 11 years ago when we bought this thing, I read the instruction manual cover to cover just in case.' Of course not! Just in time for when you need to fix it, you're getting out the instruction manual, pulling up the YouTube video, calling Uncle Bob who's super handy."

Your refrigerator breaks. Do you panic because you didn't read the manual 10 years ago? Or do you find what you need to know right now?

@connorboyack explains why we don't need kids who memorize facts "just in case" - we need kids who can find and apply information "just in time."

The whole education system is built on the wrong model.

"We don't need kids who memorize information 'just in case' they might need it someday."

@cboyack explains how AI changes everything about education, and why teaching kids to assemble resources "just in time" is the better way.

### Facebook Caption

Your refrigerator breaks. Do you:  
  
a) panic because you didn't read the manual 10 years ago, or  
b) pull up YouTube, figure it out, and move on.

That's "just in time" learning - it’s how humans actually acquire information in the real world.

So why do we force kids to memorize facts "just in case" they might need them someday?

@tuttle twins author Connor Boyack explains why the entire education model is backward, and what to do instead.

The refrigerator manual is the perfect metaphor for what's wrong with education.

When it breaks down, you don't think "thank god I read the manual cover-to-cover 11 years ago!" You get on YouTube and figure it out just-in-time.

@connorboyack explains why we cram kids with "just-in-case" information when humans actually learn "just-in-time."

Full episode in bio. This will change how you think about learning.

"When a refrigerator breaks, nobody says 'I'm so glad I read the manual cover-to-cover 11 years ago.'"

@cboyack's brilliant explanation of why traditional education fails: it teaches "just-in-case" when humans learn "just-in-time."

Ever feel like we're teaching kids backward?

"Just in case you become a marine biologist, the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell."

In our latest conversation, @Connor Boyack tells @Isaac Morehouse why traditional education's "just in case" model fundamentally misunderstands human learning.

Instead, he proposes a "just in time" approach - the way we all naturally acquire knowledge when we actually need it.

If your kid is obsessed with Minecraft, there's more educational value there than you realize. Connor explains why context must precede content and how real learning happens when kids follow their genuine interests.

This isn't just theory - his Tuttle Twins books (6M+ sold) and various educational initiatives show that intentional, context-based learning works.

The education system operates on a "just in case" model, but that's not how humans actually learn.

Connor Boyack (@TuttleTwins) dropped this gem in our conversation: "When your refrigerator breaks down, you don't say 'I'm so glad I read the manual cover-to-cover 11 years ago.' You pull up YouTube just in time for what you need."

This disconnect between how schools teach and how people actually learn explains so much about why traditional education often fails kids.

Connor's better approach? Build learning around what kids are genuinely interested in, focus on where to find information rather than memorizing it, and prioritize context over content.
