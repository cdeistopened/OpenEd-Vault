**Amir (24:36):** "I had exactly the same experience. I can program, but I still can't learn Minecraft. It's very complicated unless you invest significant time. I don't know how much money I spent on a Minecraft tutor of all things."

**Amir (25:05):** "He's building worlds in a collaborative way with other kids supervised by a teacher who's helping the kids use Minecraft. He does that every Sunday afternoon and absolutely loves it."

**Amir (25:33):** "Not all screen time is created equal. Just watching stuff on YouTube is completely different to building a virtual world or learning a tool or building a virtual world with others."

**Amir (26:01):** "Kids instinctively want to learn the powerful tools of adult society, and these are playgrounds that can be used for that purpose."
