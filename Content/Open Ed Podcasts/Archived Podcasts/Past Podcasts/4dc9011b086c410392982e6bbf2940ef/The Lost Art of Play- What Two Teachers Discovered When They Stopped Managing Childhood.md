# The Lost Art of Play: What Two Teachers Discovered When They Stopped Managing Childhood

_By Ela Richmond_

---

Ginger still has the Post-it note, yellowing at the edges now. She'd stuck it on Kristin's desk during a particularly brutal week in 2019, back when they were both teaching at a conventional private school in Minnesota. The note read: _**"Kristin, you need to start a school and I'll come work for you."**_

At the time, it felt like wishful thinking—the kind of thing exhausted teachers say to each other during lunch duty while managing 26 kids who'd rather be anywhere else. But three years later, that Post-it note would become the founding document of [SKOLA](https://skolamicroschool.com/): a microschool where children spend three hours outside every day, where there are no letter grades (even in middle school), and where boredom is celebrated as the gateway to discovery.

"COVID was the catalyst," Ginger tells me, "but honestly, we were already burning out." After eighteen years in traditional classrooms, she'd hit a wall.

The kids had changed—they came to school already exhausted from overscheduling, anxious about performance, and more comfortable interacting with screens than with each other. They'd lost something essential: the ability to create their own fun, to resolve their own conflicts, to simply _be_ without adult intervention.

Meanwhile, the system hadn't changed at all. Something had to give.

What Kristin and Ginger discovered—and what a growing body of research confirms—is that the screens aren't the real problem. They're a symptom. The actual crisis runs deeper: we've systematically eliminated the one thing children's developing brains need most. Not more structure. Not better curriculum. Not earlier academics.

Play.

Unstructured, child-directed play. The kind where kids negotiate their own rules, assess their own risks, and solve their own problems. The kind that looks, to anxious modern eyes, like a waste of time.

## Screens Are the Default, Not the Desire

According to the 1000 Hours Outside blog, [American children now spend just 4-7 minutes a day playing outside](https://www.1000hoursoutside.com/blog/children-should-be-outside-for-4-6-hours-everyday)—less time than maximum-security prisoners spend in the yard. They're in front of screens for [over 7 hours daily](https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/nccdphp/dnpao/multimedia/infographics/getmoving.html).

Not surprisingly, there have been consequences for mental health: [anxiety disorders affect 31.9% of adolescents](https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/facts-statistics), and [rates of adolescent depression doubled from 8% in 2009 to 16% in 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8868033/).

Jonathan Haidt, the social psychologist who's been tracking this crisis, argues that this is a direct result of replacing a ["play-based childhood" with a "phone-based childhood."](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/08/kids-smartphones-play-freedom/683742/)

But here's what makes the situation even more tragic: when you actually ask kids what they want, [they don't choose screens](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/08/kids-smartphones-play-freedom/683742/). They choose real, physical, social play with other children.

"Being glued to screens is their DEFAULT not their DESIRE," [says Lenore Skenazy](https://letgrow.org/let-grow-in-the-atlantic-the-surprising-reason-kids-are-glued-to-their-phones/), founder of [Let Grow](http://letgrow.org) and one of the leading voices in the childhood independence movement.

Think about it: How often do you find yourself scrolling when you'd rather be walking, creating, or connecting with others? We fall into screen habits not because we prefer them, but because they're the path of least resistance.

And for kids, it's even worse. Screens are simply filling a void we've created by eliminating real-world freedom. Most children today aren't allowed in public spaces without adult supervision. One in five aren't allowed to play in their own front yard.

If the problem is that we've engineered play out of childhood, the solution is straightforward (even if it's not easy): we need to engineer it back in.

## “You Have the Most Beautiful Dataset”

For decades before Kristin and Ginger's revelation, researchers had been documenting what we were losing.

[Peter Gray](https://www.petergray.org/) has spent his career studying play from an evolutionary and developmental perspective. In the 1950s, he'd grown up in small Minnesota towns like the one where Kristin and Ginger now teach. Back then, kids disappeared after school and parents didn't panic.

His research revealed something profound: play isn't preparation for learning—it _[is](https://www.petergray.org/)_ [learning](https://www.petergray.org/).

"Play is, first and foremost, an expression of freedom," Gray [writes](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freedom-learn/200811/the-value-play-i-the-definition-play-gives-insights). "It is what one wants to do as opposed to what one is obliged to do."

In his research, he's documented that play is **quite literally the job of children**—it's how they're biologically programmed to learn. Hunter-gatherer children, who have unlimited time for self-directed play, develop all the skills they need for adult life without a single worksheet or standardized test. They learn to navigate complex social hierarchies, assess risk, solve problems creatively, and regulate their emotions—all through play.

In 1972—the same year that Gray became a psychology professor at Boston College—a revolutionary study about childhood was beginning on the other side of the world.

[In Dunedin, New Zealand, researchers began following 1,037 babies](https://www.science.org/content/article/two-psychologists-followed-1000-new-zealanders-decades-here-s-what-they-found-about-how) born in a single year, tracking everything about their lives—health, behavior, relationships, finances. By the time these children reached their thirties, the study would produce one of the most important datasets in human development research.

Fifteen years into the study, two scientists would take the helm whose love story began over data. [Terrie Moffitt and Avshalom Caspi met at a conference in 1987](https://www.science.org/content/article/two-psychologists-followed-1000-new-zealanders-decades-here-s-what-they-found-about-how), where Caspi, not typically forward, was captivated by Moffitt's research poster.

"You have the most beautiful data set," he told her. She went to the library afterward to check his citations.

"It was very nerdy," Caspi recalled. "We fell in love over our data."

As the Dunedin children grew into adults, the data began to show something extraordinary: [children who demonstrated strong self-control at age 3](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1010076108)—measured by their ability to delay gratification, persist through challenges, and regulate their emotions—were more likely to have better physical health, higher incomes, and fewer criminal convictions three decades later. The effect was so strong it held true even when controlling for social class and IQ.

Here's the crucial connection: [These self-control skills](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3041102/) aren't developed through worksheets or direct instruction. They're developed through play. When children wait their turn in a game, negotiate rules with peers, persist in building a fort despite setbacks, or manage disappointment when they lose—they're building the exact capacities the Dunedin Study found predict life success.

In other words, the ability to navigate the complex social world of childhood play at age three predicts your salary at thirty-three better than your parents' income or your intelligence.

## The Four Pillars of Childhood

After opening SKOLA with their three guiding principles—more time outside, meeting students where they are, and building genuine community—Kristin and Ginger had to figure out what "more time outside" actually meant in practice.

Kristin made a decision that would have seemed insane in her previous teaching life: she stopped teaching during outdoor time and started observing instead.

"I noticed pockets of kids, all 100% engaged," she recalls. "But they were doing completely different things."

After months of observation, she identified four distinct categories that emerged naturally when children were left to their own devices:

**1. Imagination Play:** The elaborate games where walnuts become currency in elaborate economic systems, and where stories from morning read-alouds transform into afternoon epics. This is where creativity and narrative thinking develop, where children learn to hold complex scenarios in their heads and negotiate shared fictional worlds.

**2. Competitive Structured Games:** The games with rules, winners, and losers. Hide-and-seek, football, elaborate variations of tag that would make a game designer weep with envy. Here, children learn to handle disappointment, follow agreed-upon structures, and experience the sweet tension between competition and friendship.

**3. Civil Engineering:** "One time," Kristin laughs, "they gathered every dead branch in the entire woods. I had to call the city office like, 'I don't know if you wanted this project done, but we gathered all the dead sticks for you.'" This is applied physics, resource management, and project planning. It's also where children learn that their actions can literally reshape the world around them.

**4. Social Hangout:** Just talking. Telling jokes. Being together without agenda. In our productivity-obsessed culture, this might seem like wasted time. But this is where children learn the subtle art of human connection—reading social cues, understanding humor, building the foundations of friendship.

"We'll stand back-to-back during outdoor time," Ginger explains, "and we can name every kid and what's happening with them. 'I'm concerned about anxiety with this one,' or 'These two have been in conflict all week.' This is what we dreamed about in teacher meetings but never had time for."

## The Microschool Revolution

What Kristin and Ginger discovered through observation, a growing movement of educators across the country is putting into practice. Microschools—small learning communities of 5-15 students—are proliferating precisely because they have the flexibility to break the mold of what we think school has to be.

Kerry McDonald, author of _[Joyful Learning](https://www.notion.so/The-Lost-Art-of-Play-What-Two-Teachers-Discovered-When-They-Stopped-Managing-Childhood-253afe52ef5980e3b1cdf94ab92bf096?pvs=21)_ and a leading voice in the educational freedom movement, points to research by Harvard education professor Todd Rose that reveals a crucial insight: "Americans don't want 'better'; they want different," Rose found. "They want a way out of the one-size-fits-all approach driven by standardized testing models and elite institutions making us compete in a zero-sum game and instead an educational framework geared towards individualized learning, practical skills, and preparation for a meaningful life."

Unlike traditional schools bound by state regulations requiring specific hours of "seat time," standardized curricula, and rigid schedules, microschools can prioritize what actually works for children. They can spend three hours outside. They can let kids work at their own pace. They can treat play not as a reward for finishing work, but as the work itself.

While Kristin and Ginger were transforming education in Minnesota, Kelly Smith, a software entrepreneur with no formal education training, was discovering the same truths in Arizona. He'd started teaching kids to code at his local library and noticed something remarkable: when children had ownership over their learning, magic happened.

Smith [recalls the exact moment he decided to start a school](https://substack.com/home/post/p-156614559?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web), standing on a sidewalk in a cul-de-sac next to his gold Toyota Avalon. His friend Andy—a calm, logical computer scientist with a math PhD—tried to warn him off the idea. "Starting a school is crazy," Andy told him. Coming from someone who was never wrong about anything, it should have been enough to stop him. But it was already too late. On January 3, 2018, Smith sat at his kitchen table with his son and six neighborhood children, launching what would become [Prenda](https://www.prenda.com/), now the largest network of microschools in the country.

The results speak for themselves. According to [New Hampshire Department of Education data on Prenda microschools](https://www.americafirstpolicy.com/issues/state-policy-actions-to-support-microschools-another-option-for-families), 54% of struggling students showed at least one full grade level of growth in English language arts, and 62% showed similar growth in mathematics.

What makes Prenda's approach work? The same principle Kristin and Ginger discovered: when you give children real freedom and autonomy, when you trust them with unstructured time, they become more focused and productive during structured learning. Play doesn't steal time from learning; it creates the conditions that make deep learning possible.

## The Undoing

For children who transfer from traditional schools to places like SKOLA or Prenda's microschools, there's a process Kristin calls "the undoing."

"We heard this quote: 'For however many years you're in a system, it's going to take that many months to actually shed everything off before you can rebuild,'" she explains. "I was coming out with 18 years of teaching, so I needed to give myself 18 months."

The same is true for students. Those who've spent years being told when to speak, when to move, when to use the bathroom, don't immediately know what to do with freedom. They look for permission. They wait for instructions. They ask, "Is this right?" about things that have no right answer.

But then something shifts: "They learn that intrinsic motivation," Ginger notes. "It's not about them making me proud; it's about them feeling accomplished for the work they've done."

This shift—from external validation to internal satisfaction—is exactly what the research shows is necessary for lifelong success and wellbeing. And it can't be taught directly. It has to be discovered through experience, through the freedom to make choices, take risks, and own the consequences.

The objections are predictable and understandable:

"But what about academic rigor?"  
"How will they handle structure later?"  
"Won't they fall behind?"  
"What about college?"

Children in play-rich, self-directed learning environments don't sacrifice academics—Gray's [research](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter-Gray-11) shows they often outperform their traditionally-schooled peers while developing superior executive function, creativity, and mental health. They develop intrinsic motivation—the desire to learn for learning's sake, not for grades or approval—which predicts lifelong success far better than any test score.

"You can get a lot done in a couple hours a day," Smith notes, referring to the focused academic work that happens when children have had adequate time for play and self-direction. His microschools dedicate just two hours to "Conquer mode"—focused math and reading work—yet students consistently show dramatic academic growth.

Of course, shifting to a play-based approach isn't as simple as opening the door and letting kids run outside. There are systemic barriers—zoning laws that prevent microschools, state regulations requiring specific hours of "seat time," and funding structures that penalize alternatives.

And there's cultural programming to overcome.

"If I took my kids outside for an extra recess, I felt like I'd be judged," Ginger remembers of her days as a conventional teacher. "Like my kids are not working enough."

But perhaps the biggest barrier is our own discomfort with uncertainty. When children play freely, we can't guarantee specific outcomes. We can't check boxes on a standardized curriculum map. We have to trust the process—and trust children themselves.

## Engineering Play Back Into Childhood

For families wanting to reclaim play, Ginger offers practical wisdom: "If you typically get outside 10 minutes a day, make a goal of 20 and build from there."

Here's a progression that works:

**Weeks 1-2:** Add 15 minutes of outdoor time after lunch. No screens available as an alternative. Expect complaints.

**Weeks 3-4:** Introduce one "boredom period" of 20 minutes. Have materials available (sticks, rope, cardboard) but offer no suggestions.

**Weeks 5-6:** Extend to 30-minute unstructured blocks. Watch for the shift—usually around day 10—when children stop asking "What should I do?" and start creating.

**Weeks 7-8:** Multiple daily play periods totaling 60+ minutes. By now, children are often reluctant to come inside.

"I've gotten comfortable with my son saying, 'I'm bored,'" Ginger says. "Actually, that's okay. The best stuff comes from boredom. It takes about five, ten minutes, and then he has his Legos out, or he's on his bike, or taking his fishing pole to the lake."

You don't need to start a microschool or completely upend your life.

Find another family—just one—who's willing to let their kids play unsupervised for an hour a week. Then two hours. Then an afternoon.

Notice which of Kristin's four types of play your child gravitates toward. Which ones do they avoid? What might that tell you about what they need?

Most importantly, start seeing play not as a break from learning but as learning itself. As Peter Gray puts it: "Play is the work of children."

## Where Learning Happens

"Several times a week," Kristin says, "there are 32 different things going on in this room, and we just stare at each other and go fill up our coffee. We bask in it, because this is the teacher's dream."

Two veteran teachers, with decades of experience between them, saying that their highest professional achievement is creating conditions where children don't need them.

As I write this, there are approximately 100,000 public elementary and secondary schools in the United States. There are perhaps [a few thousand microschools](https://microschoolingcenter.org/). The revolution is still tiny.

But revolutions don't start with everyone changing at once. They start with someone, somewhere, deciding to try something different.

Ginger still has that Post-it note. She had it laminated.

The front door is right there. All we need to do is open it.

[The Lost Art of Play: What Two Teachers Discovered When They Stopped Managing Childhood](https://www.notion.so/The-Lost-Art-of-Play-What-Two-Teachers-Discovered-When-They-Stopped-Managing-Childhood-253afe52ef5980e3b1cdf94ab92bf096?pvs=21)

Play is fundamental to childhood development and learning, serving as much more than just entertainment or downtime.

**### Why Play Matters for Development**

- **Natural learning environment:** Children develop critical thinking, social skills, physical coordination, and learn real consequences through play without external pressure.[[Peggy Lowe]]
- **Brain development:** Research shows unstructured play helps children retain learning, builds focus, increases brain size, and develops language skills.[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Charts-and-Graphics-11cafe52ef5980de9102cd5e1cf869cc?pvs=21)
- **Stress reduction:** Play creates an environment of ease and joy that reduces stress levels, especially important for children who are often overstimulated.[[3]](https://www.notion.so/Teaching-Through-Play-Autism-Treatment-Center-of-America-Blog-41e61306f8504ebfb7d800b1bba999df?pvs=21)
- **Social connection:** Play deepens children's ability to engage with others and shows them the joys of human connection.[[3]](https://www.notion.so/Teaching-Through-Play-Autism-Treatment-Center-of-America-Blog-41e61306f8504ebfb7d800b1bba999df?pvs=21)

**### The Current Crisis**

Many children today are over-scheduled and lack sufficient free play time.[[4]](https://www.notion.so/HOW-CAN-I-HELP-MY-ANXIOUS-CHILD-2229a1bee9594d34945a104fc367e6a4?pvs=21) Traditional education systems often restrict movement and play, using recess as a reward rather than recognizing it as essential for learning.[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Charts-and-Graphics-11cafe52ef5980de9102cd5e1cf869cc?pvs=21) This has contributed to rising anxiety rates, with nearly a third of adolescents suffering from anxiety disorders.[[5]](https://www.notion.so/HOW-CAN-I-HELP-MY-ANXIOUS-CHILD-2229a1bee9594d34945a104fc367e6a4?pvs=21)

**### The Learning Connection**

Contrary to the belief that "playing isn't learning," play actually facilitates natural skill development.[[Peggy Lowe]] Children learn better when they don't realize they're learning - through natural problem-solving, spontaneous creativity, and pure joy in discovery.[[6]](https://www.notion.so/Let-Kids-Be-Kids-The-Importance-of-Play-in-Childhood-Development-14cafe52ef598033bc1df00c47337b14?pvs=21) The tragedy isn't that children play too much, but that we stop them too soon.[[Peggy Lowe]]

The key is giving children time for unstructured play without adult control, allowing their brains to reset and their natural curiosity to flourish.[[2]](https://www.notion.so/Charts-and-Graphics-11cafe52ef5980de9102cd5e1cf869cc?pvs=21)

    # The Importance of Play
    
    Play is a fundamental aspect of human development and well-being, recognized across disciplines such as psychology, education, neuroscience, and evolutionary biology. Far from being a frivolous or merely recreational activity, play is essential for cognitive, social, emotional, and physical growth throughout life. This report synthesizes current research on the importance of play, its developmental and educational benefits, the consequences of play deprivation, its evolutionary roots, and its role across cultures and the lifespan.
    
    ## 1. Play and Child Development
    
    ### Cognitive Benefits
    
    Play is a primary context for cognitive development in children. Through activities such as puzzles, building blocks, and imaginative play, children develop problem-solving skills, creativity, memory, and reasoning abilities. Play stimulates curiosity and experimentation, fostering executive functions like decision-making and self-regulation. Neurobiological research shows that play enhances neuroplasticity—the brain's ability to form and reorganize synaptic connections—by stimulating the release of neurochemicals such as dopamine and endorphins, which promote learning and well-being[[1]](https://ipaengland.org/blog/the-science-of-play-how-play-impacts-brain-development)[[2]](https://www.theplaytherapycenter.com/post/the-neurobiology-of-play-unraveling-the-fascinating-connection-between-play-and-brain-development).
    
    ### Social and Emotional Development
    
    Play provides a rich environment for developing social skills such as cooperation, negotiation, empathy, and conflict resolution. Interactive play teaches children how to share, take turns, and communicate effectively, laying the foundation for successful relationships. Emotional development is supported as children express and process feelings, develop resilience, and build self-confidence through playful experiences[[3]](https://www.steppingstonepeds.org/post/the-importance-of-play-in-child-development)[[4]](https://ipaengland.org/blog/the-importance-of-play-in-child-development-exploring-the-benefits).
    
    ### Physical Development
    
    Active play—such as running, climbing, and sports—builds motor skills, coordination, and physical fitness. Meta-analyses confirm that play-based interventions significantly enhance fundamental motor skills and physical fitness in early childhood, supporting lifelong healthy habits[[5]](https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/92649/)[[6]](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-025-24156-3).
    
    ### Language and Literacy
    
    Playful interactions, including storytelling, role-play, and language games, promote vocabulary acquisition, narrative skills, and early literacy. Children learn new words and concepts through playful engagement with peers and adults[[7]](https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/early-childhood/early-childhood-health-and-development/power-of-play).
    
    ## 2. Play in Education and Learning
    
    ### Play-Based Learning Methodologies
    
    Educational models such as Montessori, Waldorf, and Reggio Emilia are founded on the principle that play is central to learning. These approaches emphasize hands-on, self-directed activities, creativity, and exploration, allowing children to construct knowledge through meaningful experiences[[8]](https://www.communityplaythings.com/resources/articles/an-overview-of-the-montessori-method).
    
    Play-based learning environments foster intrinsic motivation, independence, and a lifelong love of learning. Research shows that children engaged in play-based education demonstrate stronger academic performance, better executive function, and greater social competence than those in more didactic settings[[9]](https://vocal.media/humans/the-role-of-play-in-child-development).
    
    ### Types of Play and Their Benefits
    
    Developmental psychologists have identified several types of play, each contributing uniquely to growth:
    
    - **Parallel Play**: Playing alongside others without direct interaction, which helps children learn social norms and observe peer behaviors[[10]](https://cadey.co/articles/parallel-play/).
    - **Cooperative Play**: Involves shared goals, negotiation, and teamwork, fostering advanced social and cognitive skills[[11]](https://helpfulprofessor.com/cooperative-play/)[[12]](https://www.splashlearn.com/blog/what-is-cooperative-play/).
    - **Symbolic (Imaginative) Play**: Enables children to explore abstract thinking, role-taking, and emotional processing.
    
    ## 3. The Consequences of Play Deprivation
    
    ### Mental Health and Well-Being
    
    A decline in opportunities for free, unstructured play has been linked to rising rates of anxiety, depression, and behavioral problems in children and adolescents. Play deprivation disrupts the development of executive function, emotional regulation, and resilience, and is associated with poor social skills and increased stress[[13]](https://dannyenglish.medium.com/play-deprivation-and-the-crisis-in-childrens-mental-health-why-we-must-prioritise-play-498c7c35c339)[[14]](https://nifplay.org/decline-in-independent-activity-as-a-cause-of-decline-in-childrens-mental-wellbeing-summary-of-the-evidence/)[[15]](https://www.communityplaythings.com/resources/articles/play-deprivation-is-a-serious-problem)[[16]](https://childandfamilyblog.com/play-deprivation-early-child-development/)[[17]](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/edcast/24/02/improving-mental-health-through-independent-play).
    
    ### Decline in Play Time
    
    Contemporary children have significantly less free play time compared to previous generations, due to factors such as increased academic pressure, screen time, and risk-averse parenting. Surveys show that only a minority of children meet recommended daily play guidelines, with outdoor and unstructured play particularly diminished.
    
    ## 4. Evolutionary and Biological Foundations of Play
    
    Play is a universal behavior among mammals and has deep evolutionary roots. It evolved as an adaptive mechanism to promote learning, social bonding, and the development of complex cognitive and motor skills. In both animals and humans, play is associated with brain regions responsible for executive function, planning, and emotional regulation. Evolutionary biologists argue that the benefits of play—such as increased adaptability, creativity, and social competence—conferred survival advantages, explaining its persistence across species[[18]](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/abs/does-play-matter-functional-and-evolutionary-aspects-of-animal-and-human-play/505E530D19E1AA1CC913EADF5ACDA922)[[19]](https://popular-archaeology.com/article/what-does-play-tell-us-about-human-evolution/).
    
    ## 5. Cross-Cultural Perspectives on Play
    
    While play is universal, its forms and societal value vary across cultures. In Western societies, play is often seen as essential for cognitive and social development, with adults frequently acting as play partners. In traditional societies, play may be more integrated with daily life, work, and cultural practices, and older siblings or peers are often primary playmates. Some cultures prioritize rule-based or educational play over free play, reflecting differing socialization goals and beliefs about childhood.
    
    ## 6. Play Across the Lifespan and in Adulthood
    
    The benefits of play extend beyond childhood. For adults, playfulness is linked to creativity, stress reduction, social connection, and workplace satisfaction. Organizations that encourage playful environments report higher employee engagement, innovation, and productivity. Play also supports lifelong learning and adaptability, contributing to overall well-being in adulthood[[20]](https://www.helpguide.org/mental-health/wellbeing/benefits-of-play-for-adults)[[21]](https://www.creativityatwork.com/why-is-play-essential-to-organizational-success/)[[22]](https://www.playficient.com/play-at-work/).
    
    ## 7. Play as a Human Right
    
    The universal importance of play is recognized in international law. Article 31 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child affirms every child's right to rest, leisure, play, and participation in cultural and artistic activities. This underscores the obligation of societies and governments to protect and promote opportunities for play as a fundamental aspect of healthy development.
    
    ## 8. Play and Socialization: Insights from Peter Gray
    
    Developmental psychologist Peter Gray’s research highlights the unique benefits of mixed-age, self-directed play. Children who engage in free play with peers of different ages demonstrate greater social understanding, adaptability, and self-confidence. Gray argues that age-segregated environments may hinder social development, and that play is the “job of children,” essential for learning how to navigate complex social worlds[[23]](https://www.notion.so/SEO-Article-The-Socialization-Myth-Why-Homeschooled-Children-Often-Develop-Stronger-Social-Skills-1baafe52ef5980b08e38c6678a64de0b?pvs=21)[[24]](https://www.notion.so/Kristin-Ginger-Blog-Post-Package-253afe52ef5980e19ac1d4ffc949bd57?pvs=21).
    
    ## 9. Play and the Role of Adults
    
    Adults play a crucial role in supporting and facilitating play by providing safe, stimulating environments and modeling playful behavior. However, excessive adult control or over-scheduling can undermine the intrinsic motivation and developmental benefits of play. Striking a balance between guidance and freedom is key to nurturing healthy play experiences[[24]](https://www.notion.so/Kristin-Ginger-Blog-Post-Package-253afe52ef5980e19ac1d4ffc949bd57?pvs=21)[[17]](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/ideas/edcast/24/02/improving-mental-health-through-independent-play).
    
    ## Conclusion
    
    Play is not a luxury, but a necessity for optimal human development. It is a powerful engine for learning, creativity, social connection, and resilience. The erosion of play opportunities poses significant risks to mental health and well-being, making it imperative for families, educators, policymakers, and communities to prioritize and protect play throughout life. Recognizing and honoring the importance of play is essential for raising creative, competent, and emotionally healthy individuals capable of thriving in a complex world.

# The Lost Art of Play: Reclaiming Childhood from a World on Lockdown

_By Ela Richmond_

---

It’s the universal lament of the modern parent: "How do I get my kids off their phones?"

We try screen time limits, digital detoxes, and endless nagging. We assume it’s an addiction to the technology itself. But what if we’re wrong?

A groundbreaking Harris Poll, highlighted by Lenore Skenazy of Let Grow, reveals a startling truth: kids don’t actually want to be online. When given a choice, their overwhelming preference is for unstructured, real-world play with friends. No adults, no coaches, and no screens.

They are online because it’s the only place they can find a shred of freedom. As Skenazy puts it, “Being glued to screens is their DEFAULT not their DESIRE.”

## The Diagnosis: An Ultraprocessed Childhood on Lockdown

The decline of play has been staggering. Since the 1970s, children’s free play time has plummeted from hours to mere minutes a day. In its place, we have a “childhood on lockdown.” Most kids today aren’t allowed to be in public spaces without an adult. One in five aren’t even allowed to play in their own front yard.

This culture of control is reinforced by our institutions. Peggy Lowe, a former public school teacher who now runs Apogee Utah, saw it every day.

“We would have them walk down the hallway in their little lines,” she recalls. Kids had to ask for permission to use the restroom and were given a scant 15 minutes for lunch.

This system, built for efficiency and behavioral control, teaches a devastating lesson: your body is not your own, your time is not your own, and your choices are not your own. You are a passive recipient of instruction, not an active agent in your own life.

Is it any wonder our children retreat to the digital world? It’s the only place where they can make their own decisions and explore without a hovering adult. We have infantilized them in the real world, and we are shocked by the results.

## Rediscovering the Work of Childhood

To fix this, we must first remember what true play is. Kristin and Ginger, two veteran teachers who founded the SKOLA Microschool, have dedicated themselves to this question. They too left the public school system because, as Kristin says, “If I took my kids outside for an extra recess, I felt like I’d be judged. Like my kids are not working enough.”

They built a school on the premise that play _is_ the work. By observing children in hours of unstructured time, Kristin identified the “Four Categories of Play,” a framework for understanding the work of childhood:

1. **Imagination:** The world of make-believe—playing store, acting out stories. This is the engine of creativity.
2. **Competitive Structured Games:** Hide-and-seek, tag, or pickup football. This is where children learn to negotiate rules and handle winning and losing.
3. **Civil Engineering:** Building forts, digging dams. This is applied physics, problem-solving, and large-scale collaboration.
4. **Social:** The simple, profound art of just hanging out. This is where children learn the subtle dance of human connection.

For these educators, play is data. By observing which categories a child gravitates toward, they can understand that child’s strengths, weaknesses, and needs.

## Building a Culture of Trust

Understanding play is the first step. The next is building an environment where it can flourish. This requires a radical shift from a culture of control to a culture of trust. Peggy’s work at Apogee offers a powerful model.

**Principle 1: Trust Them with Their Bodies.**  
At Apogee, the rules are inverted. Kids don’t ask to use the restroom; they just go. They are given an hour for lunch and play and are trusted to listen to their bodies. This builds interoception—the ability to understand your body’s own signals—and is the foundation of self-ownership.

**Principle 2: Trust Them with Failure.**  
“We’ve failed to value failing,” says OpenEd founder Matt Bowman. Peggy’s approach is the antidote. She speaks of letting her students “fail forward.” During a showcase where some students didn’t meet their goals, she resisted the urge to intervene. That single experience of low-stakes failure taught them more than a dozen successes ever could. It taught them resilience.

**Principle 3: Trust Them with Their Education.**  
Peggy tells a story of pulling a student back a level in their math book, away from their prescribed “grade level.” By meeting the child where they were, she reignited their confidence. This is the power of passion-driven learning. As Isaac Morehouse notes, his son might claim he can’t “read” a book, but he can flawlessly read his baseball cards. The skill is there; it just needs to be unlocked by genuine interest.

## A Parent’s Guide to Opening the Door

This philosophy can be implemented in every family, starting today.

1. **Embrace Boredom.** When your child says, “I’m bored,” don’t rush to solve it. Boredom is the precursor to creativity. Give them the gift of empty space, and they will eventually fill it with their own worlds.
2. **Become a Guide, Not a Manager.** As Peggy advises, “Step back and let them show you what they can do.” When your child is stuck, ask a question instead of providing an answer. Guide them toward their own solution.
3. **Start with a “Let Grow Project.”** Take a page from Let Grow’s playbook and start with one small, concrete step toward independence. Ask your child to run an errand on their own for the first time.
4. **Explain the “Why.”** Treating children as rational beings who deserve an explanation fosters respect and collaboration. Whether it’s for chores or a new challenge, explaining the “why” changes the dynamic from compliance to partnership.

For too long, we have been asking the wrong question. The cure for too much screen time is not more screen time rules. It’s more real-world freedom.

The digital world is a pale imitation of the rich, complex, and thrilling world just outside our doors. Our kids are desperate to explore it. We just need to trust them, and ourselves, enough to unlock the door.

As Lenore Skenazy says, “If parents want their kids to put down their phones, they need to start opening the front door.”
