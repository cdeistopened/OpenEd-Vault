# Teenage Rebellion is a Myth (Or, it Can Be)

_By Ela Richmond_

---

We’ve accepted a cultural script that says teenagers will inevitably pull away from their parents. The eye-rolling, the slammed doors, the obsession with friends—it’s just a phase to be endured.

Janae Daniels challenges that script, and questions the idea that teenage rebellion is some kind of a biological inevitability.

Instead, she argues, it’s a symptom of a broken system.

At the heart of Janae Daniels’ story is a quote I had to repeat in our recent conversation, to make sure it didn’t get lost on our listeners:

**“We cannot parent children whose heart we don’t have.”**

Janae is not the person you’d expect to deliver this message. She’s not a lifelong, crunchy homeschooler. She was a K-12 licensed public school teacher, a fierce advocate for the system, and now hosts the popular podcast and YouTube channel, _[School to Homeschool](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-g2A33G_3g-eS9A4L6Lw-A)_.

“I believed all the propaganda,” she says. “I knew a couple of homeschoolers in high school and thought they were weird. It was never on my radar.”

Then came COVID. And then, a few weeks later, a moment in church that she can only describe as divine intervention.

“This thought came into my head,” she recalled. “‘I want you to homeschool the kids.’ I thought, _**‘hard no.’**_

Then it came again.

She heard the voice:

“’It’s taken a pandemic. I want you to homeschool the kids.’”

She went home, cried, and called the three homeschoolers she knew. The next day, shaking, she submitted her notice of intent to the school district. A month later, she held her first day of homeschool for her four children, including a 12- and 13-year-old on the cusp of high school.

## The Piano Tuner to the Rescue

The first day was, in her own words, a complete disaster.

“I was still in a public school teacher mindset,” she said. “I had a detailed schedule, tons of expensive curriculums. An hour in, everyone was in tears, including me. My 13-year-old son said, ‘We’re going back to school. Just put us back.’ I was ready to agree.”

And then came a knock at the door. It was the piano tuner.

As Janae let him in, her kids staged a mutiny, abandoning their color-coded schedules and fleeing to the living room. Defeated, Janae followed, expecting to find them glued to a screen. Instead, she found all four of them surrounding the piano tuner, “totally mesmerized, totally enthralled,” as he explained sound frequencies and the geometry of octaves.

For two hours, they peppered him with thoughtful, deep questions.

That’s when it hit her. This was learning. Not the forced, sterile compliance she had been trying to replicate, but a genuine fire of curiosity sparked by a real-world expert. “I realized I needed to rethink education,” she said.

That rethinking led her to the work of Dr. Gordon Neufeld and Gabor Maté, and their seminal book, _[Hold On to Your Kids: Why Parents Need to Matter More Than Peers](https://www.amazon.com/Hold-Your-Kids-Parents-Matter/dp/0375760288)_. It was here she found the intellectual framework for what she was feeling intuitively: the modern family structure was broken.

The book’s central thesis is a radical one: for the first time in human history, children are turning to their peers, not their parents, for guidance, identity, and connection. Neufeld calls this “peer-orientation,” and he argues it’s the root cause of everything from bullying and gang culture to the epidemic of teenage anxiety and depression.

Janae breaks it down point by point:

1. **The Natural Order is Parent-Led.** Historically, children were raised in a “village” of multi-generational attachments, with parents and other caring adults as their primary compass point. This is how culture, values, and identity were passed down.
2. **The School System Broke the Model.** The industrial school model, Janae learned, intentionally severed this connection. By separating children from their families for some 16,000 hours during their most formative years, the system created a vacuum. “The more they can separate kids from parents,” she says, citing early school reformers, “the more kids will rely on the government.”
3. **Peers Filled the Void.** Nature abhors a vacuum. With parents largely absent, children turned to the only other people available: each other. The problem, Neufeld argues, is that peers are developmentally incapable of providing the unconditional love, safety, and guidance a child needs. Peer attachment is inherently insecure, based on conformity and performance.
4. **The Result is a Generation Adrift.** A peer-oriented child is a child looking to other lost children for directions. This, Janae realized, was the source of the “normal” teenage behavior she saw everywhere. It wasn’t rebellion; it was a desperate search for belonging in the wrong place.

“It blew me away,” Janae says. “I realized my kids could be attached to me; that’s the natural order.”

Armed with this new framework, Janae threw out the curriculum. She kept the basics—math, reading, and writing—and for the next several months, she gave her kids something radical: time. Time to be bored.

At first, she panicked. But soon, things started to happen. Her son, once consumed by video games, picked up a guitar and taught himself to play from YouTube. Her eight-year-old learned Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata the same way. Her daughter, who had grown to hate reading in school, started devouring books.

This newfound freedom didn't just reignite their curiosity; it began to subtly mend the parent-child connection that the school schedule had frayed. The gift of time was, in fact, the beginning of getting their hearts back.

## Reclaiming Your Child's Heart

As Janae’s kids entered their high school years, they “hacked” their education. Her son, the one who taught himself guitar, interned with a YouTuber who has 4 million subscribers. At 16, he was writing proposals to NASA and being trusted with a company credit card.

“He said he learned more in those months than in a semester of his business class,” Janae said. He now has job offers waiting for him.

As for Algebra 2? He never finished it.

But when it came time for college, he tested out of it.

“There’s more than one road to Rome,” Janae says. The goal isn’t to follow a pre-paved path; it’s to figure out which doors you want to keep open for your child and find the most direct way to get there.

Janae’s journey reveals that homeschooling isn’t just about academics; it’s a tool for rebuilding the family. It forced her and her husband to confront their own values, to slow down, and to redefine success. It put a mirror up to their own lives.

It’s a hard path. It requires courage. But as Janae’s story shows, the prize isn’t just a better education. It’s a chance to reclaim something far more fundamental: your child’s heart.

And her story is a chance for the rest of us to realize that the sullen, eye-rolling teenager isn’t a biological inevitability. It’s a symptom. And it’s one we have the power to heal.

# Teenage Rebellion is a Myth

And we have the receipts to prove it. PLUS: The high school credential that matters less than ever.

Greetings!

Today we’re diving into our conversation with Janae Daniels, a former public school teacher who stumbled into one of the biggest lies we tell ourselves about raising kids. “Normal teenage behavior” doesn’t have to be

Let's dive in.

**THOUGHT**: Teenage Rebellion is a Choice (Yours)**TREND**: The Useless Credential**TOOL**: The Attachment Bible

# Teenage Rebellion is a Choice (Yours)

Everyone knows “normal teenage behavior” is a disaster. The eye-rolling, the slammed doors, the obsession with friends over family. We pretend it’s a rite of passage—something to be endured.

But there’s an alternate theory that this behavior is a symptom of a broken attachment model we’ve accepted for generations. We’re shocked when our kids don’t want to be around us, after spending 16,000 hours at an institution designed to do exactly that. Of course they’re peer-oriented. We trained them to be. The good news? As Janae discovered, you can get their hearts back. It just requires admitting the “normal” we’ve settled for is anything but.

# The Useless Credential

We live in a world where a kid can get a paid internship with a YouTuber who has 4 million subscribers, learn more in three months than in a semester of college, and get job offers… but society is still panicked that he didn’t finish Algebra 2. This is, of course, completely insane. The credentialism that props up the traditional high school path is crumbling. While the system obsesses over seat time and test scores, the real world is rewarding verifiable skills and demonstrated initiative. The story of Janae’s son isn’t an outlier; it’s a preview. He didn’t just hack high school; he exposed how useless most of its metrics have become.

# Hold On to Your Kids

If the parent-child relationship is the foundation for creating mature adults, how do you fix it? You start with the source code. The book _Hold On to Your Kids_ by Gordon Neufeld and Gabor Maté is less of a parenting guide and more of an operating manual for the human heart. It’s the book Janae handed to her crying friend whose daughter wanted nothing to do with her. It explains, in terrifyingly clear detail, why our kids are turning to their peers for guidance and how to win them back. It’s not easy reading—it’ll put a mirror up to your own parenting—but it’s a great book for any parent who refuses to accept a broken relationship as “normal.”
