**Hook**: Shows the stark difference between kids raised with purpose vs. without - creates immediate contrast and demonstrates parenting impact

**Complete Edited Transcript**:

> Kerry: There was a story I actually wrote in another book, an experience that I had where I saw this homeless man and I was at an intersection and then from the other direction there was a car with these young 20 year old young men who wound down their windows and they started throwing their soda bottles and cans at this homeless man. And it was just very , it was, I couldn't do anything about it and it was a very emotional experience and came home and just was crying about it to my kids.
> 
> And I said, if you were ever to do anything like that~~, like~~ would be awful ~~if their mums could have seen their sons doing that you know I'm sure they would have been just mortified~~ and so my son who was able to drive picked up his keys and went off looking for that homeless man because he wanted to do something to help him.
> 
> ~~So for example~~ One of my sons was working at this car wash place and he was given some tips and some friends of ours saw my son giving those tips to a homeless man and my son never mentioned a word of it.

- I did **not** find a clearly verified public Instagram, Facebook, or X/Twitter account for Kerry Owen personally (distinct from the organization). If you have a recent appearance or tag that points to a personal handle, I can add it.
