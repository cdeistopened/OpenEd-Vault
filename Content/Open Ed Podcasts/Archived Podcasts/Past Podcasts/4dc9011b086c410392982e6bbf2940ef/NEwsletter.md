# The School That Adapts to YOUR Child (Not the Other Way Around)

## 🌟 INTRODUCING OPENEDED ACADEMY 🌟

We've been proud to offer the OpenEd District Model Program in a growing number of states, but we still get asked all the time: "What can we do if we live in a state that doesn't offer this program?"

Now we're thrilled to announce OpenEd Academy – a nationwide virtual private school that brings the same personalized approach to families everywhere. Starting at just $2,900/year, it's the subject of this week's OpenEd podcast with Teresa King, CEO of the OpenEd Foundation.

### 💡 THOUGHT

## **BUILDING EDUCATION FROM THE GROUND UP—AROUND YOUR CHILD**

[Video Clip Embedded: The Buffet Approach - Clip #1]

Most "personalized" education still forces children to adapt to a predetermined system. OpenEd Academy takes a different approach.

"What we're trying to build is a buffet," explains Teresa King, CEO of the OpenEd Foundation. "In so many settings, you sit down and you're handed a menu with three choices. What we want is for it to be a buffet where you leave what you don't want and take what you do."

After 15 years of helping over 100,000 students, we've learned one fundamental truth: parents know their children better than any system or expert. That's why OpenEd Academy operates on a completely different premise than other virtual schools. We start with your child—their strengths, interests, learning style, and goals—and build education from there.

This buffet approach transforms how education works in four key ways:

**1. Customized Curriculum Selection**

Choose from multiple curriculum options for each subject based on how your child learns best—visual, text-based, interactive, or hands-on approaches.

**2. Flexible Scheduling That Fits YOUR Life**

"We're never going to say, 'You signed up for school so every day at two o'clock you better be online,'" Teresa emphasizes. "That doesn't meet the needs of every family."

Set your own start and end dates, determine your pace for each subject, and create a schedule that works for YOUR family.

**3. Real-World Learning on Their Transcript**

When your teen works as a shift leader, masters a skill through independent study, or completes meaningful community service, that learning counts for transcript credit.

**4. Education Built on Trust**

"Schools don't typically seem to trust parents," Teresa observes. "What does it look like when a school trusts parents to know their child and then works with them to create the education that would work best for them? That's really where we want to start."

The result is education that feels natural, effective, and joyful—because it's actually designed for your unique child.

## 📊 TREND

### **THE END OF "SIT STILL AND LISTEN"**

Traditional education was designed for a world that no longer exists. Built for assembly line workers, it teaches children to:

- Sit quietly for hours
- Follow directions without question
- Do the same work at the same pace
- Prioritize compliance over creativity

Yet today's world rewards exactly the opposite: creative thinking, self-direction, adaptability, and personalized skill development.

This fundamental mismatch explains why millions of families are seeking alternatives—whether through microschools, homeschooling, or innovative virtual options. It's not just a pandemic blip; it's a permanent shift in how parents view education.

The schools that will thrive in this new landscape are those that can truly adapt to children's diverse needs, rather than demanding children adapt to them. This doesn't mean abandoning structure—it means creating the right structure for each learner.

As Teresa King puts it: "What does it look like when a school trusts parents to know their child? That's really where we want to start."
