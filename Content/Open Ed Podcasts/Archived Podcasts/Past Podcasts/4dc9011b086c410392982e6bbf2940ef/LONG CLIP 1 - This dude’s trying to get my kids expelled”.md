[LONG CLIP #1 - EXPANDED]  
  
[25:30-27:30] I've always been a disruptor by nature. I never wanted to fit in any box, so I already hated traditional education. ~~Especially when I learned how to communicate and actually shift and transform behavior. I hated how things were being taught because they were not transformative and they were just the slowest way to learn information ever.~~ I already was like, I wish I could find a different way for my kids.  
  
Then I met you and I'm like, "Wait, what? People are doing this?" I'll never forget our conversation we had and you're like, "Dude, just try it out for a bit. You don't have to make a fork in the road decision right now, man. Just pull them out of school for a couple weeks and take them on some learning adventures and see how they go." And I'm like, "This dude is trying to get my kids expelled."  
  
**Matt Bowman:** I remember your first question was, "Is that allowed?" Right.  
  
**Darryll Stinson:** I'm like, "Is this dude serious?" And then I'm like, "It is because he's white and I'm black. I can't do that. I'm going to jail. I don't know what's going on." ~~My—I am telling you, we talk about paradigms, right? I just couldn't—I couldn't wrap my mind around it. I was like, "It's a scam. It's only because whatever."~~  
  
But it opened—it sat with me and I couldn't unhear it. I couldn't unhear like, "What if? What if it was possible that there was a different way to have my child self-direct their own learning? What if there was a different way to do it that wasn't career suicide or sabotage, wasn't closing doors or shutting down opportunity or ruining a child's future? It was actually one of the most powerful, empowering things we could do. What if?" And I just couldn't unhear that question.  
  
[27:30-30:30] Long story short, I think we just ended up trying and doing it. What it was is we took the summer and we said, "Okay, let's pretend that we're running home education during the summer to know if we want to send them to school or not for the year." ~~That's kind of what we were doing.~~  
  
~~The kids were going wild, by the way. They wanted to be in school. My oldest two wanted to be in school. My youngest one could care less, but the oldest who really wanted the social interaction, the schedule, they were used to the friends that they were around. So they did not want to be missing out on anything. And it was challenging because again, I was like, "They're kids, right? They don't know what they don't know. They might hate me now and love me later for this tough choice that I made." So I'm like, "I owe it to them to just be like, I'm not gonna let a 7-year-old and a 9-year-old tell me what to do." All right, we're gonna run this play and we're gonna do summer school.~~  
  
So we did it. It was fun. We took trips, we went across the country. We saw the Grand Canyon and loved it. We're learning so much more stuff. Our kids are way smarter. They would listen to me do sales calls in the car. They're ready to run businesses now. This is the dream. And they did not want to keep the dream. They wanted to go back to school.  
  
**Matt Bowman:** ~~And especially, let me just make a point here for our listeners. We never criticize the choice to send your child to the boundary district school. If that's the choice you're making, kudos. We applaud that. Just make that a choice instead of a default. There's "it's my only option."~~  
  
**Darryll Stinson:** ~~Yes, a hundred percent.~~ So they chose to go back. But here's what happened. The law of exposure: the mind when stretched, never returns back to its original form.  
  
**Matt Bowman:** Wow. Well said.  
  
**Darryll Stinson:** So now they're at school, but they notice the rigidity. Now they're at school, but they miss the adventure. Now they see dad's going to Colorado and they want to go, but they can't go because they got choir. And then they're like, "Oh." And I'm like, "Well, you can just come."  
  
**Matt Bowman:** ~~It's your choice.~~  
  
**Darryll Stinson:** "Hey, my friend Matt said we can do whatever we want. Just send him a note." And we did, bro. We pulled them out. We took them on some of my travel trips. We took longer extended vacations. We broke the system. ~~We had high levels of anxiety thinking we were foolish, we were gonna get our kids kicked out.~~  
  
~~We also were kind of worried about the social perception that like, oh, they can just do whatever they want and we're in the matrix. So that sucks. What are you doing going on an adventure while you stay in school? We felt bad about that, that I felt like our kids were becoming better than a little bit. I know it was a weird dynamic. It's still one of my concerns, to be honest with you.~~  
  
They missed over a hundred days of school or something crazy. ~~It was like they missed like half of school.~~ Still had good grades and still were student council leaders somehow. And still it worked out perfectly fine because they'd be messing around half the time in school anyways, and you could just catch up.  
  
[34:00-41:00] **Matt Bowman:** Tell us about your wife's experience with that, because a lot of dads and moms have these conversations back and forth of, "Oh, but you're just off working and I've gotta deal with the hybrid schedule." Talk about that negotiation because we talk a lot about family needs need to be also identified and can't be ignored.  
  
**Darryll Stinson:** ~~Totally.~~ So my wife actually has her master's degree in science administration. ~~I just have a bachelor's.~~ Her parents are all traditional. They're like "don't break the box." That's their MO as a family. They have for decades—every holiday ate dinner at two o'clock. Just running the same play forever. ~~Like dinner's not even at two, bro. It's like somebody over the course of the last 40 years would've been like, "maybe we should try five o'clock dinner," but no, two o'clock. So anyways...~~  
  
And one of the people—~~I love her family—~~one of the people we both respect the most out of that side of the family is her grandma. Her grandma was an assistant to the president of the university for her entire career~~, tenure~~. So I say all that to say the thought of pulling our children out of school—you would've thought we were switching religions.  
  
**Matt Bowman:** Right.  
  
**Darryll Stinson:** And doesn't it feel like that sometimes when we think about pulling our kids and doing something different than what culture says is acceptable? We feel like we're changing religions here. We're violating sacred cows. It feels vulnerable and exposed and scary.  
  
~~For her it was a lot. She didn't meet you, she just knew I always talk to people and say everybody's amazing, right? So I'm like, "Oh, I met this guy Matt, and he's amazing, and he said we can pull our kids out of school." And she's like, "So you're gonna have to help me with this conversation."~~  
  
~~So you got on a call with us, and it helped her to start to see like, "Hey, this is not an unwise decision. This is just an option. Let's just look at it as an option." That was helpful to go from "I'm not forcing you to do this right now" to "it isn't as scary as you think. Let's get you in the mindset of possibility."~~  
  
~~That summer experiment was helpful too—being able to have that summer with our kids where we could see the benefit of alternative education. And then their own lack of fulfillment when they went back into the belly of the beast. After we tried it for that summer, I think she flipped and changed. She was more like, "Man, now I feel bad. Now I feel like I'm sending them into something that's less good for them."~~  
  
**Matt Bowman:** ~~How did she deal with her family? What tools and strategies did she do to embrace that difference?~~  
  
**Darryll Stinson:** ~~Totally.~~ All right. I know this is a podcast, but I need all the listeners to help your boy out. Don't tell nobody~~, but~~ I don't think her parents know. I don't think they know~~, man~~. What you don't know won't hurt you.  
  
~~So they—~~I don't think they really know. The times that we kind of tried to poke and mention, "Oh, well, don't they have school?" It's like, "Yeah, it's cool. It's all right." Because it's not worth the argument. ~~Because~~ here's the thing—I think this is important for your listeners. Sometimes your freedom reminds people of their lack thereof. ~~And the truth is,~~ all the feedback that we were getting where we were putting our toe in the water with letting them know what was going on—~~the deep part of it,~~ it was all a response because if this was a better pathway, then that would remind them that they could have thought of something different or a better way to parent. ~~And I think they were rubbing off on like,~~ "Well, if you're doing a different, quote-unquote, better way, we did a way that wasn't of highest service," and that is confronting to face that reality.  
  
So we had to learn that that's what we were dealing with and just be like, we don't want to create that tension~~, and that's not even our belief, but that's their interpretation of our behavior~~. So we just left it alone.  
  
**Matt Bowman:** ~~Yeah. I respect that. I really do. I think~~ sometimes when new things are discovered in one's life, you push that on everybody because you want them all to know. And sometimes~~, even what you said earlier, you could never unhear what you and I chatted about.~~ Sometimes people would rather not hear some of that because it makes them question, makes them feel some guilt, anxiety, doubt of what they chose~~, even though you don't want them to. You're definitely not retro-applying judgment, but you don't want them to feel that. So you're being sensitive to that. I respect that 100 percent.~~
