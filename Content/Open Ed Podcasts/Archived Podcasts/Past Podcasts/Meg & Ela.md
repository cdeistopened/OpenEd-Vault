**Meg:** "Now the children don't even need to ask how to behave, how to make decisions or how to make this trade off against that one. So like, do I do my school or do I just go play, right? Because your family in many ways is a self-managing family thanks to its culture. Parents don't need to dive into the details of every decision because the culture almost as an agent of management is present in the details of every decision. So when you have those three things functioning, heart, habits, home. School is just another extension of your family. Like, of course we read books, of course we study, of course we finish things that we started because that is the culture that we have intentionally created in our home."

**Ela:** "Wow, that is the perfect note to end it on. I could not have asked for anything better. Absolutely incredible Meg."

# How Coach Meg Thomas Created a Self-Running Homeschool (With 7 Kids)

Homeschooling multiple children without losing your mind isn't about perfect schedules or the right curriculum. It's about building a family culture that practically runs itself.

In this episode, veteran homeschool mom Meg Thomas shares how she created a self-managing family while homeschooling seven children—and still maintained her own identity (she ran 16 miles the morning of this interview!). Learn her "Heart, Habits, Home" framework and discover how teaching children real responsibility creates both capable kids and a sustainable homeschool.

## Improved Social Media Clips with On-Screen Text

### CLIP 2: "Stop Creating Entitled Children" (45-60 seconds)

**First 3 Seconds Hook:** "I see more parents create entitled children..."

**Full Clip Transcript:**  
"I see more parents create entitled children... They give their kids all of these liberties. Like 'go do what you want, go have this phone, go with your friends whenever you want' without having to work for it. 'Well, I just get a phone because I'm 12. And I didn't have to work for it.'

But we understand as adults delayed gratification. So with a smaller child, I do more instant gratification, right? Like we clean your room, then we get the toys out. We finish our school, then we can go to the park. But as they enter these teenage years, we actually work together... If you're my kid and I want you to win, it's not me like, 'I'm going to bury you in all of this hard work.' But instead I want you to win."

**On-Screen Text:** "Are we raising entitled kids without realizing it?"

**Caption Style (Instagram):**  
The surprising truth about why teens push back against rules 👀

Most parents either give in completely or become too controlling. But what if there's a middle path?

After raising 7 kids (4 now adults), I've found a system that helps teens EARN the freedoms they want without entitlement or power struggles.

What freedoms do your kids want most right now? And how are you helping them earn them?

### CLIP 3: "The Self-Managing Family Secret" (45-60 seconds)

**First 3 Seconds Hook:** "Now the children don't even need to ask how to behave..."

**Full Clip Transcript:**  
"Now the children don't even need to ask how to behave, how to make decisions or how to make this trade off against that one. Because your family in many ways is a self-managing family thanks to its culture.

Parents don't need to dive into the details of every decision because the culture almost as an agent of management is present in the details of every decision. So when you have those three things functioning - heart, habits, home - school is just another extension of your family. Like, of course we read books, of course we study, of course we finish things that we started because that is the culture that we have intentionally created in our home."

**On-Screen Text:** "The 3-word framework for a homeschool that runs itself"

**Caption Style (Instagram):**  
What if your kids knew exactly what to do without constant reminders? 🤯

After 17 years homeschooling 7 kids, I've discovered it's not about better planners or stricter schedules. It's about a framework I call "Heart, Habits, Home."

When these three elements work together, your family practically manages itself.

Which of these three do you think your family needs most right now? Heart, habits, or home?

These revised clips now:

1. Open with an attention-grabbing statement in the first 3 seconds
2. Use clear, compelling on-screen text that creates curiosity
3. Include Instagram-optimized captions with thoughtful questions for engagement
4. Are formatted to work as standalone content while encouraging viewers to want more

Would you like me to refine any of these further, or should we focus on another aspect of the content package?

  

  

Let me identify the best clips, quotes, and "sticky gold" from the interview before creating the blog post:

### Best Clips & Quotes:

1. **On Creating a Family Culture of Responsibility** (52:30-53:00):  
    "Now the children don't even need to ask how to behave... because your family in many ways is a self-managing family thanks to its culture. Parents don't need to dive into the details of every decision because the culture almost as an agent of management is present in the details of every decision."
2. **The Laundry Revolution** (01:41-02:29):  
    "What I found in the beginning was to teach them habits, to help our home run. So like when we did laundry, it was an event, but we all did it together... Everybody would just hook all their clothes into the kitchen and we'd do a humongous pile and they would learn how to sort right then and there..."
3. **The "Successful Six"** (10:30-12:28):  
    "We call it the successful six that now before our kids graduate and leave the nest essentially is that they are proficient in skills with finances... proficient with skills with their emotions... mentally learning how to push through hard things... physically, how to cook, clean, your hygiene, exercise, grocery shop... socially, how to be a good friend... and then finally, spiritually..."
4. **Levels of Liberty** (15:23-15:56):  
    "As they enter these teenage years, we actually work together. So if you're my kid and I want you to win, it's not me like, I'm going to bury you in all of this hard work, right? But instead I want you to win."
5. **Maintaining Mom's Identity** (31:23-32:40):  
    "I knew I needed to make myself still a priority... I don't know that I knew exactly who I was, but I knew I needed to make myself still a priority and still not like, 'then don't ever homeschool,' right? Because like, 'I'm going to go to the spa every day'... But like, I had something always for me."
6. **Heart, Habits, Home Philosophy** (50:50-51:50):  
    "So relax, really relax. But I love thinking into three different steps of focusing on the heart... The next one is habits... and then that home piece of creating this culture."

### Sticky Gold (Memorable Phrases):

1. "I basically am working myself out of a job."
2. "Teaching them responsibility is not burying them in work."
3. "This is who we are. This is what the Thomases do."
4. "It's not about controlling our kids; it's about setting them up to win."
5. "We don't start with smartphones. We start with sweet big old brick Nokia phones."
6. "When you have a big family, you learn what is essential and what you can let go."
7. "Homeschooling wasn't cool yet."
8. "I think sometimes to learn a lesson, it has to be really hard. Like I must be the person who has to touch the hot stove to know don't touch the hot stove."

Now I'll create the SEO-formatted blog post:

## Transcript

Ela Richmond (00:00.58)  
and I do, okay, so I guess we're in. Okay, welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. Today I am joined by Meg Thomas and I'm so excited because she is incredible. I was doing some research. She helps homeschool families to do homeschool better. And today she's gonna talk about that, about getting started in homeschool, about her seven children and what that looks like to balance everything and hopefully so much more. Welcome to the podcast.

Meg (00:28.648)  
Awesome, thank you so much. I'm excited to be here.

Ela Richmond (00:32.162)  
Okay, so I want to throw this at you first. I have a good friend of mine, right? And we were just chatting over messages and she's starting homeschool and she has one child that is very, very tiny and one child that is starting to get into homeschool age. And she was saying that it's so hard to balance both. She's like, I don't know how to do this. You have seven children. What is your best piece of advice for that? like, did you experience that as well?

Meg (01:00.55)  
Yeah, so when I started homeschooling, I only had five kids, but the oldest six. So I had a six year old of like six, five, four, one year old and a newborn, right? So kind of chaotic and kind of crazy. And we did one year of private school and then one month of first grade, kindergarten, preschool. Those first three are really close together. So pull them out and we like homeschooling wasn't cool yet. And internet was very different.

Ela Richmond (01:03.384)  
Okay.

Meg (01:29.562)  
as far as Googling things, And resources and apps and all of those things, it just was very different. So we just had to figure it out. And what I found in the beginning was to teach them habits, to help our home run. So like when we did laundry, it was an event, but we all did it together. So it wasn't me trying to stay up on my husband's mind and five little kids' laundry. It was a full family event where we literally, we had a two-story home.

Ela Richmond (01:41.806)  
Mmm.

Meg (01:59.28)  
and with a loft right down into the kitchen. And so everybody would just hook all their clothes into the kitchen and we do a humongous pile and they would learn how to sort right then and there, learn how to do like put it in the wash and then I would switch loads and then we'd fold it all together. And I didn't realize that these skills I was teaching them was going to help me to make long school feasible long-term because I basically am working myself out of a job, right? But a lot of those big habits of running the house

Ela Richmond (02:21.9)  
Mmm.

Meg (02:29.404)  
became a huge foundation in our homeschool of learning how to cook, learning how to clean, learning how to do yard maintenance, learning how to do, like I said, laundry. that, because what I see too often is a mom's like all in on homeschool. I'm so excited. I'm going to teach this subject. I'm going to do this really fun thing. And then it's laundry time. And she's like, I can't keep up on this. And then it's meal time and she is burned out. And the kid's like, play a game with this. You never play a game with this. And so.

It just becomes chaotic and a lot of times moms start resenting their kids like nobody helps me. Kind of that victim mentality. I do everything, but you kind of are doing everything. And so really in the beginning of we get really worried about the education piece. But you can learn them at the same time.

Ela Richmond (03:16.826)  
interesting. Okay. So like throwback to when you had five kids and you were just starting this, what made you initially decide, okay, this is something that we're going to do. And what was the education that your five kids were going through before?

Meg (03:29.81)  
So like I said, my oldest did a year of private school. the reason, I guess, well, let me back up. We did preschool, right? And I think preschool's adorable and it was super cute. And he did his first year and I was like, they're so cute in the painting and it's all the fun stuff, right? And then the second year they were teaching him to read and they were just doing sight words for reading. And I went to the preschool director because it was a bigger preschool, not just a mom and like a mom's basement.

So I was talking to the preschool director and I said, I don't understand why you're teaching this. Like, why are we not doing phonics? Why are we not doing something that makes more sense? And she said, well, that's how the public school teaches. And so like, we're just following modeling them. So right then and there, I was like, that is so ridiculous to teach my kid just to memorize words, but knowing how to sound them out. So we switched to a different preschool that was phonetic based, really amazing, really pricey, but so good, right? So this time now I have two preschoolers.

Ela Richmond (04:14.625)  
Yeah.

Meg (04:25.006)  
And so they're in this cute little preschool and I told my husband, I go, we have to do the private school route because if public school is teaching these ways that I just think are ridiculous, like I don't, I don't love it. So then the next year we put him in a private school for kindergarten and he is very well behaved, so well behaved. He will never be the problem child, but he wasn't learning anything because he's quiet.

Ela Richmond (04:49.998)  
Mmm.

Meg (04:51.176)  
So he would just like, he loved to look at books, but he wasn't reading them. He was just looking at books in the library and the cute, and she was adorable, the kindergarten teacher, but she was just like, oh good, this kid's not an issue. He's not a problem. He's not hard. And I was like, no, he's not, but he will drift away very quietly that you will forget that he's even in your class. So we did that whole year. Private schools are expensive. I'm pregnant during this time. I give birth while he is a kindergartner.

Ela Richmond (05:06.167)  
Hmm.

Meg (05:20.54)  
Plus you're putting in all your hours for the school. So that summer I just thought, I don't know that I want to keep this going. And homeschooling was still weird, right? We've all had that story that we have this like notion that just homeschoolers are weirdos. And so I was like, I don't know, maybe that summer I kind of played with the idea. So I did what most people do and you ask your friends or family, what do you, do you think I could do it? And I had enough negative comments, right? It's like, no, cause you have five kids.

Ela Richmond (05:36.632)  
He

Meg (05:50.636)  
Your oldest at that time was only five. So maybe he was six, but he was. Yes, I'm trying to think of the years they were born. I can't do the math that quick, but yeah, he was six when the fifth one was born.

Ela Richmond (05:53.485)  
Wow.

You had five under six?

Ela Richmond (06:07.446)  
Okay, you are a superhero. Let me just stop and say that.

Meg (06:11.464)  
Thanks, the better crazy, right? So then that summer I panicked and I ended up in re-enrolling them in the private school. So we now have a first grader, a kindergartner, a preschooler and two babies. And we live maybe 20 minutes away from the school. every day I know we'd moved in closer, but still like a 10, 15 minute drive. So every day I'm packing them up. My first graders there all day long. And then the kindergarten and preschooler were

different times of the day, plus these two babies that you're waking up and moving and you got to put everybody in the car seat, right? And it was so bad, not the school itself, but just the chaos of it. That sometimes for me to learn a lesson, it has to be really hard. Like I must be the person who has to touch the hot stove to know don't touch the hot stove. Yeah. And so it was so hard. And my cute little guy, he's six years old and I'm like, let's play games. Let's do this after school. And he was like, I can't.

Ela Richmond (06:55.576)  
Yeah.

Ela Richmond (06:59.394)  
Sometimes yes.

Meg (07:08.712)  
I'm emotionally exhausted because he's an introvert. And so when we started, so we, I pulled them everybody out and I was like, I guess we'll figure it out. And we literally got out pieces of paper, our first week of homeschool. And I was like, do you guys want to draw pictures? I guess we should practice some letters. And I had no idea what I was doing. A friend of mine had started homeschooling too. And she was like, well, I think you should teach them letters. I think you should teach them this. And so I just kind of.

Ela Richmond (07:10.908)  
my goodness.

Meg (07:38.14)  
found random books or random curriculum and we just would jump in and we started school right then and there and it was so funny because he was really learning. He had actually forgot how to read during that year of kindergarten and so we were starting over with him and a little monotone six five-year-old kids when they're learning to read like my name is Meg and that monotone really slow would put me to sleep every single day because I had

Ela Richmond (07:59.842)  
Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (08:06.595)  
no.

Meg (08:07.24)  
babies, right? And I was like, I can do this. I can stay awake, right? So our school was simple, a couple hours a day. The three kids, my three oldest kids, a lot of times I would lump them together and just teach. I can teach with a baby on me. I could teach while nursing. The toddler would just, we'd have some toys, let him run around. And we just went for it right then and there.

Ela Richmond (08:31.288)  
my goodness. Okay, so I'm extremely fascinated by how somebody does the whole number one, like having so many kids and then educating so many kids at home and balancing it all. You mentioned at the very beginning that you really had an emphasis on habits. So how did that transform your home? Like think back to before, was it the situation where was like you were taking care of everything, you were dropping everyone off at school, you were...

cleaning the house and cooking and doing everything. And then how did you integrate the habit aspect into your home and what has that transformation been like for your family?

Meg (09:08.456)  
Great question. So I think, like I said, it got too difficult to do things. And that's when I get to work. It's when something gets really hard. And so it started with laundry, because especially when you have toddlers who change their clothes three, four times a day, right, and piles just get bigger. And what was interesting is I didn't do it. I hadn't studied Charlotte Mason. I didn't even know who Charlotte Mason was. If you don't know who that is, I'd love to tell you about her. Right. But like,

I hadn't studied anything with habits. I'd never read a book. I don't even know if atomic havocs had been written yet, but I just realized like I was drowning and I need their help. And my husband every now and then would hire a cleaner for me, right? To just like get caught up, but nobody to do my laundry, nobody to cook our meals. And so it just became like, I realized those habits had to become our lifestyle of this is what we do.

This is who we are. This is what the Thomases do. And I didn't know I was unintentionally creating a very intentional family culture of children who know how to work, children who know how to take care of themselves. And it's evolved into, we call it the successful six that now before our kids graduate and leave the nest essentially is that they are proficient in skills with finances. They are proficient with skills with their emotions. So this could look like

Ela Richmond (10:29.196)  
This is huge.

Meg (10:30.928)  
So finances, so many different things with that, right? But like the basics of understanding finances, economics, reading a lot of really good books there, but even understanding credit. Do you want to utilize credit? A lot of our kids, we actually do have them get a credit card at 18 because we've already taught them how to track and how to not emotionally spend, which then goes into emotions of like how to navigate hard things when you're frustrated, how to take responsibility. So instead of you made me so mad.

Ela Richmond (10:33.41)  
Mm-hmm.

Meg (11:00.672)  
Can you imagine when you have seven kids, if they're all pointing fingers of, you made me so mad and you made me so upset of like, okay, this was maybe me. How do I do this? Right? So really learning those emotional skills, mentally learning how to push through hard things. So this could be mastering an instrument, pushing yourself academically. We actually put taking care of the home in mental as well. There's so many, like I think it's a Marine or Navy and Jordan Peterson talks about cleaning your room, making your bed every day.

Ela Richmond (11:02.019)  
Yeah.

Ela Richmond (11:29.954)  
Mm-hmm.

Meg (11:30.086)  
and what that does for you mentally. Physically, how to cook, clean, your hygiene, exercise, grocery shop, all these amazing things with physical, taking care of your physical health. Socially, how to be a good friend, how to interact with other people, but also taking that a step further of service instead of like, somebody fix this, somebody, this park is such a mess, somebody should come and clean it. I'm like, maybe I could clean it. Maybe if this is really bugging me, how do I fix this problem, right?

Ela Richmond (11:49.292)  
Mmm.

Meg (11:59.3)  
Even taking it a step beyond being a good friend, but being a good steward of your house, of your neighborhood, of your town, wherever you go. And then finally, spiritually, and even people I work with that don't necessarily belong to an organized religion, spiritually can still be meditation, nature, different things like that. For us, it would be God, right? But like spiritually having this strong foundation of what that looks like within your own home. So then when my kids,

Ela Richmond (12:06.754)  
Mmm.

Meg (12:28.378)  
are now I have four adult children and when they are moving out of the house, they could navigate these things. They knew how to cook for themselves, cleans for themselves. And it's not like they never had trials, right? Because they're human and they would experience hard things, but they also knew that they knew how to overcome it. So let's say they are, my one daughter moved out and she ended up going to Thailand to teach English when she was 18.

So as you can imagine, there was different girls who had different backgrounds and some of them would get catty or some of them would say like, you're an idiot or just call you a name or write. And so she's like, okay, how do I navigate this? I don't need to this personally, but like maybe I need a journal. Maybe I just need a good cry. Like, but just navigating all these skills. And I've just seen it like so much more than my kids like impressive. got college degrees young, but so much more that they have a high quality of life.

Ela Richmond (13:06.125)  
Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (13:22.862)  
I love this. I want to ask your question, your opinion on this though. So sometimes whenever you have a lot of kids, then it gets to a point where like the kids are taking on responsibility that they might not should be, you know, taking on. Like, and it seems like you've navigated this very well where you have given them responsibility that is appropriate for them, right? Like,

Meg (13:51.1)  
Yes.

Ela Richmond (13:51.19)  
appropriate for them in order to become fully functioning adults, in order to become the individuals that God created them to be, or they were supposed to be, hopefully, or like, how do you make sure that you are doing that as a parent? Because I feel like that's really difficult, is deciding, okay, what kind of responsibility is appropriate and correct for them as a child, right, as a member of our family?

as a member of this home community. Because, mean, and this is coming from a place of, I have seen in some instances where that goes wrong, where it's like the responsibility given to a child is actually not appropriate for the child. But I think that's a really important conversation to have, which is responsibility is so good for kids. They are so much more capable than we think they are. But what is that line in your mind between the

responsibility that is good and the responsibility that might not be great.

Meg (14:53.896)  
That's such a good question. Okay, so we do it in levels. We got, literally have it. It's called levels of high level. Right? So like, I wouldn't give, I have a seven year old, I have a bonus baby. So I wouldn't let my seven year old go and just cook on a stove, right? Or drive my car or like, hey, go grocery shopping champ or do all of these things. But we go in phases and we do these levels. And as they really get to the teenage years and they want liberties, right? So like you're an adult, you could go and drive your car.

Ela Richmond (14:58.251)  
I love this.

Meg (15:23.878)  
You could go to the store and get what you wanted, but you also have the understanding if you go and blow your whole paycheck, maybe you don't have enough for groceries or maybe then like if you go on big trips and you don't have the funds for it, right? Like you understand the work that goes into some of these liberties. And so too often I see people and parents give their kids all of these liberties. Like go do what you want. Go have this phone, go with your friends whenever you want without having to work for it.

I actually see more parents create entitled children. Like, well, I just get a phone because I'm 12. And I didn't have to work for it. I didn't have to do anything. But we understand as adults delayed gratification. So with a smaller child, I do more instant gratification, right? Like we clean your room, then we get the toys out. We finish our school, then we can go to the park. So much more immediate gratification. But as they enter these teenage years,

We actually work together. So if you're my kid and I want you to win, it's not me like, I'm going to give, I'm going to, going to bury you in all of this hard work, right? But instead I want you to win. So maybe you are 13 and you're like, mom, you know what I want? I want to be able to go to the mall with my friends with no adult. And you're like, that sounds so stinking fun. So we really need to make sure you're responsible. We need to make sure like whatever the things are in your family. If you're like,

you want to feel comfortable with that. So then you would go through the six things and saying, let's master some of these skills. So at the very beginning, it may be like just tracking your spending. That's one of our first things we have our teens do. So it's not even like a set goal of only spend 10 % of your income or only do like, it's not even managing it. It's just like, here's the skill. This is why lots of wise, like if you don't have a why throw it away until you get a strong why, right? Like tracking your spending.

can make you such a successful adult later in life. So then we literally create it with each child because emotionally you may have a child who cries at everything. Somebody looked at me wrong and they're gonna have a meltdown, right? Or another kid just like shoves all their feelings down and then explodes at everybody. So it's completely individualized, but I only do it if you've ever seen the analogy of a ladders when you're trying to...

Meg (17:48.264)  
climb the top, want the rungs as close together as possible, right? So if it's too far apart, you just can't reach it. So if you have a child who is really emotional and you're like, keep it together, champ, like that's your goal. That's way too hard for him. So it may be like, hey, when you're really upset, let's just practice journaling. Like you don't have to stop having this big tantrum, but like maybe practice you go into another space.

you do something so it's not like you're bad don't have this big explosive emotional thing but like let's just do one step and this is where you have to be careful that it's not about control that it's about how do i set you up to win right and so if you have a kid maybe socially that manipulates friends like well i'm not going to play with you if you don't do this game with me i'm not going to be your friend if you have to go home right i'm just like hey let me tell you

the road that that goes down. So if every time like dad comes home and I'd want to manipulate him, like how often is he going to want to really help me? But like, or a girlfriend or somebody that's my friend, right? Using myself as an example and then trying to teach them like this is why and it's not bad. You didn't know just like walking and you're falling like you're learning how to be a good friend. So just really studying small obtainable things and I have them work for a few months to really to make it a habit.

And once it's a habit, then they can have these liberties. Like one of my kids right now wants to earn to be like they have their regular bedtime. And, but March Madness is coming up or different events will be coming up and they want to stay late to pass their bedtime. And it's like, so first of all, let me explain to you why we have a bedtime because that was very unclear. Like you just are so mean to me. Like, why can't I just stay up? I want to, even though I'm 13, I should be able to stay up.

Ela Richmond (19:24.724)  
Mm-hmm

Mm.

Meg (19:39.794)  
till 11 o'clock every night, right? And it was like, well, let me explain to you with sleep and what sleep does to your brain and your growing. So let me explain these things. But also I hear you that you would really like this Liberty of when it's an important game, which we needed to clarify that not every game is an important game. But if it's a championship or if it's a playoff game, if it's whatever, just cause my kid loves sports, like, let me show you how you earn this. Just like if you want to buy a new car, you know how you're going to earn it.

And kids aren't always excited about it because we're asking him to put in the work and do delayed gratification. But I will tell you, like all four of my adult children were like, this changed my life. Even the ones that like while they were teenagers were like, this is so stupid. Just let me have it. Like, let me just have a phone. Let me just like take your car. Let me just do these things. And I was like, I get it. And as like an adult, I want the easy button too. I want the quick fix as well, but your life will be so much better.

Ela Richmond (20:36.588)  
Hmm.

Meg (20:37.54)  
if you learn these skills.

Ela Richmond (20:39.938)  
That is huge. How do you, so in between that, right, whenever they are young, something that I've seen at least in my own life and then also in some of my friends' lives is that like, if you are never taught how to want something and how to identify what you want personally, it makes it really hard in your future, right? So it seems that what you've done very, very successfully is help your children to understand, okay, this is...

what I want and this is what it's going to cost me and this is what I'm going to have to do in order to get it. Is that worth it? And like that is that is literally something that is so important for every adult to understand. And if you can teach your kids to understand it, the way that they go about life in the future seems to be a lot easier just because they understand that as like a basic concept. How do you teach your kids early on to identify what it is that they want and then to start seeing this like

this line between right choice to consequence to like, okay, this is how I get it cost, things like that.

Meg (21:41.296)  
Yeah, well some of them like some of them will want what their friends all have right and you get to decide like I don't want to do video games in my house like they're I've seen more negative effects from people with video games and I've seen positive effects. I don't think they're evil. I don't think if you have video games you're a terrible parent, but I know for myself it gets really easy to be like fine go ahead and play a little bit or like if they're begging every day and I don't know that I have the mental energy every day to say no like remember we own the

Thursdays or something. So I just don't want that extra fight. So sometimes what they want will take some practice of like what you're also comfortable with. And as you start doing this, they'll get better and better with it. But even like so one of my kids wanted a cell phone. And so but I said, but we don't start with smartphones. We start with a sweet big old brick Nokia phones that to text it's like 227742, you know, but like they have to learn really good skills and it actually forces them to call.

And so they are learning phone skills. so even though they're kind of annoyed, like we're going in baby steps, just like I'm going in baby steps as far as what I'm requiring of them. I'm giving them liberties and baby steps as well. So that just like you don't give a little kid keys to a car. Right. And when a kid is learning to drive, a parent has to be with them for like six months. Right. That they have to put in all this work for it. But it's I think then beyond that.

of what they want going after dreams and creating big things, I think the easiest way is to show them by you doing it. So if dad's doing stuff, if mom's doing stuff, because I see a lot of moms lose themselves and lose their own identity because I'm just a homeschool mom. But no, I also do Ironmans. this morning before, the reason I didn't get all the way ready is because I ran 16 miles this morning. And so like,

Like my kids are watching me go after big goals. Like I don't have the attention span to just sit like I've got to run and I've got to move my body. Right. And so, but they've they've watched that of like, and when I came in this morning and everybody asked 16 miles, how did it feel? Cause I haven't ran this long in 10 years. Right. Cause then I have half marathons and then half Ironmans. And so, but like,

Ela Richmond (23:36.95)  
You did not. This is incredible.

Ela Richmond (23:56.333)  
Really?

Meg (24:01.596)  
they are seeing me go after things and my husband goes after things, right? So he thinks I'm crazy for the endurance events, but he's going after things with his job and he is a huge dreamer and he goes to Africa and he wants to help people over there with power. And like, he's so lit up about just helping different people and like, he is so excited about that. So they're seeing dad create some of his things and he actually does a free men's workout twice a month.

Ela Richmond (24:28.502)  
This is awesome.

Meg (24:29.96)  
But he wants these like, because sometimes men don't get support groups, right? And so he wants men and dads to have this support group. So he has things. I'm going after visions and goals. I love travel. And so like, they've watched me sail up and then watched me learn about a place and study about a place. And then maybe I can, I'm in a financial place where I can take one kid, right? But like not all seven. But so they just, think when you are a big dreamer,

Ela Richmond (24:34.541)  
Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (24:53.102)  
Mm-hmm.

Meg (24:57.256)  
and not like huge, right? But like have a dream, have a goal. Then they start seeing like, oh, I can too. So my one daughter, then my oldest daughter, I've just had the two girls and the five boys. My oldest daughter, she got her associates at 16 through open ed, previously my tech. But she, so she got her associates through them and graduated at 16 and then she wanted to travel, but she's a minor, right? So then she and I worked together, like what if you nanny?

Ela Richmond (25:22.626)  
Mm-hmm.

Meg (25:26.108)  
What if you did something different? So maybe you can't just go travel because you are a minor. So we found a family that used to live in Utah with us that had moved to Puerto Rico and were looking for a nanny. And so she ended up nannying for them for three semesters. And then she was 18. So then she went to Thailand and taught English. And now she is serving a mission for a church in Texas and she'll come home. I don't know when this is getting released, but she's coming home in six days. So I'm so excited.

and then she'll leave for Nicaragua to go teach English. So she's found all these ways to travel without spending money.

Ela Richmond (26:03.916)  
Yeah, that's incredible. That's like, that is so incredible. How did you find that initial family? I know that people like, well, think about this. They'll throw out ideas and then like finding the thing or getting that initial door open is sometimes tough. How did y'all find that family initially?

Meg (26:10.184)  
minutes like.

Meg (26:20.744)  
I'm a great doer. I literally, it was a friend of ours. So we used to be in a co-op together years ago and she might've just posted in our co-op and said, hey, looking for somebody who'd be willing to come down to Puerto Rico and nanny for us that like, but they still homeschool. So they would love a homeschool person. And I said, well, my daughter is, she's still a minor, but.

Like she'd be good. So they actually flew her down and maybe just one other girl and interviewed them for a week and had them live with their family for a week. And they picked my daughter and yeah. there are so many families in Puerto Rico that like if she wanted to, I could have found way more. And I know a lot of times you have to be 18. So we just lucked out that we knew somebody, but like just ask around, post in Facebook groups.

Ela Richmond (26:57.73)  
Wow.

Meg (27:12.136)  
There's so many homeschool Facebook groups, right, have just like looking for experience for this type of thing, looking for this, anybody who want this help, right, and learning how to market yourself so she can be like, here are all my skills, I can cook and clean and I can take care of kids. And because she grew up in a house that was teaching her really solid habits, and so like she was really independent.

Ela Richmond (27:33.59)  
I love that. One of the things that I want to ask you before we get into the nitty gritty of the homeschool days and kind of what y'all do and your curriculum and just all that nitty gritty stuff day to day. I want to ask you about being a mom and a homeschool mom and just being like literally a woman. And it's interesting, as you mentioned that sometimes, you know, moms put so much into homeschool that they get to a point where they're like, OK, wait a second, who am I? Right.

And was actually talking to my aunt recently and she's a homeschool mom of four. And she was saying that like for a long time she compared herself to other homeschool moms, right? Where like she would be in groups and she'd be like, my gosh, these homeschool moms are doing phenomenal job in this way. And she was reading a book or listening to a podcast or something. And it was, it emphasized the fact that the goal is not to be a certain type of mom or homeschool mom or anything like that. It's to find.

the homeschool mom that you were meant to be, like to find the mom that you were meant to be and like to be that fully. And it sounds like you have done that very, very well where, you you've integrated your kids into your daily life and to-do's and home stuff and the way that you have built a culture in your home around goal setting and identifying the things that you want. It seems very much like everything that your family is started with you first knowing who you were.

and then kind of like creating a culture around that. Can you speak a little bit to that? Because I think that's really unique and I don't find that often, but that's really something I'm interested in. Just like from the lens of like, right, we talk about in open ed, every kid is unique, build an education that suits them. Well, every mom is unique, build a homeschool that suits you.

Meg (29:20.506)  
Yes. So when I started, I don't know that I knew who I was. Right. Like a lot of people think when you have a big family like you meant to, but only two of mine were planned. Right. Like a lot of birth control methods do not work. I wouldn't change it for the world. Right. But it's like, I love my big family and I wish I could have had one more with my little caboose, but it wasn't meant to be. But

I don't know that I knew who I was because you're still growing up yourself. I got married young and like got pregnant quickly after we were married. And so like you, just got thrown into motherhood of trying to navigate things and navigate my own past and heal from childhood trauma and, just all of these things. And so a lot of it, I was just learning right there with my kids. I think the biggest thing for me, because like through the process of homeschooling, I really learned who I was.

So I definitely like if anybody thinks you have to know first, you do not, you can just like do it as you're going. Oh, this is why I write stuff down and I just totally spaced what I was gonna say.

it left me. Oh I remember what it was. So like Facebook wasn't, I think it was invented but like nobody really had it yet. So we had Yahoo groups that were through emails and back then so I am, I don't know, young like mid-20s or something, late 20s and these moms were in their 40s now and saying like I'm done homeschooling and I'm so depressed and like I don't, I don't know what to do. I don't know like what to with myself. I've lost my whole self.

And so I remember reading that right in the beginning of my journey and saying, that will not be me. Like, I will always keep a hobby. I will always keep something that's mine. And so I actually started running after the birth of my second son. And so like, I would always have a running group. I would always have something that was mine. And so it wasn't a lot that like when you can imagine, right? When you have a lot of little kids, but like that was mine and my husband was so great.

Meg (31:23.984)  
Like Saturday mornings were just mine. Everybody knew they were just mine. And so, like, I just knew that you can get depressed so easy. And so I don't know that I knew exactly who I was, but I knew I needed to make myself still a priority and still not like, then don't ever homeschool, right? Because like, I'm going to go to the spa every day now and get my nails done or whatever, right? But like, I had something always for me. And

Now that I just have the three kids left at home, I did still have a little bit of a week. My husband says I need to call it the midlife transition, but like that midlife, the switch, right? Where I don't have all these fingernails to clip and I don't have anybody that I help with the bathroom anymore. And I don't have physical demands of little children. And it's this transition to more adult children now of still having something for me that helped me get through that so that I didn't end up like these moms who were really depressed.

who resented their kids, like I did everything and now you're all getting married and leaving the house and now I'm just alone and I don't know what to do with myself. And so I think knowing that and I wanted to avoid it, that through the homeschooling experience, I always kept something for me.

Ela Richmond (32:40.332)  
Yeah, that's really smart and really incredible. I do think that's a good idea to have, like, what is the thing that I want for myself? And that is like, I would find myself more resonating with you where it's like, I need to do something physical, like I need to go run. But there are so many different outlets and ways to expand your creativity, whether it's like music or art or literally anything, just like the personal expression of you.

Meg (32:40.614)  
Yeah, that's it.

Ela Richmond (33:09.966)  
in the world. I think that's so important and valuable. I want to kind of switch gears here a little bit. We've talked a lot about like philosophy and the ideas and being a mom. Now, can you explain and paint for me like what a day in your life looks like? I know that obviously with different children it looks different, but what about is the way that you like to homeschool?

Meg (33:34.578)  
So currently, so right now it feels so easy. I know like maybe new people are like, you're crazy, but like I am wrapping up my 17th year of homeschooling. So it's not my first time, right? It's not my first rodeo. I have three kids left at home that are still homeschoolers. My daughter is 16 and she will be 17 soon and she would be a junior.

Ela Richmond (33:36.94)  
Yes.

Ehehe

Meg (34:00.806)  
She is in her second year of college through open ed through Southern New Hampshire University. So she does everything completely independent because independence is a big thing I have focused on with like these levels of liberty, right? And teaching them responsibility. I don't like, I'm mostly just I'm checking how are things going versus like me sitting down and like, did you do your school? Because like I said, independence has been a big thing. She is, she does that. And then I am.

Ela Richmond (34:25.516)  
Mm-hmm.

Meg (34:30.096)  
She does, it's called independent education program now, I think, but she does speech debate through them and mock trial. And so those are like her favorite things that she's way into. And that's why I've really liked Southern New Hampshire University. I'm just going to call it SNHU going forward, but like I really liked it because it allows her to take these other classes that she wants. And then she just works one full day a week. So then she has plenty of money, right? And can still hang out with friends. And so her school is completely by herself. So sometimes it's like, yeah, we do live in the

Ela Richmond (34:34.157)  
Mm-hmm.

Meg (34:59.954)  
same house. How are you honey? And then I have a son who would be eighth grade and his school is also really independent. And so like I like my kids to be independent with their work. So with him, he doesn't do any group subjects with us anymore, but I just check. We just go four times a week. We always have. I don't know why, how we got into the habit of that. Probably with a co-op Friday fun class years ago. And then we just kept Monday through Thursday as our schedule.

So I just check his school. So he likes to do two math pages a day. I don't know why he thinks it's fun. So I check his math. We do some language arts together. I'm really big on narrations. So whatever books he read the day before, he's telling me about it. He had to write something about each of the books. He does like a vocabulary book, a word roots book, right? So whatever he did the day before, I'm just now checking it and we call it Minute with Mom. And then I have my seven year old. He would be second grade and

We're like 30 minutes, maybe even less sometimes, sometimes a little bit over because it's just the one kid a lot of times that I'm homeschooling that it's pretty quick and we do all of his stuff together. so a lot of times with our school, if I'm doing like the full day exercises, a big part of our family culture, right? And so, we'll maybe work out together or like they may work out or dad will go workout. Right. So just some exercise in the morning. And then we do scripture studies of family.

eat breakfast, we do our chores, and then we start school around 10 a.m. because we can now. Whereas before when I had a lot more, we did need to start maybe by nine. So we start about 10 and then we're done all the way. As far as me teaching by 1130 ish noon, we eat lunch together and then afternoons they have some classes that they can do. We can just go and relax. Maybe go grocery shopping. And but my two teens are

all the way independent. So they just make sure they're staying on top of their stuff. And I'm just kind of making sure that they are a seven year old, one kid, we can get done really fast. And so it's like life is school, right? And so sometimes he gets to travel with dad or sometimes he gets to go do fun things like that, or we will utilize national parks and go learn about all the rocks there and do some really fun stuff with that. So it really is doable.

Ela Richmond (36:59.074)  
Mm-hmm.

Meg (37:19.784)  
to do a really good education in a lot less time than people think.

Ela Richmond (37:26.382)  
Yeah, that's incredible. So when your kids were younger, and I mean, even now, like how would you explain what they're doing? It's like, do you outline the subjects and then say, okay, this is how we're going to check the box for these subjects. And then this is where we're going to have the community portion. And this is, do you use online kind of resources too? How do you think about their education whenever it comes to structuring it?

Meg (37:50.832)  
I really like to, when they're younger, I just tell them that this is what we're doing, right? Like they don't even know possibilities and it's too many choices to be like, anything in history you want to learn about, right? Like, I don't know. So like I am more with a younger kid. We've always done subject of the day. like arts are one day. My daughter who is coming home, we're going to go on a big trip to Europe. So I thought it would be fun to learn about all those countries with...

youngest son so we've been learning a lot about the different countries that my other daughter and I will be going to. So like that's been our history. He loves history because it's probably my favorite subject. Science we've been utilizing through OpenEd there's Generation Genius as a homeroom source so we like Generation Genius. We have Kiwi Crate so we have a lot of fun stuff like that for science. We do the arts one day.

Life skills a lot of times are one day where we're like, really get into a different skill we want to master and to know. And it could be even for my youngest guys, like this is our address. These are mom and dad cell numbers. How do you tie shoes? Right? Like, so some really good basic stuff as far as that. But as they get older, I really just navigate with them and work with them. What do they want? Cause my daughter who's 16 at one point she's like, I just want to do, like she was just loving all the books we were studying and reading and

Like, this is so dreamy. This is so fun. I think I just want to do that with you always. And then she got about ninth grade and she goes, actually, I think I want a degree and I want like, I think I'll start college for 10th grade. And I was like, what? Like I wasn't ready for you to go. Right. So, cause she and I were having so much fun. And so I just individualize it for every kid. My eighth grader wanted to try SNU for ninth grade. And I said, can we, cause one of my other kids did started in ninth grade.

And it was a lot harder for him than my kids who waited till 10th or 11th. And so with this guy, just said, like, it is your choice, but let me just explain to you how much harder it was for your brother that did it at this age. And I said, I would rather spend the year and get really good at essay writing and really good at some of these things that I know are in this program. And so, and then just keep doing what he and I are doing. And he goes, okay, like that's a good plan. like, I know he wants to do SNU and I just said, just give it one more year.

Meg (40:05.916)  
Like I will support you, but I think you should wait. And he agreed. So as of now, like, right. So I just, I'm always working with them, especially the teenage years. And I think that's where a lot of people really struggle because with the little kids, you can just control what you're learning. Right. Like my son wouldn't have picked like, let's study Hungary. Let's study about the emperor, Sisi. Like Sisi, let's do, you know what I mean? But I'm like, this is so amazing. This is so fun. Like, let's just learn all of these fun things. But as they get older than parents, like

Ela Richmond (40:14.422)  
Yeah.

Ela Richmond (40:22.402)  
Mm-hmm.

Meg (40:35.228)  
want to hold on to that. And I get it because those younger years are so fun and just so dreamy and those relationships that you're creating. And it's really those Instagram and Pinterest worthy posts, right? Where it's just so pretty and dreamy and like we read poetry out in the hammocks today and then your 13 year olds was like, I'm good. Like I do not want to do that. And so kind of letting go of some of that control and saying, okay, we are going to study language arts. What like, what do you want to learn about?

How much do you love it? Because one of my daughters loved a more intense language arts program and my sons were like, shoot me now, like, please don't make me do this program. So we're like, we simplified one. Like I said, my 13 year old really likes math. So we just two math pages a day. Another kid hated math. So we did a much more simpler program. So really, really individualizing every kid's education of just kind of like, they know math, they can read, they're learning history. We love geography.

which maybe that's weird, I don't know, but we love geography. And so just a lot of fun, but a lot of it really is just like making all of life learning. So you kind of feel like you're checking all the boxes. Like, yes, we're doing structured math and structured, whatever, but like having conversations because I have mostly old kids, like political conversations, like what's going on in the world right now? What is Doge? What are all these things that they're talking about, right? And just like having these types of conversations and just answering questions.

I'm trying to think what my seven year old just asked the other day as we were driving of just like, what do you think about? I know one time he asked my husband, would you say you enjoy being an entrepreneur? Is that the enjoyable career for you? Right. And so, but just talking and having conversations. And if you have little kids, they ask a thousand questions a day, if not more. I actually started doing school with my phone by me for chat GPT. So many of my kids were like, well, why?

Ela Richmond (42:27.502)  
Meg (42:31.908)  
why is it this way? Why is it that way? And I thought, I do not know. So like my phone is right here, like beep, boop. Like now you know. So that they can learn like, we can know anything we want. We're not tied down to like, well, we picked this curriculum, we have to stay with it, but we can go off on tangents. You can utilize really fun YouTube history videos, right? Tons of fun science videos online. So I don't like.

my kids to just be on a computer without an adult. So I don't let them just go on YouTube by themselves. But as a family, we'll cast it on a computer, maybe watch it. And then as they become teens, really start teaching them responsibility with a computer, the positive parts, the parts to avoid. I don't utilize, obviously, SNU for my college daughter. And then for my son, he just has a couple of programs online.

Ela Richmond (43:14.637)  
Yeah.

Ela Richmond (43:22.732)  
Yeah, that's awesome. And I love your emphasis on asking, what do you love? that is such, I mean, even as an adult, like that is such a good indicator of what I should continue doing and what I should do less of or what I should rethink. Like how am I approaching this is just what is draining your energy and what is giving you energy. And that's, that is such a good path.

Meg (43:45.33)  
There's a really great book called The Lazy Genius. And she talks about like, it's not about doing more or less for doing what you love, right? So like you talked about the comparison, right? So maybe somebody's like, my gosh, Meg does all of these crazy things. Like I must have to do all these things. And I think, no, you don't. Like I am not super, I will never be the cute flowery mom that like has the chalkboard where I drew it.

Ela Richmond (43:48.193)  
Mmm.

Ela Richmond (43:53.869)  
Mm.

Meg (44:12.24)  
at that morning and I think those are so beautiful so I'm not teasing but like where they're like this beautiful poetry and it's so inspiring it is not my strength right but like I can make anything fun and I can make anything silly and so instead of like I have to be like somebody else or or Meg really likes this subject if you don't let it go right

Ela Richmond (44:36.654)  
Yeah, that's awesome. My last question for you and then I'll hit you with a couple of rapid fire questions. So what have you found is valuable about open ed? Like why did you decide initially to do it and then kind of like going through it? What is valuable for you as you've done it? Just because you're a parent in the program and you are also an incredible homeschool mom and it seems to be something that exists. It coexists like with the way that you are doing what you are doing. And that's exactly what we want it to be is.

We don't want it to be something where people have to change what they're doing. We want it to be so flexible to the way that you are going about your education. Yeah, and I would love to hear that from your perspective.

Meg (45:17.64)  
Yeah, so I don't remember where I heard about it. I know some of my friends that utilized it for funding and for me that felt like too much work. By this time I had seven kids, right? And I just felt like one more sister to figure out and I thought I don't have the bandwidth, so we're just gonna make homeschool really inexpensive. But when my second son probably was in 10th grade and he was trying lumen and he just wasn't loving it, I thought he would like the in class experience and it actually drained him.

Ela Richmond (45:27.489)  
Yeah.

Meg (45:46.34)  
And he was like, this is so long. Like to just sit there all day was killing him. So somebody told us about it. And so we enrolled him and my next daughter in 2019 and they started the 2019, 2020 year. And we utilized it for college, right? Because college can be so expensive and put you into thousands of dollars of debt. And so we did it because OpenEd does a direct payment.

to the university and so I didn't even have to worry about it. Like I actually didn't even have to get reimbursed, right? Because it was a direct payment and to me that was like, this makes sense. I really liked this new program because it was very homeschool-ish for me where it was self-led, competency-based, so no grades, because my kids didn't even know what grades were, right? And so it was like, hey, you didn't master this, let's try again.

And then they had, I don't even remember what her name is, but who their cute girl was that was their weekly check-in. And she was so amazing. Maybe, is it Emmeline? Maybe, I don't know. I just know she was so, so sweet. And so they would have weekly emails and so they had somebody in OpenEd that actually was checking in with my kids. Like, how are we doing? So not just your weekly sentences you turn in, right? Like this is what I did, but somebody that actually

for SNU was like, you have any questions? And I even did, excuse me, Zoom calls if you didn't understand anything. So they wanted your kid to succeed as much as you did and really, really helping them. And so my oldest son did it, then my daughter did it, then the next kid did it. And it was interesting because I said, what this does for you is it gives you a leg up.

So when other kids are graduating from high school and you are both maybe trying to get just a basic job, you get to put on your resume or application that you are a college graduate. And I know it's your associates and kids could work hard and get a bachelor's within high school, but at least on there you can put your in college. And it was crazy because my one son was 15 and so he needed a job and he can go work in the daytime because it's not set class hours so they could do it in the evenings.

Meg (48:00.718)  
And so he got a job and they didn't even realize he was so young because he put like, I'm in college. He's tall. My husband's really tall. So he was over six feet. He could work days. And so it just like, it's opened up so many opportunities for them and just it's really helped them in so many different areas to have that. And they did it without any debt. Right. And so to me, that was a no brainer.

Ela Richmond (48:22.38)  
That's huge. Yeah, that is so huge. I love hearing that, because it's such a unique way to use the program. I know that there are lots of homeschool families that like, sometimes they look at the program and they say, depending on their values and how long they've been homeschooling, like the question is, how can this be valuable for me? And I think that's really a unique way to use it is, okay, like if you're in high school and we offer the program in high school,

maybe this is a different opportunity that you didn't think about because I mean, to be quite honest, like when it comes to building an open education, nobody knows what their opportunities are, right? It's like, what could I possibly do? There's this idea of what school has to look like and what school should look like and what you should be doing, you know, by 15 years old. But like the fact that you can personalize it to that degree where if you want to do college classes, you can. My littlest brother is 17 now and

Like he's looking at the associate's degree and he's like, he got some advice from some of my friends who were like, you know, as an engineer, cause he wants to be an engineer, he also did alternative education and that's been super big for him. But as an engineer, all of your basic classes are so basic. They're weed out classes and you don't have too much interaction with a professor.

Like it's very basic, try and get those out as much as possible if you can. And like he's taking that to heart and he's like, okay, I'm gonna try and do as much as I can so that when I get to school, I can focus on the classes that really matter and like I can be ahead of everybody else. And he gets so excited by that. But like truly, even in high school, even early on, like you can personalize it to whatever degree you want. And if it matches with your goals, like why not?

Meg (50:10.47)  
Yeah, I just love giving my kids that leg up because once you have a college degree, like people don't care if you have a high school degree, right? Like a high school diploma. And so my kids, other than my oldest, have no high school diploma. And so when they are applying for a job or whatever, they can just put college because once you have that, nobody cares that you don't have transcripts, that you don't have all of these things. And when they, when they've applied for colleges, they just come in as a transfer student. And so it's been really

Ela Richmond (50:39.768)  
That's so smart. Yeah, that's so smart. Okay, my last rapid fire question for you. What is the best piece of advice that you have for new homeschool families?

Meg (50:50.194)  
So relax, really relax. But I love thinking into three different steps of focusing on the heart. So connection and building a relationship with your child. Because if you guys have a crappy relationship, homeschool will be hard. Like part of the reason our homeschool is fun and easy is because we focused on relationships. So focusing on that heart piece and connection because children are inclined to listen and follow and obey when they feel safe with you, loved with you and like.

first thing heart. The next one is habits, right? Building those strong habits so that a lot of times people are like, well, we can never get to school because my kids are still in their pajamas and they're like, it's just a mess. My house is a mess. can't like, I can't even think right because it's all crazy. So like, but then they don't listen to me to do the habits. And that's why I say heart first. So like I'm guiding you, I'm leading you. I'm the master with my sheep, right? Like the shepherd is my sheep. Like that they just follow me. Like this is what we're doing.

So that heart piece, the habit piece, and then that home piece of like the creating this culture. We are a family that does school. We are a family that does like that loves learning. We all of these things. And if you don't mind me, this is my favorite quote about culture. And I've adapted it from the book, How Will You Measure Your Life? So I'm gonna just change it to how I've adapted it. So now the children, so this is when like you have a home working, right?

Now the children don't even need to ask how to behave, how to make decisions or how to make this trade off against that one. So like, do I do my school or do I just go play, right? Because your family in many ways is a self-managing family thanks to its culture. Parents don't need to dive into the details of every decision because the culture almost as an agent of management is present in the details of every decision. So when you have those three things functioning, heart, habits, home.

School is just another extension of your family. Like, of course we read books, of course we study, of course we finish things that we started because that is the culture that we have intentionally created in our home.

Ela Richmond (53:00.622)
