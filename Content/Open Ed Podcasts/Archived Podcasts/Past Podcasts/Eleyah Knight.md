## Why should we learn this?

  

_Text post on socials plus newsletter plus clip. I think this works in every format._

  

# Potential Twitter Thread

1/7 Ever wonder why so many kids hate math and writing?

It's not the subjects - it's how we teach them.

The secret to effective learning isn't more worksheets or stricter methods.

It's about making it REAL.

2/7 Here's what's broken in our education system (public AND charter):

We teach subjects in isolation

Kids can't see the practical application

Students keep asking "When will I ever use this?"

Result? Completely disengaged learners

3/7 The solution is stupidly simple:

Connect learning to real life.

Show practical applications.

Let students drive their interests.

Make it fun (yes, learning can be fun!)

4/7 Real example:

Building garden beds teaches:

- Measurement
- Basic geometry
- Problem solving
- Project planning

No textbooks needed. Just real-world application.

5/7 Writing? Same thing.

Instead of forcing boring essays:

- Let them tell their stories
- Encourage investigations
- Write about their passions
- Use humor (teens love this!)

6/7 The magic happens when students:

1. See immediate value
2. Connect skills to their interests
3. Apply knowledge in real-time
4. Have fun while learning

This isn't rocket science. It's just common sense.

7/7 Stop making kids hate learning.

Start showing them why these skills matter.

Education should open doors, not close minds.

When you make it real, they'll want to learn.

That's the secret.

# Linkedin

Want to know the secret to effective learning? Stop teaching subjects in isolation.

A major problem in our education system is that we teach subjects without context. Students constantly ask "When will I ever use this?"

And they're right to ask.

When math is just numbers on a page, it creates stress and resistance. But when those same numbers help build a garden bed or solve a real problem, students engage naturally.

The same goes for writing. Students reject traditional essays but light up when writing about their passions or crafting humor pieces.

This is why career exploration is so powerful in education. When students see how professionals use math, writing, and other skills in careers they're interested in, the learning becomes meaningful.

The key isn't teaching the subject - it's showing its application in the real world.

Think about it: A teenager measuring and building a garden bed will learn more about geometry than from memorizing formulas.

A student investigating a topic they're passionate about will develop better writing skills than through assigned book reports.

The solution is simple but profound:

Make it relevant.  
Make it practical.  
Make it personal.

Because when learning connects to real life, you don't have to force it - it happens naturally.

The question isn't whether students can learn. The question is: are we teaching in a way that makes them want to?

# Unlocking Effective Learning: The Secret to Engaging Education

Eleyah: ~~~Those who are like, I'm looking at numbers and I'm stressed out.~~~

~~~Like, obviously they're not going to, they're going to have struggles with learning it. So the key to it, ~[00:00:00]~~ the key to any sort of learning is how do you make it more interesting? How do you make it more applicable? And that's what's driven me crazy more than anything else in the public school systems. Is that or any sort of like, you know, I mean, it's not just honestly, a lot of charter schools are this way too, when it comes to like, oh, these are the subjects and this is how you're going to learn them, you know, it's just like, well, This child or the student needs to see how they're going to use it.

Otherwise, they're going to be like, what is the point? And that's what I hear the most out of my kids or, you know, other kids in general, is that like, I don't want to learn about this because I'm not going to use this. However, when we're able to apply real math skills to what we're doing, like for example, we're building our own garden beds right now, we have to understand some basic concepts of math for measurements.

Um, and then for, in order to like make sure that they're set up correctly, we're going to have to apply these, these like very simple, but very practical math skills. And then, you know, when [00:01:00] it comes to like, again, the career exploration aspect, when they're like interested in something, you know, that we see people doing, um, then they, then that's when we can bring up, okay, well, How are we going to use math for this?

Or how are we going to use writing for this? Writing is another thing that I've noticed a lot of my students just like, don't want to be into. They're just like, oh, this is boring, this is boring, I don't want to, you know, write. But when they get to deliver their own story, or when they get to do an investigation, when they get to write about something that they're passionate about or that they think is funny, like, humor is a huge way to get through to teens.

~~~I had them write letters the other day for this, um, project that this, um, that the library had posted out about, um, what kind of organ do you envision or what kind of organ do you want to see?~~~

### The School Bus That Actually Goes Places

While some dream of disrupting education with AI and virtual reality, Eleyah had a simpler idea: a 14-passenger van.

Her "adventure school" is redefining what a classroom looks like. The weekly schedule reads like a choose-your-own-adventure book:

**Mondays:** Cooking, nutrition, and natural medicine (plus PE)**Tuesdays:** Coding and theater**Fridays:** Guest workshops and field trips based on student interests

But here's what makes this more than just a cool story – it's part of a growing movement. Across the country, educators are breaking free from traditional classroom walls:

- Forest schools are popping up in public parks
- Sailing families are "worldschooling" their kids
- Micro-schools are operating out of community centers
- Adventure learning programs are turning national parks into classrooms

The message? You can cover every subject in the standard curriculum while making it relevant to the modern world. As Eleyah puts it: "The sky's the limit."

The most powerful part? Students aren't just passengers on this educational journey – they're co-pilots, making real contributions to their own learning experience.

# Turning a 14-Passenger Van into an Adventure School

Eleyah: [00:00:00] I decided I'm going to buy a van that fits up to 14 passengers and I'm going to make this like an adventure school. I'm going to make this a real life skill building opportunity. for teens between the ages of 12 and 18, um, a way that they can get out in the community and learn what's going on, see different career options, as well as, um, participate in what I'm best at, which is natural medicine and natural health.

And so on Mondays we do cooking and we learn about nutrition and sometimes we'll make natural medicine and we do PE as well. Um, And then our, our Tuesday classes are based around, um, we have a coding teacher that comes out, so they are on the computer a little bit for that. We also do theater and sometimes we'll throw in science and other activities in there.

Our Tuesdays are pretty flexible. We always have some sort of a lesson. Typically this year it's been theater. Last year it was more science based. And then on Fridays we [00:01:00] do guest teacher workshops or field trips, and those can be very diverse. There, a lot of them are based on the kid's interests or what, um, what we have available in our community or anything that I feel could really help them in their development.

And so like the sky's the limit. So basically you can cover every subject that they cover in public school, but do it in your own unique way and with the resources available to you and with what's relevant in the modern world that you live in.~ And so that's what's most empowering is that the kids feel like they can do it.~

~actually make changes and contributions to their own education and their own experience.~

### 💭 THOUGHT

### Let Kids Be Kids (While They Still Can)

"Your kid's 18, working at Pizza Hut, sharing an apartment... not living the dream you had for them."

When we hear this scenario, many parents feel a knot in their stomach. But let's ask a different question:

Are they happy? Healthy? Self-sufficient?

In our rush to prepare children for adulthood, we sometimes forget to let them be children. We pack their schedules with enrichment activities, test prep, and advanced courses - all in pursuit of some future "success."

But what if the most successful thing we could do is give them time to bloom?

Think about it: How many 30-somethings do you know battling chronic stress because they never learned to listen to their bodies? How many are stuck in careers they chose at 18 because they never had time to explore their real passions?

The irony is clear: In our hurry to prepare kids for adulthood, we might be setting them up for an adulthood of playing catch-up with their childhood.

Maybe success isn't about rushing to the finish line. Maybe it's about giving our children enough space to figure out who they are before they have to decide who they'll become.

# Redefining Success: What Truly Matters for Our Kids?

Eleyah: ~~~And is given more options and, but with structure, like I said, discipline and options, then they have time to bloom, like fully bloom.~~~

~~~Um, ~[00:00:00]~~ we might see, you know, it's, it is, it's rare it happens when you have these young geniuses who go on and like they start businesses right out of high school. You know, maybe they go to like Harvard or something and they're just incredible people and like, how many of us like want our kids to be like that?

Of course we do, of course. Who, who would honestly be like, no, I don't want my kid to be like that. But does that, what really matters in the long run? So your kid's 18, 19, 20 working at Pizza Hut, whatever, you know, maybe, maybe he, uh, rents a room with, in an apartment with another teen or whatever, and it's not, you're not, they're not, you're not living the dream that you want for them.

The most important thing we can ask is like, is the child or the team, the young adult. The new adult. Are they happy? Are they healthy? Are they provided for? Can they take care of themselves? Are they self sufficient? Do they, well, you know, if you can address these things growing up, if you can focus on a [00:01:00] young person's holistic health while they're young, then you're not gonna have to, they're not gonna be in their 30s with chronic diseases You You know, being like, what happened to my, I never got to fully live my childhood cause I was so busy trying to be an adult.

Or they're going to be, you know, feeling like, like maybe they rushed through things too much or feeling like, Oh, you know, I don't know if this is what I really want to do. Or, um, There can be a lot of things that people don't examine when they're young that haunts them later in life and that's just what we see repetitively.

    💡 And when it comes to writing? It’s all about **making it personal.**

    - Sailing families are "worldschooling" their kids
    - Micro-schools are operating out of community centers
    - Adventure learning programs are turning national parks into classrooms
    
    The message? You can cover every subject in the standard curriculum while making it relevant to the modern world. As Eleyah puts it: "The sky's the limit."
    
    The most powerful part? Students aren't just passengers on this educational journey – they're co-pilots, making real contributions to their own learning experience.

    # Turning a 14-Passenger Van into an Adventure School
    
    Eleyah: [00:00:00] I decided I'm going to buy a van that fits up to 14 passengers and I'm going to make this like an adventure school. I'm going to make this a real life skill building opportunity. for teens between the ages of 12 and 18, um, a way that they can get out in the community and learn what's going on, see different career options, as well as, um, participate in what I'm best at, which is natural medicine and natural health.
    
    And so on Mondays we do cooking and we learn about nutrition and sometimes we'll make natural medicine and we do PE as well. Um, And then our, our Tuesday classes are based around, um, we have a coding teacher that comes out, so they are on the computer a little bit for that. We also do theater and sometimes we'll throw in science and other activities in there.
    
    Our Tuesdays are pretty flexible. We always have some sort of a lesson. Typically this year it's been theater. Last year it was more science based. And then on Fridays we [00:01:00] do guest teacher workshops or field trips, and those can be very diverse. There, a lot of them are based on the kid's interests or what, um, what we have available in our community or anything that I feel could really help them in their development.
    
    And so like the sky's the limit. So basically you can cover every subject that they cover in public school, but do it in your own unique way and with the resources available to you and with what's relevant in the modern world that you live in.~ And so that's what's most empowering is that the kids feel like they can do it.~
    
    ~actually make changes and contributions to their own education and their own experience.~

    🚐 **"I bought a 14-passenger van… and turned it into a school."**
    
    Traditional education wasn’t working for my kids—or for so many teens who needed something different. So I decided to build my own solution:
    
    ✅ **A real-life, skill-building adventure school for teens (12-18)**
    
    ✅ **Hands-on learning through community exploration & career exposure**
    
    ✅ **A focus on natural medicine, nutrition, and practical skills**
    
    📚 **Our week looks nothing like a standard school schedule:**
    
    🔥 **Mondays** → Cooking, nutrition, natural medicine & PE
    
    💻 **Tuesdays** → Coding, theater, science, and flexible lessons
    
    🎒 **Fridays** → Guest teacher workshops & field trips
    
    The best part? **We cover everything public school does—but in a way that’s relevant to real life.**
    
    No rigid classrooms. No one-size-fits-all learning. Just **engaging, hands-on education that prepares teens for the world.**
    
    🚀 **The future of education isn’t standardized—it’s personalized.**
    
- Let kids be kids for a while
    
    💡 **"The real measure of success isn’t grades or career paths—it’s well-being."**
    
    We push kids to perform, achieve, and plan for the future—but how often do we ask the most important questions?
    
    ✅ **Are they happy?**
    
    ✅ **Are they healthy?**
    
    ✅ **Are they provided for?**
    
    ✅ **Can they take care of themselves?**
    
    ✅ **Do they feel fulfilled?**
    
    If we focus on **holistic health** while kids are young, we set them up for lifelong success—not just academically, but emotionally and physically too.
    
    Too many adults hit their 30s wondering: _What happened to my childhood? Why am I so burned out? Did I rush into a life I don’t actually want?_
    
    🚀 The goal of education isn’t just to produce workers—it’s to raise **self-sufficient, thriving humans.**
    
    Let’s start focusing on **what really matters.**

### A Natural Parent's Rebellion Against Traditional School [00:00]

**Ela Richmond:** Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm Ela Richmond and today I have on Aleya Knight. Thank you for being here.

**Aleya:** Thank you for having me.

**Ela:** You're a mom of two who's recently started a microschool. Today we'll be exploring your journey through open education, your beliefs about it, and this microschool you've started as a concerned and interested parent. I'd love to give everyone some context into what you've discovered. Where did your educational journey with your kids begin? Did they start in public school, and what does a day in their life look like now?

**Aleya:** I was a new single mom when they were very young. My son started kindergarten in public school, while my daughter began with homeschooling. This was because in California, Senate Bill 277 was being implemented, requiring mandatory vaccinations. As a natural parent who specifically went to Chinese medicine school to be more of a natural doctor for my kids, I chose not to vaccinate.

I decided to homeschool them during my final year of grad school since there weren't other options. Fortunately, I found a program that funded excellent nature-based classes in our community. Santa Cruz was wonderful for that, offering many options at the time.

Years later, when lockdown hit and the only schooling option was online learning, I knew that wouldn't work for us, like many parents realized. We joined local homeschool groups, but none quite fit long-term. There was often disorganization, confusion, and unfortunately, even instances of bullying that weren't properly addressed.

When my son was approaching high school age, I felt increasing pressure to take action. I asked myself what I could do as a single mom with limited resources to create options not just for my own kids, but for others in similar situations. Since I run my own private practice with flexible hours, I realized I could make this work.

This led me to an important decision in September 2023: I purchased a 14-passenger van to create what I envisioned as an adventure school. I wanted to build a real-life skill-building program for teens between 12 and 18, where they could engage with their community, explore different career options, and learn about natural medicine and health – my area of expertise.

### How a 14-Passenger Van Revolutionized Teen Education [02:57]

**Aleya:** On Mondays, we focus on cooking, nutrition, natural medicine, and physical education. Tuesdays incorporate coding with a specialized teacher, along with theater and various supplementary activities - it's our flexible day. We had more science-based activities last year, but this year we're emphasizing theater. Fridays are dedicated to guest teacher workshops or field trips, which we design around the students' interests and what our community offers.

The beauty is that we cover every traditional subject you'd find in public school, but we do it in ways that are relevant to modern life and use the resources available to us. What's most empowering is that the students actively participate in shaping their educational experience.

I've seen this approach help them develop a strong sense of identity and confidence naturally, without the overwhelming influence of media, political agendas, or the intense peer pressure you find in traditional schools with hundreds or thousands of students.

### "I've Bred Some Rebels" - When Kids Question Everything [06:19]

**Aleya:** I can definitely say I've bred some rebels! My kids question everything, including authority - and yes, that includes questioning me, which is great. They've become powerful critical thinkers.

Of course, being 13 and 15, they still face typical teenage challenges with ethics, respect, and learning to communicate with adults. My daughter, in particular, has always struggled in traditional school settings because of her critical thinking mindset. If a teacher tells her to do something that doesn't feel right to her, she won't do it.

What's been remarkable is watching the growth in confidence among all our students over the past year and a half. Some students started out uncertain about their abilities, but by the end of last year, they were diving into activities wholeheartedly, without that initial hesitation of "I don't know if I can do this."

The small group setting has been transformative - it becomes like a family and builds deep trust. We establish clear class agreements at the beginning of the year and before new units, setting explicit expectations for each other. If issues arise, we have the framework to communicate clearly and ensure everyone feels comfortable and heard.

This is radically different from an authoritative system that rigidly dictates "this is how it's done." In our environment, students can say, "I want to do things this way," and if they express it reasonably and respectfully, we can make it happen. Of course, if someone acts disrespectfully, they experience natural consequences, but that's part of the learning process too.

### The Magic of Micro-Communities in Learning [07:59]

**Aleya:** Overall, what I've noticed is that they work together remarkably well. When someone's not comfortable with an activity, we find ways to adapt it so they can participate in their own way. This is completely different from an institutionalized system where there's only one way to do things.

Each student has different abilities and needs, different talents they want to explore. I believe one of the best things we can do as teachers - and this comes from a book we're reading called "My Ishmael" - is to be what's called a maieutic teacher. This is someone who inspires children to want to learn for themselves and helps bring out their natural talents, rather than forcing them to believe specific things.

While it's important to show children how things work in the world and in nature, it's equally crucial to keep them open to asking questions and exploring new possibilities. That's what we're here for as human beings - to evolve, to explore possibilities, and to understand that we don't have all the answers. A huge part of teaching is learning alongside these kids.

The more we can bring out the truths naturally within everybody, the more we can find solutions to problems that keep repeating throughout history. The school system and the medical system, two of our biggest overarching systems in this country and the world, are falling apart. They're not serving humanity the way they should. Finding balance starts with new generations - they'll be the ones to make changes once these systems are too far out of balance to repair.

### Making Learning Relevant [14:39]

**Aleya:** My greatest challenge, not surprisingly, has been working with my own kids and their resistance. This led me to realize the fundamental reason why kids struggle with learning: disinterest. If they're bored, they won't engage or try.

I had this re-epiphany recently during our coding class when we were working with math concepts. Those who are interested in math succeed in math. Those who look at numbers and feel stressed obviously struggle to learn. The key to any learning is making it more interesting and applicable.

What drives me crazy about public schools - and honestly, many charter schools too - is their rigid approach to subjects. Students need to see how they'll use what they're learning. Otherwise, the most common response is, "What's the point?"

However, when we apply real math skills to practical projects - like building our garden beds right now - they need to understand basic math concepts for measurements and setup. These are simple but practical math skills. Similarly, with career exploration, when they're interested in something they see people doing, that's when we can discuss how math or writing applies to that field.

Writing is another area where I've noticed resistance. But when students get to tell their own stories, conduct investigations, or write about something they're passionate about or find funny - humor is a huge motivator - they engage differently. Some prefer drawing to writing, so we find middle ground. They can draw pictures to express their ideas, but they also need to complement that with some writing. It's about finding that balance because that's just life - you'll have to learn some things you might not love, but if you know it'll get you where you want to go, you'll be motivated to do it.

### The Truth About Teens Who "Don't Know What They Want" [18:07]

**Ela:** How do your kids figure out where they want to go though?

**Aleya:** That's another tricky thing - many teens don't know, and I've been learning that's completely okay. My own kids often say, "I just want to be a kid. I don't want to grow up. Being an adult looks scary."

Instead of pushing them to choose a career - which is something that really turns me off about public schools, asking sophomores about college plans - we take a different approach. We look at the world around us: What are people doing? What interests you right now? What do you see people doing - maybe your parents' friends, your uncle, your aunt - that they really enjoy?

Our coding teacher shared something powerful with us: if you're doing something you're truly passionate about and find a way to make money with it, you'll never work a day in your life. So we focus on getting them excited about the possibility of running their own business doing what they love, or perhaps joining a group of entrepreneurs to create something together.

While they're young and want to stay young and aren't sure what they want to do, we focus on building those foundational concepts they'll need to function healthily in society. That way, when they're 18 or whenever they're ready to enter the workforce, they already know what they like, what they're good at, and what they want to do - for now. Because in today's world, you can change your career path whenever you want.

There's no need to push kids toward college or into a career just because "we need to make money right now" or "you need something to do with your life." For instance, my kids started volunteering one day a week at the library this year. Even though it might seem routine or boring, they get different tasks each time and work with other kids their age. It builds that work ethic and discipline without being overwhelming. They've stopped complaining about it - it's just become part of their routine.

### Structure with Flexibility [20:40]

**Aleya:** It's crucial to provide structure - which I obviously do with our school - so they know what to expect. But equally important is flexibility. You need both: structure so they know what's coming, but also the ability to adapt when things change. Guest teachers might cancel last minute, weather could suddenly shift, someone might get sick.

The key is learning how to respond to change while still respecting the structure. How can you be flexible while maintaining consistency? These are fundamental skills they'll need as adults.

### Honoring Natural Development [23:00]

**Ela:** What would you say to parents who struggle with being flexible about their kids' outcomes? Whether you're a longtime open educator or new to the movement, it's difficult to accept if your child doesn't become that lawyer or surgeon you imagined. How do you come to terms with that?

**Aleya:** From what I've seen in my own experience and in my family and friends, when a child becomes a young adult and is given options within structure - discipline with choices - they have time to fully bloom.

Sure, we occasionally see young geniuses who start businesses right out of high school or go to Harvard. Of course we all want our kids to be like that - who wouldn't? But what really matters in the long run? Maybe your kid is 18, 19, 20, working at Pizza Hut, renting a room with another teen. It's not the dream you had for them.

But the most important questions we should ask are: Are they happy? Are they healthy? Are they provided for? Can they take care of themselves? Are they self-sufficient? If you address holistic health while they're young, they won't end up in their 30s with chronic diseases, wondering what happened to their childhood because they were so busy trying to be an adult.

I think that's why we're in this health crisis in our country - many adults never honored their childhood dreams and wishes. You might not know your dream right away. You might not even have one. But those who do should hold onto it and pursue it. That responsibility can take half a lifetime, but having that dream propels people forward. And a dream could be as simple as wanting a comfortable life or just wanting to be loved and supported.

My kids are very simple in that sense. I'm super ambitious with huge, insane dreams that I wholeheartedly believe in and am excited to pursue. But my kids just want to feel loved and supported, and that's perfect for their age. Though my son will tell you it's been really hard for me to let go of saying things like, "But you're 15 - don't you want to do something? Don't you want to take some classes? Don't you want to get a job?" And he just says, "I'm really comfortable where I'm at. I like what we're doing." Why fight that? Who am I to say he needs more?

### The Connected Teens Experience [28:49]

**Aleya:** First of all, my micro school is called Connected Teens, though Elated Family is my business name - I know it can be confusing. One of the highlights of our year together was our last day of school. We went to a lake and had this honoring ceremony where the kids got to share their favorite teachers and experiences.

What made it really special was that everyone came together with their families. You can choose how many days a week you attend our school, so not every kid comes every day. But when they all gathered, we got to hear what meant the most to them about the school. Across the board, they loved anything that made them feel free and truly engaged in learning something interesting.

I think what I loved most was watching their confidence grow and seeing them participate in things they normally wouldn't have done, encouraged by the camaraderie of the group.

**Ela:** What resources or tools do you use frequently with your students that they really enjoy?

**Aleya:** Our van! We go to lots of places. But for learning resources, YouTube actually has some amazing short documentaries. I don't like having the kids in front of screens for long periods, so I won't show full movies, but there are great 15-20 minute historical and relevant films that are free. I preview them to ensure they're appropriate.

One channel in particular that's absolutely beautiful is The Modern Intuitionist. He analyzes famous historical texts, connects them to historical events, and focuses on raising consciousness and understanding human nature. He helps us along our path to evolution through different aspects of our history - it's just absolutely amazing. We need to have more faith in everyday people coming together, learning things, and having these epiphanies. It's not necessarily coming straight from a university - we're all evolving together, like a hundredth monkey effect. Once one side of the world learns something, the other side naturally learns it too without direct exposure.

### A Vision for the Future [32:53]

**Ela:** Did you always know you wanted to personalize your kids' education? And what makes you excited for the future of education?

**Aleya:** Yes, I've always been very... you can say controlling, that's okay... about what my kids are exposed to and what they learn. At the same time, I don't want to be over-sheltering. I definitely make sure they're exposed to what's going on in the world and I don't hide things from them.

What I'm excited about is honestly how this is rippling out. I'm excited about the effect that the Connected Teens movement is going to have on the world. I'm in the process of several huge projects that are all feeding into each other, and one of my greatest intentions - what I think will be my greatest accomplishment in life - is inspiring more nature-based teen schools all around the world.

I have this vision that's going to become reality soon enough: sailing around the world with teens on a ship where we grow food below deck and raise animals, starting up farm schools in every country we visit. I just finished writing a novel about this, and once it gets out to the world, people are undoubtedly going to love the idea.

These farm schools will address food sustainability, preserve cultural heritage, and most importantly, create healthy young people who are stewards of the land. That's what I'm looking forward to - seeing more down-to-earth, grassroots movements around education for teens. Like I said, there's too much imbalance in this world. It's time for change, and I'm instigating that change with every effort I have.

**Ela:** You're incredible, and I really appreciate how much passion you have for this. I have so many more questions, but maybe we'll do a part two at some point. This has been awesome. I'll leave the links below so people can find you and your school.

**Aleya:** Thank you so much, Ela. So nice to talk to you.

First for the thought segment make this the promotion for the podcast episode and give it some kind of a clickbaity hook so that people are actually inclined to watch or listen
