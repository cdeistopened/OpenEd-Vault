Did you know our school system is based on a 200-year-old Prussian model designed to create obedient soldiers? Or that we grade students in ways that would make even elite athletes like LeBron James look like failures?

Isaac Morehouse and Matt Bowman expose the fundamental flaws in our education system in their category-defining new book "Open Education: How to Reimagine Learning, Ignite Curiosity, and Prepare Your Kids for Success."

In this episode, the authors break down Part One of their book, examining the historical traps of education, why standardization doesn't work, and their revolutionary "mastered or not yet" approach.

Matt: "What bugs me is when we impose on kids that they're failures, or that they're not proficient enough, or they just aren't good enough. You have to say, 'not yet.' They're not there yet. And that three-letter word of 'yet' adds so much strength to a kid, to a person who's struggling, because they know that they still have runway. We're all a bunch of 'not yet' in life. And it's a spiritual belief I have. It's a human belief I have."

## Transcript

Isaac (00:01.427)  
Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. am here, Isaac Morehouse here co-hosting with my co-author, Matt Bowman. How are you, Matt?  
  
Matt Bowman (00:02.059)  
yes.  
  
Matt Bowman (00:11.906)  
Doing well, thanks Isaac, pretty exciting to have our book out, huh?  
  
Isaac (00:15.197)  
Yeah, this is amazing. So we just launched the brand new book, Open Education, How to Reimagine Learning, Ignite Curiosity and Prepare Your Kids for Success. Really, this is Matt's book and I just sort of like sneak a few things in there and slap my name on the front. So this is from Matt's years, decades even of experience and passion in the education space. Matt, I'm just from a very high level.  
  
How difficult was it to distill everything in your brain and all the things you care about and have experienced and seen and form it into a book, that process? Was that really tough or did it just flow out of you?  
  
Matt Bowman (00:58.862)  
You know, it has taken a couple years of lots of different iterations of what to share, what not share, you know, because there are so many stories behind the scenes of what's in there, right? Of even just understanding families over and over again, listening to so many parents talking about their child's education, that it's just, could have been a thousand pages. And so the idea to just kind of  
  
Think through what's the most impactful, can, what, what illustrations can we use? What stories can we use? What principles, you know, tell the story the best. so yeah, it's been a couple of your journey and was not easy to kind of narrow down. Cause I, you know, again, I could talk for hundreds of hours on all this stuff as you could too. And, and to just distill it down into what's impactful and hopefully really helpful for families.  
  
was took a lot of effort.  
  
Isaac (02:00.701)  
Yeah, it's interesting. There's, there's kind of two different types of nonfiction books, whether you're writing about business or education or health, you have type one is like smart, clear thinking or, or interesting thinker who's basically doing research or observing things that are happening. So let's say it's a business book. Here's all these businesses I looked at and I crunched numbers and I observed things. I, from this, sort of put together.  
  
Matt Bowman (02:27.0)  
Mm-hmm.  
  
Isaac (02:29.875)  
some common patterns. It's like this pattern recognition from kind of a distance observation, a more scientific approach. And then there's the, I'm writing a more memoir style. Here's what I learned running my own business or starting my own business. And of course, the more businesses you have run or started, or the more experiences you've had in there, both failure and success, the better that's going to be, because it's not gonna just be like, hey, I did one thing once and it worked. here's...  
  
Matt Bowman (02:58.36)  
Right?  
  
Isaac (02:58.653)  
Here's why it worked, right? Which may or may not be true. And so you have the more like personal bottoms up. Here's a bunch of stuff that I stumbled my way through. And then the more top down, hey, I'm taking a 30,000 foot view, looking at hundreds of examples, doing some number crunching and coming up with some principles. This book actually has both. And I really like that. I remember you called me after reading the physical edition in your hand for the first time, which is a different experience. And you're like,  
  
Matt Bowman (03:17.463)  
It does.  
  
Isaac (03:26.749)  
I don't really like the beginning and the end, but I like the middle. And I said, I'm the complete opposite. I like the beginning and the end and the middle is kind of boring. You're like, I want this specific tactical stuff. And I'm like, I really like the high level analysis. So I think it's actually a good marriage of both of those things. It does provide research and some concepts and theories about education from a vast sort of historical sweep, but it's also got.  
  
Matt Bowman (03:34.967)  
It is so funny.  
  
Isaac (03:56.399)  
you and I both have multiple kids and have been learning in the trenches. And then we've both run programs with hundreds or in your case, tens of thousands of kids and seen from experience success and failure and a lot of things too. And I just think it's got a nice marriage of the personal and the kind of research side.  
  
Matt Bowman (04:16.878)  
It really is a good mix and we intentionally, you know, I really did not want it to read like a textbook ever. So even the, the, the research and the, the good background content doesn't read like a textbook. Uh, it's not, it, it, it's doable. It's accessible. You really can, you know, grasp those concepts really easily and well. And I think that's why I like that.  
  
how it ended, it's turned out to be a really nice mix of both.  
  
Isaac (04:48.477)  
Yeah, I've really enjoyed, even though I'm very much a, okay, once it's good enough, let's just get it out the door and not keep trying to refine it. I have actually appreciated in the final stretches when we had it, 90 % of the way there, getting that last 10 % right, the order, the structure, where the content goes, how it flows.  
  
Matt Bowman (04:56.27)  
you  
  
Isaac (05:08.925)  
you've done a really great job of like being very relentless about this just isn't quite right. And I tend to have a like good enough, let's go, you know. So it's been good. It's been good.  
  
Matt Bowman (05:16.085)  
you  
  
Well, you know, that's why we're good co-authors, because we needed that balance, because, you know, had you come and said, oh, we should take more time, you know, that wouldn't have been helpful to the finish line. So it's nice to be able to have both saying, hey, it's good enough, go for it, and push me to get to the point where I'm comfortable, that it's now good to go. I hope people enjoy it.  
  
Isaac (05:43.679)  
It's funny. There was a there was a part in one of the drafts of the book. think I think I ended up removing it. But we were talking about. Like mastery, mastery based learning or something to that effect. And I had a little story from my grandfather who always used to he was like World War Two vet worked with his hands, did carpentry, did just constantly building and making stuff all the time. But he was not known for his like.  
  
fine craftsmanship. Like if he built you a shelf or a table or something, like it was, you know, it a little rough. And, but he just cranked out. He had tons of kids and grandkids. And so he'd be in his basement, like making like 50 bird feeders that he was going to give everyone at Christmas. And just like a one man, you know, assembly line, but he always had this line. If we're doing woodworking with him, good enough for who it's for. Oh, we did keep it. Okay. Okay. For some reason, there was some version where we're.  
  
Matt Bowman (06:35.212)  
No, we kept it, Isaac, we kept it. Yeah, it's in there. It's good enough for who it's for. No, I love it. I think that's a great, know, because really that does tell us into some of the content we talk about, which is don't pursue perfection. That pursuit is unattainable. None of us have it. Don't try to believe, you know, social media influencers whose lives look perfect.  
  
Isaac (06:41.821)  
We're going back and forth.  
  
Matt Bowman (07:03.596)  
It's not there. So your grandpa's quote is spot on and aligns with that concept of in designing your child's education, don't pursue perfection. It's not something that is to be pursued. The messiness is in the, you know, the experience is in the messiness.  
  
Isaac (07:22.867)  
Yeah. And, and, it's contextual as well. And this kind of ties into what I was saying about, you know, the complimentary, approaches on writing this book. There are certain contexts where you want to have a higher degree of mastery or perfection and others where it really doesn't matter that much, where 80 % really is good enough and being able to know the difference and not have like a very absolutist approach. So I, I got started writing by just having a challenge to do daily blogging. so for me, like,  
  
Matt Bowman (07:43.062)  
Thank  
  
Isaac (07:52.287)  
needing to press publish every day on a new blog post for a year, and then I eventually ended up doing it for many years, that very much required good enough for who it's for. And like that context, if I were to say, can only put it out into the world if it's perfect, I would never have been able to meet that challenge. A book is different. And I have to context switch, like this is not your daily blogging, this is not your social media post, this is something different. It's more enduring, it's gotta have more credibility.  
  
and I have to ratchet up, which doesn't come natural to me. But I think that's a great, with education, that's a great question. Is this something that requires, I asked my daughter this, she's in a Spanish class at a homeschool co-op, and she'll get really upset if she gets less than like a 95. And I'm like, why? Are you mad that you're not as good at speaking Spanish as you want to be? And she's like, well, no, I don't think it's really.  
  
Matt Bowman (08:21.591)  
to see.  
  
Isaac (08:48.147)  
tells me much about that. And I'm like, so what is it that makes you want that perfection? And I'm not trying to tell her she should or shouldn't, I'm just trying to get her to question, is this where I should put my effort and my energy?  
  
Matt Bowman (08:49.921)  
You  
  
Matt Bowman (08:56.174)  
Right, right.  
  
Matt Bowman (09:02.794)  
a great point. Identifying there are times when it should matter and you do want to get that as close to nailed down as you can. But other times, know, 50, 60 percent is probably good enough for who it's for to your grandpa.  
  
Isaac (09:19.679)  
So that's a great segue into let's we're going to kind of take, take this book section by section. So there are three parts, part one, part two, part three that the chapters are kind of divided into. And for today, we're just going to focus on part one. I just chat a little bit about what's in here, give you a little preview and talk a little bit about some of the, some of the things that the parts that we like a lot. part one is chapter one.  
  
which is kind of a history of school and kind of education as it stands today, how it came about, different attempts at reform, how COVID really changed a lot of things, the sort of homeschool, school choice movements, ups and downs. Chapter two is really about standardized testing primarily and kind of what that has done and what that has created.  
  
in the incentives of the education system. And then chapter three is sort of a picture of a better version of goal setting for education than standardized testing. It's called mastered or not yet. And Matt, know you're really passionate about that. And I love that framework. It's funny, I didn't even have the...  
  
any concept of like competency-based education or like, didn't know that this was sort of a thing or a field that people were into. But when I first created the Praxis program, I just kind of stumbled upon, because I was trying to figure out a way to combine, and that's what the word Praxis means, theory and practice, to combine that like, there is an element of study and learning that makes you better at going and getting a job, which was really the goal of the program.  
  
So it's not just like, go work and be an apprentice. You know, doing is how you learn. You will, you'll learn most things that way. But there's also a time to reflect and learn. And when it came to demonstrating your competency at that component, I just sort of stumbled on having people do it through like creating projects or doing oral exams. But then we just had a simple, you mastered it or you didn't master it. And I don't think we call it mastered or not yet. Can't remember what we called it. But then if you...  
  
Matt Bowman (11:39.138)  
the same principle.  
  
Isaac (11:40.539)  
If you weren't there, you could do it again, right? As many times as you wanted. Yep.  
  
Matt Bowman (11:42.414)  
and you can come back and do it again. If you choose that you're a not yet, come on back. Like go refine, improve, take feedback, come back. And even in your daughter's example, if you aren't happy with 95%, come back when you wanna finish that 5%. That's great. But if you are at a point where 80 % is gonna be good enough, say, my not yet's are fine, I see those not yet's.  
  
but I'm good enough and I'm gonna not come back to that exam. that's why I love that part of your story of, know, when you say you went the oral exam round and then you said professors that you had helped judge that were blown away on how engaged those students were versus the kids they give tests to.  
  
Isaac (12:29.981)  
That's one of the sides of an open education that doesn't, I think, get enough attention. Not only is this so much better for learners, teachers have such a better experience when they get to have this kind of like, you're in a classroom of a bunch of kids who are just there to like, give me the tests and let me use AI to cheat as much as I can to get through the pain. It's not as fulfilling of an experience.  
  
When you're there with someone and they're engaged with you, that's just amazing. So I think that's a big plus. But I wanted to ask you, when did you first come across the concept of competency-based education or mastered and not yet? Is this something you stumbled on yourself or tried to implement when you were a teacher? Or did you come across it through some books and some different thinkers in education? What got you hooked on  
  
Matt Bowman (13:22.434)  
Yeah, so I do go back to even my, so it must've been through some of my teacher preparation program. I give them some credit because when I first started as a teacher, what I had been trained to do was build rubrics. It's this idea of transparency in education starts with a very clear rubric. Here's what your project, you know, very project-based.  
  
In the nineties, when I started teaching project-based learning was a big thing with rubrics to judge it. But then that was a very natural transition to when competency based education vernacular became a thing where those rubrics, you know, ahead of time, exactly what you're going to be judged on. And you, you self evaluate. did a lot of self evaluation on your rubric and then go get a peer to root to judge it.  
  
and then get an outside adult to judge it, right? And so you had all this feedback on your rubric and you could see, you know, the challenge is writing good rubrics that show exactly what you're expecting to get. And then if you've mastered it, you can see it. If you have some not yet, you can see that too. So I implemented project-based rubric assessments in 94 when I first started teaching. And then just to see how that has  
  
as entered into a mainstream education vernacular of, and even, you know, Southern New Hampshire University doing a whole college degree program. One of the few, actually the only one that's interdisciplinary project-based, competency-based assessment is Southern New Hampshire. And we highlight them in our book. But others have tried to do that, but they use more of a test-based approach. You can test out of credits. That's a little bit.  
  
Yes, that's competency based or at least mastery based, but not project based. Have you demonstrated the skill? So anyway, I love all that stuff. Yeah. You know, and really, because it's very personal to me that, we're all a bunch of not yet in life. And it's, it's a, it's a spiritual belief I have. It's a human belief I have. And when we impose on kids that they're failures, it just drives me crazy.  
  
Matt Bowman (15:44.758)  
or that they're not proficient enough or they just aren't good enough. Just bug me, because you have to say, not yet. They're not there yet. And that word, that three-letter word of yet, adds so much strength to a kid, to a person who's struggling, that they know that they're still runway.  
  
Isaac (16:07.301)  
It's interesting when you see the contrast between what happens in the professional world, in the world of employment, and even just like relationships and other things we do in life and what happens in the education system, which is supposed to prepare people for that. When you imagine like hiring for a business and the only way you hire it is you just send out a multiple choice test.  
  
and hundreds of people take it and whoever did the best on it, you just bring on to the team. Like no one would do that. There may be a few jobs where that's one step or a final step or something else and very, very specific jobs with very specific knowledge. But the hiring process is really messy. It usually starts with something like a resume that's kind of just like, here are my grades and whatever else. But that's really not the thing that the decision is based on. Then you go through like,  
  
several interviews where you're talking, it's like an oral exam, and you're trying to see, does this person know what I need them to know for this particular role? And what's weird in that process is sometimes you find out that they don't know as much as you thought you wanted them to about that role, but they do know something in another area that you didn't even think about, and you might end up hiring them anyway. And it's not this binary, it's such a complex thing, and they're talking to multiple people.  
  
And then you might ask them to do a project, okay, send me a proposal of your first 30, 60 and 90 days on the job. And you're getting this feel that's so multi-dimensional. And we all know that's the way that most of us hire, but somehow when it comes to the education is where it's like, okay, now let's see, are you good at something? Number grade, number grade, number grade, right? It's like.  
  
Matt Bowman (17:50.464)  
And let's start the clock, the timer, and it's going to expire at 1102. And if you don't have it turned in by there, you don't get anything. So this is stress of the timer. It's the lack of transparency. Again, we cover all this stuff in that book, in that chapter of the book, that we don't even let kids, we don't even let teachers know what's going to be on the test. We say, it aligns to these ambiguous standards. But in the  
  
in the sake of protecting authenticity of the test, we don't tell anyone if it's on it. That's the opposite of transparency. Teachers need to know, parents need to know, students need to know. They need to prepare for it. And then we do gotchas, we do time tests, we say, don't talk to anyone. Like where else in any business would you say, don't talk to experts to get your answers? It's the most ridiculous thing. Like you have to do...  
  
Do not email anybody. Do not have a Zoom call with anybody. Do not talk to anyone who knows what you're looking for. Like that's opposite of what we want people to learn how to do.  
  
Isaac (19:02.143)  
I remember my, one of my early jobs as a teen, I was working for a construction company, Framing Houses, and the boss would just like yell something down. be like, I need a four foot, two by four with a eight inch, you know, whatever, a 45 degree angle and a 30 degree bevel. And I didn't know what any of this stuff was. And I'm just imagining if I just had to show up and then just like make a bunch of cuts and hand it to him. And he would either say,  
  
you're fired or we'll keep you like, I mean, it was crazy stressful. So you're like, okay, what's a bevel? How do what's the angle? What's a how do I make the saw adjust the way that I want it to like the idea?  
  
Matt Bowman (19:41.774)  
So you ask questions, you research, you're motivated. That's learning. It's not that you just, go do a, you know, in the dark and then come show up and he says, wrong.  
  
Isaac (19:47.369)  
Yes.  
  
Isaac (19:54.111)  
80 % of your cuts were 80 % of your cuts were wrong. You're out of here. And I'm sure they were at first. Exactly. Right? Like, man. So, so let's let's talk a little bit about the part one of the book. And I want to know  
  
Matt Bowman (19:56.558)  
But that's what we do to kids.  
  
Matt Bowman (20:02.03)  
Right. And you can have a second try.  
  
Matt Bowman (20:14.146)  
Yeah, the three chapters to just to help people who are listening. Chapter one is called the 200 year old trap. Chapter two is students are not standard and chapter three mastered or not yet. So what's your favorite of all that Isaac?  
  
Isaac (20:29.673)  
Okay, so I'm gonna cheat. I'm gonna give two answers. My favorite chapter is actually chapter one. I'm a sucker for the history of the education system because the first time I learned the impetus for a lot of the people early on who put together the public school system, yeah, it was really shocking. And when I realized like there was no broad-based public school system.  
  
Matt Bowman (20:32.28)  
hahaha  
  
Matt Bowman (20:47.989)  
origin story, yeah.  
  
Isaac (20:56.745)  
for the first couple of hundred years of this country's, know, people in America. And when it came about, the goals were very different from what people would want the goals to be today. Now that doesn't mean that people today have those same goals, but the fact that so many of the things, the structure, it was like, hey, it was modeled after a Prussian system whose goal was to get people to go fight the wars that the government wanted them to fight.  
  
and just obey orders without really asking. Yeah, right. Like, hey, if we tell you to run into a gunfire, you do it. So how do we create a system that gets people to think that way from the time they're children, right? Like that was kind of the core. So I love that. I always liked that historical context. That's my favorite chapter. But I do have a favorite line in the book, in the entire book. And this is, it's my favorite for a couple reasons.  
  
Matt Bowman (21:25.902)  
without questioning, right.  
  
Isaac (21:51.139)  
You know, there's the raging debate in sports about like, who's the greatest of all time? And I'm a firm believer that Michael Jordan's the best basketball player ever. And I get really annoyed and me and my friends have all these chats about this, you know, when people are like, LeBron James. I'm like, no, LeBron James doesn't belong in that conversation. So chapter three opens with this. LeBron James is a failure. Now it says after that, at least he would be if he were graded like we grade our kids.  
  
But I just took a picture of just that first part and I sent it to my buddies on the sports chat. And I'm like, guess what? I put in my new book on education. Just as a joke, but I love that chapter opening. Cause it really gets at what we were just talking about. Like, Hey, LeBron James is a failure. If we apply this rubric to him, to any basketball player, to any athlete, you mean you make 50 % of the shots that you take. That's it. Like.  
  
on a grading scale? I mean, we're talking F, right? And I think we'd go down and show like field goal percentage, three point percentage, free throw percentage. You know, the best he would be on here would be a D plus in any of those categories, right? Like I love just breaking us out and recognizing that things outside of the education world, we have a totally different way of viewing them and measuring them. that's my two-part answer. What about you? What's your favorite part of your chapter or part in part one?  
  
Matt Bowman (22:49.302)  
I am. Yep.

Well, good. Well, I'll take your two-part answer and mirror that. So first, I want to do a shout out to Amy's Forward. So if you skip forwards in books, skip that in other books. Don't skip the forward in this book. You've got to read Amy's Forward. She's my wife, co-founder of OpenEd, and what she lays out in her forward.  
  
just inspires me. And so definitely I want to do a shout out for the forward. It sets the table for everything you're going to read. So just make sure you don't skip that. In terms of just what I really, you we've talked about master and not yet, and I love that line of LeBron and, know, Roger Federer and Simone Biles, but I love the, the quote that we questionably attribute to Albert Einstein.  
  
that if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it'll live its whole life feeling stupid. And so we put in there a graphic that I hope you just digest as you read it. You know, can fish climb trees? No, they can't. And so why are we judging a fish on its ability to climb a tree when that just doesn't make sense? You know, in the picture, the monkey is so excited. The squirrel is super  
  
you know, optimistic they'll perform well on the climb the tree exam, but the fish is terrified. And, you know, I, like to ask people which animal do they identify with in the picture? And, know, I look at it and I, I was probably like the horse in there. The horse looks very happy, confident that they can do anything. It's a beautiful horse in there and, but they can't go climb the tree.  
  
Isaac (24:58.63)  
You  
  
Matt Bowman (25:08.462)  
But I am so confident in myself that I'm sure I could figure out a way to climb that tree. And so that's why I view the horse is just smiling and happy and confident, but still is not going to succeed like the monkey will. And so how frustrating is that concept? You the elephant gives up because they know they're just going to push it over and see if they can get a D for that, right?  
  
Bring the teacher the tree itself and say what grade do I get now? right, and so it's just funny how we try to paint every child as the same and By birth year and cohort, you know zip codes. That's the most Illogical way to organize kids. It's the most illogical way to assess kids by having them all climb the same tree and It just it literally doesn't make sense for human development  
  
And so, and then seeing that for my own five children and their five, you know, their spouses that they've married and our grandkids. And we highlight this a lot in the book. There's no such thing as an average child. Every child's unique. Their education should be too. So that's really the favorite message throughout the whole book is that.  
  
Isaac (26:27.711)  
What I love about when you take that amazing quote, which I'm just gonna say it was Einstein, even though it's debated, if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, will spend its whole life feeling dumb. There's one reaction to that, which is, okay, well then we gotta shield kids from the knowledge that they're not good at certain things. like,  
  
protect them and make sure that they never know that they're actually not as good at this as somebody else, because they might feel bad or not. And that's not productive either, right? Because you're creating fragile kids who once they find out, they'll be crushed. I'll never forget Vince Young. He was an amazing quarterback in college, goes to the NFL and his first year, know, said he was a number one draft pick, know, big heralded guy drafted by a bad team, as is usually the case, really struggled and  
  
Matt Bowman (27:01.677)  
No.  
  
Isaac (27:21.903)  
He said he sat in the parking lot of his car after one of the games where he got booed and he had never done anything but just win at every level he had ever played in sports for his entire life and only ever just been praised because he was just so physically gifted from elementary to middle, whatever. And he said he, he sat in there like questioning his entire life. Like he didn't know what to do when he got booed. so I think you don't want to create kids where it's like, Hey,  
  
We don't want you to know, don't do that activity, because then you won't be as good as everyone else and you'll feel bad. But so how do you marry that with the recognition that everybody's different and everybody has different skills? And I think sports is actually kind of a fun, especially sports that has a diverse range of skill types. It's kind of a fun atmosphere with that. I was driving home from baseball practice with my son just the other night and he was just kind of bummed because he said, dad,  
  
I think I'm the slowest kid on the team when we run sprints. And he just runs kind of slow. He's just kind of got like a gang. He's in that gangly phase where he's growing and he hasn't quite got coordinated, but he actually has like a lot of power as a hitter and he has a really good arm. And I said, I said, do you ever want to go watch Anthony Rizzo? He's the slowest base runner I've ever seen. If he hits a ground ball, there's no chance he's going to run. He's an amazing first baseman and he's got, he's a good hitter. Like he's won a world series. said, go, you know,  
  
Some guys are base stealing champions who never hit home runs. Some guys like you've got a whole mix and a team needs all of those. And I'm like, you may get faster and you wanna practice and work to get faster. But knowing that if you're a fish, you don't have to be ashamed of the fact that you can't climb a tree. But you need to know that actually knowing what you're not good at is really a good thing. And if you put a stigma on not being good at something,  
  
Matt Bowman (29:05.293)  
Thank  
  
Isaac (29:14.249)  
That's really bad because then it incentivizes us to like hide that fact from our kids or be crushed when we find out. And you wanna have a balance. Like I want to know the things that I'm not good at and not let the fact that I'm not good at it crush me. And I think that's like a hard thing to figure out and accomplish in an academic setting. But I think it's really important to not attach shame with that, but to be like, hey, I'm just not very good at math. So I'm gonna need some help. Right? And not feel bad about it.  
  
Matt Bowman (29:43.458)  
No, I agree. And it's not like, yeah, to your point, fish, then we should protect them and never make them do anything, you know, hard. In later chapters, we talk about one of the most rewarding things is accomplishing something challenging. So it's not that we don't want kids to be challenged. That's not the point of saying fish don't climb trees. The point is,  
  
that fish, there are challenging things for that fish to discover. And once you find those things that each child is passionate about conquering, that experience produces learning and joy all in one.  
  
Isaac (30:31.603)  
Bingo, yeah. And I think that's, as a parent, one of the hardest things to figure out when your kid is just truly like, this is not for them. Why would I make them do it? They're miserable and it's not benefiting them.  
  
Matt Bowman (30:45.804)  
Right? That is not easy to find that line.  
  
Isaac (30:49.255)  
Yeah, and then there other times where you gotta push them a little bit. And I think ideally, the older they get, the more they get to figure that out on their own. When my six-year-old says, I don't wanna practice piano, I'm gonna say, sorry, do it anyway. If he's played piano for a couple of years and I know he's able to make himself practice and he's able to be disciplined, but it's just not his thing and his timing's terrible and he says, don't wanna play, then maybe that's a different scenario. it is a...  
  
Matt Bowman (30:52.002)  
Yeah.  
  
Isaac (31:15.475)  
presenting people with the opportunity in an environment that is not high stakes, I think is better. Hey, here's a tree, anybody wanna climb? And if some people take to it and some don't, okay, cool. More of that for some, less for others versus here's the test, you all have to do it and you're all gonna be shamed if you don't do it.  
  
Matt Bowman (31:35.372)  
No, yeah, and that's definitely a good teaser for the next episode and the next section of really giving your child a voice is such a key. And people say, you just let kids do whatever they want. No, that's not the point. The point is give them some autonomy, give them some agency based on their developmental levels and all that stuff. They still need adults and teachers and coaches in the room, but don't dismiss giving them a  
  
a voice and choice in some of that. So we'll cover that on the next one.  
  
Isaac (32:08.895)  
I love it. That's a great teaser, great setup. We'll come back next time to talk about part two, which gets much more Matt's favorite, gets tactical and really walking through some ideas, some examples of how to do this with your kids. So Matt.  
  
Matt Bowman (32:24.706)  
Yeah, just really give a playbook on parents that want some help to just start at the beginning what to do. We find a lot of families just don't know where to start. And so that's why we did want to get tactical and practical. So part two definitely gives you a lot of tactical things you can do in your family today.  
  
Isaac (32:45.615)  
Absolutely. Excited to jump into that. If you want to go to opened.co. book, you can find a link to get the book on Amazon. You can find a bunch of other stuff we got on there as well. And we just want to, we want to spread the, spread the concept, not just the book, but just the concept of opening up your education. So if you encounter someone, ideally this is one of those books where you're at the playground and you hear another parent say, Hey, I just, kind of want to do something different. I thought about.  
  
homeschooling or a virtual school, but I'm just not sure that's a perfect person to grab a copy of Open Education for. Matt, any parting thoughts?  
  
Matt Bowman (33:23.725)  
true.  
  
No, thanks man. It's been a great experience to get this published and out the door. I appreciate all your work, Isaac. Thank you.  
  
Isaac (33:32.157)  
Likewise, until next time.
