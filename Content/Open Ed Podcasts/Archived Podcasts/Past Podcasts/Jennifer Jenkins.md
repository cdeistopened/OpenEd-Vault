Title: "Why Struggling Readers Often Make the Best Writers"

Thumbnail Concept:

- Split design with contrasting sides
- Left side: Messy jumble of letters/words (representing dyslexia/reading struggle)
- Right side: Clean, organized stack of books with "AUTHOR" text
- Text: "STRUGGLING?" (keeping under 20 chars)
- Color scheme:
    - Left: Muted/frustrated tones
    - Right: Vibrant/successful tones
    - Blue/gold contrast for transformation effect

The prompt for AI image generation was:  
Two-panel split composition. On the left: floating jumbled letters in dark blue and gray, chaotic and overlapping, some letters appearing backward or mirrored, representing dyslexia. On the right: same letters transforming into organized, golden book spines on a shelf, crisp and clear. Clean white background. Minimalist design style. Large bold text "STRUGGLING?" in dark blue spans across the top. Professional lighting, sharp contrast between the chaotic left and organized right sides. Subtle gradient transition in the middle where the jumbled letters begin transforming into books.

# Jennifer Jenkins

**Jennifer Jenkins:** [00:00:00] I always loved story. That was never the problem. I had been telling myself that I wasn't a good reader, that there was something wrong with me.

And that was a story I believed and once I started to really attack that in a way that didn't feel like, Oh, I'm just stupid. I started to fall in love with reading, and then years later started to publish. Every story needs a beginning, a middle and an end, a 1st, act. But great authors have to understand what those rules are so they can break them effectively. Break them with intention. what is the negative space? What part of the story are you not telling that you're alluding to, or you're hinting at? That ignites that curiosity in the reader.

We don't maybe identify it if we're not looking for it. But in stories, it's the little nuggets that are included by the author that make you go

**Charlie Deist:** Hey everyone. Welcome back to the open ed podcast. I'm Charlie Dice. Here joined today by Jennifer Jenkins, who is a co [00:01:00] founder and the CEO of Operation Literacy, which runs a program. We're excited to be participating this year in the annual StoryCon event. It's a big event going on in Salt Lake City in February, just coming up right around the corner.

Jennifer, so glad to be with you today.

**Jennifer Jenkins:** Thank you for having me, Charlie.

**Charlie Deist:** Yeah, of course. , open ed back as, as my tech high, uh, has had this, this running partnership with what I think it used to be called the teen author bootcamp, and that has sort of evolved into this story con event , , tell us a little bit about, who's going to be there.

What are the, the banner headlines?

**Jennifer Jenkins:** It's always scary for me to try and and even list our keynotes because we have 10. it is a monster event that's being held at the salt palace in Salt Lake City, featuring over 90 author. And presenters, uh, including Jeff Kinney, who's the author of diary of a wimpy kid. We have, uh, Neil Schusterman, who's the author of scythe with Shannon hail.

We have Brandon mole. We have [00:02:00] Marissa Meyer. Who's the author of cinder, uh, Lainey Taylor, Jennifer Nielsen, Margaret Peterson had X. And then we have just amazing breakout presenters and masterclass teachers like Christopher Paolini, who is the author of the Eragon series and was a teen author himself.

And so, yeah, the list goes on and on, and I guarantee you, I didn't get all of our keynotes in that, but it was, it's an impressive list.

**Charlie Deist:** Yeah, it's it is a star studded list. And I know that because I'm not really one. I'm not super plugged into the world of young adult literature, but a lot of these names I immediately recognized when I saw them. And, uh, and so it looks like it's going to be the place to be, whether you're a parent or a teen or a preteen, who's an aspiring author.

And, uh, and this is this is where kind of the open education. Yeah. Message that we obviously have a lot of overlap in terms of the audiences that we reach a certain category [00:03:00] of young adult person who's maybe already at, you know, at a younger age, thinking about, you know, they're very passionate about one particular thing.

And in your case, I gather that a lot of the attendees. Are, you know, they've already got their either already got their own manuscripts or they're working on one, but people who aren't waiting to be, you know, sort of picked out or given permission. They're just they're just going for it. They're sort of following their their passion how would you describe kind of the average attendee? Are they from all over the country or are they predominantly from Utah? And

**Jennifer Jenkins:** attendees are from out of state right now. , we have people coming from all over the world, in fact, but a high concentration from the Midwest, from the East Coast, from the Pacific Northwest, uh, a lot from Arizona and surrounding states, obviously. I, uh, we have school groups.

that are busing people in from out of state even. I know [00:04:00] even Rigby Idaho, I just learned, is bringing almost 100 students down from Rigby High School, which is just really cool. So this, this event is, it has several audiences. You know, Operation Literacy, we've, we've done programming and support events for teens and tweens, like you mentioned, but also educators.

And so, and it seems that every event that we do, we have parents and aspiring adult writers who are interested in sitting in on classes. And how do I, how do I pretend to be a teenager? So I can come to teen author boot camp and, and StoryCon is really the answer to that question. So, so we have four tracks.

Uh, one for teens, one for tweens, one for educators, and then one for the general public. And a lot of the teens and tweens that come to StoryCon, I feel like as adults we need permission to follow our dreams sometimes. These kids, they don't need it. They, like you said, they, they know what they love. [00:05:00] They read.

Um, they watch movies and they, they want to change the ending of stories. They want to invent characters in their minds. They, they imagine what worlds would look like if, and, and those are the people we attract at StoryCon and formerly. Teen author boot camp.

**Charlie Deist:** I want to come back to StoryCon, but first, for a minute, I just want to hear a little bit about Kind of your journey towards, , founding this organization and, and starting this event that is attracting, you know, so many people from all over the country, you have talked and written a little bit about some of your sort of early struggles with reading and the like, and I think that this is a very common refrain that we hear from open ed parents that, you know, their kids are, you know, they're really smart kids, but yeah.

For whatever reason they're they're sort of struggling with reading. Um, tell us about sort of your story and your journey

**Jennifer Jenkins:** Yeah, so I, I always loved story, Charlie. I always loved story. [00:06:00] That was never the problem. I, I moved a lot growing up. I felt like I was always in a car and my dad would retell novels and, or we would listen to Alfred Hitchcock. Tapes cassette tapes, which just absolutely ages me. But one, one thing that, um, so that was universal.

That was never the problem. I'd love to be read too, but I, I did struggle with words. I struggled with dyslexia as a child. I was undiagnosed for, um, most of my, my, uh, well into my adult life, I was actually graduating from college with a degree in history and, and secondary education. And I, it was a teacher who identified my.

Dyslexia in a class that was meant to help teachers learn how to identify learning disabilities in their students. And we were doing a unit on dyslexia and she was telling my story and I went up to her after this class and I said, I think I'm dyslexic and I've never been diagnosed. And I, I [00:07:00] got good grades in college.

I have a very, very good memory. And I loved history because I could listen to a lecture and typically regurgitate. dates and, and facts that I needed to, to test well. But I, I really struggled with reading, which is ironic because that is a very reading intensive major, but long story short, I, I ended up learning that I was in fact dyslexic and it changed the way I thought about reading.

And I thought that that was so interesting that, uh, the, The, the impressions that we give children, the stories that they tell themselves rather about who they are and what they are, are so powerful. Uh, I had been telling myself that I wasn't a good reader, that there was something wrong with me. And that in this way, I was not very intelligent.

And that was a story I believed and really subscribed to. But once I had that label. That once I realized that I wasn't, it wasn't a problem with, with how smart I [00:08:00] was, it was actually an issue that my brain worked differently and I needed to work around the way my brain was wired to find those words.

And once I started to really attack that and address it in a, in a way that didn't feel like, Oh, I'm just stupid. And I started to fall in love with reading, which is just miraculous. And then years later started to publish. And so that's, that's kind of where I come to, uh, operation literacy from. There are so many kids out there who have decided that they are not readers, but who like me love story.

And that's what StoryCon is for them too. In fact, we have in our expo hall, we have an organization called Operation Read not to be confused with Operation Literacy. They are a sister and a partner of ours, but they are doing free screenings. To help parents and children identify learning disabilities, uh, they're doing it in our expo hall at story con and our expo hall [00:09:00] is free to the general public.

So, even if you are not interested in purchasing 1 of our conference tracks. You can come to the Expo Hall. All of our signings are free to the general public. So Jeff Kinney, if you want to go get a picture with Jeff Kinney, come. Uh, we know that a child is 80 percent more likely to pick up a book if they have met the author.

And so that's a very powerful statistic that, that really, uh, we turn children into readers at StoryCon.

**Charlie Deist:** It is funny how you Develop a relationship with the characters of the book in the course of reading it. But um, the the author is Kind of in the background and they're a little bit hidden, speak a little bit about the role of, of mentors and mentorship and, and being seen, like, how, how do you see kids responding to, uh, to, you know, meeting these authors in person beyond being more likely to, to read the books?

**Jennifer Jenkins:** Well, we know that when you put a [00:10:00] presenter an astronaut even in front of an author. I mean, in front of a child, that's why career days are so poignant, right? If you put, if you put a, a figure in front of a child and they see that they're human, they see that they, they, you know, have loves and fears and interests and they're just a normal person.

It kind of takes away some of the, the stigma or the idea that I could never be dot, dot, dot. Uh, and so that's one thing. I also think that when you have. An individual who is willing to validate and mentor these kids, uh, it's, it's extremely powerful. I know I started writing and believing in myself as a writer as a child, because I had a teacher who's told me in the margins of a story.

I'd written. You are a good writer. And so with operation literacy, 1 of our main, um, focuses is how we are validating the young writer. That is coming through the ranks in this next [00:11:00] generation. And we do that in several ways. We have lots of different opportunities for, for teens and tweens to engage with operation literacy and contests.

And we have multiple, I think we have three contests that close on February 1st. So this will probably be after this podcast airs, but you can look to it in the future. We also publish 50 teams a year, um, 25 in our short story anthology. and 25 in our poetry collection. And we put these, these Aspiring writers and talented young authors.

We put them through a traditional publishing process where they are given a payment for their writing. They are given the opportunity to go through editorial, the editorial process, and then they are, you know. They have a launch party at a reception at our, in conjunction with our annual gala. And then they actually are put on stage at our gala and we [00:12:00] celebrate them.

So just that validating is really, is really powerful. I feel like we get that a lot for, for students who are in sports. For students who are interested in, in dance or theater, even there's, we have lots of opportunities to, to give them an opportunity to, uh, socially to, to put their, their skills and their accomplishments, uh, out there and, and to be, to be seen and elevated.

And so when, you know, when we have the opportunity to, to provide awards and things like that, it's extremely validating. Um,

**Charlie Deist:** And, and you have published, I think, seven novels yourself. Is that the right count to date? Or, uh, are there any others in the works right now? What, what's your sort of creative process like from, from idea to finally getting it published and getting it out there?

**Jennifer Jenkins:** yeah, I have seven works of fiction. And then I have one nonfiction, so I have eight published works. [00:13:00] My creative process is, is complicated and different every time I write a book, it feels, I, I, I feel like most stories exist in the words, what if, and we're inspired by the people that we meet, you know, the locations that we visit and, or maybe even high concepts, you know, we're inspired by technology, we're inspired by all sorts of things culturally and, and for example, one of my novels, Was inspired by a picture that I had seen of Manarola, Italy.

And I, I don't know how I stumbled across this picture online, but I was looking at it and I just couldn't pull my eyes from this picture. And I thought a story happens here. And, and so that was very setting driven, but I have had other stories that have leaned into my history degree a little bit, even though they're fantasy novels, uh, what if questions, right?

So, what if [00:14:00] these different cultures that existed at different times in our. Uh, in our history, what if these select cultures all lived in one region and in one time, how would they interact and what, what chaos would ensue? And so that was my nameless series. So it's, I think they come from all over the place, but yeah,

**Charlie Deist:** What's the role of sort of just curiosity? Do you ever have a, a topic that you sort of, you know, you want to. Explore it more deeply and that that kind of pulls you in to the novel. I mean, that's one of the things that we find with, uh, with motivation and learning is that it's, you know, having the skin in the game or the inherent curiosity is often one of the biggest drivers of Making the learning actually stick.

It's one thing to, you know, put a book in front of someone, uh, and say, you know, read these chapters by this date. It's another to, to kind of light the fire in the mind. ,

**Jennifer Jenkins:** to present a [00:15:00] question or encourage questioning, right? Like to allow, I feel like. I know that, um, you know, I write primarily fiction and so often my husband will come in. He's like, what are you working on? I'm like, I'm doing research and he's like, are you writing or are you doing research? And I'm like, yes.

Exactly. That's what I'm doing. I, I, I spent so much time going down rabbit holes and trying to understand culture and people and technologies and history, even though I, I'm not writing about that specifically, but usually, um, in fact, Charlie Holmberg. teaches a class called great ideas and where to find them.

And she's actually coming to StoryCon and is just a brilliant author, but she, she talks about the Wikipedia. There's a, there's a term that she uses, but basically the concept is, you know, diving into a subject on Wikipedia or another [00:16:00] scholarly journal site and resource site and, and then finding.

Additional resources listed and then clicking on one of those and then exploring further. And by the time from start to finish, you, you end up in a completely different place than you started before. But that's, that's a great way to generate ideas and also to learn. I, I think we've, it's proven that we want to learn the things that we're curious about.

And, and I think that that's what, that's what's so great about the open ed model is. Is that ability for your students to, to explore because that's really where learning happens.

**Charlie Deist:** Yeah. And, and bear with me here while I try to kind of flesh out this, this. seedling of a thought in real time. But, but I'm, I'm the, the idea of world building is coming to my mind. I've never written any nonfiction of any fiction before. It's, it's a sort of foreign art to me, but I imagine that there's a whole lot of prep work that would go into [00:17:00] just building out this, this world.

And it's rooted. If you're writing about a certain place, you have to do that research to know. What is this world? I know, you know, J. R. R. Tolkien spent huge amounts of time even constructing whole languages from thin air to create this vivid world. And people have the experience of coming into that world.

It's not escapism, but it is a portal into something that gets us out of our sort of everyday reality.

**Jennifer Jenkins:** And it feels real because of that research that they've done, even if the writer, if the writer has a soft hand in the way that they're unfolding their world building, the, the elements that make up their world, then, then it's actually extremely enjoyable for, for the reader to uncover these details, some things that come to mind, you know, when I teach world building, I always, I, I go back to that history degree and what are the fundamental Things that make up a civilization and, and that [00:18:00] includes the obvious, right?

Like languages and economy and, um, religion and, and topography, geography, all of that, but how do, how do they trade goods? What are the commodities that are valued here? What are the ideals? That are valued here, and how would that why are they valued? Usually it's a chicken and an egg situation. Either the author comes up with the idea.

I want a society that values eggs. I'm just throwing that out there, but, um, okay. So why would they value eggs? Well. Maybe they're very rare here. Why are they rare? Well, because, you know, and so you follow this, this rabbit hole of, of thought into what usually ends up being really cool plot ideas that support, you know, a beautiful, well fleshed out world.

And the more the author seems to know about their world and how it ticks and the little minutiae details. [00:19:00] The more enjoyable it is for the reader. I know I felt that way with Tolkien. I felt that way with J. Kerr Rowling too, where I've, I feel like this world absolutely exists. Um, how could it not?

There's a ministry of magic and there's textbooks and there's, you know, historians and all of these elements that just feel so well, um, just multidimensional. It's, it's awesome.

**Charlie Deist:** right. I mean, I think almost not everyone. I, I feel sorry for the people who, uh, for whatever reason were not yet been sucked in or initiated into the, the world of, of Harry Potter. Because for me, I know, I think I, I read that, um, that was the first full length. Book that you read and I think the same was probably true for me Um, and I remember, you know Actually, my sister had checked it out from the library and there was a long wait list.

My sister was two years older So she she got the book first and uh, I just you know I picked it up I was hearing a little bit of buzz and and I read the first few pages and didn't put it [00:20:00] down for You know our and then I think I snuck it into my room and and she didn't know where it went but uh, but but that idea of it's like you get the sense that even if the author isn't Shining a magnifying glass or a flashlight on some other area, they're really the way that they focus in with so much detail on the plot points gives you the sense that every other aspect of this world already exists and has been thought through by the author, even if we don't get to see it.

**Jennifer Jenkins:** A hundred percent. And, and, you know, when I teach classes, I, I really try to, uh, about world building in general, I really try to focus on what part of the story, what is the negative space? What part of the story are you not telling that you're alluding to, or you're hinting at? That ignites that curiosity in the reader.

We don't maybe identify it if we're not looking for it. But in stories, it's the little nuggets that are included by the author that make you go, I [00:21:00] wonder what. That story is about and or how that came to be, but the author doesn't actually even go down that road. It just gives you enough to make you curious and enough to make you assume that surely there is a story here.

And surely the author knows the answer to that story. I think Sanderson is, is prolific at this. He is, he's honestly just. amazing at at putting those nuggets of information. I can't tell you how many times I've read a Sanderson novel and thought, I bet that this little element, this little seed that he's planted here is going to become a novel in five years.

And I've been proven right on two occasions so far. So he's, he's just amazing.

**Charlie Deist:** So I had an experience when I was younger of trying to write fiction, and I never managed to get past sort of the first chapter, my initial enthusiasm. Would peter out and and in hindsight I have an inkling for why that might have been [00:22:00] and I think it's partly because I sort of lacked Frameworks or templates or, I, I, I lack the, the understanding of the architecture.

And as much as people like to think of creative writing as this very sort of freeform thing in my nonfiction writing and, and work, I've always found that having a framework or a template gives me a container in which I can actually be a lot more creative. It sounds like the different, talks and the tracks at this event, what you guys are putting together.

Part of that, like, how do you give an introduction or what kinds of tools and frameworks are there? How do you, how do you think about the balance between just letting a child's innate curiosity run wild and then Learning some of the tips and tricks of the trade which there are many good in that I don't know what they are, but I know that there they must be there

**Jennifer Jenkins:** Yeah. There's so many, there's, there's a lot of, just like with any, Any, um, you know, medium, there's a lot of rules, right? They, [00:23:00] there are industry rules that are accepted and that are, uh, considered standard, you know, every story needs a beginning, a middle and an end, a 1st, act. And, you know, there, there are several structural, uh, scaffolding.

rules that really help writers, like you were saying. But one thing that we always try to focus on and a good author will tell you is great authors have to understand what those rules are so they can break them effectively. They can break them with intention. And so that's, that's one thing that we talk a lot about at, at teen author bootcamps in the past and now StoryKind.

We have classes that, that talk about effective dialogue and, um, Different plotting structures and how, how plotting and, and panting or writing by the seat of your pants, how you can, how you can write a story and be one or the other and do it effectively. Uh, we talk [00:24:00] about character development and the absolute necessity of motivation and stakes.

We talk about tension and creating suspense. In writing and how to, how to write a mystery. We, we try to give as much guidance as we possibly can with room for our, our attendees and our audience to know that these rules should be broken. Every now and then, not always, but every now and then, you know, those people that take the creative risk and, and they've really do it with an intention and with a strategy attached to it, they are the stories that we are that we've talked about in this.

Um, and then we have a lot of characters that are not in this discussion so far. Uh, ironically they are, they are the risk takers. So, so yeah, you have to know the rules to break them and we definitely try to instill at least a foundation of what, what you need to know to write a novel or a screenplay or, or, [00:25:00] um, a playwright, you know, any, any of these things we, we focus on at storycon.

**Charlie Deist:** Well, being in the presence of a seasoned storyteller, I feel like I'd be remiss if I didn't take the opportunity to sort of Follow a bit of my curiosity with something that I've been thinking about a lot with open ed's overall sort of content and, uh, and our, we have an internal document called our strategic narrative and, um, one of the influences behind that is, uh, a marketing, I guess you could call him kind of a guru named Donald Miller,

**Jennifer Jenkins:** I love that Miller. I teach

**Charlie Deist:** a story

**Jennifer Jenkins:** on nominal mother.

**Charlie Deist:** Right. And, and he lays out this roadmap that's based on screenwriting principles for, but for brands, for companies to, to make it crystal clear to your audience, what it is that you offer, you know, in, in language that's simple enough that a caveman could kind of grunt at it and understand what it is.

How do you think about the, the operation literacy and StoryCon narrative? [00:26:00] What's, what's the story that you're telling, uh, behind this event?

**Jennifer Jenkins:** Do you know, we have like a full story branded document for each one of our programs and everything. And I'm feeling like I'm going to fumble this football here on the spot, but, but mostly, StoryCon is a place. for the aspiring author to find their community and to find the tools that they need to succeed to avoid burnout and writer's block and all of those things that tend to trip up the writer when when they're working in a silo.

I, I had the opportunity recently to, to sit down with one of our alum. Uh, alumni. He is named Jonas Sterling and he works actually on one of our committees right now. He's, he's awesome and he published with us last year. He's just been amazing. And I, I, I asked him that question. I said, what would you say is the number 1 takeaway?

What is the thing? What is our why? And [00:27:00] what is our, what is our statement of purpose? And he said, I loved story. I loved ideas, but I felt like I was the only one and it's such an isolated. Um, pastime, right? Uh, it's something we do on our own, typically. He said, when I walked into that room and I saw a thousand teenagers who loved what I loved, it was instantly validating.

It made me feel like I was a part of something that was bigger than myself. It made me excited to know that I would be able to bounce ideas off of these people and, and, um, grow. Together with these people. Whereas before this was such, you know, kind of like something that he did in on his own time in his own, you know, room.

And, and I think that that's probably the biggest takeaway. There is a synergy that comes from, from getting in this space with creatives and networking with them [00:28:00] and, and learning from each other that that is just impossible to do on your own. You can read a hundred books and you can not have that match that experience.

So So I would say community. Yeah. See, I told you I

**Charlie Deist:** the power of community and especially those in person connections. I know that people can consume the content from the event after the fact. And I think that's sort of what 1 way that we've offered open ed families in the past access to this amazing content. Because if you're.

You know, we might as well get that that extra leverage out of it. Another parallel that I'll draw to the open Ed ethos is that so many parents who have been pursuing a sort of unorthodox education plan for their kid feel like they're. Alone in this journey that they're, you know, fighting an uphill battle against judgment from other families from sort of the, the society at [00:29:00] large, and I would just put in sort of as the message, our message that we're trying to bring to story con is that if you're a young person.

Who, for whatever reason, is, is not thriving in your current educational environment, and you are wanting to put more of your, your effort behind your curiosity, follow your, your passion for writing, uh, and literature, you can do that, and, and you don't have to just follow what the crowd's doing. You can actually find your own tribe.

And hopefully we'll, we'll be able to connect with those kinds of families at StoryCon and we're really just so grateful that you're putting, all this effort into building a community that, that we get to, tap into in that way.

**Jennifer Jenkins:** We love OpenEd. We love what you guys are doing. And we found that a lot of our, a lot of our, uh, participants. Our homeschooled students who are, and pods and, and different groups that are trying to supplement their, their [00:30:00] curriculum. And man, I can't think of a better way to do it. Come, come to StoryCon, come and, come and sit at, uh, the feet of some, some literary giants and, and, uh, make some great connections.

I can tell you personally that I, my little writers group. That started Operation Literacy eons ago. We were a group of writers that met at a community writing event. That's how we met. And, and I feel like a lot of good comes from, from the opportunity to come and connect with your peers and come in and learn together with them.

So thank you so much, Charlie. Thanks for having me and thanks for, for, to OpenEd for, for the collaboration. We're thrilled to host you.

**Charlie Deist:** You heard it come sit at the feet of the greats. And if your feet get tired walking around the exhibition hall, you can come and sit in our little reading lounge at the open ed booth in the hall, whether you're just coming for the, hall or the full [00:31:00] experience, we'll have links in the show notes for anyone that's interested in attending the event, but highly recommend it.

Jennifer looking forward to meeting you in person and thank you.

**Jennifer Jenkins:** Thank you.
