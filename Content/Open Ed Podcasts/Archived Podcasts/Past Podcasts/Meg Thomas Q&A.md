**Clip 1:**

> “People are thinking something's off and they just... a new curriculum or they throw something else at it. I'm like, no — we actually need to just fix the foundation.”

**Clip 2:**

> “You don't have a lot of control over things that your children do and say... but one of the things that you do have control over that makes a humongous impact is the home.”

**Clip 3:**

> “We don't need to come in yelling and get really angry at everybody, but I'm in control of myself.”

**Clip 4:**

> “The behavior triangle is: example, teach, and praise.”

**Clip 5 (Final punch):**

> “You don't have to be perfect at this. Kids are very forgiving.”
