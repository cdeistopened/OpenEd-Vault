        Speakers: Stop wasting people's time with small talk 🔥  
          
        When someone gives you their attention, they're literally giving you a portion of their LIFESPAN.  
          
        Don't fumble it with "thank you for having me" and all those filler words.  
          
        BE A THERMOSTAT. SET THE TEMPERATURE.  
          
        Come in there and SET IT OFF from the jump. Set the tone. When you do that? They start raising their temperature to match YOURS.  
          
        I gave this advice recently on the @openedhq podcast. They're building a movement of engaged parents transforming their kids education.  
          
        But this applies whether you're:  
        → Speaking to a crowd of thousands  
        → Defending your parenting choices at a family dinner  
        → Advocating for your kid's education  
        → Having any conversation that matters  
          
        Don't reflect the energy in the room. CREATE the energy you want.  
          
        People don't move unless they're moved emotionally. It don't matter what facts you got. Move them FIRST.

        ```Plain
        "What if there was a different way to have my child self-direct their own learning?"
        
        That question changed everything for our family.
        
        I couldn't unhear it after Matt Bowman planted that seed. Here I was, a transformation speaker who helps people break free from limiting systems, but I was accepting traditional school as the only option for my kids.
        
        When Matt suggested I could pull them out for educational adventures, my first thought was: "This dude is trying to get my kids expelled."
        
        But that "what if" question sat with me.
        
        What if it wasn't career suicide or sabotage? What if it wasn't closing doors or shutting down opportunities? What if it was actually one of the most powerful, empowering things we could do?
        
        So we tested it.
        
        The result? My kids are way smarter. They listen to my business calls in the car and are ready to run companies. They've seen the Grand Canyon. They missed more school than the attendance secretary wanted but maintained honor roll and student council leadership.
        
        Most importantly, they learned they have a say in their future.
        
        The law of exposure is real: the mind when stretched never returns to its original form.
        
        What "what if" question might be sitting with you about your child's education?
        ```
