📍 📍 📍 📍 And I remember having this moment where I was in college and realized I'm learning so much on the job, working for this small business and getting paid to do it.

And then I'm turning around and paying all of my money to go to classes and no one wants to be at there. When class was canceled, everyone would celebrate, including the professor. And I'm like, what other good do you pay for in advance and then you're happy when it's not delivered? Right. So, so like, what are people paying for if they don't want the classes?

And I was coming to this realization that it's this credential they want. They want the piece of paper that's going to signal something about their value to the world. And so I thought, okay, well I understand that. But then I looked around. I remember looking around the classroom one day and seeing, you know, it's typical big generic state university.

People are hung over and not paying attention. And I thought, "Oh, I'm really buying is a piece of paper that tells the world what I'm no worse than the rest of these people." I mean, I guess that says something, but like, is that really the best signal I can come up with?

📍 📍 📍 Sometimes educators take on this doctorate of education standpoint and they are diagnosing and prescribing like doctors do in health care. And that to me is, is backwards. Let's start with the child, math is one of those things that many kids struggle with. As it turns out, when you offer them multiple curriculum options you can say now to the child, "It's not you. It's the curriculum." And for the 1st time

they say, "Oh, you mean I'm not dumb? I'm not bad at math? It's just I haven't found the curriculum that clicks with my brain yet." And when we try and try and try a different version, and then all of a sudden one clicks and the child's lightbulbs go off. It's the curriculum not the child. And math is one of those things that needs to embrace that, to not have kids blame themselves.

📍 📍 📍 OpenEd started with seeing our children all needed something different, charter school, district school. And so my wife and I thought, Hey, we imagine other parents have experienced a need for different options for their children too.

Let's see if we can do this for other families and said, "Hey, if I contract with school districts, I can help families access world class education at no cost to them."

We didn't want to launch a private academy. For wealthy families. I wanted to really arm and enable low to middle income families to have excellent choices in education also.

We started the first year with 92 students. Our youngest had seen us do all this of all her older siblings, but she has a good group of friends. She was a three sport athlete. And she just said, I'm just going to go traditional district high school.

Christmas break of her junior year. She pulls my wife and I aside and says, "Can I do OpenEd from now on? Like I'm exhausted. This is not working out for me. My friends are all on anxiety medication for tests. The pressure is crazy. I'm forgetting stuff."

And so immediately we enrolled her in our mid year OpenEd program and we said start on your college. We have an early college competency based program where it's mastered or not yet. So she ended up finishing her associate degree and taking a couple classes at her local boundary high school with her friends and then she still was a 3 sport athlete.

## Introduction and Podcast Theme

**Isaac**: Our core theme is that every individual is different, yet many educational approaches treat them as if they aren't. We believe all types of education should be on the table. We're exploring all approaches to education, whether in the classroom, out of the classroom, online, in person, one-on-one, or group setting. Our thesis is that every individual should have access to all these options to use when and where they make sense for them.

**Matt**: We really do embrace all forms of learning. It's open for all, and we need to figure out how to do that for everybody.

## Matt's Background and Early Experiences in Education

**Matt**: I was born to educator parents. My mom was a high school teacher who taught tech and business, while my dad was an electrical engineering professor. We were always surrounded by technology and learning. At 17, I started my first education company—a backyard all-sports camp for neighborhood kids. It taught me the value of education and helping kids learn, both as a way to do good and as a business opportunity.

**Isaac**: Matt, you were also an exceptional basketball player in high school. How did sports fit in with your education?

**Matt**: My parents always encouraged me to be active and play sports. The things you learn in sports are applicable to the academic world. Interestingly, despite being an academic all-American, my lowest grade was in PE because I couldn't meet their long-distance running thresholds. This experience probably contributed to my belief that it's insane to judge someone on something that comes naturally to others but not to them. It highlighted the need for personalized approaches in education.

## Matt's College Experience and Career Path

**Matt**: I got a scholarship offer from a junior college to play basketball. Our team ended up being seventh in the nation. In high school, I focused on scoring, but in college, I focused all my energy on defense and ended up getting a defensive player of the year award.

After a two-year church mission in Uruguay, I realized how enjoyable I found teaching. I decided to pursue a teaching career instead of continuing with basketball. I chose elementary education, inspired by my fourth-grade teacher who was a great influence.

I ended up getting my master's degree in education focused on the forgotten child from 10 to 14 years old. This middle level child became something I became passionate about. My own master's degree was focused on helping that middle school child from ages 10 to 14.

## The Importance of Middle School Education (Ages 10-14)

**Matt**: You change most in your life between those ages, except zero to three. And you think of how much you change from birth to three years old. That's the changes going on between a 10 to 14 year old. I'd have parents show up and just say, "If you can do anything with my child, good luck," and walk out the school. We'd have just a great time. It was a great experience. And that's really where I fell in love with education for life.

**Isaac**: I have actually never come across that concept of that 10 to 14 window being so crucial. When I think about my own experience homeschooling my kids and being homeschooled, it's not uncommon that out-of-the-box approaches to education can work okay in very early years and high school years. But when you really feel that this out-of-the-box version of education is not fitting your child, it usually starts around that 10 to 14 age. That's when the real pain starts to come together.

**Matt**: One of the reasons standardized education doesn't work for the 10 to 14 year old is because these two kids are absolutely normal: one is 6’ 4” inches and one is 4’ 6” inches. They're statistically normal, but yet there's such a range. There are kids that are driving cars when other kids are still playing with cars. Same with dating and playing with dolls. They're all totally developmentally normal. How do you set a standardized system for that range of developmental differences? You just can't. So personalization is the essential step when children are changing that much.

## Bringing the Internet into the Classroom (Mid-1990s)

**Isaac**: I remember you saying a couple of times that you started bringing the internet into the classroom in the mid-nineties. What prompted that?

**Matt**: I was a sixth grade teacher up in Washington state. The state announced a grant to any teacher who wanted to learn how to bring this new thing called the internet into their classroom. Most teachers grumbled at it. You can imagine just saying, "No, the internet. I don't want that in my room." It's almost like today we're saying people don't want phones in classrooms. It's the greatest educational access device you have, and we're saying, "Let's shut it off and remove it from kids."

I jumped at it. My classroom was filled with computers, all internet enabled. We started doing tech-based projects and I saw student engagement go off the charts. Because now when they did a project and I said, "We're going to share it with our sister school in Germany," the kids would spend after-school time making their project look even better. They would take so much time to get it right and make the animations look really good and the graphics look well. They were learning all these skills of edit, design, develop prototype, things that we dream of kids learning. The internet and project-based curriculum was able to help them do that.

## Isaac's Personal Education Journey

**Isaac**: My story is in many ways very different from yours, but there's so much overlap. I grew up homeschooled in the early eighties when it was legally questionable in Michigan. My mom happened to be a certified teacher. We had a very vibrant homeschool community with sports teams and various activities.

When I was 14, I wanted to be with people my age all day long. I went to a small private school for my sophomore year of high school. There were things I loved about it, but after being homeschooled for so long and being really independent, I remember thinking, "Why are these 50-minute classes no matter how fast or slow I learn? What if I'm done in 10? What if it takes me two hours?"

So I went to community college full-time for my junior and senior year of high school. I actually loved community college as a high school experience because I had more control over my schedule. Although I did not feel that most of the classes were translating into getting a job someday.

In college, I realized I was learning so much on the job, working for a small business and getting paid to do it. And then I'm turning around and paying all of my money to go to classes, and no one wants to be there. When class was canceled, everyone would celebrate, including the professor. I thought, "What other good do you pay for in advance and then you're happy when it's not delivered?"

## The Origin Story of My Tech High (now Open Ed)

**Matt**: Open Ed started when we realized our children all needed different educational approaches. We thought, "Other parents must need this too." So we decided to help families access world-class education at no cost to them by contracting with school districts or charter schools.

We started with 92 pioneer students, focusing on tech and entrepreneurship. When I asked parents about their favorite curriculum providers, we got 92 different answers. That's when I thought, "Could our model be 'choose your own adventure' for curriculum by subject, course, child, and grade level?" Instead of standardization, we decided to partner with every best curriculum provider out there.

## Letting Children Choose Their Education Path

**Isaac**: Did it feel scary to let your kids choose their education path?

**Matt**: It was actually liberating. We provided guidance but wanted them to take ownership. Our oldest chose a charter school with his friend. Our third child later decided he preferred the district middle school. We realized it was okay to have kids in different schools, as long as it fit their needs.

## The Flexibility of Education Rules and Norms

**Isaac**: Many people don't realize how flexible educational rules can be. I've seen this with job applications too - people assume a college degree requirement is set in stone, but it's often just a guideline.

**Matt**: Exactly. When my daughter finished her associate degree during high school, we asked if she could walk at graduation despite not following the traditional path. The school analyzed her achievements and agreed. It shows that many rules are just norms, not strict laws.

**Isaac**: This flexibility extends to many areas. I often tell people I don't have a high school diploma, and they're surprised. But I got a college degree and jobs - no one ever asked for my diploma. People often take rules for granted without questioning them.

## The Value of Family Time in Education

**Matt**: Many parents tell me that choosing our program has brought them back to family dinner and enjoyable conversations in the evening. It used to be just riding them hard for homework, with kids slamming doors and exhaustion. Now, that relationship is so much stronger for child and parent.

**Isaac**: When COVID happened, many parents said, "I have gotten to see things about my kids that I never knew. I've gotten to have conversations with them. I've gotten to enjoy and appreciate them in ways that I didn't know were possible."

Even if they are in traditional school, there are often ways to say, "What if they had more time? What if I didn't push them so hard to do all these arbitrary things that aren't helping them, but are only causing stress. And we had more time together. How valuable is that?"

## Real-World Learning Experiences

**Isaac**: I spent a lot of time with my grandparents when they were building a house. I didn't become a handyman, but I learned so much just watching my grandpa's decision-making process, negotiating with people, and even some lessons on what not to do, like his temper.

I think about that with my own kids. Imagine if they're up in their room just doing some "train went from Boston at 60 miles an hour" assignments all night long versus coming with me to Home Depot while my wife and I argue about which kind of tile we need in our kitchen. That's actually a really interesting experience. It's interpersonal communication, it's budgeting, it's cost-benefit analysis, it's trade-offs, it's how to get along with your spouse when you have a house project. These things are actually more important than doing one more story problem for the 10th time.

## The Founding Principles of Open Ed

**Matt**: Open Ed started with seeing our children all needed something different. We imagine other parents have experienced a need for different options for their children too. That's really was the foundation of the start of My Tech High. Let's see if we can do this for other families that we have done for ourselves.

We didn't want to launch a private academy for wealthy families. They already have almost ultimate choice already. I wanted to really arm and enable low to middle-income families to have excellent choices in education also.

**Isaac**: And that entrepreneurial insight is what the company was founded on, and that's what it's still the core today. You go to these parents and 92 parents give you 92 different things when you say what's the best curriculum and your answer to that was "yes, let's do all of it."

This platform of, hey, we'll partner with a public or charter school. You can come in and kid by kid, you pick period by period what you're going to do. Maybe it's a course that we built. Maybe it's a course from another online provider. Maybe it's a local tutor in your area. Maybe it's something that you're doing yourself at home. Being able to just say whatever you need to build, you build it and we want to provide that platform and provide you with resources and give you access to some of these courses free of charge as much as possible and help you cover that.

## The Importance of Curriculum Flexibility

**Matt**: Math is one of those things that many kids struggle with. When you offer them multiple curriculum options, you can say to the child, "It's not you. It's the curriculum." And for the first time, they say, "I'm not dumb. I'm not bad at math. It's just, I haven't found the curriculum that clicks with my brain yet."

When we try a different version, and then all of a sudden one clicks, the child's light bulbs go off. It's the curriculum, not the child. And math is one of those things that needs to embrace that, to not have kids blame themselves.

**Isaac**: That's so cool because it's typically in education, people are passionate about education, myself included. We come in with very strong points of view on what should be taught and how it should be taught. And that's okay. Like everyone has those. You have a strong point of view that entrepreneurship and tech need to get more focus than they get for most people. And that point of view comes into Open Ed a little bit, right? It's definitely emphasized somewhat.

But I love this idea of, "Hey, look, I don't want to fall prey to the fatal conceit that I know what's good for everybody. Yeah, maybe I have some opinions, but how about we create this platform where you can go and what you want to do for each kid at each time, go ahead. And we want to try to help facilitate that." That is the core of what we're doing.

**Matt**: Sometimes educators take on this doctorate of education standpoint, and they are diagnosing and prescribing like doctors do in healthcare. And that to me is backwards. Let's start with the child, and that leads to this other example of math. For the first time, they say, "Oh, you mean I'm not dumb. I'm not bad at math. It's just, I haven't found the curriculum that clicks with my brain yet."

**Isaac**: Oh, I love it. I love it. You're getting me really hyped. So I'm going to bring this around to a close. We are definitely going to have a round two with the two of us because we've kind of done a historical overview. There's so many things I'd like to pick your brain on.

### Introduction to the Open Ed Podcast [00:00:00]

**Isaac Morehouse:** Welcome to the first-ever episode of the Open Ed podcast. Our show explores all kinds of education experiences and innovations, but it all comes back to one core idea: every individual is different.

That's not much of a shocker, but a lot of what we do in education treats students as if they're all the same. We believe all types of education should be on the table. We're not picking favorites or endorsing particular approaches on this show. We're not going to be pro-Montessori or anti-Montessori, or for unschooling or against it. We're exploring all these different ways to learn, whether in the classroom, out of the classroom, online, in-person, one-on-one, or in groups.

There are so many different ways to help a child or anyone learn, and we want to know about all of them. Our big idea is that everyone should have access to all these options, to use when and where they make sense.

This leads to something that looks very different from a one-size-fits-all approach. Even within one family, even for one kid from one year to the next, needs change and education should change with them. That's what we're all about - opening up those possibilities.

I'm really excited to kick off this first episode with Matt, the founder of Open Ed, the company behind this podcast. Before we get into the company story, I want to start with Matt's personal story. I want to hear about his upbringing, his own educational experience, and how he became a teacher. Then we'll lead up to the start of My Tech High, which is now Open Ed.

### Meet Matt: The Founder of Open Ed [02:19]

**Matt Bowman:** My background starts with my parents, who were both educators. My mom was a high school teacher. She taught tech and business. People I run into from 30 years ago still say her class was their most valuable because she taught them how to type.

My dad was an electrical engineering professor in college. So we were always surrounded by technology and learning. Education has always been a huge part of who I am, and I can trace that back to my parents.

I started my first education company when I was 17. I just loved helping kids learn. I started a little backyard all-sports camp during the summer for neighborhood kids. I taught them basketball, soccer, volleyball, and set up obstacle courses.

I made some money from it, but more importantly, I saw the value of education and helping kids learn. It was both a way to do good and a potential business. All these foundational experiences from my youth shaped my path.

### Matt's Early Life and Educational Background [03:09]

**Isaac Morehouse:** Now, I know you don't like to brag, but I have to mention your impressive sports background. You still hold a couple of records for Utah high school basketball, including shooting 74 percent from the field in one year. That's incredible.

Sports must have been a big part of your life. How did you balance that with education? If you're playing at that level, you must have spent a lot of time on sports. Did your educator parents ever worry you were neglecting your studies?

**Matt Bowman:** Sports were definitely a big part of my life, but my parents never saw it as competing with my education. They always encouraged me to be active and play sports.

My mom actually played some sports in college. My dad was more of a computer guy, but he'd come out and shoot hoops with me sometimes. He likes to tell the story of when I got old enough to beat him at 'Around the World'. He says that was the last time he played with me because I never missed and he never got a chance to shoot.

I played all kinds of sports throughout my life and really believe that the things you learn in sports apply to the academic world too. It's funny, though - with all my sports achievements, my lowest grade in high school was actually in PE. I couldn't run the mile or two-mile under their time thresholds, so I'd get an F on those tests.

That experience probably contributed to my belief that it's crazy to judge everyone by the same standard. If they'd graded me on shooting hoops, I'd have gotten an A+, but that wasn't part of the PE grade. It was an early lesson in how one-size-fits-all approaches don't work in education.

### College and Career Decisions [07:58]

**Isaac Morehouse:** Let's talk about your college experience and what came after. How did you approach your career decisions in your late teens and early twenties? Did you consider pursuing sports further into college?

**Matt Bowman:** Coming out of high school, I got a scholarship offer from a junior college to play basketball. I played college ball for a year and loved it. Our team ended up ranking seventh in the nation, and we traveled all over.

It was interesting how my role changed. In high school, I focused on scoring. But in college, as a small forward, I shifted my energy to defense. I ended up getting a defensive player of the year award, even though I hardly ever scored. It was a great experience in adapting to new roles.

After that year, I decided to go on a church mission to Uruguay for two years. Before my mission, I had planned to major in mechanical engineering. But during my mission, I discovered how much I enjoyed teaching. We spent our days teaching people about our faith, and I found it incredibly fulfilling.

When I returned home, I realized my career path had shifted. I wanted to become a teacher. I had the opportunity to play another year of college ball, but I faced a decision: continue playing or focus on my education degree.

At this point, I should mention that I got married that summer. My wife and I decided together that I should focus on my academic career and starting our family. Playing college sports is all-consuming, and I realized I wasn't going to go pro. So I chose education over basketball.

I pursued an elementary education degree, inspired by my fourth-grade teacher, who was one of the greatest teachers in my life. He's still working as an administrator at a low-income school in Salt Lake City, and he remains a hero of mine.

After graduating, I got a job as a sixth-grade teacher. That's where my journey in education really began to take shape.

### Bringing the Internet into the Classroom [15:45]

**Isaac Morehouse:** I remember you mentioning that you started bringing the internet into the classroom in the mid-90s. What prompted that? What insight made you think, "I need to start incorporating this into my classroom"?

**Matt Bowman:** This was when I was teaching sixth grade in Washington state. The state announced a grant for any teacher who wanted to learn how to bring this new thing called the internet into their classroom. Most teachers grumbled about it. You can imagine the resistance - it was similar to how some people today don't want phones in classrooms.

But I jumped at the opportunity. Growing up with my mom's high-end typewriters and my dad bringing home computers from college, I was excited about the potential. My classroom was soon filled with internet-enabled computers, and we started doing tech-based projects.

The impact on student engagement was incredible. When I told students we'd share their projects with our sister school in Germany, they'd spend time after school perfecting their work. They knew it wasn't just for their friends or parents to see.

Students were learning skills like editing, design, development, and prototyping - things we dream of kids learning. The internet and project-based curriculum made this possible. This experience sparked my passion for online learning, which has been a constant in my career ever since.

In 1999, I got a job offer from a tech company to run their online education program for employees and partners worldwide. They were impressed that I had been doing online learning since '96. I left the classroom for the tech industry and spent 13 years there, exploring almost every version of early online learning tools and platforms.

### Isaac's Educational Journey [19:03]

**Isaac Morehouse**: Your story is in many ways very different from mine - different generation, different experiences - but there are so many points of overlap. Let me give you an abbreviated version of my own upbringing and education.

I grew up homeschooled in the early '80s when it was legally questionable in Michigan. My mom happened to be a certified teacher, which helped. We were fortunate to have a vibrant homeschool community in West Michigan.

One of the first things you realize when you opt out of the public education system is that you miss out on things like sports. We had homeschool basketball teams, though we never had a football team, which broke my heart. They didn't pass the law allowing homeschoolers to play on public school teams until after I graduated.

When I was about 14, being the youngest of three, I found myself wanting more social interaction. Most homeschool parents can relate to this - homeschooling is going great, and then suddenly your kid says, "Once a week classes aren't enough. I want to be doing social stuff all the time."

**Matt Bowman**: That's a common experience, especially around that age.

**Isaac**: Exactly. So I went to a small private school for my sophomore year of high school. There were things I loved about it, like being with friends every day. But after being homeschooled for so long and being really independent, I found the rigid structure frustrating.

I remember thinking, "Why do I have to sit in this class for 50 minutes no matter how fast or slow I learn? What if I'm done in 10? What if it takes me two hours?" It felt so artificial, and I was surprised that everyone seemed okay with it.

For my junior and senior years, I went to community college full-time. I took classes three days a week and worked the other two. I actually loved community college as a high school experience because I had more control over my schedule.

One thing I appreciated about community college was the diversity of age ranges and life experiences in the classes. You'd have older people who were excited to be back in school, asking for more homework, while the younger students would get annoyed.

After that, I transferred to a four-year university, still working part-time. I had a moment in college where I realized I was learning so much on the job, getting paid for it, and then turning around and paying all my money to go to classes where no one wanted to be there.

I remember looking around the classroom one day and thinking, "What I'm really buying is a piece of paper that tells the world I'm no worse than the rest of these people." It felt like a weak signal of my value.

**Matt**: That's a powerful realization. It speaks to the core of why we need to rethink education.

**Isaac**: Absolutely. At 19, I created a PowerPoint presentation called "Education Revolution." I was so frustrated with paying for college and not knowing what I was getting out of it. I outlined an education experience that combined real-world learning and apprenticeships.

I didn't know what to do with that idea at the time, but 10 years later, after working in policy and nonprofits, I ended up launching a company called Praxis, a college alternative program. It was funny to find that old PowerPoint years later and see how those early experiences had shaped my thinking without me even realizing it.

### Student-Inspired Alternative Signal [26:57]

**Matt Bowman**: It's interesting you mention Praxis, Isaac. If you remember, it was actually one of our students who introduced me to you and Praxis. We've always embraced the model of finding the world's best education options and sourcing them for our students. One of our students came to us and said, "I want to go to Praxis. Will you fund it?"

I looked up Praxis and found you. I thought it was super cool, but I wasn't sure if they'd allow a 16-year-old since it was geared towards adult internships. We ended up connecting and having a webinar for our My Tech High - now Open Ed - students. We told them, "Hey, you've got to hear Isaac's alternative signal." That introduction came directly from a student's initiative.

**Isaac**: I had totally forgotten that's how our connection started. I've been talking to you on and off for like 10 years, and I couldn't remember how it began. That's amazing.

### The My Tech High Origin Story [27:23]

**Isaac**: So, Matt, let's hop back to your side of things. You've gone through education, worked in the tech world. When did you have the insight to start My Tech High? And I guess, when did you find the courage to say, "I'm going to go build this"? What's the My Tech High origin story?

**Matt Bowman**: During the time I was working with the tech company running their online education programming, my wife and I had our fifth child in 2002. So we had this age range of five children between 9 and 0, and they were all different. Even as our youngest started growing up, she was totally different from her older sister.

We had three boys and then two girls, and the benefit of having multiple genders of children gives you a chance to see how different each child is. My wife and I were perplexed because we ran our cadence of the home exactly the same for every child. The chores, the responsibilities, the expectations were all the same, and yet every child was different.

As these five children grew up, we started asking, "What does their education need?" I dusted off my master's degree and thought, "How do I develop their talents best through education?"

During this time, Utah adopted charter schools. A brand new charter school was opening up in our town, and there was a lot of opposition to it. People thought it would destroy the traditional district school. But it didn't, and that got me thinking about educational options.

We started asking our oldest child, "What do you want for your education?" And that began a pattern of asking every year, because it changes every year, "Hey, son or daughter, what do you want your education to look like this fall?" We would consider district school, charter school, online school, homeschool, private school - whatever options were available.

### Navigating Educational Choices for Children [30:13]

**Isaac**: That sounds potentially scary as a parent. Were you nervous the first few times you gave your kids that choice?

**Matt**: It wasn't stressful; it was liberating. We saw it as an opportunity to help them take ownership of their education decisions, with our guidance. Our oldest, entering seventh grade, had spent a year at a district middle school and didn't like it. He had one close friend who was going to the new charter school, so he chose that.

The charter school's construction was barely finished when classes started. It was a pioneer experience, very different from a district school. Our seventh-grader was excited. The next year, our sixth-grader followed his brother there.

But after one year, our third boy said, "I'm never going back there. I want to go to the district middle school." We realized we could have kids in different schools. Our two daughters still wanted to go to their boundary elementary school in the district.

Our oldest two ended up graduating from the charter school. The next three did a mix of district school, online school, and homeschool. Our youngest stuck with traditional district high school until her junior year.

### Embracing Educational Flexibility [33:09]

During Christmas break of her junior year, our youngest approached us and said, "Can I do Open Ed from now on? I'm exhausted. This isn't working for me. My friends are all on anxiety medication for tests. The pressure is crazy."

We celebrated her realization and immediately enrolled her in our mid-year program. We encouraged her to start early college with our competency-based program. It's mastery-based, so you move at your own pace. As soon as you've checked off all the rubrics, you get your credit. It's not sit-and-wait for lectures and tests.

She ended up finishing her associate degree while still in high school. We arranged split enrollment so she could take a couple classes at her local boundary high school, have lunch with friends, and still participate in three sports.

She came home without homework because she did her schooling in the mornings. We got to hang out together while her friends were stressed out. She walked with her graduating class, and even during the COVID shutdowns in 2020, her education wasn't disrupted.

This experience with our own children made us realize other parents might want similar options. That's really what led to the foundation of My Tech High, now Open Ed. We wanted to provide the same kind of personalized, flexible education for other families that we had created for our own.

### The Birth of Open Ed [42:09]

**Matt Bowman**: Open Ed started with the realization that our children all needed something different - charter school, district school, online learning. My wife and I thought other parents might have similar experiences.

The foundation of My Tech High was to do for other families what we had done for ourselves. We drew on my online learning experiences from the mid-90s and said, "If we contract with school districts or charter schools, we can help families access world-class education at no cost to them."

That was our design principle from the start. We didn't want to launch a private academy for wealthy families - they already have plenty of choices. We wanted to enable low to middle-income families to have excellent educational choices too.

We started the first year with 92 students who were real pioneers. Our initial focus was on tech and entrepreneurship. I believe entrepreneurship encapsulates all learning in a practical way - you're motivated, you have opportunities to problem-solve, and you figure out things you didn't know before.

For core curriculum, I asked parents what their favorite providers were. We got 92 different answers by subject, by child, by grade level. That's when I thought, "Could our model be 'choose your own adventure' for curriculum?" Instead of standardization, we decided to partner with every best curriculum provider on the planet.

I remember a mom of 15-year-old triplets who had a different provider by subject for each of her daughters. It was a powerful validation that every child is unique.

**Isaac**: That entrepreneurial insight is still the core of what we do today. You asked 92 parents what the best curriculum was, got 92 different answers, and your response was, "Yes, let's do all of it." That's so cool.

This platform of partnering with public or charter schools, letting families pick what works best for each kid, each period - whether it's a course we built, another online provider, a local tutor, or something they're doing at home - that's really powerful.

It's different from the typical approach in education where people come in with strong opinions about what should be taught and how. You have some opinions too, like emphasizing entrepreneurship and tech, but the core is this platform where families can build what works for them.

**Matt**: Exactly. We're not trying to be the "doctors of education," diagnosing and prescribing like in healthcare. We start with the child.

For example, math is something many kids struggle with. When you offer them multiple curriculum options, you can say to the child, "It's not you, it's the curriculum." For the first time, they realize, "Oh, you mean I'm not dumb? I'm not bad at math? I just haven't found the curriculum that clicks with my brain yet?" When we try different versions and one finally clicks, the child's light bulbs go off. It's about finding the right fit, not labeling the child.

### Strategic Narrative and Future Vision [50:00]

**Isaac**: Matt, if you're cool with it, I'd like to share my screen and highlight a couple of things from what we call our strategic narrative. The core of it is what we just talked about - this idea that we want all options open for all learners.

It starts with the fact that technology has enabled more choice and personalization in everything we do - how we live, work, and play. As you mentioned, Matt, standardization in a personalized world is a strange fit. The implication is that education should also have more flexibility, personalization, and choice.

This is the core shift in the world - the big move from closed to open. It's not just about geography-bound versus flexible remote education. It's not an either/or situation of in-classroom or out-of-classroom learning. Sometimes a classroom is great for some things, sometimes it's not. We're trying to remove all the boxes that separate these approaches to education.

You talked about cell phones in class being seen as the enemy, much like the internet was once viewed as a distraction. I think it's important that in our approach on this podcast and in all these conversations, we don't fall into either extreme - the cynical view that technology is terrible and kids are addicted to screens, or the overly optimistic view that technology solves everything.

The reality is that things like cell phones present real challenges. Screen time is a real issue. People can absolutely get addicted to screens, and it can shorten attention spans. These are very real challenges. But the answer isn't to move to a cabin in the woods. The answer is to continually learn how to make these tools serve us.

**Matt**: Totally agree. It's the ultimate challenge with any technology or device - finding a balance. Are there things any of us do too much of? Achieving a moderate balance in life on all things is healthy, and that's a human quest - to figure that balance out. Helping our children and modeling this for them is not easy.

We just continuously try to say, "Let's find some balance in all things." There's always going to be room for screens and technology, but there's also a whole great world out there of mountains, parks, and open spaces. It's really just striving to have a balance of it all.

**Isaac**: I love it. The answer, as always, is yes. Super excited to kick this podcast off with you, Matt. Everybody, go to [open-ed.co](http://open-ed.co/) and subscribe to the Open Ed Daily.
