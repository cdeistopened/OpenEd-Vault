## Transcript

Ela Richmond (00:00.932)  
Welcome to the podcast, Mike. So you've often talked about this like window of creativity, right? Can you explain that a little bit more for families in our audience?

Michael Gibson (00:11.874)  
Yeah, sure. So something people don't really think about is that creativity is perishable. So not only is it rare, but it also doesn't last in individuals and in societies. So at the individual level, think of it like a athletic prime. I mean, we take it as given that, you know, even Michael Jordan has a life cycle to his career, despite how good his skills are, all the talent he has, nevertheless, biology takes its toll.

in people have to retire. Well, sad to say, it looks like there's something similar when it comes to productivity and creativity. And by that, I just mean taking an individual and this person across their career has a track record of producing works of originality and value. It could be novelists, could be painters, it could be mathematicians, scientists, and so on. And when you look, it follows actually a similar pattern as the athletes.

So, you know, there's a rise in from teens to 20s. And then sometime in our 40s, we seem to fade. Maybe it's not totally biology. Could be cultural matters or life stage issues. So it could be the case that someone just has a lot to lose. They stop taking risks. They have mortgage payments, a spouse, a dog, children. I don't know. But at any rate, people stop producing.

work as high quality as they did in their 20s and 30s. It's just sad. you know, it's something we have to recognize and work with. I think that's why I'm so interested in some of the things holding younger people back, because it seems like they've been delayed longer over time. But nevertheless, that's a truth we have to face. And then to make maybe a more controversial analogy is like, I feel like in the last 30, 40 years,

Ela Richmond (01:58.063)  
Interesting.

Michael Gibson (02:09.998)  
with let's say women entering the workplace and establishing careers and pursuing their dreams. All of that has been fantastic. But at times I think in our society we've told women, you know, they can delay things forever. It's like, hey, you focus on your career. Don't worry about a family. And what we've seen is, at least now that I'm in my 40s, is I meet a lot of women who thought they could do that. But it turns out it's really hard to have babies in their 40s where they have to

You know, use extraordinary methods to try to do it. Well, look, having babies is creation. So is producing art and science and so on. And it just is sad to say, but we just have a window where we're where we seem to be better at it than others. I have a favorite novelist, Kazuo Ishiguro, who wrote, you know, cheese. man, how am I forgetting his novel? Never let me go. That's it. Clara and the Sun.

remains of the day. And I was listening to an interview with him recently, and he made an interesting comment that's in line with this. The question was, now that you're older, what would you tell your younger self to do differently? What career advice would you give your younger self? And he said, I would say nothing, because that younger novelist was better than I am now. And there are things that he was capable of that I'm no-

capable of doing and I was like, wow, that is brutal statement. But nevertheless, you know, there's a lot of truth in it. Look at musicians and this will be my last example. It's like there seems to be, you know, when you look at the Beatles, they were tremendously creative. Paul McCartney, just incredible prolific songwriter, but even someone so talented as him has a window where, you know, his work over the last 20, 30 years even is nowhere nearly as powerful as that work in the 10 years with the Beatles.

Ela Richmond (03:50.694)  
Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (04:03.524)  
So how would you define creativity so we're all on the same page?

Michael Gibson (04:07.502)  
Yeah, I think it's creating original, valuable new things. So original means it's some departure from what has occurred in the past. It could be genres of fiction. It could be some song that's different in some interesting way. The second piece is really the hard one is that not only is it original, but it's valuable. And that can, we can define value, but it's like, there are lots of original things that are worthless.

and worse than the status quo or even take us back. You can imagine all sorts of useless original things. But the valuable part, the two together, are what define creativity to me.

Ela Richmond (04:51.012)  
Why would there be like a window of creativity, right? Like you would normally...

Michael Gibson (04:57.154)  
Yeah, well, part of it is biology. So it's like look at math or chess. There's something. psychologists who study intelligence and then some into the creativity part, like with IQ. IQ is like this measure that's supposed to predict your ability to solve problems. And there's a lot of validity to it. But it seems to be the case that as we age, they separate intelligence into two separate.

categories or concepts. One is fluid intelligence and the other is crystallized intelligence. Fluid intelligence is your ability. It's almost like mental speed and agility. You know, take some new shape shifting problem or shape rotating problem and younger people just seem to, or at least people in their own life. So it's like when they're in their twenties, your fluid intelligence peaks and then declines slowly after that.

Whereas crystallized intelligence is just like the raw number of the storehouse of knowledge you have, you know, it could be everything from vocabulary to facts of history and so on. And as we age, crystallized intelligence actually increases. So that's kind of interesting. But that fluid piece is there's a lot of evidence to show that it declines in time. Now, creativity is different from IQ because there are that ability to invent novel

Ela Richmond (06:18.63)  
Mm-hmm.

Michael Gibson (06:23.628)  
valuable things is not the same as the ability to problem solve under time constraints and so on. There are lots of high IQ people with who are conformists, who are lazy. They don't really produce new ideas. And that's kind of interesting. So the psychologists who study creativity, one of the things they notice is there's actually not a strong correlation between the ability to produce

valuable original ideas and works and IQ beyond like 120. So it's like a threshold effect where, you know, sure, a little bit of a higher level of intelligence predicts some, some creativity, but only a little. then beyond that, not at all. And this really came out and I'll sorry, I'm like going down these rabbit holes. There's this history of the whole IQ test, which is kind of interesting where maybe you've heard of the Stanford-Binet test. That was this old version of the IQ test that used to.

Ela Richmond (07:10.937)  
No, I love this.

Michael Gibson (07:21.422)  
given schools. Well, the person behind that was very much interested in the connection between intelligence and creativity. In the 1920s and 30s, he decided to conduct a longitudinal study to see, you know, to measure what were the life outcomes of a group of geniuses as defined by people, children who scored above 130, I think on an IQ test.

at maybe 12, maybe 15, I can't remember. But at any rate, he pulls together this group of people, follows them over 50 years. And then there were some borderline people who didn't meet the IQ cutoff that he kept out. then, so fast forward, he looks back, he looks at this group and sure enough, IQ did predict the things that we now know it does. It's like, success within the professions, doctors, lawyers.

Some people became public intellectuals and so on. But there was no one in that group who had masterworks of achievement. And what's kind of funny is that the two people he excluded from the group were William Shockley and Luis Alvarez. And these two guys went on to win Nobel prizes. Shockley famously for inventing the transistor and Alvarez for

Ela Richmond (08:43.696)  
Wow.

Michael Gibson (08:49.39)  
being the first to discover that the dinosaurs were killed by an asteroid and with plate tectonics. And so it's just interesting to me. It's like a great anecdote about how the IQ test did not predict someone's ability to create novel new things. And what's funny, the irony is that William Shockley became obsessed with IQ.

The reason Silicon Valley is where it is, is mainly due to William Shockley because he moves to Palo Alto, he starts Shockley Semiconductor, and this is the birth of Silicon Valley as we know it because the people he hires, they end up defecting. They end up hate, they hate working for him so much because he's addicted to things like IQ tests. He's like, and he's doing things like printing everyone's salary on the...

on the common room board. He would, what else? If there were delays, product delays, production delays, he immediately thought people were lying. So he was a very bad boss to work with. And these eight or so people decide they've had enough and they quit. They're like done with him. They quit and they start their own company called Fairchild Semiconductor. And they're known as the Trader is Eight. And these people, yeah, and these people, Bob Noyce is one of them.

Ela Richmond (10:12.08)  
This is so interesting.

Michael Gibson (10:15.79)  
They go on to create Intel and the rest is history. you know, the, the, the, what I find so interesting is like Silicon Valley was born by this person excluded from an IQ test. He ends up getting, you know, creating the first defection startup because he's such a jerk about it later on. And then Silicon Valley has come to represent this, this idea. And that's fullest form to me where you have a lot of smart people.

who are capable of inventing new things. And now this takes it to the level of cities, regions, nations. It's like undoubtedly over the last 50 years when it comes to innovation and doing new things, Silicon Valley is far beyond any other region. If you just look in terms of GDP wealth created in that region alone, I think it outweighs like 40 of the American states and some countries. And so what is it about countries?

that makes them more creative over time. That's kind of interesting question because it seems to be the case as with individuals. So with countries, there's this life cycle where there's a beginning, there's a rise, a peak, and then some kind of decline and fall. And we can think of great examples from history where it's like ancient Athens, Florence in the Renaissance, Elizabeth in London, maybe Paris in the 20s. It's like these things peak and fade. And so that's a great question. It's like, why? Why couldn't we just have the golden age forever? What is it?

Ela Richmond (11:30.31)  
Mm-hmm.

Michael Gibson (11:40.811)  
about institutions and laws and just life and culture in a city that allows for flourishing and then ultimately death. I wish we could figure that puzzle out because a lot of our great achievements in science and the arts comes from these golden ages. So yeah, I'll leave it there.

Ela Richmond (11:57.41)  
Yeah, this is fascinating. I'm so-

I love, like it changed the way that I understand how I want to interact with the world and what I want work to be for me. But I love Peter Thiel's perspective on progress, right? And I'm assuming that this is the way that you're viewing progress as well, just because of what you're saying, like there are doctors and lawyers and like everybody would look at them and say, yes, you are super successful, but you say, you know, but they're not creating anything new. And so Peter Thiel has these like different types of progress, right? There's like,

Michael Gibson (12:17.742)  
Hmm.

Michael Gibson (12:33.262)  
Yeah.

Ela Richmond (12:33.52)  
progress that is net new and it like moves the human race forward and there's progress that is not net new and it's just kind of like we are continuing on the same circle that we are on. You can keep on going, right? Like you can be an amazing doctor and that's really, really, really important and by all means it is quite successful quote unquote. Right? And so like, how do you see that difference, right? The difference between like creativity as success quote unquote and like, okay, I'm a doctor, I am successful.

Michael Gibson (12:37.837)  
Hmm.

Michael Gibson (12:43.138)  
Yeah.

Michael Gibson (12:50.776)  
Hmm.

Michael Gibson (12:59.928)  
Hmm.

Michael Gibson (13:04.142)  
There's an old example Peter used to use when he first hired me that related way back to discussions in economics about agriculture in the 19th century. So it was about intensive versus extensive farming where, you know, imagine a farmer who's trying to figure out how to increase the yield of his crops. One way to do it would be to just plant more crops. So extend, that would be extensive. It's like, hey, I only have this amount of farmland. I can grow more if I just extend.

the size of my farm versus maybe with the same plot of land, you can discover new ways of growing more yield, having higher yield within that small boundary that you currently own. And that's intensive, intensive development. So there was always this contrast between doing more with less versus just like going from one to N. And this could fit the frame of globalization versus innovation where

Ela Richmond (13:58.575)  
Mm-hmm.

Michael Gibson (14:03.47)  
You think about the total addressable market for any good. It could be bananas. It could be Facebook. If you broaden the market from, let's say, a single country like the United States to the rest of the world, that increases the market size quite dramatically. And in some ways, that is an improvement that does bring increased GDP. But it's not the same as inventing something wholly new, which it would be like going from zero to one in Peter's famous phrase.

And so that would be something like inventing some new way of growing more of your crop in the same plot of land. Norman Borlaug famously did this in the 1960s and 70s and was one of these unsung heroes of the 20th century who helped save the world because he was able to invent new ways of growing rice in Asia and so on. this is what prevented a lot of famines.

Innovation is one of these things that's like loosey goosey. A lot of people want to be innovative, the core of it is creating something that someone wants, someone needs, something valuable, being able to deliver it at a high enough quality, at the right price, at the right time. mean, it's like so hard to do these things. And in order to do that, it does require some creativity to go from zero to one.

One, end is not as hard a problem.

Ela Richmond (15:34.286)  
Yeah, that's fascinating. Most parents that I've chatted with would probably ask the question, Like, my kid needs to know information, though. Like, right? Like, my three-year-old can paint a picture, and that's creativity. However, for them to create something new, they need to know information. How much information do they need to know to start creating? Because that is the cell with a university, right? We're teaching them the things that they need to know so that they can be creative.

Michael Gibson (15:49.518)  
Hmm.

Michael Gibson (16:03.499)  
Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (16:04.174)  
What is your thought on that?

Michael Gibson (16:07.328)  
Yeah, because there are different like

Michael Gibson (16:12.714)  
Imagine maybe here's an example would be to say the difference between, you know, someone sits down and plays a game with you and there's a given set of rules that you are told about. And then within that game, you come up with interesting ways of winning or performing well. You know, that's certainly a form of creativity. And so we could easily transpose that to something like being a lawyer or a doctor, you know, lawyer, I bet they're very novel.

ways to win cases or interpret the Constitution to win some argument. But it's not the same. And then the second one would be like, what if we invent a new game together with our own rules that we create? That's a total different style of creativity, inventing a new Constitution. taking something that already exists and then doing your best to perform well with inside that will require some creativity.

I think when it comes to dramatic breakthroughs, especially in science and technology and the arts, it's really that second kind that really moves the needle. So I don't want to say that some lawyer isn't creative. No, by far it's possible to do interesting things. But on the other hand, creating a new market or creating a new product or discovering a new theory, it's just a different level of creativity.

And it's almost like this dark energy, dark matter in our understanding of our capabilities where so much attention is applied to being smart. That word smart is used all over the place. And then IQ is part of that conversation. like I said, creativity is this other faculty that because we can't measure it, we're not good at acknowledging it. And then the second thing is because we can't measure it, we don't know how to improve it.

Ela Richmond (17:58.192)  
Mm-hmm.

Michael Gibson (18:07.66)  
So maybe it's like it's ignored in schools because well, what the hell, we just don't know. There are some tests out there. Maybe you've come across them where these questions like it'll, you someone's given a brick and they have to list how many different ideas they can come up with about a brick. Some period of time, very, very weak correlations of those kinds of tests of predicting who is going to be creative. And then we, are just so many anecdotes of like experts missing.

Ela Richmond (18:21.637)  
Mm-hmm.

Michael Gibson (18:35.2)  
something because they're just so hardened in their understanding of the world. So like, you know, to go back to the Beatles, apparently Paul McCartney had a music teacher in high school and this person thought he wasn't that great a musician, didn't care much for his talents. And then George Harrison, another member of the Beatles went to the same high school, was two years younger, had the same music teacher. That guy also didn't like George Harrison. So it's pretty wild that there was this teacher who was greeting these people.

and had no understanding of what they were capable of. I think that's true. Like that's an exaggerated anecdote example, but I think it's just true at a much, even at the lower intensities for a lot of people where maybe they don't have the same ability to rotate shapes in their mind to tell you patterns on a cube, but nevertheless, they're like really creative at coming up with new ideas and testing things.

Ela Richmond (19:29.166)  
Yeah, you argue that people should not go to college, right? Do you think there's a certain amount of, is it the way that information is taught in college? Is it the reason that you are learning? Like what is the thing that makes it, yes, you're taking in information, right? Yes, you are quote unquote learning. Yes, you are educating yourself, but in some ways you're becoming less creative. Why is that?

Michael Gibson (19:32.908)  
Hmm.

Michael Gibson (19:44.704)  
Hmm. Yeah.

Michael Gibson (19:53.751)  
Okay, yeah, you mentioned a question earlier I wanted to come back to that touches on this. You said something like, how much do you have to know in order to create new things? And that question points to an interesting problem, which is that there is some golden mean that is between too much and too little knowledge of a field or of a problem. I keep going back to these stories. One that illustrates that one is

Ela Richmond (20:10.032)  
Yeah.

Michael Gibson (20:22.958)  
I don't know, I should really know the names of these people, but I think it was a statistician out at UC Berkeley and he was a grad student and he missed a class, was late to it. And during the class, the professor had listed some of the unsolved problems in the field of statistics and he put like one on the board. The class ended, that guy who was late shows up, he just sees these problems on the board and he thinks it's the homework.

for the next class. He doesn't know that it's the unsolved problems of the field or something. And so he goes to work on one of them and ends up deriving one of the answers. And so in retrospect, one of the things he always pointed out was like, if he had known that this problem was supposed to be unsolvable, maybe he never would have attempted it. Maybe he would have been intimidated. But because he didn't know, he was able to just naively attack it.

Ela Richmond (20:52.708)  
That is so funny.

Ela Richmond (21:10.458)  
Mm-hmm.

Michael Gibson (21:19.926)  
So I think there's something to that where our schools are these powerful institutions that can intimidate people into thinking that they're less capable of solving problems than they are. It's also the style of education where there's this conditioning where you're taught that you have to master these foundations in some kind of pyramid where once you climb all the way up this mountain after

15 years, you you go from high school to PhD to postdoc. Only then are you able to finally address these unsolved problems in your discipline. And by that time nowadays, you're probably in your mid thirties. I, know, there's a lot to that style of education because it totally makes sense that you have to master the fundamentals before you move on. But it takes so long to get out there and you're

you're conditioned by how these people before you think that maybe it prevents you from bringing novel tools and techniques and ideas to solving a problem. like one thing, one idea I've had is could we invert this pyramid in some sense where young people, you you should walk into a physics department and they should list right in the front atrium, the top 10 unsolved problems in the field in

And one thing that would do is it let you know that even the smartest professor in this Harvard physics department has not been able to solve this problem. So it immediately makes that person a little more humble. But then it also allows you to look at the frontier and say, what do I want to work on? And how do I get there fastest? And how am I going to then just discover or invent the tools I need to tackle that problem? Because maybe it doesn't involve that pyramid.

Ela Richmond (23:10.32)  
Mm-hmm.

Michael Gibson (23:15.97)  
Maybe there are other things I could learn to help me solve that problem. That could be very interesting. And then there's this probably wider cultural conditioning that I think is detrimental to creativity that's involved with schooling and really our culture in America now, where over the last 50 years, teens have just been transformed by this tournament.

where the tournament is to who gets these exclusive limited number of seats in the freshman class of an elite Ivy League school. That tournament is a labyrinth of tests, of classes, of extracurricular activities, and that admissions committee is really setting the standard for what matters. And here's where my old boss comes in. Teal was a big fan of René Girard.

Ela Richmond (23:51.652)  
Mm-hmm.

Michael Gibson (24:13.674)  
French literary critic and anthropologist interesting figure who studied crowd dynamics and the madness of crowds witch hunting scapegoating and Gerard came up with this theory about humans where you know the basic syllogism and this is really rough but it gives you the ideas like the more we compete after rival risk goods meaning you know these goods that only one of us can have the more we compete the more alike we become

And that's kind of interesting. We see that in consumer goods, for instance, take a look at water as a category. Anytime you see a mature product category, all the products are the same and they're really just competing on fake differentiation. So is Dasani really different from Fiji, from smart water? It's the shape of the bottle. It's some BS about electrolytes. This is not strong differentiation.

So the more you compete in a category, the more you become alike. So all these people competing, these teens competing for this nationwide tournament are all becoming more and more alike. And then here's the next step. The more you become alike, the less unique you are, the less unique you are, the fewer new ideas you have. So this giant cultural shift, wherever the only path to success is to go to college, has really homogenized our intellect and our...

our ability to think of new things. So I think that's been really detrimental. that has nothing to do with the curriculum. That's just like the shape of life trajectories that occur in the US now and these institutions.

Ela Richmond (25:55.726)  
I'm curious if you have any perspective on children and early education. So like what should early education look like inside of children? And especially whenever it comes to like creating motivation for solving problems.

Michael Gibson (26:14.626)  
Yeah, I have this issue just on that last point. I've noticed it's kind of fascinating because I noticed my mom doesn't have this problem. We do a lot of puzzles together, like crossword puzzles. She's always loved solving riddles. It's like there's always this, you sometimes there's this initial resistance when someone puts a puzzle in front of me where I feel challenged and it's almost like getting asked to do a workout.

where it's like, gotta have the energy or I don't have it. And it's like, ah, or, then if it's really, if it's difficult, Oh man, there's like all sorts of excuses you can bring up to quit. I don't have time now. Don't bother me. Um, deep down, there might be some insecurity in people where, you know, it's like you get presented with a, like, let's say you're known to be someone who's smart. And then as someone throws a puzzle down in front of you, you feel like you have to prove yourself in that moment.

Ela Richmond (27:12.282)  
Yeah.

Michael Gibson (27:13.23)  
And that can be intimidating. So what some people do is they like shrug it off or they you know, don't want to deal with it Yeah Whereas my mom is the opposite she doesn't care where she is what frame of mind whatever she just loves puzzles and she gets in there and won't quit Until she figures it out and we were doing this crossword I was like feeling sick and I get there, you know, the Sunday New York Times crossword has these themes and

Ela Richmond (27:18.15)  
Or it's the same with trivia games. It's like...

Ela Richmond (27:39.461)  
Yeah.

Michael Gibson (27:41.103)  
We couldn't get the theme and I just had, I had a tooth pulled and I was just like, geez, I'm out. And she's like, she keeps asking me, even though I'm like dying on the couch. She's like, but what about this? But what about this? And then she did it. She got it without me because I had passed out. And when I woke up, she had the answer. But I realized with her, it's like, there's this thing where she just doesn't like, because it's not a challenge to her identity or because I don't know, there's just, she doesn't feel that, what would you call it? Like startup.

Ela Richmond (27:57.882)  
That's funny.

Michael Gibson (28:10.474)  
engine problem, like heating up the engine problem. And I feel like that's true for a lot of kids, for a lot of younger people where they're, because the difficulty of some of these problems can be so hard. the startup energy is just like really tough to get going on them. So there's something in education, I think with younger people where we gotta, we gotta somehow, teach them to overcome that resistance.

that somehow they're not condemned to hell because they fail at solving this puzzle in front of them. I don't know. That's how it feels, I think, to some people. Or it's just really hard. It's really hard to learn. I don't know. There's something about education that might be similar to fitness. That motivational piece is really hard. So I don't have a...

Ela Richmond (29:00.24)  
Yeah.

Michael Gibson (29:05.506)  
I don't have like strong views on curriculum or style of education for younger people. I just do think that it has to be some mixture of allowing their curiosity, intrinsic curiosity to blossom in terms of what interests them, subject matter, types of things, and then doing your best to allow them to explore that. There are different techniques that show stronger effectiveness in terms of teaching.

Ela Richmond (29:08.688)  
Mm-hmm.

Michael Gibson (29:35.435)  
So most famously, one-on-one tutoring is just by far the best method of teaching and learning. When it comes to like small classes, big classes, a lot of that is just not as good. There's a famous paper by Benjamin Bloom called the Two Sigma problem because Two Sigma, because the people who had one-on-one tutoring were just so far superior from these other methods. And then when it comes to actual instruction too, there are things, know, spaced repetition,

Ela Richmond (29:40.197)  
Mm-hmm.

Michael Gibson (30:05.474)  
ways that just these techniques that self testing these things that have developed over time that really show have greater stickiness for people. And so I think for younger people, it's like you got to wade them into this in some fashion, but it's going to be some some balance of doing that with also just hey, they're a younger person whose attention span is somewhat limited. So I you know, I'm not a child educator, but that's just sort of what I see.

Ela Richmond (30:28.624)  
Yall.

Michael Gibson (30:33.034)  
out there and it's kind interesting, we're starting to see more homeschooling, Montessori schooling, and then now these blends of like, what is it, the Alpha school or something in Texas where they're starting to use AI to really try to capture some of that one-on-one effectiveness in tutoring. So it is an exciting time, I think, in education now because of that.

Ela Richmond (30:57.484)  
Yeah, this is fascinating to me. It also brings up though, like the psychological aspect of building a startup, right? So like in order to create anything new, there's a lot of challenge associated with it and it definitely takes a different type of a mindset, right? But also whenever you're talking.

Ela Richmond (32:43.123)  
This one.

Michael Gibson (32:44.398)  
Okay, not sure what happened there. I think... Okay.

Ela Richmond (32:45.587)  
Okay, me neither. Post-production is perfect for that.

Ela Richmond (32:54.48)  
All right, we're back. Okay, back to the question. I was about to ask you a question. So the psychological effects of building a startup, obviously building a startup is really, really difficult. And especially in the areas where you work, you're advocating for younger and younger people being capable of creating these amazing solutions and solving these amazing problems.

Michael Gibson (32:57.454)  
I forget where we were though.

Michael Gibson (33:06.432)  
okay, sure.

Michael Gibson (33:16.397)  
Hmm.

Ela Richmond (33:22.579)  
How does that work out with the psychological effects of building a startup? So like you have these young people that are facing challenges like making really, really difficult decisions. You have lots of probably workplace things that are going on. You're putting them in and advocating that they're actually capable of being in these positions that are quite difficult. How does that shape up?

Michael Gibson (33:29.238)  
Hmm.

Michael Gibson (33:46.51)  
Hmm.

Michael Gibson (33:50.894)  
jeez, yeah, there's a lot to unpack there.

You know, maybe maybe starting with, OK, so we make investments in companies that are founded by people sometimes in their teens. And so the question we often get from investors who want to invest in us, who are considering it as like, my God, how do you possibly trust a 20 year old to be a CEO where they have to make a lot of these tough decisions involving who to who to hire, who to fire, you know?

Ela Richmond (34:16.955)  
Yeah.

Michael Gibson (34:25.134)  
product development roadmaps, raising money and so on. And it is a tough situation where we have to try to figure out this phrase we use sometimes is from acorn to oak. So we have to know, is there something in this person right now that we can trust to grow into the type of person who is now fully capable of

managing three divisions in this bigger company and all these marketing, accounting, HR, product development, all that, right? Okay, how does that happen? Well, we focus on things like that intrinsic curiosity. So we meet people who are just insatiable at learning. They're voracious readers. They're constantly going to workshops or lectures or who knows what, but they just love learning.

Ela Richmond (34:56.147)  
Hmm.

Michael Gibson (35:21.23)  
What that tells us is that when it comes time to have to learn about these different areas of the business, they're gonna put in the time to do it. Oftentimes with these younger people, it tends to be the case that they only wanna know about a fire extinguisher when the house is a little bit on fire. So they have to be quick learners too. So that's just something we pay attention to.

But then there's also this, yeah, this other side where we want to know, like, are they good at, like, attracting friends who support them, maybe mentors, maybe coaches of some kind. It's like always interesting if someone's doing that on their own already, independently of working with us. And so that all this together could be a way of just sort of giving us a sense that they're going to be capable of growing into the role. Now, the psychological pressures.

starting a company. one last thing on that. I've worked with adults and they are very immature and can't take the pressure. I've seen adults act like complete children. So there's also that. It's like there I think there's a little bit of a romantic, a romanticization of adulthood where we pretend to think that people are mature, especially in business. But that's not true. So that's so I think adults have their own problems. So yeah, I think the pressures can be quite great.

That's why we love seeing co-founders rather than single founders. There's going to be a emotional roller coaster of wins and losses and struggles, dark nights of the soul. And then to get through that, it's really key to have someone there with you in the trenches. That can be quite powerful. And then that dark night of the soul is really tough. The act or the what? The project of building a startup.

Ela Richmond (36:54.673)  
Mm-hmm.

Michael Gibson (37:14.518)  
and running it is a really fundamentally, it is a project of self-knowledge. So what do I mean by this is startups, because you have to do everything and it can be so intense, they are going to expose all the flaws and weaknesses that you have as a person. So let's say you're afraid of having difficult conversations. Well, guess what? Your startup is going to require you to have difficult conversations.

Let's say you are afraid of ever admitting that you're wrong. You don't like being wrong. Well, guess what? You're going to be wrong every day and the world doesn't care. Let's say you don't like looking at legal documents. Let's say you don't like making cold calls. Well, guess what? You're going to have to do these things. So you're going to learn a lot about yourself running a company that you might not learn if you just have a specific role at a very big company and you get to hide in your cubicle with your job description.

So you're going to gain a lot of self-knowledge. Now here's where the life coaching comes in is like that self-knowledge can be transformed into something greater where either you acknowledge the weight of these weaknesses and address them yourself. So maybe you learn how to have tough conversations. Maybe instead you hire someone and you can delegate some of these things. What you can't do is ignore them. So the startup is just going to be a man. It's going to magnify all these things about you that you didn't know.

But on the other hand, it could be the case that you gained self-knowledge that you didn't, that you couldn't have about the good things. Like none of us knows what we're capable of just sitting in a chair and thinking about it. We think we have self-knowledge. The philosophers tell us to look within ourselves. Well, guess what? That's not enough because you don't know what you're capable of. And so when you start a company, it's going to bring the best things out of you that you didn't even know you had in you. You didn't know you could work 80 hour weeks. You didn't know that you could convince people to join your team.

and that you could achieve these incredible victories together. And that self-knowledge is also priceless. So it's like all this together is a really intense thing. And young people, yeah, I've seen people spin out. The human factor is really tough. It's not the technology that breaks. it's the human factor. Maybe you're just not capable of learning fast enough to overcome some of these weaknesses and you end up self-destructing. whether the outcome is

Michael Gibson (39:42.265)  
you know, this billion dollar company and great success or whether you work out on, you you flame out after a year, what you gained during that time is going to make it all worth it. Everything I just described in a way that makes it better than, you know, business school or working at a company. So I think I've wandered from your original question, but it's like, that's what I think this path offers people that, the traditional path doesn't.

And so when you say just the psychological pressures, think, you know, I think you have to learn by doing on these things. Like if you're just living, you know, the solipsistic, like in your mind world of being in school, you're not learning how to deal with urgency or high stakes environments with difficult decisions. You know, that's like you're coddled in school. given the track record of mental health in the U.S. over the last two decades,

I'd say schools have made that worse. And what I've seen out in the world is people have tough times, but when they're working in teams and they're working on something they love, they come to understand how to deal with these pressures better.

Ela Richmond (40:54.193)  
That's interesting. It seems like we have a lot of safety around us, right? So like business school is a path. It's like a stair step toward these things that people want. They learn all the right things. They slowly make themselves capable of, you know, doing financials. like a lot of, for example, like younger kids that are managing a startup will have had no experience with that. And they'll have to like figure it out on the backend.

people that I have met who have taken the route of just jump in are like, yeah, to be honest, looking back, like would never recommend my path to anybody because it was hard. However, like they are personally very rewarded for what they have done. Like they've shown themselves more than they ever thought they were capable of, exactly like what you were saying. What is the prize? Like people that are doing,

Michael Gibson (41:33.294)  
Yeah.

Michael Gibson (41:49.678)  
Hmm.

Ela Richmond (41:51.239)  
these startups that are building these things that are net new that are putting themselves in positions that are harder. For example, like I did Praxis, everybody told me not to, everybody told me to like take the path that I was supposed to take. And the hardest period of my life thus far had been that period where I said no to the right answer and I didn't know what the next right answer was.

Michael Gibson (41:57.335)  
Yeah.

Michael Gibson (42:13.816)  
Hmm.

Ela Richmond (42:16.229)  
That's really hard and most of our audience is parents. So like a parent listening to this isn't necessarily going to be super excited to tell their kid drop out, know, like go and build something. And I bet a lot of parents come up to you and they're like, I really love what you're doing. I support it entirely. And yet they're sending their kids to a four year institution or like they're promoting the path that is a quote unquote safe route.

Michael Gibson (42:26.68)  
Yeah.

Michael Gibson (42:33.166)  
Hmm.

Michael Gibson (42:38.637)  
Ready?

Ela Richmond (42:41.785)  
What is the prize? Like why would people, why should people if they are a certain person or if they believe that their kid is a certain way, why should they help their kid or promote their kid or like support their kid to make a decision that is inevitably going to be very difficult?

Michael Gibson (42:59.0)  
think maybe the key idea is what I sort of touched on, namely, it's not the outcome in terms of money earned that necessarily matters, but who you become in the process. And who you become is someone who can handle ambiguity, who can handle structuring your own weak plans, coming up with what you want to do on your own. Whereas the people who play it safe by staying in these established institutions, they don't set their own goals.

They have some broad goal, like they want a degree, but then that's filled in by all these other people. And then they're given assignments and then they're told how to do them. And then they fulfill those things. It's like you very much become someone who has a brittle dependence on that institution for how they should live their life. And so the differences between the two people are like differences in capability and skill. mean, I don't know, maybe think about like skiing or some kind of risky activity where

You want to start on the bunny hills. You want to start on the beginner runs. And only after time do you work up to the black diamonds that are frightening to someone who's a beginner. Well, in life, we're all on this mountain. And you can wait to 22 to get on the bunny slope, or you can start doing the bunny slope at 15. But you're only going to be able to handle the black diamonds of adulthood if you start practicing now. So I encourage parents, even if you're

Children are in school still. You gotta find ways for them to manage risk, to come up, to pursue their own curiosity. know, none of this adult supervision, it's just, you gotta let them go. We gotta rewild the American child.

Ela Richmond (44:44.401)  
love this. If you had a child that was 18, you know, they got into Harvard tomorrow, would you tell them to drop out and start a company instead?

Michael Gibson (44:53.89)  
I wouldn't say just drop out and do it and have nothing in mind. in the best case scenarios that we see, it's usually some kind of slowly building momentum and it just takes the person out of school on its own and we're there to support them. You know, some people have thought, do you pay people to convince them to leave school? Like don't do that. Cause that's like not, not good. The only college pays because what you're doing and we're, I mean, we get in a debate about

what you learn in college. You know, the argument is like, is it skill accumulation or is it signaling? I tend to think it's more signaling about the type of person you are. And sadly, that signal is still valuable. So it could be the case if you have no dreams, if you have no plans about doing your own thing, then it is very safe, secure, and you'll make a pretty good income if you make it all the way through school. And I would have this conversation, frankly, with my kids.

And I would also balance it as some conversation about cost benefit too. So if they do want to study poetry and philosophy, that's great. But if I'm on the hook to pay $250,000, $400,000 to do it, that's clearly another conversation. So that's part of this discussion as well. But if they got in the Harvard, would hope that, and it did make sense for them to stay, I hope they could pursue their curiosity within that structure.

at low cost. And then if something else came up along the way, then they would pursue that instead of staying.

Ela Richmond (46:29.807)  
If you were young, another hypothetical, if you were young like 18, 19, 20, what would you be looking into? Would you be asking yourself questions like, what am I fascinated in? What problems interest me? How would you figure out like what a next step or path would be that is entirely your own?

Michael Gibson (46:35.182)  
Hmm.

Michael Gibson (46:41.1)  
Hmm.

Michael Gibson (46:50.85)  
I think there are couple of things that occur to me. One is, don't, it's hard. We don't really teach a receptivity to beauty and that feeling of wonder that is such a powerful spark to curiosity. And so it'd be about trying to inculcate a greater sensitivity to wonder and what that draws me to. And maybe it is works of art and maybe it is

Ela Richmond (47:02.375)  
Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (47:16.754)  
Hmm.

Michael Gibson (47:21.134)  
science and some of the unsolved mysteries that certainly provoked that feeling in me now. So I would try to feel drawn to something like that by how I feel about it, because that's going to sustain me over time on that question. And I feel like that's so distorted now by that tournament I talked about, where I wonder, people aren't really paying attention.

to their curiosity and awe and wonder and instead are just thinking about what will look good in the eyes of others. And so that's very dangerous. think, you know, just, and if it's true to who you are, it's like, that's always hard. It's like, is this something that I care about because it's, there's some deep essence in me that resonates with it? Or is it just cause I want to look good in the eyes of other or cause I want to get in this prestigious thing and get high status? Like that's always going to be a dangerous.

knife sedge, because it's hard to tell, hard to tell apart, especially at 18. hopefully, I would know. know, I'm more of a writer than an investor. And people ask me, what would you do differently at 18? And I think when I think back to my younger self, was very fearful. I was afraid of writing and having it out there in the world, not thinking I was ready.

Ela Richmond (48:21.703)  
That's interesting.

Michael Gibson (48:48.046)  
or prepared enough to write. And so instead I was just gonna study all these other great writers and maybe get to comment on them. That could be like, you know, becoming a professor, all because I was too afraid to think I could become capable of that level of mastery. And so I think if I could change something about myself at 18, it would be to just dive right in. It's like, I wouldn't have gone to college. Maybe I should have just moved to New York and like fought my way into the theater.

or started writing journalism, just finding cracks in the door to do it. That's what I would do now.

Ela Richmond (49:26.619)  
That's interesting. This kind of goes alongside this question. What do you think is the best way to use this creative period of your life? Just like create, like stop consuming, start creating like in any direction possible.

Michael Gibson (49:39.565)  
Yeah, absolutely. think, yeah, there's a few. play guitar and I notice I don't like writing songs. It's it's so bizarre. I like learning new songs. I like other people's songs. Okay, fun. But when I feel a little bit of that resistance, whenever I think about, I'm going to sit down and write a song, it just feels heavy and like work. And so I think it is a muscle. The more you do it, the better you get at it. And the earlier you do it better.

I'm not saying you're going to write songs and try to get them on Spotify when you're 15, but you should learn to overcome that fear that you're incapable of writing a song. And that could also just be math. It can be science. It doesn't have to be the arts, but for me, that's where I think of that question and that feeling of resistance. So the earlier, the better. And then...

And then, yeah, you got to lose this feeling of shame and embarrassment. So it's like, think people are afraid to put something out there because they think it sucks or they want to protect their baby, but you got to get used to it. You got to just get it out there.

Ela Richmond (50:53.757)  
Yeah, I love that. My last question for you. So you have helped a lot of people start companies, build companies, and a lot of them have dropped out of college, right? Most recently, you helped the Figma IPO, which is amazing. just, I mean, being reflective, like, if instead he would have gone through college, like, he would have paid his 200, 300,

Michael Gibson (51:05.954)  
Mm-hmm.

Michael Gibson (51:12.43)  
Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (51:24.539)  
$400,000 and possibly even missed out on his, you know, million dollar, billion dollar opportunity, right? Would you say that you see that often?

Michael Gibson (51:30.253)  
Yeah.

Michael Gibson (51:35.383)  
certainly have seen it quite dramatic in that fashion. Yeah, Dillon Field, the founder of Figma. I ran the Teal Fellowship, helped co-found the fellowship and then ran that for five years. And in 2012, Dillon Field came in as one of our fellows and we helped them start Figma back then. What was kind of cool to see in retrospect is CNBC ran this documentary on us back then.

It's not available online, sadly, but they came to our finalist weekend where we interviewed a lot of the candidates and Dylan was one of them. And they also managed to interview Dylan's parents at the time. And they have his dad on film saying that he's a little worried about Dylan leaving Brown to work on his ideas. And he's concerned about his future. And sadly, a few years ago, Dylan's dad passed away.

was really sentimental for me to go back and watch this and to know the outcome that Dylan's more than okay. So yeah, I've seen it. I don't think if he went to Brown, Figma wouldn't have been how it existed because he would have been pulled into other things. And it's also sometimes these developments that there's a wave, there's a time. And he managed to ride it and control it in such a way that he's arrived to where he's at.

And if you miss that wave, it's gone. So I bet the counterfactual Dylan who graduates from Brown, he's doing all right in that sense of maybe he has a great job at Facebook or someplace. But I don't think Figma has created. And I've seen that a number of times with the people I work with. We work with a lot of younger people who decide to leave school to work on something because some ideas can't wait. And because they decided to make that decision, their life took a fascinating

direction and some have found great success like that others not so much but like I said it's it's who you become in that process and I think all those people we've worked with you know they have a little bit of what you've said where it's like damn that was so hard I don't know if I'd do it if you told me but but boy am I like this badass samurai now who has some you know some lessons learned out there in the battlefield or something

Ela Richmond (53:46.641)  
Hi.

Ela Richmond (53:59.251)  
Dang, that is an amazing note to end it on. Be a samurai. Mike Gibson, everyone.

Michael Gibson (54:02.383)  
Okay. Okay, thanks for having me on.
