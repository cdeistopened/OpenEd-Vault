# Transcript

Isaac (00:01.036)  
Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I am your sometimes host, Isaac Morehouse. Today I've got Corey DeAngelis with me. First Corey, I should have double checked with you. Is that the proper pronunciation of your name? Okay. I've seen your stuff for years. I've followed you. I've seen you in writing, but I just realized right before I said it, I don't think I have ever audibly pronounced your name. So one of the big mistakes of podcasting just committed.

Corey DeAngelis (00:14.497)  
That's right, just like Los Angeles. Thanks.

Isaac (00:29.26)  
Welcome to the Opend Ed podcast.

Corey DeAngelis (00:31.629)  
Hey, thanks so much for having me and thanks for getting the name right on the first time.

Isaac (00:34.798)  
It was luck. So Corey is a well-known school choice evangelist. He's a senior fellow at the American Culture Project, fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research, executive director of the Economic Freedom Institute. You're involved in lots of organizations, lots of efforts all around school choice, education, freedom, and you have a pretty recent book called The Parent Revolution. I want to start there. I love the-

title of your book. It's not the education revolution. It's not about policy revolution. It's not about the system. It's about the parents. What is different about what's happening now? This parent revolution from various times. I remember in the nineties, there was a big push for vouchers like education reform. There've been these kind of waves. This one seems different and I'm

hinted at it, I think it's in the name, give me your take on what's different about what's happening now.

Corey DeAngelis (01:35.406)  
Yeah, it is different and we're winning so much Isaac. I'm almost getting tired of winning. Almost. We're not done yet. We have to get states like California, New York to get across the finish line. It's red states that are going all in on school choice right now. And for listeners, the way I would define school choice is in the current system, the status quo is that you have to go and send your kid to a school just based on your address and your taxpayer dollars have to go there too.

Isaac (01:39.894)  
You

Corey DeAngelis (02:02.509)  
And if you want to opt out, you want to go to a private school, you basically have to pay twice, once through the tax system and then get out of pocket. Or if you want to get access to a better quote unquote public school, you have to basically move residences so that you're assigned to a better institution, which makes no sense. It creates a lot of monopoly power and school choice is any policy that allows some of that funding that's meant for your child.

to follow you to a school that isn't your assigned government run school. So it creates more competition. It allows families to be in the driver's seat to direct that funding to institutions that align with their values or even a homeschool situation as well. And so what's happened differently over the past few years is that, well, the teachers unions really stepped on a rake when they fought to keep schools closed during the COVID era. They held children's education hostage. They knew they could leverage those closures.

for extorting more money from taxpayers. They ended up getting about $190 billion in so-called COVID relief. had nothing to do with safety. The science clearly showed that the school should have been the first things to open and the last things to close. Yet we had the grocery stores open, the bars open, we had private schools open, but the government schools were closed because they had no incentive to do the right thing and listen to parents.

So families got the short end of the stick in the short run, but in the medium to long term, the teachers unions overplayed their hand because they showed parents one, the school system doesn't care about them all that much, but two, perhaps more importantly, they opened the eyes of parents like never before. Parents got to see what was happening in the schools and too many had far left indoctrination happening in the classroom.

Families got to see this over Zoom school. It was a failure in a lot of ways, but it revealed a lot of things. Parents didn't like critical race theory. They didn't like gender ideology. And so those parents showed up at school board meetings, which was what they were told to do all along. The teachers unions have always told us that the public schools have quote unquote democratic accountability. Well, we saw how that worked out. The long story short is that it did not. They labeled parents as domestic terrorists. even

Corey DeAngelis (04:20.665)  
created a threat tag at the FBI, specifically for parents protesting at school board meetings. But now the parents have woken up. They're never going back to sleep. And although the only special interest group that had ever been involved in education represented the employees in the system, now we have a new one. There's a new sheriff in town. They're called parents. They're fighting back. They're winning at the ballot box. And now in the past four years, we've had more advancement on school choice.

than in the preceding four decades. I wish Milton Friedman were alive today to see his ideas finally, finally coming to fruition. We now have 17 states, New Hampshire being the most recent this past month, going all in, meaning all families, regardless of income, background, zip code, they can now take their state-funded education dollars to the school that works best for them. And if that's the public school, fine. Look, if you like your public school,

You can keep your public school for real this time, unlike with your doctor, but the public schools do get better in response to competition and the fear mongering from the teachers unions, that evidence has never come out in public. There's been 29 studies on the topic, 26 of them positive, more school choice. It's a rising tide that lifts all boats. The unions actually had to think about.

how they're gonna spend that money. They shape up or else they're gonna have to close down.

Isaac (05:49.026)  
Yeah, it's interesting. I want to dive a little bit more in a minute into some of the things that became, I think you called it a transparency event from COVID. But first is one of the things you said right away about the current system, sort of the status quo system where it's, know, by zip code and whatever. Matt makes this point in the book, Open Education that we recently released that people talk about

public education like it is, like there's no pricing mechanism. It's just free across the board and therefore it's got equal access. And he's like, no, there is tuition. It's called the house prices in your zip code. The better schools have houses that only some people can afford in those districts. so like, we know this about markets. When you remove the ability to shop and use prices as a signal, like direct money prices for an item.

Prices and rationing will still occur and they'll come out like squeezing a balloon. They'll come out in weird directions and other unintended ways.

Corey DeAngelis (06:51.159)  
Yeah, look at the realtors. The realtors use the school ratings in order to sell houses. So it is tuition by mortgage. You buy yourself into the fancy public schools by buying an expensive house. And so that is a discriminatory system. It discriminates on the basis of zip code. They're not public in any meaningful sense of the word. There are private institutions that charge this indirect tuition. And in some cases, they charge

Tuition directly, I live in Texas in San Antonio, and there's a school district right next to me called Alamo Heights. It's known as like one of the best school districts in Texas. Public school districts, we should call them government school districts because they're not open to all. And they charge families, in addition to what you're spending on the school that you're not gonna send your kid to, if you wanna transfer in, you have to pay over $10,000 per student per year. That's a ton of money considering we're already paying.

for another school we're not using through taxes. And they even go further than that. They also say that they can re-evaluate the student each year based on their disciplinary records, their test scores. So even if you can buy your way in, they have all these other ways to exclude children. these schools are run by the government. They're compelled by the government. They're funded by the government, or at least the taxpayer that the government takes the money from.

They are assigned by the government and they're regulated by the government. So we should call them government schools as opposed to public schools. But at end of the day, the money is supposed to be meant for educating the child. So it should follow them to the school that best meets their needs and aligns with their values. And thankfully, 17 states are figuring that out. Some better than others, Arizona and Florida are doing better than my home state of Texas.

But Texas just got started this year. We passed a program that's universal and that everybody can apply. No income caps or anything. But it's only limited to about 100,000 kids in the initial year, which is only about 2 % of the 6 million school-age population in Texas. It's not utopia, but it is a step in the right direction. It's a great move towards

Corey DeAngelis (09:15.545)  
truly universal school choice like they have in Arizona and Florida. And it's an education savings account, which is kind of this new wave of school choice where we used to talk about vouchers where you could basically only use that money at a brick and mortar private school. But now you can use it for a whole host of approved education expenses, including homeschool curriculum, micro schools. And so it really opens up the supply of

providers of education, which is really important for rural areas too, because in Texas we had school choice blocked for a long time because Republicans voted with lot of the Democrats, all the Democrats. There were 21 Republicans from rural areas in 2023 who voted against their own party platform issue with school choice. Thankfully, two thirds of them lost their seats in the primaries and we got a new makeup of a house that ended up passing school choice this year.

But six of the seven remaining guys who kept their seats, they ultimately voted for school choice this year as well. So the political winds are shifting on our side. But when you have an ESA, that argument that, well, we don't have a lot of choice in rural areas, so therefore we don't need to vote for it, that kind of falls flat on its face because now you can use this funding for providers that have lower startup costs and that can exist regardless of geography.

Isaac (10:42.572)  
Yeah, you know, it's interesting. When you change the where the funds go first and how the funds are allocated or who gets to choose where the funds go, you have all these downstream effects and suddenly education starts to look like what's been happening in the rest of the market for at least 20 years, which is kind of this unbundling and all these new combinations become possible.

and to say like, the parents get to, the money gets to go to whatever school they choose. Even that is actually narrower than what's really happening because the word school, it hardly applies anymore. I live in Florida and we homeschool, I guess, but it's like my daughter just started attending a three day a week school. There's two days and then an optional middle day where you can do sports, but then she also plays volleyball at a different private school.

And then there's a public school where she went to a volleyball camp and like, then she'll do a few things on Khan Academy or something. I don't even know what to call it. It's not really a school. It's not quite homeschooling. Yeah, like that's why we're like, education is just opening up so fast that the boxes don't matter. And that's what happens when if parents get to take that money where they want, we see new formats that we just didn't even know about before.

Corey DeAngelis (11:47.897)  
Hybrid homeschool slash private school. Yeah, I mean, and with these ESAs you could.

Corey DeAngelis (12:06.157)  
That's right. And ESAs have been used, these education savings accounts, which I believe Milton Friedman called multi-use vouchers, if we can change the name. But you can roll over the funding from year to year. It's directed by the parent in a savings account. It's the money that would have followed you to the government school. You can now direct the funding. But you're right. It's not even like public versus private anymore because you can use that funding partially at a public school for certain classes if they allowed you to do that.

And you could use some of the funding for home-based education or a private school course. You know, not as many families are doing that right now, but I believe that's the future of education. And especially when I think about how, you know, I learned things today and how all of us learn before we go to school. even when I was in school, I went to public schools, government schools. So I'm sorry if I have any mistakes on this podcast. That's probably why, but.

Isaac (13:03.202)  
Well, I was homeschooled and I make mistakes too, so yeah.

Corey DeAngelis (13:05.433)  
Yeah, there you go. So I went to government schools all through K through 12. And when I would learn things, was usually I'd go home and read about it. And then I'd come to class prepared. And so I didn't really feel like I was absorbing the information while it was trying to be force fed down my throat in the class. Instead, it was based on interest. It's based on my own time when I want to do it. And that's how human beings learn.

How do people learn how to walk without the government? How do kids learn how to talk without the government? The reality is most of our learning, even with the status quo, happens outside of the government school system anyway. So it should be self-directed. And in Arizona, they've been using these ESAs for over a decade now already. And they've been funding these micro schools where they've had five to 10 children together in a household.

basically economizing on the process of homeschooling. Teachers benefit too because now they have more autonomy, they have smaller class sizes, they can make the same amount of money or even more. Actually, know, broken clock is right twice a day. The Washington Post of all places wrote about this occurrence during the COVID era in New Jersey. They were covering a public school teacher out there.

who had been in the system for decades, decided to leave the government school system and created her own micro school. She was making the same amount of money as a tenured school teacher and had a fraction of the class size, I believe like 10 as opposed to 30. And she didn't have to deal with all the red tape in the government school system. So this isn't just a win for parents and students. I think that's the most important win, but it also happens to be a win for the employees too.

because you have less red tape, you have more competition in the labor market too. mean, the government school system's a monopoly, but it's also a monopsony in that they don't have to spend any of those additional dollars wisely. They don't put it towards the classroom. It doesn't go towards the teachers. And they don't have to treat their teachers well because if you want to be a teacher, where else are going to go basically? You know, the government has most of the market.

Isaac (15:22.454)  
I love that point and it helps reveal that, you know, it's easy to talk about different actors in the economy as if everybody is like one thing and they're in their little box, like, okay, teachers are the providers of education, they're over here, parents and students are the consumers. But all of us play all of these roles all the time. Like most teachers also have children. Most parents have the ability and skill of teaching at least some things.

And when you get to kind of break down, if the only option is full-time teacher that goes through the traditional licensure and that's your full-time job, or no teaching at all, you're losing this massive part of the market. And you look at things like out-school or some of these homeschool co-ops where it's like someone who's a stay-at-home mom, they can't afford to only be a stay-at-home mom. They need to work at least part-time, but they don't wanna work full-time. They wanna raise their kids. They can go and be a teacher.

X number of hours a week themselves on out school or with a micro school. Like what teaching is those teachers were like, I like teaching, but I wish I could do it like two days a week instead of five.

Corey DeAngelis (16:23.725)  
Yes, the gig economy. It's why people like to work for Uber. You can have your full-time job and also do that. A lot of teachers, do Uber during the summer because they're not working the full calendar year. They can make some extra money that way or on the weekends. And I was just talking to someone yesterday actually who's starting this kind of new company to link education providers with consumers of education, the parents and their kids.

And it basically reminded me of the Uber of education. I know there's been other startups trying to do the same thing, but basically, yeah, you're trying to find an expert math teacher or something. You can do that and you can use the review system to figure it out. And with the ESAs, I would imagine at some point you can start paying for these services. And I bet you in some states they already allow it.

Isaac (17:12.386)  
Yeah, I know out school, like I've used it several times. I know that most ESAs will cover out school. It's so cool. The little niche things you can find. I've done it for hair braiding that my daughter wanted to learn. I've done it for Minecraft mods that my son wanted to learn, you know? So the pandemic, I want to just get back to this for a second. I don't want to confuse correlation with causation, but it seems really interesting that we had this...

crazy experience for several months, sometimes much longer, where education was like totally different than it had been for decades and decades. There was this like stop, was this everyone's at home, you're doing online, you're scrambling. Within a couple of years after that, what, like 14 states in a single year, 17 in a couple years past, have we ever seen a policy change that quick in that many states? I have to think something about what happened during the pandemic with education.

made the Overton window shift? What do you see? What specifically about the pandemic, you alluded to some of the things, kind of helped this parent revolution get started.

Corey DeAngelis (18:18.583)  
Yeah, I was just reading something in the 74 this morning. It was someone who was arguing against school choice, but they said the headline was something along the lines of, school vouchers in recent years have been the biggest policy shift in US education in a century. I'm like, yes, we're winning. This is the way. Keep it going. We're not done yet. Keep the foot on the gas. But it was because the teachers unions fought to keep the schools closed, they lost the trust of parents.

I mean, you look at places like Chicago, they had their union tweet out, they later deleted it, that quote, the push to reopen schools is rooted in sexism, racism, and misogyny. But because this, I mean, just they showed, they threw every buzzword at the wall to see what would stick.

Isaac (19:05.069)  
Isn't that implying that every time your kid is in school, wait, do we want them to go back to school?

Corey DeAngelis (19:10.797)  
Well, I had replied to their post with a screenshot from CNN of all places, citing a study showing that if anything, the school closures hurt non-white students the most and low income kids the most. And so they ended up deleting the tweet shortly after they had egg on their face. But so this hurt the unions in the realm of public opinion and that decreased confidence.

especially among conservatives in the public school system. believe the latest Gallup polling showed 9 % of conservatives reporting that they had confidence in the public school system, and that was at an all-time low. so the conservatives were especially upset because they witnessed firsthand left-wing indoctrination in the schools, whether it was anti-Trump sentiment, whether it was

critical race theory, divisive concepts, or gender ideology in the schools. Most parents, especially ones who had their kids in A-rated schools, thought things were okay. They thought the schools were focused on math, reading, and writing. And even independents and Democrats don't want schools focused on a lot of this political nonsense. They just want their kids to get a great education. They don't want...

Isaac (20:28.91)  
I think that's a key point real quick. I want you to finish your thought, but it's not even so much about what is the right thing to teach and the wrong thing to teach. It's about where is that decision coming from and who's watching? It's like if you put in any business, if you put a bunch of people in a closed building for decades and basically guarantee them funding and have no customer choice and just essentially assume they're doing a good job because it's fun to go to the football games.

everyone's gonna start to deteriorate and get used to doing whatever they wanna do. And when people see it and say, wait a second, this isn't how it's supposed to be. Like the mechanism of helping shift, it seems like you should have lots of different schools that have different curriculums in lots of different directions based on the population, the needs and desires of the students and the parents, instead of like this uniform thing that almost nobody likes, you know?

Corey DeAngelis (21:22.293)  
Exactly. It's not one size fits all. It's one size fits none. We should let a thousand flowers bloom instead. And by definition, this system is set up to fail because families are fundamentally going to disagree about how they want to raise their kids and how they want them to be educated. And that's OK. It's OK to have these disagreements. What's not OK is in the status quo, we force millions of families, particularly low income families, to send their kids to institutions that fundamentally

Isaac (21:26.094)  
Yeah.

Corey DeAngelis (21:52.282)  
are misaligned with their values. And it's not even a tyranny of the majority, it's a tyranny of the minority. It's not that a majority of parents are inflicting their will on others, it's typically a small group, the special interest in the teachers unions, people like Randy Weingarten and Becky Pringle, the radicals at the fringe of society, determining how to mold the minds of other people's children.

And that is the problem. And I think the only way out of this through freedom as opposed to force is allowing families to choose schools that align with their values. That way, there's no control of other people's kids. It's you deciding for your own children. That's how it ought to be. Parents should be in the driver's seat. And this should be appealing to people on the left and the right alike because let's imagine you're in a situation where

Your school board is a conservative one and you're a Democrat and you don't like maybe they go too far right on some issues or maybe there's some other type of curriculum that's left a line that your public school doesn't have and you do want that. So this is all about raising children. That's fundamentally what education is about. And the question isn't public versus private. It's not teacher versus student. It's who gets to decide.

Which of these adults get to determine what's best for a particular child? And I think parents are in the best position. They have the best information on the ground. They're the closest to that member of their family. It's their child. No one else is. It's not the government's kid.

Isaac (23:30.914)  
And they're not perfect, but they are going to pay the price for their mistakes regardless. So like they're closest to the cost. They're closest. They have the most interest, the most concern, the most love, the most knowledge. So it's not an argument about perfection. It's like compared to what, know, the, the America is ideally a place where there is a marketplace for ideas and where people can share and people can say, do you, if you like this book, you can buy it, you can read it. And if, if we have a system that does not have that,

Corey DeAngelis (23:34.423)  
Yep. Yep.

Isaac (24:00.29)  
for kids for the first 20 years of their life. And then they're supposed to enter that world and be able to like, this is about make the case for the curriculum, the book, the approach, the pedagogy that you want and find the people who value that and let everybody do that. And it's gonna be robust and dynamic and people will change and shift and there'll be trends that come and go. But that's more accurate reflection of what the world the kids are entering into looks like anyway.

Corey DeAngelis (24:26.979)  
That's exactly right. And parents, yes, they have the most information about their kids in general, but they do have the incentives aligned to get that decision right. Because again, they have to live with them for the rest of their lives. Whereas the employees in the government school system don't. And the bureaucrats sitting in offices hundreds of miles away might not even know you have a child. They might not even know your child's name. They probably don't. And so these top-down solutions also don't really work. And so I live in Texas.

And we banned critical race theory in DEI, for example, but we're finding on undercover video that the schools are still doing it anyway. We have undercover journalists talking to public school administrators where they're openly admitting that they're just moving the goalpost. They're not gonna call it CRT. They'll call it social emotional learning. Or if you figure that out, we'll just change the name to student mental health services. They changed the label, but it's a never ending game of.

whack-a-mole where parents get lost in the process, they get the short end of the stick, and behind closed doors, those government employees basically get to do whatever they want. Whether you agree or disagree with the top-down solution of banning an idea, I think the better solution for freedom's sake, for people to be able to choose the values that are aligned with theirs,

But also, if you really just don't like critical race theory, a better enforcement mechanism is to allow families to have a choice. That should also incentivize the public schools to knock it off and to focus on the basics.

Isaac (26:06.168)  
So you mentioned, I think two of the big impacts that happened because of COVID. One was parents kind of seeing, maybe the administration teachers union apparatus doesn't have my kids best interest in mind. The other was seeing a lot of the content has kind of gone way off of what they assumed it was. I think there's maybe a third that's slightly more subtle. I'd like your take on this. And it relates to technology and people seeing

Okay, my kids did virtual class for a while and in multiple things happen. Some were like, I don't want this. I don't want them just on. Yeah, didn't. Yeah, exactly. I don't want them staring at zoom.

Corey DeAngelis (26:40.729)  
But they weren't doing it anyway, right? So was only advancement to be made.

Isaac (26:49.452)  
Yeah, like the downsides of just trying to replicate the typical classrooms during Zoom and people were like, okay, I know what I don't want. But then there was also some realization that, hey, for some subjects and some things, doing it online is kind of cool. And it means I can do it when I want to and where I want to. There's this very interesting realization of the digital age kind of was really delayed in hitting mainstream education.

And now you quickly force everybody on Zoom and you quickly see both the perils and the potentials of it. And I think that led to like kind of a flowering of different approaches.

Corey DeAngelis (27:25.497)  
That's right, it did. And so yeah, even before the school choice victories, we had a doubling of homeschooling according to US Census Bureau data relative to pre-pandemic levels. So families started voting with their feet even before the money fall of the child. And I can only imagine what those numbers look like today with the education savings account programs blossoming all across the country. And I think there's another piece of it too. So yes, one, parents got to have a taste of home-based education.

Yes, some of them didn't like it, but they weren't doing it anyway. So they went back to the public schools. But the ones who would have never, you know, kind of had this test drive, now we're seeing them switch to the private sector or homeschool sector and never going back because they figured their kids can learn more at a fraction of the time. Their kids were less anxious.

and they were much more confident in their ability. Whereas before they were always told what you're not an educator, you can't figure this out. But you know what, you don't have to be an engineer to figure out who your math teacher is going to be. You can still choose based on heuristic. Everybody kind of knows what the best school is. You have rating systems to figure out who the best teachers are. You don't have to be a dentist to choose your child's dentist. You don't have to be a

surgeon to choose your child's doctor. You don't have to be a formal, you know, university educated person in a teacher's college to choose your child's education. So I think that the confidence was a key factor there as well. But the last piece that I mentioned in the book, too, is that there was a political shift, too, in that

Politicians used to think that if they voted against the teachers unions, they were gonna lose their jobs. But the opposite turned out to be true after COVID because parents started to show up at the ballot box, make their voices heard, and it became a political winner to empower parents. We saw this in Virginia with Terry McAuliffe, the former governor who, in a state that went 10 points to Biden the year before, he lost as a Democrat.

Corey DeAngelis (29:40.004)  
who said, I don't think parents should be telling schools what they should teach at the final debate. It was a huge debate gaffe. It'll go down as one of the biggest blunders politically in history. And Glenn Youngkin saw an opportunity to emerge as the GOP being the parents party. And he made parental rights and education a key part of his campaign. Education ended up being the number two issue in the election.

And that never happens. Education is usually the bottom on the list of priorities of voters. But it was number two. And Glenn Youngkin won with education voters by six points. So there was a huge shift to the right on these issues. Trump even beat Kamala Harris on education. This was kind of an underreported story, but Atlas Intel, the most accurate pollster from 2020 and 2024.

was the only pollster I saw ask this question, but they asked, who do you prefer on education? And on both occurrences, they found that Trump was leading Kamala Harris on education. And, you know, for people who aren't kind of dialed into politics, this might not be very surprising, but for those who are, the Democrats have had a decades long double digit advantage on education. So for things to shift in this way, you know, for me, that should send a signal to the

to both parties like, hey, maybe we should not just listen to the teachers union, let's listen to the kids union too. Let's listen to the parents because they're gonna fight harder than anybody else. They care about their kids more than anybody else.

Isaac (31:15.074)  
Yeah, politics tends to be a lagging indicator of, you know, deeper shifts that have happened. that parent revolution title again is so precious. It's like politicians will put their finger in the wind and when it's safe to go somewhere, they'll start to go there. There's always a few that might go out and on the limb and take a risk and, you know, they'll see, wow, that person did it and they won. And all of a sudden there's a shift and it looks like, it was a big political shift driven by these visionary politicians. It's not, they're like, they're waiting till it's safe.

Corey DeAngelis (31:32.609)  
E

Corey DeAngelis (31:42.126)  
No, it's from the bottom up. I mean, Milton Friedman said it best. It's not about getting the right people into office. He said that the way that you change things is by creating a climate of opinion where it becomes politically profitable for the wrong people to do the right thing. And we have seen a lot of these shifts in the past few years, not just from polls, not just from specific elections like the Virginia gubernatorial election in 2021.

But in Texas, where you had six, seven of the people who voted against school choice on the Republican side kept their seats, they didn't lose their primaries, two thirds of them did, but seven of them remained. Six of them this year ended up voting for school choice after they were primaried on the issue because probably they put their finger, I don't think they had a true change of heart. I know some of them didn't. They put their finger in the wind and said, you know what? This is the right thing to do.

that people are going to hold me accountable if I don't in the end. And you look at people like Josh Shapiro in Pennsylvania, he always opposed school choice. He started to get called the hypocrite when he was running for governor in Pennsylvania in 2022. His opponent, Doug Mastriano, who was backed by Trump, he had said, Josh Shapiro, you know what? You're a hypocrite on school choice because you went to private school. You sent your kids to private school.

But I support it. Right after that, lo and behold, Josh Shapiro changed his education platform online to explicitly include private school choice in the form of what they called Lifeline Scholarships. It was a bill that was run by a Republican the previous year. He ultimately faltered and ended up caving to the teachers unions in the end. But that he had so much pressure to publicly endorse school choice.

is a sign of things to come. And I'm hopeful that, you the more the Republicans win on the issue, the more the Democrats, you know, are gonna be forced to come along sooner than later. You look at places like Louisiana, they went all in on school choice a couple of years ago, and 20 % of their Democrat caucus in the House voted for universal school choice. Now, that's not 100%, it's not where we should be.

Corey DeAngelis (34:05.305)  
but it's a lot better than 0 % where we've been before. So it's a move in the right direction.

Isaac (34:11.182)  
I love it. So we like to end this show on something really positive and actionable. So what would you say, regardless of the policy environment you live in, to parents, what are some steps you can take right now to kind of take charge of your kids' education and help move it towards more freedom for you, more control, better outcomes for them?

Regardless, maybe you're in an ESA state, you got an ESA, great. Maybe you didn't get it because it got filled up already. Maybe you're in a state that's farthest away from adopting ESAs. What are some things that parents can do now that don't have to wait on a change in policy?

Corey DeAngelis (34:50.041)  
Yeah, I'd say look at which policies are already available in your school and in your state. And most states, I believe like 48 of them now have charter schools, for example. And even states like California, which they're coming after the home-based charter schools in California right now. The Democrats in the assembly voted to pass a bill to restrict freedom and education, assembly bill 84. But they have had on the books for a while now,

a policy that if you're in a virtual charter school and you're doing a home-based education, you can have like three or $4,000 per student per year. A lot of people just don't know about these things. And that's a state like California. So look into the policies. I know Ed Choice has a list of a lot of different programs by states. I'd recommend checking them out. And if your state doesn't have the meaningful policy that you want today, I'd say contact your lawmakers and tell them, hey,

Look at what Texas and Arizona and Florida are doing. Why can't you be like them? Parents like it. And so you can be involved. Your voice matters. And I think that's kind of the message of the parent revolution is that parents thought they were powerless before. And they were when the school was initially closed. But once they banded together and locked arms, they became an interest group, more of a general interest than a special interest because they're fighting for their own kids. But they became

more powerful in numbers and beat the teachers unions at their own game. So the positive note is that you are more powerful than you believe. You're a better educator than you believe. I mean, just look at a lot of the stories you see coming out of the public school system and its failures in Chicago. They have 30 to 40 schools with zero percent math proficiency rates. Come on, you can do better than zero percent. So just try things out and don't let the elitists

tell you that you don't have what it takes to raise your own kid because you do. How did you figure it out before kindergarten? Well, you are your child's first and foremost educator, and I would argue the best educator your child's ever going to have. I would take away from this conversation a sense of confidence and also not just in your ability as an educator, but in your ability to affect

Corey DeAngelis (37:14.937)  
policy change. And so just because you live in a state that doesn't have education savings accounts right now, I think that's going to change soon, but it's going to rely on people like you working alongside other parents and grandparents and members of your community to push for the right thing.

Isaac (37:32.584)  
It's such a great point. And so many parents out there don't realize there are more choices than you realize, even in states that don't have great policies. They're just not advertised and talked about a lot of virtual programs, hybrid charter, even just the ability to tell your public school, I'm not going to attend period five and six. Like they can't stop you from doing that. A lot of parents just don't even know that that that's on the table. So always look into maximize the options that you have. love it. Corey, thank you so much for coming, man.

The parent revolution, it's happening right now and you have been talking about it and now you are in the middle of it. So appreciate your time.

Corey DeAngelis (38:09.304)  
Yeah, thank you so much, Isaac. Good talking to you.

## YOUTUBE TITLE OPTIONS

## "How to Fix American Education in One Simple Step" - Interview Setup

### Opening Question Setup

"If you had to identify just ONE fundamental change that would transform American education, what would it be?"

### Expected Soundbite

This question is designed to get Corey to deliver his "fund families, not systems" message in a concise, shareable clip. He'll likely respond with something like:

_"The one simple step is to fund families directly instead of systems. When education dollars follow the child rather than being locked into institutions, we create a market that responds to what families actually need. This single change would drive innovation, improve quality across ALL education options, and restore the natural joy of learning."_

## Alt: **"Fund FAMILIES, Not Systems: How Parents Are Revolutionizing Education"**

- _Thumbnail text:_ "WHAT EVERY PARENT SHOULD KNOW"
- - _Thumbnail text:_ "THE SYSTEM ISN'T WORKING"

## HOST NOTES FOR ISAAC

### Key Themes to Emphasize

- Focus on **educational freedom** and **parent empowerment** rather than criticizing public schools
- Highlight the concept of "**fund students, not systems**" as Corey's central philosophy
- Grant uses "fund families"
- Explore how **personalized education** better serves children's unique needs
- Discuss the **growing parent movement** across political lines

### Follow-Up Questions to Deepen the Clip

1. "What would this look like in practice for an average family?"
2. "How would this one change benefit children with different learning styles?"
3. "What's the most dramatic transformation you've seen when families gain this freedom?
4. "We've seen tremendous growth in alternative education models recently. What do you think is driving this parent revolution?"
5. "How does educational freedom benefit children with different learning styles and needs?"

### Sound Bite Opportunities

- On parent empowerment: "Parents know their children better than any system or expert"
- On educational options: "Education should adapt to the child, not vice versa"
- On the pandemic's impact: "We've seen more progress toward universal school choice in the last three years than in the previous three decades"

## Key Sound Bites to Explore

### On the Problems with Traditional Education

- "The biggest problem with American education isn't funding—it's the lack of freedom for families to choose what works for their children."
- "The one-size-fits-all approach isn't just ineffective—it actively suppresses children's natural curiosity and love of learning."
- "When we force children to adapt to the system rather than adapting education to the child, we're setting them up to fail."
- "Traditional schooling was designed for the industrial era. We're preparing kids for a world that no longer exists." (THIS ONE ALWAYS SLAPS)
- "The question isn't whether public schools are 'bad'—it's whether any single system can possibly meet the unique needs of every child."

### On the Benefits of Educational Freedom

- "Educational freedom isn't just about where your child learns—it's about restoring joy to the learning process."
- "When parents have choices, schools have to listen. Competition drives improvement across the entire system."
- "The data is clear: when education funding follows the child instead of the system, outcomes improve for everyone."
- "Educational freedom allows families to align learning with their values, rather than outsourcing their child's formation to strangers."
- "The beauty of school choice is that it doesn't force anyone to leave their current school—it simply gives options to families who need them."

### On the Parent Revolution

- "Parents became a new interest group during the pandemic—I call them the 'Kids Union'—and they're more powerful than the teachers unions when they band together."
- "What we're seeing isn't just policy change—it's a fundamental shift in how families view their role in education."
- "The pandemic didn't create the problems in our education system—it just revealed what was already there."
- "We've seen more progress toward universal school choice in the last three years than in the previous three decades."
- "This isn't a partisan issue for families—it's about doing what's best for their children. Politicians on both sides are starting to recognize that."

## Potential Questions

1. "You've called the pandemic a 'transparency event' for education. How did virtual learning change what parents could see about their children's education?"
2. "Many parents became 'accidental homeschoolers' during the pandemic. What were the most surprising discoveries parents made when they saw classroom instruction up close?"
3. "There's a saying that 'you can't unsee what you've seen.' How has parents' direct observation of their children's learning during lockdowns permanently changed their perspective on education?"
4. "We saw an explosion in microschools and learning pods during the pandemic. What lessons should we take from these spontaneous educational communities?"
5. "Many families discovered that their children thrived with more personalized attention and flexible schedules during remote learning. How can we preserve these benefits in post-pandemic education?"
6. "What's the single biggest misconception about school choice that you encounter?"
7. "We've seen tremendous growth in homeschooling, microschools, and hybrid models. Do you see this as a temporary reaction to the pandemic or a permanent shift?"
8. "What would you say to parents who are interested in educational alternatives but worry they're not qualified to make these decisions?"
9. "What role should technology play in creating more personalized learning experiences?"
10. Ask about his vision for the future of education in America
11. What practical steps can parents take right now, regardless of their state's policies?
12. How can families start exploring educational alternatives even if they're currently in traditional schools?

[Bryan Caplan’s review of](https://www.betonit.ai/p/parents-take-control) _[The Parent Revolution](https://www.betonit.ai/p/parents-take-control)_ positions Corey DeAngelis as both strategist and chronicler of one of the most significant political shifts in American education policy in recent decades. Caplan opens with a stark indictment of public schools during the COVID-19 pandemic, framing Zoom schooling as a farce that deprived students of real education, social connection, and childcare—while still paying teachers full salaries. In contrast, private schools responded swiftly to parental demand, reopening as soon as legally allowed. This divergence, Caplan argues, made the case for school choice suddenly visceral and urgent for millions of American families.

DeAngelis' book traces the rise of what Caplan calls a “Red State Strategy,” a tactical shift away from decades of fruitless bipartisan appeals for education reform. Instead of attempting to convert moderate Democrats with arguments about equity and opportunity, DeAngelis and his allies chose to rally Republican legislatures already inclined toward school choice. In this telling, the failure of public schools during the pandemic—combined with growing frustration over ideological curricula around race, gender, and sexuality—created a unique opportunity to galvanize conservative voters and politicians.

What makes _The Parent Revolution_ stand out, according to Caplan, is not just its subject matter, but DeAngelis’s role as a direct participant in many of the political victories he documents. The book offers a play-by-play of how states like Arizona, Florida, Utah, and West Virginia moved toward universal or near-universal school choice, and how political momentum continues to build in places like Texas. DeAngelis also aligns himself with a combative style of advocacy, frequently calling out the hypocrisy of public figures who oppose school choice while sending their own children to private schools. Caplan, though typically averse to ad hominem attacks, concedes that such tactics are effective given the demagoguery and ideological rigidity of the teachers unions.

The review acknowledges that DeAngelis’ success is impressive but also points to a broader and more pessimistic dynamic: rather than building national consensus, school choice is accelerating political polarization. Caplan warns that while school choice is flourishing in Republican-led states, blue states remain firmly aligned with teachers unions. He doubts that successful models in red states will persuade their counterparts elsewhere. Instead, he predicts increasing migration from blue to red states as families seek better educational options alongside lower taxes and cheaper housing.

Caplan closes by observing that _The Parent Revolution_ is ultimately a story of both democratic responsiveness and hard-nosed political calculation. The optimistic headline is that parents are finally being heard. But the deeper takeaway, for Caplan, is that persuasion has failed where strategic partisanship has succeeded. DeAngelis, in this view, hasn’t just won policy battles—he’s rewritten the rules of engagement for education reform.

## 00:00 Introduction

**Isaac Morehouse:** Welcome back to the OpenEd Podcast. I’m your sometimes host, Isaac Morehouse. Today I’ve got Corey DeAngelis with me. Corey is a well-known school choice evangelist, fellow at multiple institutes, and author of _The Parent Revolution_. Corey, thanks for joining.

**Corey DeAngelis:** Thanks for having me. And yes, the name is pronounced just like “Los Angeles.”

---

## 02:15 What is the Parent Revolution?

**Isaac:** Your book is titled _The Parent Revolution_. It’s not about policy or systems—it’s about parents. Why is this moment different?

**Corey DeAngelis:** Because we’re winning like never before. In just the past four years, we’ve had more advances in school choice than in the previous four decades. Teachers unions overplayed their hand by keeping schools closed during COVID, and parents woke up. Now they’re not going back to sleep. There’s a new special interest group in town: parents.

---

## 05:30 "One Size Fits None" – The Problem with Traditional Education

**Corey DeAngelis:** Public education is really “tuition by mortgage.” Better schools require more expensive homes, effectively pricing families out. It’s discriminatory by zip code. Families should be able to direct their tax dollars to schools that fit their values and needs, instead of being locked into government schools.

---

## 08:45 How Florida Families Mix and Match Education

**Isaac:** In Florida, my daughter attends a three-day school, plays volleyball at a private school, and takes some classes online. It’s not homeschooling, not traditional school—just a mix.

**Corey DeAngelis:** Exactly. With Education Savings Accounts (ESAs), parents can build customized, hybrid models—some public, some private, some at home. That’s the future.

---

## 11:30 The Future of Hybrid Learning

**Corey DeAngelis:** ESAs allow families to split funds across multiple providers. This unbundling means parents can create a tailored education plan—whether that’s part-time classes, tutoring, or micro schools. It’s no longer about “public vs private,” but about what works best for each child.

---

## 14:20 How Kids Really Learn (Hint: Not in Classrooms)

**Corey DeAngelis:** Most learning happens outside classrooms anyway. Kids learn to walk and talk without government instruction. Real learning is self-directed, driven by curiosity. ESAs empower that by giving families flexibility to choose the right environments.

---

## 17:10 Teachers Finding Freedom Through Micro Schools

**Corey DeAngelis:** This isn’t just good for parents and kids—it’s good for teachers. During COVID, some left government schools, started micro schools, and now make the same income with fewer students and less bureaucracy. It’s a win-win.

---

## 20:45 Chicago’s 0% Math Proficiency Crisis

**Corey DeAngelis:** Chicago has dozens of schools with _zero percent_ math proficiency. Zero. Parents can’t possibly do worse than that. The system is failing, and giving parents choice is the only way to create accountability.

---

## 23:30 "Parents Know Best" – Who Should Decide?

**Isaac:** Parents aren’t perfect, but they’re closest to the costs and have the most love and concern for their children.

**Corey DeAngelis:** Exactly. Education is about raising children. Who decides—bureaucrats, unions, or parents? Parents know their kids best, and they live with the consequences of those decisions.

---

## 28:15 What Parents Can Do TODAY

**Corey DeAngelis:** Even if you’re not in an ESA state, there are options: charter schools, hybrid programs, part-time attendance. Parents should explore what’s available and also push lawmakers. The Parent Revolution is about realizing you _do_ have power.

---

## 32:40 You’re Already Your Child’s Best Teacher

**Corey DeAngelis:** Parents are their children’s first teachers—and the best ones they’ll ever have. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. You already taught them to walk and talk. You can direct their education too.

---

## 35:20 The Path Forward for Educational Freedom

**Corey DeAngelis:** Change is accelerating because parents are demanding it. Politicians are finally listening—not because they want to, but because they have to. This is a bottom-up revolution. Parents are the new special interest group, and they’re here to stay.

**Isaac Morehouse:** The Parent Revolution is happening. Corey, thank you for leading the charge and for joining us today.
