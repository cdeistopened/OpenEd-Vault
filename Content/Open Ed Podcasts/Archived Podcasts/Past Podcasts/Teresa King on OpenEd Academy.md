### Clip #1: The Buffet Approach

```Plain
[CLIP #1 - 24:35 to 25:30]
"What we're trying to build and what we've put into place is a buffet. In so many settings, virtually or traditionally, you sit down and you're handed a menu and you literally have like three choices to pick from. What we want for the OpenEd Academy is for it to be a buffet where you leave what you don't want and you take what you do. We'll offer live time together, synchronous. We'll offer that daily, weekly. It's always going to be optional though. We're never going to say to a family, 'Well, you signed up for the school so every day at two o'clock you better be online.' That doesn't meet the needs of every single family."
```

  

Who says school has to be the same for everyone?!

It's time we stop forcing children to adapt to a rigid system and instead build education around THEM.

At OpenEd Academy, we've created an educational buffet where families take what works and leave what doesn't.

Some powerful principles behind our approach:

- You pick your curriculum from our marketplace
- You set your own course start and end dates
- You choose your pace and breaks for each course
- You decide how much teacher support you want
- Your real-world learning counts for credit

Education shouldn't be "take it or leave it" - it should adapt to YOUR child.

### For Facebook/LinkedIn (Longer Format):

"Traditional education forces kids to fit the system. Virtual schools often do the same thing, just online. OpenEd Academy flips this model entirely - we build education around your child instead. With personalized learning plans, curriculum you choose, and credit for real-life experiences, we're creating the school many of us wish we had growing up. Now enrolling nationwide for 2025-26!"

### For Instagram/X (Shorter Format):

"What happens when a school is designed to adapt to your child, instead of forcing your child to adapt to the system?

### Clip #2: Real-Life Learning Credits

```Plain
[CLIP #2 - 29:02 to 29:56]
"One of the things that we're going to do is actually give transcript credit for real-life learning. If you have a high schooler who has been working at Chick-fil-A and recently moved up to Shift Leader, has taken on all these responsibilities, is learning so much about interpersonal communication and management and time management and customer service and even the finance pieces of doing the register at night. All of those things, that's real-life learning that should count for something we feel, right? So we're going to be able to work with you on getting transcript credit on their actual transcript from us."
```

  

What most people get wrong about education:

MYTH: Learning only happens in a classroom  
TRUTH: Some of the most valuable learning happens in real life

MYTH: Transcripts can only reflect traditional courses  
TRUTH: Work experience, travel, and projects can demonstrate meaningful skills

MYTH: Online school means sitting at a computer all day  
TRUTH: The best virtual schools encourage real-world application

MYTH: Learning must follow a standard timeline  
TRUTH: Education should adapt to each child's unique development

This is why OpenEd Academy gives transcript credit for real-life learning. When your teen works as a shift leader, travels abroad, completes an internship, or starts a business - that's REAL education that deserves REAL credit.

We're launching nationwide this fall, bringing accredited, personalized education that recognizes ALL the ways your child learns.

Who else believes education should value real-world experience?

### Clip #3: The Trust Difference

```Plain
[CLIP #3 - 34:58 to 35:50]
"It's just this lack of trust, I think, is what it comes down to, is that schools don't typically seem to trust parents. And what does it look like when a school trusts parents to know their child and then works with them to create the education that the parent and child are saying to them that they need, that they want, and that would work best for them? That's really where we want to start. The fact that we will listen and trust and understand the learning that's taking place outside our school. That is a foundation based on trust. The fact that we really want to partner with parents, that is part of our foundation based on trust."
```

**On-Screen Text for Clip #3:**  
"What if a school actually trusted parents?"

**LinkedIn Post for Clip #3 (Using "The Question" template):**  
QUESTION: If your child's school actually TRUSTED you to be a partner in their education, what would that look like?

For most families, this feels like a hypothetical question. But at OpenEd Academy, we've built our entire model on this foundation:

Parents know their children better than any system or expert.

Our virtual private school operates on a radical premise - what if we designed education by TRUSTING parents and students to co-create the learning experience?

The result? A fully accredited K-12 school where:  
• You help choose the curriculum that works for your child  
• Your child's unique schedule and learning style are honored  
• Real-world learning counts for transcript credit  
• Teachers support rather than dictate

What would you change about your child's education if you were truly trusted as a partner?

```Plain
[COLD OPEN - 9:58 to 10:30]
"The Open Ed Academy is an opportunity for families and children together to build an individual education from the ground up around that child that works for that child. We're not just taking traditional structures and moving them online. That's actually the last thing we want to do. What we want to do is leverage a lot of different options that being online lets us do in order to build the options around your child."

[Timestamp 12:14] "Instead of being top down, instead of saying like, 'Hey, this is what we do. Take it or leave it,' what OpenEd Academy strives to do is to say, 'Let's look at your child individually and let's build their education from the ground up around them instead of trying to get them to fit into a system that's built from the top down.'"

Enrollment opening August 2025: https://www.openedacademy.com

Most virtual schools simply move traditional education online - same rigid structure, same standardized curriculum, same one-size-fits-all approach. OpenEd Academy is different.

After 15 years helping over 100,000 students personalize their education, the OpenEd Foundation is launching a nationwide virtual private school built on a radical premise: education should adapt to YOUR child, not the other way around.

In this conversation with Teresa King, CEO of the OpenEd Foundation, we explore how OpenEd Academy:
• Lets YOU choose the curriculum that works for your child
• Allows YOU to set your own pace and schedule
• Gives transcript credit for real-world learning
• Builds education on trust rather than control

Starting at just $2,900/year, OpenEd Academy combines the freedom of homeschooling with the support of an accredited school.

### The "What Most People Get Wrong About" Format

```Plain
What most people get wrong about virtual school:

MYTH: Virtual school just means "traditional school through a screen"
TRUTH: The best virtual schools completely reimagine what education can be

MYTH: Online learning means sitting at a computer all day
TRUTH: Great virtual schools encourage real-world application and experiential learning

MYTH: Parents have to choose between structure and flexibility
TRUTH: The right approach offers both - support when you want it, freedom when you need it

MYTH: All virtual schools use the same standard curriculum
TRUTH: Some let YOU choose the curriculum that works for YOUR child

My conversation with Teresa King from OpenEd Academy explores how they're challenging these myths by building a virtual private school that adapts to children rather than forcing children to adapt to the system.

"The things that kids learn outside school should count as learning inside school," Teresa explained - just one of many ways OpenEd Academy is reimagining education.

### The "Day in the Life"

```Plain
What a day in the life of an OpenEd Academy student might look like:

7:00 - Wake up naturally (no rushing to catch the bus!)
8:30 - Begin math course using visual, interactive curriculum that matches learning style
10:00 - Take a break to help with family garden (which counts for science credit)
11:00 - Join optional live session with other students for literature discussion
12:30 - Lunch and free time
2:00 - Work on entrepreneurship project (which counts for transcript credit)
3:30 - Complete history lesson at own pace
4:30 - Volunteer at animal shelter (community service credit)
7:00 - Family dinner and discussion about the day's learning

No two days look alike, because no two children learn alike.

That's the philosophy behind OpenEd Academy, a virtual private school launching nationwide this fall.

In my conversation with Teresa King, we explored how they're building education around children instead of forcing children to fit a system.

"Schools don't typically seem to trust parents," she observed. "What does it look like when a school trusts parents to know their child and then works with them to create the education that they need?"

## Transcript

Ela (00:00.556)  
Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm Ella, your sometimes host. And today I'm joined by Teresa King, who has an incredible background in all things education, especially innovative education. So today we're going to be talking about her experiences and the Open Ed Academy specifically. So Open Ed Academy just launched recently and we're going to dive into why, what, all sorts of things that you get to look forward to. So welcome to the podcast.  
  
Teresa King (00:28.477)  
Hello, I'm so excited to be here.  
  
Alex (00:30.604)  
Okay, so kicking it off, what's the difference between OpenEd and the OpenEd Academy?  
  
Teresa King (00:35.889)  
Great question. Open Ed Inc. exists and has existed for 15 years to build partnerships between families and districts and other partners to broaden access to all sorts of different educational options through those partnerships. And in the Open Ed model, students actually become enrolled in the partner district.  
  
And that is what allows them to have access to a lot of opportunities that Open Ed can then provide as far as curriculum, extra resources, tutoring and support, and everything that goes with it. The Open Ed Academy, instead of being a district partnership model, is in fact its own virtual private school. So with the Open Ed Academy, families get to enroll directly with us and become students of our virtual private school.  
  
It is nationally accredited and it is an opportunity for students and families to really drive their own education. We've designed it to be, not surprisingly, very open. So families have the opportunity to build the education that they want for their child with our guidance and support. We really want this to feel like the best of both worlds, right? The support and structure of a school to the extent that you want and need it.  
  
to drive your vision for your child's education with the freedom and openness of homeschooling and a lot of parent agency to know their child best and what they need.  
  
Alex (02:12.736)  
I love that and we'll get into more specifics as we go on. But can you kind of break down for me, like, why do you care about education and especially innovative education?  
  
Teresa King (02:23.185)  
Yeah, I love to. I think as with a lot of people who do work that's really mission driven, a lot of it's personal, right? So a lot of this comes from my own personal experiences as a student and my own personal experiences as a parent and my own personal experiences as an educator. I started an education over 20 years ago, which is crazy, as a public school teacher. I taught English and I  
  
really noticed that there's a phrase in education that I don't know if it's necessarily taught in teacher appropriation programs or if it's one of those things that teachers and administrators say to each other in a way to sort of get a grasp on what they've been asked to do, which is that you teach to the middle. And what that means is as you're standing in front of a room of 32 children, there is going to be 32 different  
  
levels of readiness, 32 different backgrounds, 32 different foundational knowledge gaps that are missing, that need to get filled, that need to be addressed. There's going to be students in that room that are English language learners. There are just going to be students in that room that have different IEPs and 504s that need those individual needs met. How do you as one person meet 32 different needs as one at once when you're sitting in front of the room?  
  
All you can do at that point, and this is why the phrase exists, is teach to the middle. So if you can reach the middle of those 32 different students, right, what that means, of course, is that the two Ns are ignored, right? If you're teaching to the middle 33%, there's 66 % that...  
  
are not getting what they need. They're not getting enough. They're not, they're getting too much. All of these things exist. So just seeing what those limitations were, it like it does for a lot of teachers, it becomes very frustrating because what you want to be able to do is individualize the instruction because you know that that's best because you care about each one of those kids as individuals, but there's not enough time in the day and there's not enough structures in place to be able to teach them as individuals. So  
  
Teresa King (04:45.881)  
After a few years, I actually moved into virtual education. I became a fully online instructor. And this was in the early days of virtual education. This was 2006. And at that point, we had calling cards that we used for long distance calls. You had to dial the student's number and then you had to put in your 18-digit code to call long distance outside your area code.  
  
Alex (05:04.545)  
Wow.  
  
Teresa King (05:14.461)  
We had pagers. You may be too young for this, Ellen. Do you remember the pager? Okay, good. So we have pagers so students could beep us and we would call them back. So that's the kind of technology that we were dealing with, but we were able to make it work. And it was the beginning of my love for finding ways to innovate, even in situations where in 2006, knowing that we were going to have...  
  
Alex (05:17.558)  
No, no, I remember.  
  
Teresa King (05:40.165)  
and like distance calling cards and there's no such thing as zoom, obviously, right? And knowing all of those what feel like limiting factors, what feel like things that you could point to and say, you can't teach virtually. How would that ever work? Right? And so that's the beginning for me of pushing the envelope of there's sure, there are limiting factors. Sure, there are things out of our control. Sure, there are things that we're gonna have to work around, but we...  
  
If there's not a front door open, we will go around and find a window on the side to climb in through and make this work for kids. And that's kind of like the beginning of that innovative drive for me on how are we going to reach kids as individuals? I found that, and I think a lot of people find this when they, of course, virtual education is much larger now, more pervasive. There are a lot of ways to provide that now.  
  
And I think what I've found over the past 20 years of being a virtual instructor, supervising virtual instructors, working at the district level in virtual education, working for universities that are offering virtual K-12, all of the things that I've started and been a part of in the intervening years, every single person that had made the transition from traditional education over into more innovative ways of doing it said, I don't stand in front of students anymore. I don't see students physically anymore.  
  
but I know my students better than I ever did when I was in a traditional setting. Because you have now the time and space to get to know them as people, because you're talking to them individually, you're having smaller group sessions over Zoom or any other kind of method for collaboration, you're talking to their families. I mean, how often in a traditional setting do you have time to talk to students' families? It just isn't there, right, despite...  
  
a lot of great efforts from a lot of hardworking people. So the surprise for a lot of folks who come to this industry is as the face-to-face physical time decreases, the actual individual interaction increases, which is not what people expect.  
  
Alex (07:52.694)  
Very interesting. No, and I bet that there was a lot of pushback around like the virtual component because there's so much there. There is something to be said for an in person component, right? Like neither you nor I are going to going to argue that there is something super valuable about the in person component. But I think it's the trade off question like what what are the trade offs? And I think there's something else to point out, which is like we're at different stages of innovation here. So like at the very beginning stage of innovation, you have.  
  
the virtual school option, basically, like you create something else, but like you don't have any secondary or like similar things to help around it. Whereas what you're seeing now is there are virtual options and then there are lots of in-person classes and in-person co-ops and in-person things that people can opt into. So like you can now start to create the experience that you want and take the best of every single thing that is offered.  
  
Teresa King (08:37.533)  
So true.  
  
Alex (08:45.806)  
Something that's fascinating to me though is the difference between like virtual ed and traditional school in the sense that like to do virtual ed correctly, like I've heard horror stories of people doing virtual ed and I bet you have to, but to do virtual school correctly, you really have to have the buy-in of the parent, right? Like it's an extremely different thing than in traditional school where like the parent drops the kid off and that's it. And like that maybe they're more involved in like  
  
Teresa King (08:59.259)  
Yeah.  
  
Teresa King (09:10.791)  
Right?  
  
Alex (09:13.944)  
testing and like maybe they talk about homework and maybe they talk about things. Maybe they don't, but like with virtual school, with virtual ed, with personalized ed and open ed, your parent really needs to be very involved in directing that. Can you speak a little bit to that? Yeah.  
  
Teresa King (09:29.501)  
Yeah, I think you're right. I think there's a lot of things at play there. There's so many structural things at play. think for better or worse in traditional ad, so much of it is prescriptive. So much of it is designed already. And as a parent, as essentially a consumer of that service, you don't  
  
Alex (09:48.781)  
Mm-hmm.  
  
Teresa King (09:58.897)  
feel like you have a lot of room to provide input. know, there's what essentially would you provide input on? Many of those things can't be changed, right? There are a lot of hardworking, well-meaning, smart people in traditional education structures as teachers and administrators, and they're being told top-down what to do. They're being told top-down what the curriculum is that we're using.  
  
Alex (10:03.106)  
Mm-hmm.  
  
Teresa King (10:27.099)  
what the instructional method will look like. Most of it is driven by a lot of times, unfortunately, money, right? This is how the school is funded. It's on seat time. It's on average daily minutes. It's on full-time equivalency, whatever you call it. It's on time in seats, which is not a barometer of learning, right? That doesn't, I don't know that a student has mastered any content at all just because he sat in a seat, but that's how a lot of traditional schools have to function.  
  
because that's how they keep the lights on, is making sure that they can document that there's time in seats. All of that is top down. And so parents who interact in that traditional school setting with the school, they feel that. They feel that it's top down. They feel that they don't have a lot of room for agency to make decisions for their child. And all of that comes into play at a structural level, right? I'm not here, none of us are.  
  
to vilify traditional education at all. I'm a product of public schools and I've worked in public schools. I think that the way that parents are wanting to have a sense of agency and ownership around their child's education is a direct reflection of the ways that policy has driven top-down education. Right?  
  
This ability of more innovative models to involve and engage parents, I think, something that is, it's here to stay. It's not going anywhere. This is not a fluke. This is not an aberration. It's not a temporary anomaly. This is the way that it's going to continue to go because it's frustrating to interact with a system or a structure where you feel like you don't have any feedback to offer.  
  
Alex (12:07.906)  
Mm-hmm.  
  
Teresa King (12:23.739)  
Right? So being able to, as a parent, kind of say like, well, I don't, I'm not entirely sure that this textbook that you're using for math or this set of standards that you're using for math is really the way that my child best learns math. Right? So it's sort of this, this conflict, right? This is where you get this point of tension of  
  
If this top-down sort of prescriptive system where there's one choice isn't working for my child as an individual, what do I do then? Because that structure isn't in a position to offer options, unfortunately. So yes, to your greater point of in an innovative or new model, parents are more involved necessarily. I think that's sort of by design.  
  
Right? And we, especially at OpenEd, have designed this to kind of meet the need of those parents who are looking around in a traditional structure and saying, if this doesn't work for me, I can't change anything here. Right? This is set, unfortunately. So where can I go where I do have the ability to build? Right? So instead of being top down, instead of saying like, hey, this is what we do, take it or leave it. Right?  
  
Alex (13:23.467)  
Interesting.  
  
Alex (13:42.702)  
Mm.  
  
Teresa King (13:50.073)  
Instead of that kind of a structure, what Open Ed Academy strives to do is to say, let's look at your child individually and let's build their education from the ground up around them instead of trying to get them to fit into a system that's built from the top down. Right? And yeah, parents are involved and we really want parents to be involved. And quite frankly, a lot of things related to education don't work the way that they can if parents aren't involved. So  
  
Alex (14:06.348)  
I love this.  
  
Teresa King (14:19.037)  
We very much have designed this to partner with parents. We want to have those individual conversations that I was talking about earlier to get to know a child as an individual and to hear from that child and from their family, how do they feel like they learn best and how can we build something around them that meets their needs?  
  
Alex (14:40.768)  
I love that. And I love how you frame this as a feature, not a bug. So it's not like it's not something that happened and that parents have to now like figure it out how to be involved. is because parents are already involved and because they already care about how their kids are being educated, how their kids are being taught, the values that their kids are being instilled. Like because they already care about that and they are asking questions and they are pushing back because something's not fitting or something's not working.  
  
or maybe something's not working as best as it could. That's the reason that we are getting innovative models and not just innovative models, but the type of innovative models that we are getting. I love that. Can you explain a little bit about the academy? What is this program that you're gonna create and that you're actively creating, what is it going to allow families to do different than maybe another virtual school or traditional school that they'd, I guess,  
  
we have these mental models that we're working from, these things that we understand how they work, how is the academy different?  
  
Teresa King (15:43.345)  
Yeah, I'm glad you said that at the end too, because it's so funny when I found myself talking when I'm talking about the Academy saying a lot of things that it's not, right? Because you sort of lean on the existing schema that you have around like, well, what's a virtual school, right? So because we're trying so hard to sort of blow that up and start something completely new and different and open, I often talk about what it's not. So I want to talk about what it is.  
  
Alex (15:51.352)  
Yeah.  
  
Alex (15:57.974)  
Mm-hmm.  
  
Teresa King (16:09.755)  
The Open Ed Academy is an opportunity for, like I said before, families and children together to build an individual education from the ground up around that child that works for that child. Here are the ways that we do that. Specifically, we are focused on several things. Obviously, a personalized learning plan. What does that mean? That sounds like jargon. It means that for each student,  
  
they will have one homeroom teacher who works only with them. And this is grades K through 12. I feel like sometimes some of this personalization in homeroom and getting to know students individually falls down a little bit at upper grade levels. And yes, sure, upper, you know, nine through 12, 11th and 12th graders, they're independent, they're older, but that doesn't mean that they don't need to be seen as people and as individuals. So that individual homeroom teacher support continues across all grade levels.  
  
And that is someone who's going to work with the student and parent and really think through what are your interests? What are your plans? What keeps you hooked? What do you love? What do you don't love? Let's build more of what you want and less of what you don't. Let's meet any gaps and then let's meet any exceptionalities as far as, you know, students who are extremely  
  
extremely advanced in math, for instance, should have the opportunity to do work that is several grade levels, what we consider traditional grade levels, right, above where their age might indicate. And at the same time, do grade level work in English or social studies if that's what they need and want, right? So like, it's not, you might think of a traditional kind of gifted program.  
  
all of sudden you have to do advanced work on everything. Because it's like, you're gifted. So here's everything all at once. But actually, let's look at the course level, at the content level, at the interest level of what that child actually wants and needs across everything. Not just, let's make it easy by saying, they're advanced. Here's advanced everything. Or, they need remediation. So here's remedial everything.  
  
Teresa King (18:29.853)  
Right. Let's actually individualize. That's what a personalized learning plan means. We're also going to provide customized curriculum. And what that means is in any other virtual school, you generally kind of enroll and you get told like, OK, well, here's your English course. Here's your courses. You don't get a lot of opportunity to select how you want the curriculum to look and feel. There are a lot of different curricula out there. Many of our.  
  
audience members today are going to be parents who are currently homeschooling or considering homeschooling. And one of the biggest challenges and points of overwhelm when you're starting to look at that is curriculum. Like, my gosh, what do I use for all of these things? I've got English and do I have to do something separate for reading? Are they going to get grammar? Are they going to get math and  
  
science and social studies and specials or electives or all of these things. It's overwhelming to try to pick between all of these different a la carte options. If you find one that offers all of them, do you like how they do all of them or are there ones that you wish you could pick and choose but now you've paid for an entire curriculum of everything? That piece we want to really help with the overwhelm.  
  
we want to be able to provide targeted solutions. So students and families in the Open Ed Academy will be able to pick at the course level across all of their courses, what type of curriculum provider and platform they want to use for that course for that year. And so we're going to have a lot of different options. There is going to be different types of curriculum, some that are more written for students who like to  
  
take in reading, take some notes on their reading, really kind of process that way. There's gonna be some curriculum types that are more visual, some that are fully kind of like slide-based where you get a visual carousel that's very engaging and changes for our students who maybe have more of like a visual or even auditory kind of processing, right? Those types of options, I think set it apart because  
  
Teresa King (20:48.337)  
Generally when you enroll in a virtual school, it again starts to feel very top down, right? Okay, well, here's your grade level, so here's your schedule, and all the curriculum comes from this place, and it all looks the same, and hope you like it, right? That's not that much different than the traditional in-person school structure that we were just talking about. It just is in a virtual setting. So.  
  
Alex (21:03.789)  
Mm-hmm.  
  
Alex (21:14.69)  
Mm-hmm.  
  
Teresa King (21:15.345)  
We're not just taking traditional structures and moving them online. That's actually the last thing we want to do, right? What we want to do is leverage a lot of different options that being online lets us do in order to, again, build the options around your child. So personalized learning plans, curated curriculum, right? A lot of optionality around all of this. And if this is starting to sound overwhelming in its own way,  
  
Just remember that you have your individual advisor and your homeroom teacher to help you decide best what's going to work for your individual student situation. And then really leaning into teacher support. And so in addition to the homeroom teacher, all of the courses will have their own academic instructors that are going be working in that course with providing grading feedback and helping with progress. And then also tutoring support is available.  
  
credit counseling and academic advisement, especially for our older students. The Open Ed Academy will offer diplomas to graduating seniors in its first year. We're very excited about that. So getting that college counseling piece for our high schoolers and even starting younger than that, if college is a goal eventually for your student and your family, really getting in and figuring out how best to meet that goal individually with you.  
  
and what that might look like. So all of those pieces are there. Plus, and I think this is important when you think about private school, whether it's virtually or in person, we've worked very hard to keep this at an affordable rate because what we're not trying to do is close education. We're really trying to open it up. And we can't do that if we've priced it at, you know, a lot of different private virtual schools.  
  
are out there at $8,000 a year, $10,000 a year, $14,000 a year. We're starting right now at $2,900 per student per year. And that is pretty exceptional, I think, across a lot of different options. And it's very deliberate. We're doing everything we can to democratize knowledge and access, right, to a lot of different options. So...  
  
Teresa King (23:38.651)  
the complete personalized experience that I just described, but at a cost that we've worked very hard to keep as affordable as possible.  
  
Alex (23:46.88)  
I love that one. One thing that's also like so fascinating about the Academy is most virtual schools are for people that want traditional school, but in a different way, the Academy actually can serve homeschool families and people that are very not into the traditional, but it can also bridge that gap between like, okay, you are used to something very traditional and you want something that is kind of traditional, but also that gives you a lot of flexibility. Maybe you're a family that has  
  
travel needs or maybe your family, like whatever it is that your needs are. Like the academy does a really good job of meeting you there. Can you speak a little bit to the part where it's like for homeschool families, this is a virtual school, right, in a sense, but like unlike anything you've ever seen before kind of thing.  
  
Teresa King (24:35.729)  
Yeah, yeah, thanks. That's a great way to frame it. And that's exactly what we're hoping for is unlike anything you've ever seen.  
  
What we're trying to build and what we've put into place is a buffet. I mean, that's how I think about it. And I don't know if it's too simplistic to describe it that way, but in so many settings, virtually or traditionally, you sit down in your hand in a menu and you literally have like three choices, right, to pick from. What we want for the Open Ed Academy is for it to be a buffet where you leave what you don't want and you take what you do. And what I mean by that is we will offer live time together.  
  
Alex (25:02.478)  
Thank you.  
  
Teresa King (25:15.277)  
synchronous. We will offer that daily, weekly. It's always going be optional though. We're never going to say to a family, well you signed up for the school so every day at two o'clock you better be online because there's mandatory live check-ins. That doesn't meet the needs of every single family. We want you to drive your schedule. We'll never put mandatory check-ins in front of you. We'll never put  
  
top-down edicts in front of you because that's not the way that we want to open up education. So every student, every family that signs up gets to drive their own schedule. And that's a daily schedule, that's a course schedule, that's a completion schedule. I talked a little bit about getting to pick which kind of curriculum you want for each course. You also get to pick which kind of schedule you want for each course. So again, going back to my example from before,  
  
If your child is very advanced in math, loves doing math, always only wants to do math, you can tell us like, hey, listen, we're going to probably fly through this math class and we're going to finish it in about four months. Is that OK? Yes, that's OK. And you can also say, I have to kind of we might have to drag him through this English course. We might take 11 months to do this English course. Is that OK? Yes, that's OK.  
  
Every single one of your courses can be paced and scheduled in a different way that meets your child's needs and meets your family's needs. So to your point, Ella, like if you are traveling, if you have other obligations, other opportunities that come up, if your child is very engaged in a sport or chess or dance or whatever else might be the case, school will fit around your schedule, not the reverse.  
  
You don't have to change your schedule to fit around school. We want this to fit your life. Now, the kind of other side of that is what you were mentioning before. For our families who really want a structure and really want a schedule, if you say that to us, if you say, listen, I know we could kind of leave this wide open and each course could have a different end date and we could do different kind of schedules, but that feels...  
  
Teresa King (27:33.157)  
a little loosey goosey and I'm afraid that might not motivate my particular child to get their work done. And I don't want to have to be sort of the bad guy in my own house, always nagging about getting the work done. So we can then say, OK, great. We're going to put every single one of these courses on a set pace with set due dates at certain times. And we, the home run teacher, will work with you to hit those milestones and make plans to hit the next one together.  
  
We'll support whatever level of structure works best for your family's needs. And that's what I mean by a buffet. You can go up there and you can take from the very structured menu, that little bowl of structured, you can take from the kind of more open and flexible structure. Either way, we're gonna offer accredited transcripts for credit that will travel with you  
  
Alex (28:12.152)  
Mm-hmm.  
  
Teresa King (28:32.797)  
wherever you go next and will eventually get you to a diploma if you stay with us through the end of 12th grade. I guess the other thing I also want to say about sort of this flexibility when it comes to specifically to your question, like homeschooling families that may be looking at this, one thing that we also want to be aware of and what we've built in is the fact that not all learning takes place in our curriculum.  
  
Alex (28:41.134)  
That's very cool.  
  
Teresa King (29:02.715)  
There are so many students and we know this because of running, especially our open ed program for the past 15 years, so many students that are doing so much learning outside of any kind of curriculum. And what I mean by that is like community service projects, entrepreneurial things that our kids have started. We've seen so many of these and they're incredible. The things that kids learn outside school.  
  
should count as learning inside school. That's a big tenet for us. So one of the things that we're going to do is actually give transcript credit for real life learning. If you have a high schooler who has been working at Chick-fil-A and recently moved up to Shift Leader, has taken on all these responsibilities, is learning so much about interpersonal communication and management and  
  
time management and customer service and even like the finance pieces of like doing the register at night. All of those things, that's real life learning that should count for something we feel, right? So we're going to be able to work with you on getting transcript credit on their actual, you know, sort of report card, right? Their official transcript from us.  
  
is gonna be able to reflect the learning that you're doing in real life. So many of our homeschooling families go on incredible educational trips, right? And they're visiting Civil War battlefields and they're going to different historical sites. All of that is learning that they're doing in real life. And we want to be able to give the credit that they deserve and that they really have learned this material. And so our transfers are gonna reflect that as well.  
  
Alex (30:56.598)  
And that's also so huge. Why do you think an option like this is important? like something that I've seen, especially being in this industry for a little while, is that there are the standard options and then there are starting to be things in between. like, there's not, if you were to start homeschooling it or if you were to get to a point in your traditional education journey as a parent where you're like, okay, something's not working, you can't just say,  
  
now I'm going to build out the perfect education for my kid. Like now I'm going to imagine like what would my perfect, perfect experience be? It be like, you know, we have the support of this. We don't have the top down, whatever of this. like it, it truly would be a mix and match. It would be like, if I could build out my perfect thing, at least for me, it'd be like, okay, well, you know, I'd have somebody that I could go to for questions. I'd have some.  
  
Teresa King (31:44.241)  
Yeah, I think so. Yeah.  
  
Alex (31:53.75)  
this, I'd have, know, like if I could build it out perfectly, like this is what it would look like. But in the past, you didn't have that opportunity in that option. It was like you choose either or and like you accept the pains that come along with the either or. So like in the past, like shout out to all the old homeschoolers that have like have been homeschooling for like 20 plus years. Like they did it with nothing, you know, and they did it with a lot of pushback and a lot of a lot of people looking at them and not understanding.  
  
Teresa King (32:15.932)  
Yeah.  
  
Alex (32:22.764)  
And then on the other side, there are so many people that are in the system that wish that they could have done something different but couldn't. So that's what I see. What have you seen, especially being inside of the world of innovative education for so long?  
  
Teresa King (32:34.909)  
Yeah, no, it's so true. you know, it has felt so much like you leave one kind of modality of education for another one and you've just sort of flown out of the frying pan and into the fire, right? It's to your point, it's like, well, I've just created different trade-offs. know, like, yes, moving to this full-time virtual school,  
  
has meant that I don't have to fight a battle every morning at 7 a.m. to get him up, because he can start at 9 a.m. So that's great. But at the same time, I didn't get to pick the course types. I don't get to change his schedule based on his abilities or interests or needs. I don't get to determine what the schedule is. It still has a rigid first day of school and the last day of school. If he's not finished with all of these classes on the last day of school, which is an arbitrary calculation, then he fails.  
  
Right? Those are still limitations. It's just that they're online. Right? That's not as innovative as I think we can be in 2025. And it's not as open as I think students deserve. Right? So why don't we, and this is, you know, as we're kind of part of this open education movement overall, you asked me at the top.  
  
How does this differ from open ed? Right? How is open ed different from open ed academy? What I'll say and I talked a little bit of those differences how they're similar is the fact that we literally share the same vision and how we go about reaching that vision is kind of different ways to provide different options for families based on what they like best but that vision is to create a world where every child can build the education they need and  
  
when all you've done is taken traditional structures and move them online. And when all you've done is sort of replicate what's already known and keep that feeling of, well, we're the school so we know best. That's one of the biggest things that I want to get away from with Open Ed Academy is that, I don't know, I hesitate to like call it.  
  
Teresa King (34:58.905)  
It's just this lack of trust, I think, is what it comes down to, is that schools don't typically seem to trust parents. And whether they're traditional and in person or online or anything else, what does it look like when a school trusts parents to know their child and then works with them to create the education that the parent and child are saying to them that they need, that they want?  
  
and that would work best for them. That's really where we wanna start and where we see like a differential, right? And so like to your point about like, why is this needed and how is this different and what's gonna, that driving factor of, know, online, in-person, full-time, whatever, all of those things seem to often share sort of this kind of...  
  
feeling, right, this sense that parents have, and I felt it as a parent, right, of I couldn't possibly speak up because, I mean, they're the school, they know best, right? And schools having that same kind of feeling of like, well, sure, but listen, this is what we need to do. These are what our standards are for sixth grade math. So.  
  
I hear you saying that like, you you feel that your child is more advanced than this, or you feel like this is too advanced for your child, but he's 12, so he's in sixth grade, and this is what we do for sixth grade math. Like that kind of prescriptive, rigid approach, I really think is rooted in a lack of trust. So, you know, you can see this, this is what we wanted to build in, and you can see it in a lot of different.  
  
things that I've talked about as far as the specifics of like, what does your day look like in Open Ed Academy? The fact that we will listen and trust and understand the learning that's taking place outside our school. That is a foundation based on trust. The fact that we really want to partner with parents, that is part of our foundation based on trust. And I think, you know, to your question, which is a great one, like, how is this?  
  
Teresa King (37:18.321)  
Why is this needed and how is this different? It's because I feel like there's so many parents out there who are looking around at the structures that have been built in person, in traditional ed, in virtual ed, and kind of saying like, it kind of feels all the same, right? And so at that point they're like, I guess my only option is to homeschool. And so for those types of parents, we're wanting to answer that call to say like,  
  
Yes, you can have the homeschool, the things that you're looking for when you say, I guess I just have to homeschool. You can have those with the structure and support of a school. We will meet that need and we will trust you when we do it.  
  
Alex (38:02.432)  
I love that. I think the vision that I see is like flourishing on an individual level as opposed to just getting by. I had this like, I have this phrase that I repeat in my head. It's like when individuals flourish, societies flourish. when at a micro level, you have individuals that are living in their best that have figured out what it is that they're good at. Because you don't just like...  
  
You don't just usually have like an aha moment. It's like, okay, I'm incredible at this and this is where I'm going to go for the rest of my life. It's like, it's a discovery process. It's like, okay, I like this. I'm going to do more of this. I've found this little thing that I like inside of this. I'm going to do more of this. And it's like, you're finding the things that you are good at. You're finding the industries that you can help and that light you up. even from like a kid level, I always, I talk to,  
  
Teresa King (38:35.121)  
Yeah. No.  
  
Alex (38:59.062)  
my family about this quite often. like, I feel like for my education, one of the things that was the hardest possible was because I went through a traditional school experience and it was very prescriptive. I never learned all the things that I could win at. Right? So like, like there are a set number of games that you can play inside of a traditional setting. And if you can't, if your family can't give you experiences outside of that, or like they don't even know where to begin, then you never  
  
you never experience feeling like you're good at something or feeling like you win at something. And I think that's key for kids is finding something that you can be great at and then pursuing that and then pursuing it more. And that is the path of finding your passion and building on it. One thing that's difficult though, and that's kind of why I preface with that is,  
  
Teresa King (39:33.66)  
true.  
  
Alex (39:53.8)  
When the path is not prescriptive and when there are not a set number of games that you can play, it feels risky, right? Like it feels risky to say, okay, you can pick it yourself. You can build your own adventure. You can try any of these curriculums. And like you are going to be kind of leading your kids, your kids education with support, of course, but it feels risky. Like what if  
  
Teresa King (40:02.427)  
Yeah. Yeah.  
  
Alex (40:20.866)  
what if, know, let's say we are in sixth grade math or sixth grade and math's not going great and we've tried three different curriculums and we feel like failures and like if we were in the regular school system, we'd feel great because by the end of the year, he got through math, right? Like there is a set standard of like, okay, this is success in traditional school. And I feel like you almost have to redefine it in a personalized education world because  
  
Teresa King (40:36.317)  
Yeah.  
  
Alex (40:49.08)  
For example, going through three different curriculums for us would be considered success. So can you speak a little bit to that experience as well? Because that's something that's really hard.  
  
Teresa King (40:53.788)  
I'm  
  
Teresa King (40:58.255)  
No, it is. there's what comes, you know, it's part and parcel for the sort of factory experience of education that unfortunately so many of us had. And part of what we're trying to change is that only the things, only the learning that the system has determined is valid gets validated. So like we have  
  
Alex (41:24.632)  
Mm-hmm.  
  
Teresa King (41:27.269)  
I mean, like three different levels of Minecraft electives, right? We have Minecraft as a course on your schedule that you get credit for and that you learn even more about and that you can share with your peers and you can become a peer mentor, right? For students in Open Ed Academy that are just starting out, you have learning there and that learning translates to skills.  
  
And those skills are things that you can start to share. And at that point, you're learning about collaboration. You're learning about how to structure information that you know in your head in a way that you can transfer to others. Those are workplace skills, right? Those are real life, real world adult level professional skills. Those are the soft skills. I don't know how I feel about that phrase because it sounds like, know, but those are the those are the real world communication skills.  
  
that employers value that you will need for the rest of your life. That's part of being in a society to your point that is enriched. so I think that the fact that it does feel a little risky, it does feel a little unknown, those are the ways that it reflects the growth. I think this is all of us kind of growing together on what education can be.  
  
And if you ask anyone, in my opinion, if you ask anyone who went through a traditional education, if they have a story of feeling very bad about themselves in school, they will say yes, right? They will say that, yeah, everyone was always done with their work before me in class, because I just took so long to do.  
  
the same math problems, everyone else seemed to get it. I always had a question, but I didn't want to raise my hand because I felt like I was the only one who didn't know. All of those things are there because they probably had a ton of skills in a lot of areas that happened to be the areas that aren't validated by traditional education. And so, part of what we can do with opening up education is helping  
  
Teresa King (43:50.703)  
Children recognize where their skills are and validating them, whether it's something that's traditionally taught on a school schedule or not. And that's what's so exciting to me too, right? We talked at the top about like, you know, why do I do this work and how did I get into doing this? And a lot of it's personal, right? Because you see, I saw as an educator, the students who, like I said before, were getting lost.  
  
right, because we weren't able to individualize the way that we wanted to. And I think you're exactly right. There's a lot of skills outside of the four core subjects that we still teach. And the other thing I would say about this, and I've said this so many times, I say this to my own kids, they're 18 and 14. And so they're at an age where, my daughter's in college and she's finished her first year of college and she's like, I'm not really sure what I want to do.  
  
Alex (44:31.8)  
Mm-hmm.  
  
Teresa King (44:48.509)  
She's like, am I, should I be worried? And I tell her every job that I've ever had, with the exception of what I taught my first couple of years, right, in a traditional setting, every job that I've ever had didn't exist when I was in high school. So like I went on to be a virtual teacher and a virtual principal and a district leader in a virtual school and then moved into educational technology.  
  
to deliver online courses to different schools and professional development and how to teach in an online setting. None of those things existed when I was in high school. I could not have as a 16 year old or 17 year old looked at you and said like, well, what I'd really love to do is work in virtual educational technology. It didn't exist, right? So there's also some level of like embracing the fact  
  
that when we validate the skills outside of English social studies, science, math, when we recognize by knowing students as individuals and validate those skills and build them with them through opportunities, we're actually empowering them to live and work in a future that we don't know about yet.  
  
Alex (46:12.364)  
Wow, I love that. Okay, I'm gonna hit you with a couple rapid fire questions and that'll wrap it up for today. Rapid fire question number one, what is your vision of education in the future? Say like five years since 10 is who knows?  
  
Teresa King (46:16.466)  
Okay.  
  
Teresa King (46:28.445)  
I know, I know. Gosh, I don't want to be a cliche right now, but I think it's going to include AI. I mean, I don't think it's going anywhere. I think it's going to include AI. I hope, my hope, as I mean, ultimately, I try to be a hopeful person. My hope is that it is intelligent AI that can do a lot of what I was just saying, which is like draw out and expand on skills that people have, that students have, that will actually help them.  
  
from like a almost a tutoring perspective of not giving them the answers, right? But helping them get to answers to sort of do like intelligent work with them. So I think it's gonna include AI and I think it's gonna become even more over time. I think this, I think it's become more broadly personalized, which might not sound like it makes sense, but I think there's gonna be a more broad opportunity.  
  
for deep personalization, which I think is just gonna lead to incredible outcomes. To your point, it's gonna let people see their wins, and it's just gonna empower so many people.  
  
Alex (47:36.43)  
I love that. What is your best advice to parents that are not sure about how to even do any of this personalized stuff?  
  
Teresa King (47:45.691)  
I mean, I don't blame you. It's so much, right? It feels like so much. And I know this is a rapid fire portion, but I'm just going to tell a quick story. I had taught, I had been involved in education, I had done all those things. And then I had my daughter and she was in kindergarten and her kindergarten teacher called me and she said, because I had sort of asked a question in email.  
  
you know, like, hey, is this, is this okay that she's not yet doing such and such? Right. And her kindergarten teacher called me and she said, she's doing just great. You're doing everything great. And I hung up the phone and cried because I didn't know how much that kind of like validation would mean to me as a parent. And all we're doing as parents is just trying to do the right thing for our kids. And we never know if it's right or not.  
  
And it's so scary because you're making these little humans and you don't want to mess them up. I mean, that's really what it comes down to. It's like, that's your anxiety as a parent is like, am I doing the right thing? Is this going to ultimately be to their benefit? And that's the worry. So I think as you're looking at different ways of going about education, you're like, I just don't want to mess them up. I don't want to put them at a deficit. don't want to look back on this and regret it thinking like, my gosh.  
  
They could have done X, and Z, but I messed this up. That's what you're trying. That's the anxiety as a parent. So I think if you're looking at it and you're worried about it and you're wondering about it, call me. I mean, that's what it comes down to. It's like, we're running this program. We're just a bunch of people too, right? We happen to have experience in education and in building educational models and in helping students succeed. So the same way, you know...  
  
If you had a question about why your plants weren't growing, you'd call an arborist. If you have a question about how to help your child best succeed in education, call us. I I will talk to you about it. A lot of people here will talk to you about it. We'll tell you what we've seen. Tell us about what you're looking for and what your goals are and what you're trying to achieve. listen, we may not offer a program that best meets what you're describing, and that's OK.  
  
Teresa King (50:08.273)  
We won't try to fit you into what we're doing if that's not the best move for your child, but we're happy to talk to you about it anytime.  
  
Alex (50:17.484)  
I love it. And last question, where would you begin? So like, let's say that you were starting with personalized ed, you're like, okay, this is for me. just, now what?  
  
Teresa King (50:29.585)  
Yeah, honestly, start small. think a problem, like not a problem, but I think part of the challenge sometimes is like, you're like I said, you're like raising this tiny human and the stakes are high and you feel that and you really want to do right by them. Start small. What do you want to do for school this year? That's it. What do you want to do for school for the next six months even? You know, there's so many options and there's so many ways to blend them and there's so many different things to go about. Just start small.  
  
My daughter did something a little bit different for every school year, for about five school years in a row. One year she homeschooled, one year she went to traditional school, one year she did a hybrid thing. Your kids are changing every year, you know that. Their educational needs may change every year and that's okay. So don't get too caught up in like the stakes, right? Of like, what are we gonna do for their education? Just kind of think about like, what does this child need?  
  
right now. It may be different from the other children in your house even. They're all going to have different kind of needs as time goes on. So kind of looking at, all right, this isn't working for this child. What are we going to do for this year? And then you can see how it goes. And I think if you can kind of start small, keep the perspective, and then design solutions and we're happy to help with it, just to kind of figure out like,  
  
What do we do for this year and how do we see how it works?  
  
Alex (51:59.616)  
this year for this month.  
  
Teresa King (52:01.541)  
Yeah, yeah, for this, for this child, for this month, for this year, for this, for this course. Yeah.  
  
Alex (52:07.83)  
Yeah, it makes it a lot easier whenever it's like, okay, we will temp check this throughout. Like it is okay to temp check it. And I mean, it also empowers the child, like not just the parent, but like for me, for example, like I had a really hard time understanding science for the longest time. And it was just like, I couldn't read a book and just like take in all the facts. That's not how my brain works. But like, if somebody would have asked me throughout science classes, like what is your  
  
Teresa King (52:28.701)  
know, right?  
  
Alex (52:37.396)  
issue, like what is going on and like let me just explain and talk through it. Like I think even as a student, like you don't diagnose yourself as bad at X, you start figuring it out. Like you start saying, okay, if this is aligned with my goals, like if I want to be a doctor and I'm not just like naturally getting this science stuff because of the way that it's being taught to me, that's okay too. How can I solve for that? So it's like,  
  
It's like you create a new ability to achieve your goals whenever you can actually diagnose problems around it as well.  
  
Teresa King (53:12.797)  
Yes, yes. And it's so empowering to be able to, like, first of all, to be able to be offered the time and space for that reflection and then to be supported in it, right? Like through a teacher, to be able to sit down with you and like with a parent and kind of say, like, lead with curiosity, right? What's going on? What do we feel like is happening here? Like, let's figure it out.  
  
Alex (53:36.386)  
Mm-hmm.  
  
Teresa King (53:41.851)  
I really want to figure it out with you. That's huge. That's everything to a kid. And it can make a difference that, to your point, lasts their whole life because now they've decided to actually go into medicine because somebody actually sat with them and worked through and helped them get to know their own brain better.  
  
Alex (54:02.07)  
I love it. This has been so cool and so cool to get to know your story and just kind of like your mission too with Open Ed Academy. A lot of people that listen to podcast are very familiar with Open Ed and just learning about the Academy. So if you want to learn more, we have an info guide that you can get for free on openedacademy.com. And that's really, really easy place to learn just like what is the difference between Open Ed and Open Ed Academy and maybe see who it could be good for too, because we offer the Open Ed Academy nationwide.  
  
and in international countries. So tons of opportunity here for personalized ed for everyone. So it was so good to have you on and thank you so much for coming on.  
  
Teresa King (54:40.967)  
Thanks, Ella. Love this.
