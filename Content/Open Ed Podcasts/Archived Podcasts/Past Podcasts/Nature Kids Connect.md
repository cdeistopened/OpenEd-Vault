- **TOOL: Wilderness Survival and Animal Encounters**  
    Speakers: Multiple Nature Kids Connect participants  
    "So speaking of wild animals, we do a backpacking trip, or we have for the past two years, and we go to same place. And this year, we have lots of encounters with wild animals, especially me and my group. So when we first entered, there's this two hikers that came back and were like, I have so many wild animals here. And they said, you'll be lucky if you see a badger, because we saw one, and it's really lucky. So we went up, and we saw saw a badger... The next day, me and my friends... ran into something a lot bigger... We looked over and we saw a baby cub slide down a tree with their little ears and everything. And we looked and we're like, there's a mama cub. Wait, no, no, there's a mama bear. There's a mama bear. And it started moving towards us. We were on a hill and we're like, crap. And we ran so fast down that hill. It was crazy."  
    Timestamps: [09:13] to [11:07]  
    Why it's compelling: This clip captures the excitement and challenges of wilderness encounters, demonstrating how the program provides unique, hands-on learning experiences about wildlife and survival skills.

## Polished Transcript

Here’s a polished version of the transcript divided into chapters with timestamps:

---

### **[00:01] Introduction**

**Charlie Deist**:

Hey everyone, welcome to the Open Ed podcast. I'm Charlie Deist, and today, we're departing from our usual one-guest format. We have six people here from a program called Nature Kids Connect. It’s a community-based outdoor enrichment program. It’s not a full-time school, right?

**Nature Kids Connect**:

Yes.

---

### **[00:36] A Day at Nature Kids Connect**

**Charlie**:

Annalise, can you describe how the program works and what a typical day looks like?

**Annalise**:

People either get dropped off or gather in the parking lot. We start with a nature-related game, then go on a hike to our sit spots for quiet reflection for about 30 minutes. After lunch, we have a themed activity, usually related to nature, followed by free time to explore.

---

### **[01:59] Program Schedule**

**Charlie**:

How often does this program take place?

**Nature Kids Connect**:

It happens every Friday from 10:30 AM to 2:30 PM throughout the school year.

---

### **[02:26] The Difference of Fridays**

**Charlie**:

Tondra, how does this outdoor day compare to your usual week?

**Tondra**:

Fridays feel special. It’s a break from the routine—getting outside and enjoying nature. I've been doing this since I was eight, and now I’m 15. But even though it’s fun, you have to be prepared for winter. If you forget gloves, you'll feel the wrath of frostbite!

---

### **[03:50] Dealing with Bad Weather**

**Charlie**:

What do you do if the weather is bad, like really rough?

**Nature Kids Connect**:

There was one time a storm rolled in while we were at Dippledale. It was so bad that we huddled against a hill until we had to leave early. A tree even got struck by lightning that day. But usually, we embrace the weather—rain, snow, or shine!

---

### **[05:16] Outdoor Learning Experiences**

**Charlie**:

It sounds like you’ve had some intense learning moments outdoors. Have any of you had an experience during journaling that made a connection between something you learned in a more structured environment and what you saw outside?

**Nature Kids Connect**:

There was this time I found a bird murder scene—bird feathers everywhere, tracks, and poop. I thought it was a fox, but my mom said it was just a dog. Still, I journaled about it and felt like Sherlock Holmes!

---

### **[07:22] Wild Animal Encounters**

**Nature Kids Connect**:

One time, I saw a coyote while sitting near a bridge. It was missing half its ear and eating something. I journaled about that too. Another time, on a backpacking trip, we saw a badger and even ran into a mama bear with her cub! We sprinted down the hill—it was terrifying but amazing!

---

### **[11:07] Dimpledale Adventures**

**Charlie**:

Can you describe Dimpledale, the place where you spend most of your time?

**Nature Kids Connect**:

It’s a huge, 600-acre canyon park with mulch trails. There’s a lot of wildlife—foxes, weasels, deer, and even turkeys. Once, we stumbled upon a wasp nest, which was traumatizing!

---

### **[12:52] Outdoor Social Interactions**

**Charlie**:

Do you think your friendships are different because they were formed outdoors?

**Nature Kids Connect**:

Absolutely! Running from a bear with your friends definitely strengthens bonds. We’ve done campouts where we slept in hammocks, stacked on top of each other. And one time, we cooked a whole pig over a fire—it was a wild experience!

---

### **[16:38] Food Challenges**

**Nature Kids Connect**:

During campouts, we do a food challenge where we eat weird things like century eggs and chicken hearts. I was the only one who finished the challenge and got to eat a fully formed chicken inside an egg. It was crunchy!

---

### **[19:47] Entrepreneurship Program**

**Charlie**:

I heard there’s also an entrepreneurship program. Can you tell us about that?

**Nature Kids Connect**:

Yes, we manage the website, social media, and expenses. We're still new to it and haven’t faced many problems yet, but we’re excited about learning how to run the program.

---

### **[21:11] Grand Canyon Trip**

**Charlie**:

You mentioned a Grand Canyon trip?

**Nature Kids Connect**:

Yes, we did a rim-to-rim hike—24 miles! It was mentally and physically challenging, especially the seven miles uphill at the end. But it was an unforgettable experience.

---

### **[24:28] New Perspectives**

**Charlie**:

Ashurla, you just joined. How has this program impacted your other studies?

**Ashurla**:

It’s refreshing to do a class outside a building. After being in nature, I go back to my other studies with a recharged mindset.

---

### **[27:06] Memorable Pranks**

**Nature Kids Connect**:

We love pranks! Once, we planted a granola bar that looked like poop and pretended it was fox poop. When we ate it in front of the younger kids, their faces were priceless!

---

### **[28:06] Words of Wisdom**

**Charlie**:

Do you have any advice for someone who feels cooped up and might want to try something like this?

**Nature Kids Connect**:

Don’t knock it till you try it! You have to get your hands dirty at least once in life.

---

### **[29:34] Screen Time and Technology**

**Charlie**:

What’s your take on screen time? Do you think your generation is figuring out how to balance it with real-world activities?

**Nature Kids Connect**:

At Nature Kids, phones are not allowed unless you’re taking pictures. It really helps us interact more with each other and focus on the experience. Technology can be useful, but it has its place.

---

### **[35:00] Final Thoughts**

**Charlie**:

Thank you all for sharing your experiences! It’s been great to learn more about Nature Kids Connect, and I’m sure others will be inspired by what you do.

**Nature Kids Connect**:

Thanks for having us!

## BIG IDEA / HARD-HITTING SOCIALS

  

1. Heavy Hitting One Liner:

You can drastically change your life in 3-6 months with 1 hour a day in nature.

1. Personal Anecdote Hook:

I run from bears, sleep in hammock sanctuaries, and eat century eggs for fun. My small outdoor group has opened up a big world. For the last 8 years, I've grown in ways I never imagined. Next month, I'll be hiking rim-to-rim in the Grand Canyon. We've been learning outdoors since day 1, and I have yet to regret a single muddy day. It has never been easier to make learning an adventure.

1. The Hard Truth Post:

Hard pill to swallow:

Your lack of connection with nature isn't due to lack of opportunity.

It's due to lack of initiative.

You know what to do. You're just not stepping outside consistently.

1. Headline + List:

Long list of things you don't want to do but that will change your life:

- wake up at 2 AM to hike
- eat weird foods on campouts
- run from wild animals
- journal about nature
- disconnect from technology
- have difficult conversations
- hear different opinions
- do the hard stuff outdoors

1. Challenging Common Beliefs:

It's mentally healthy to not be up-to-date about everything all the time. Disconnect, get outside, and let nature be your teacher.

1. Commentary on Popular Ideas:

If you don't have a purpose, everything becomes your problem. You don't have a way to filter important information that helps you achieve your goals. You slowly drown in distractions until you can no longer think, act, or be yourself. This explains the misery of most people stuck indoors.

1. Experiment Suggestion:

My focus checklist:

- Strong vision for the future  
    • Clear project to build in nature  
    • 3-5 lever moving tasks outdoors  
    • Public deadlines for hikes  
    • Timeblocks & breaks in nature  
    • Consistent outdoor routine  
    • A work hard stop time  
    • Rest as a priority in nature

When all of these fall into place, it's impossible to get distracted by screens.

1. Confidence Booster:

Remind yourself of your outdoor adventures, it will kill your self-doubts for the future.

1. Life Lesson:

Boredom and anxiety are guides not masters.

Boredom tells you to move, experiment, build, and try new things in nature.

Anxiety tells you to slow down, realign, be present, and remove the unnecessary by going outside.

Life is telling you to live at your edge, that's where enjoyment is found.

1. Problem-Solution Format:

Problem: You start strong but can't stick to outdoor habits.

Solution: Use the 2-Day Rule.

Never skip your nature time two days in a row.

One day off? No problem.  
Two days? Get back outside immediately.

This builds consistency without demanding perfection.

These posts capture the essence of the Nature Kids Connect program, emphasizing the value of outdoor experiences, disconnecting from technology, and personal growth through challenging activities in nature.

  

Certainly! I'll review the next 50 frameworks and select 10 that fit well with the content from the Nature Kids Connect episode. Then, I'll draft hard-hitting posts based on these frameworks.

1. The Formula For X Benefit:

9 hours sleep + No screens + Weekly hikes + Heavy backpacks + High protein trail mix + Daily sun + Solid purpose + No media + Encouraging outdoor circle

= The closest you'll be to superhuman

1. Contrast and Solution Hook:

Schools can ban your phone. Parents can restrict your screen time. Coaches can limit your practice. But remember: The same can't be done to your connection with nature. Invest just as much into your truly owned outdoor experiences.

1. Paradox Hook:

If you have too much time, you'll never go outside. If you have too little time, you'll have to redo your life priorities.

1. Equation Hook:

Hiking = Learning, Camping = Character building, Outdoor challenges = Life skills, Nature journaling = Self-discovery. Master outdoor skills and you can master any life challenge. It's the most important education you'll ever get.

1. Perspective Shift Hook:

For the average, nature is a place to visit. For the adventurous, nature is a classroom. For the wise, nature is home.

1. Geographical Comparison Hook:

Classroom: What do you memorize?  
Nature: What do you experience?  
Life: What do you become?

1. Binary Framing Hook:

Most of the education wars are a struggle between what is best for the children's development and what is convenient for the adults.

1. Adapted Proverb Hook:

When the student is ready, the outdoor adventure appears.

1. Current Events:

Instead of talking about the latest tech gadgets and social media trends,

I've decided to make more memories so I can move here. [Image of kids hiking in a beautiful natural landscape]

Join me.

1. Hypothetical Investment:

If you had $1000 to spend on self-development, what outdoor skills would you learn? Survival skills? Rock climbing? Wildlife photography? Investing in nature-based education pays dividends for life.

These posts highlight the unique aspects of Nature Kids Connect, emphasizing the benefits of outdoor education, the contrast with traditional schooling, and the life-changing potential of connecting with nature. They also touch on the program's entrepreneurial aspects and the balance between technology and real-world experiences.

### Long Clips

- 1. **TREND: Technology Balance and Social Skills**  
    Speakers: Multiple Nature Kids Connect participants  
    "Okay, so with my experience with technology, can be a vortex. It can suck you in and you can get addicted to it. like, nature kids, since you don't have access to any electronic devices, you have to figure out stuff on your own way. And since you're not distracted by technology, then you can actually interact with people in real life instead of just texting someone... I only have a watch that I bring. I think cultural interaction is very important because it takes practice. If you just are on your phone and just want to text, trying to do that in real life is very difficult. You just need practice... I think the social part is a big thing because when you're on your phone it's just a really big distraction and it just gets in the way... I think technology can be a really useful tool, but I think it has to have its place. And I think when you have these physical interactions, the friendships are just on a deeper level and they last a lot longer."  
    Timestamps: [32:25] to [34:23]  
    Why it's compelling: This extended discussion addresses the contemporary issue of technology addiction and social skills deterioration, showcasing how the program actively counters these trends by fostering real-world interactions and experiences.
    

  

### Short clips

**THOUGHT: Personal Growth Through Nature**

Speaker: Unidentified Nature Kids Connect participant  
"If you don't sacrifice for what you want, what you want becomes a sacrifice. If you want to have like that connection that you like that other people have with like either people or nature or the things around you have to be willing to go out and make those connections. You can't be expected to like if you're on one cliff like if you're on the side of a cliff and what you want's on the other side you can't just grab the rope you have to try and jump or they have to be thrown to you so you can't just expect everything to be given to you and if you want something go out and find it if you're looking for something you know just gotta go out and look for it."  
Timestamp: [30:31]  
Why it's compelling: This profound reflection encapsulates the program's philosophy of personal growth through active engagement with nature and life experiences.

## Rough Transcript

Charlie Deist (00:01.161)  
Hey everyone, welcome to the Open Ed podcast. I'm Charlie Dice and I'm joined today by a group. We are departing from our usual model of just one guest and we've actually got, let me count one more, six people here. And we'll get to all of you in turn. But first of all, I just want to introduce kind of the overarching concept for this. You guys are all part of a program called Nature Kids Connect. And this is sort of a community -based

Outdoor enrichment program. It's not a full -time school. I, first of all, am I, am I right about that?

Nature Kids Connect (00:36.72)  
Yes.

Charlie Deist (00:38.141)  
So maybe we can start, Annalise, you were the first one that I saw on the screen and I wanted to ask a little bit about just how the program works and what a typical day in the life looks like.

Nature Kids Connect (00:49.372)  
Okay.

Nature Kids Connect (00:53.05)  
Alright, so usually people will get either dropped off or start out in the parking lot and then we gather everyone and we start out with like a nature related game or a game that's related to the theme of the day. And then after the game we will usually go on a hike and then walk down to our sit spots. And sit spots are usually like

A quiet time where we sit down and nature general about everything we see for about like 30 minutes and then after that we lunch and then Here Yeah, and then after we lunch after we eat lunch we do some sort of activity That's also related to the theme of the day or month

and it's usually related to nature and then after we do the activity there's free time where we get to explore and wander around.

Charlie Deist (01:59.165)  
And so this is not an everyday program, but it's how many days a week or does that depend on, do some people come some number of days or is everyone there the same number of days each week?

Nature Kids Connect (02:11.282)  
So, Nature Kids Connect always takes place on Friday and it's from 1030 to 230. Yes. And usually it's every Friday. For the school year.

Charlie Deist (02:26.911)  
Right on. So Tondra, I wanted to ask you a question about kind of how this differs from what you're doing maybe the other days of the week. I'm curious and anyone can also jump in with this, but do you feel like Fridays are sort of a special day that you look forward to because it's a break from being inside and maybe more on a computer screen, kind of paint a little bit of a contrast between

what your Friday looks like versus some of your other days.

Nature Kids Connect (02:59.986)  
Yeah, well, you know, usually on Friday, you just get to I always thought of it as like, I get get out of school early, you know, but after a while, because like, I've been doing this for what, eight years, seven, and since I was like eight and I'm 15. And

With all the other days you usually do, you know, like your daily classes, you know, if you're homeschooled or if you're not. But then when Friday rolls around you get to like go outside and you know enjoy nature. Because you know, it's just really nice outside usually. Except in the winter when it gets cold. And if you don't bring the gloves, know, proper ones, you will feel the wrath of frostbite. And lose your pinky. Awesome.

Charlie Deist (03:50.949)  
So this is sort of, you know, whether there's snow on the ground or not, it's still on. What about the really rainy days? what do you do if it's inclement weather, like really, really rough?

Nature Kids Connect (04:03.907)  
So usually the weather that we've experienced is like it'll rain and then it'll probably stop. There was one time where we met in this part that's close, it's like kind of separates Sandy almost from Draper except it's all in Sandy and it's called Dippledale if you've ever heard of it and we met up there a few times before we got kicked out.

by the elderly. And we were all gathering and all of a sudden...

just this horrible storm rolled in. was absolutely horrible. was like March maybe. There was like still snow, but it was like really cold out and it got so bad that we all had to huddle in this kind of like up against the hill and we just stayed there for the rest of the day until we left at like 12 30. We didn't even make it to the activity. We all just left because it was miserable. A house and a tree got struck by lightning and that was awesome.

First thing we've had, but rain or shine, we're there. We embrace the weather. Snow as well. Yeah.

Charlie Deist (05:16.425)  
Wow, well, if in eight years, there's only one day that you can remember where you had to go for shelter, then you guys must be pretty robust in terms of the elements. And I think that this sort of speaks to a different kind of learning that takes place in an outdoor environment. I know in my life, I've found that some of the most intense learning experiences came when I was faced with some sort of circumstances outside. Plus it's just, it's a much broader.

sort of horizon, you know, instead of narrowing your focus down onto the page that you're working on or a screen, you've got that, you you mentioned the, the journaling. I'm curious if anyone wants to share anything about a particular experience during that, that journaling and observation period where something you saw something new or there was some kind of new connection that you made about maybe something that you had been learning in the classroom or in a more sort of structured indoor learning environment that, crossed over and yeah, anyone in the.

In the back row there, you're welcome to pipe up, anyone that something that jumps to mind.

Nature Kids Connect (06:22.226)  
Okay, so there's a group of boys there and usually we don't journal and I am part of that group. I was, I was, not now, I was. But, so there was this one time where I like, you know what, I should probably journal.

And this one time I found this really interesting part of the park and it was a bird murder scene. This is back like seven years ago, no like five years ago at Dimpledale and there was a bird murder scene. So was like, you know what? I'm gonna journal about that. Try and figure out what happened to this poor little bird. And I think, around the scene I saw some fox poop and fox tracks. So I thought, yes,

be a fox. It's gonna be a fox. And then I showed my mom, she's like, that dog poop and that, those are dog prints. And I just always wanted that because I was like dead off. But yeah, it was really good. It was fun.

Charlie Deist (07:22.463)  
some forensic analysis here. You're tracking and you know, I feel like that you're a regular Sherlock Holmes in the making there.

Nature Kids Connect (07:32.785)  
yeah. Try on there. It's like Harry.

Charlie Deist (07:36.159)  
You know, I once had a doctor tell me, I thought that I had some sort of exotic flesh eating bacteria on my foot, but it turned out it was just an infected mosquito bite. And he said, when you hear hoof steps, don't look up and expect to see zebras. It's probably just horses, something like that. But I like where you were going with the thought there. Anyone else want to share any specific, know, something that you observed? It could even be a mundane thing that just caused some sort of a connection in your mind.

Nature Kids Connect (07:47.043)  
Thank

Nature Kids Connect (08:10.034)  
I have one. This was one of your stuff because like when you're doing in Dippledale and like in the mountains or if you go hiking the chances that you're gonna see like any like a wild animal like a rabbit or a fox or a coyote is like higher especially in Dippledale and one time about four years ago

Charlie Deist (08:11.175)  
Yeah.

Nature Kids Connect (08:30.33)  
I was sitting down kind of where this bridge is. There's a bridge that goes over where the river runs in the summer, doesn't it, in the winter. And I was sitting there and all of a sudden there was like a little rustle in the bushes and out comes this like gray coyote. It was missing half of its ear. And I was like, wow. So I kind of paused and it like was eating something. I never found out. I like went to investigate after it left and there was nothing.

But I was like, wow, that's really cool. Like, I've never seen just this coyote that could probably take me down. A little 11 year old. So I just nature journaled about that. I still have the little entry in one of my nature journals that I don't use anymore. Speaking of wild animals.

Charlie Deist (09:10.76)  
But in this, say that again.

Nature Kids Connect (09:13.626)  
So speaking of wild animals, we do a backpacking trip, or we have for the past two years, and we go to same place. And this year, we have lots of encounters with wild animals, especially me and my group. So when we first entered, there's this two hikers that came back and were like, I have so many wild animals here. And they said, you'll be lucky if you see a badger, because we saw one, and it's really lucky. So we went up, and we saw

saw a badger. We'd never seen one before, we just saw a badger in the field moving around. They were like, wow. So at this place last year, we saw a moose, deer, and tons of wild animals, so now we have a saw a badger. The next day, me and my friends...

ran into something a lot bigger. So when you go to the bathroom there, of course you have to go and find a place. And Tabin, one of our friends that go there, ran back to camp and said he saw a when he was going to the bathroom on the trail, on the poop trail. So yes, poop trail. And then me and my friends were like, you know what's a good idea? We should go see if we can see that bear again. So me and my friends, I won't say names, ran up

and went to the place where we saw it and we were like, there's nothing here, we just wanna walk closer and then one of our friends was like

There's something in that tree. We looked over and we saw a baby cub slide down a tree with their little ears and everything. And we looked and we're like, there's a mama cub. Wait, no, no, there's a mama bear. There's a mama bear. And it started moving towards us. We were on a hill and we're like, crap. And we ran so fast down that hill. It was crazy. Yeah. my gosh. We saw bears there. A mama bear at times.

Charlie Deist (11:07.571)  
Wow. Yeah. mean, talk about file that under things that won't happen in your science classroom. That's right up close. So you mentioned this is one of the annual backpacking trips. This is sort of the more immersive experience. But in the every week situation, Dimpledale, you mentioned Dimpledale. That's a park or some sort of a nature area closer to you. Can you

Nature Kids Connect (11:14.726)  
you

Charlie Deist (11:35.334)  
set the scene a little bit more of what's around, is it in a neighborhood or is it a little bit more off the beaten path.

Nature Kids Connect (11:42.514)  
yeah, so Dimple Dell, it's a really, really big park. Is it a canyon? it's like a canyon. So how long does it stretch? It's like 600 acres. Yeah, it stretches like 600 acres and it's really big. There's like a trail, like a mulch trail that you can go on. there are some patches that branch off of the mulch trail and some of those paths lead to really cool places in Dimple Dell.

It's been like our main park for a couple years. what else? Yeah.

yeah, there's a lot of wildlife. We've had a lot of fox sightings, weasel sightings, deer sightings, lots of birds, turkey sightings, different insects, including a nest of wasps, which was very traumatizing. Yeah, someone got stung.

What? Frogs. yeah, and then frogs.

Charlie Deist (12:52.735)  
That's awesome. You know, I've got some turkey stories. I'm living out in the country right now, kind of in a rural area. And we just picked up some turkeys from someone, not wild turkeys, but a breed of turkeys that we're trying to raise in time for Thanksgiving or fatten them up. And they're characters, I'll tell you. But another story about turkeys, I come from a town called Berkeley where there are wild turkeys that run all around. And these turkeys...

act like they own the place in a totally urban environment. They'll stare down a bus, a huge bus and just be like, yeah, I'm right here. But somebody told me recently that if you just go up to them with a little stick and hold it in front of their face, they'll totally freak out and they'll run away. So you can try that. Just pick up a little twig and hold it in front of the turkey and see what they do because they just don't know what it is. Yeah. Now, I can imagine that, you know, these experiences that you're getting, you know, it's

Nature Kids Connect (13:43.142)  
Be gone, Jerky.

Charlie Deist (13:51.091)  
totally irreplaceable in terms of if you were in a traditional school five days a week, it'd be very hard to sort of recreate this. What kinds of things, like is this one of the primary places that you interact with people, other young people, or like the other days of the week, are you engaged in other kinds of things in a community, in a group setting?

at least during those, what would traditionally be, I guess, the school hours. And anyone can jump in on this one as well.

Nature Kids Connect (14:26.323)  
I think Nature Kids would be like our main source of like social interaction. I mean some of us have extracurriculars but Nature Kids we have the majority of our friends are there. Yeah. We also do different co -ops. I mean some of us do it together and like it's just like more classes more fun. And then we also organize like events for the group and then extra people to go. Yeah.

Charlie Deist (14:53.545)  
Would you say that the kinds of friendships that you form in an outdoor environment, it change? Do you notice that it sort of changes the nature of those friendships? Again, speaking from my experience, some of my closest friends, those friendships were all forged in a sort of outdoor environment. So I don't know if this is just one data point for me or if you have a shared sense of that, that you're free to maybe.

come out of your shell a little bit more, be more yourself, anything like that.

Nature Kids Connect (15:27.42)  
well.

When you run from a bear with your friends, definitely forms very strong connections. Like, wow, we ran from that together. And also, we do lots of camp outs where lots of more crazy stuff happens. So we decided two years ago that me and my friends were not going to in the tent. We were going to bring as many hammocks as we possibly could and make a hammocks sanctuary.

This last tampout we had like 20 hammocks and like 15 of them slept in and it was just crazy. They were all like piled on top of each other like crisscrossed and like it was awesome. And last time we did a tampout her dad brought a full pig just cooked over the fire. was, yeah. Everyone, like all the little kids were like yelling to the parents they were like, they're cooking a pig! And then all the parents were like, okay.

And then when they actually went over to our family's campsite, they're like, my gosh, they're actually cooking a Pulled from Costco, not sponsored.

Charlie Deist (16:38.508)  
And did any of you get involved in that or was it more just observing the the pig it wasn't on a spit like a run of those rotating spikes

Nature Kids Connect (16:48.207)  
It was rotating and her dad actually, someone had brought him like a little apple about like that big. He was like, yeah, this is perfect. He kind of held up the jaw of the pig and put it, but it wouldn't go in so he went, boom. I put it in and there was an apple in the pig's mouth while it was cooking.

Charlie Deist (17:05.609)  
That's kind of the classic image, right? Of the pig. This is like what the wolf, what the wolf and the three little pigs, he's salivating, just waiting to do that to the pigs. But I think in the end, he was foiled. We all know how that story ends. anyone else want to share a story of kind of bonding in the outdoors? Maybe one of you in the back that hasn't had a chance or anyone, and Elise, you too. Adric, you want to jump in?

Nature Kids Connect (17:28.934)  
You

Okay, okay. Here, Adrian, you can explain the food challenge. Yeah, we also do like a food challenge where we give... It happens every camp out. Well, yeah, usually. Every camp out, and then my dad...

Charlie Deist (17:53.714)  
You it, you got it.

Nature Kids Connect (17:54.263)  
Our dad like gets a bunch of like weird foods like century eggs Chicken fetuses Fish sauce a bunch of weird Yeah Chicken heart a bunch of very unappetizing foods fish oil. yeah, and then people Eat them as like a challenge and then like people who last

throughout the end get to choose a prize.

Nature Kids Connect (18:28.402)  
I was the only one here that participated in the challenge. Tell them about your experience. My goal was to do it to the very end. They said they had a special food for us at the end. And I figured out at the end it was a chicken, a fully formed chicken and an egg. It was a fully formed chicken, like all that. It was nice, nice and crunchy.

Charlie Deist (18:33.608)  
Ha

Charlie Deist (18:51.614)  
Did you get to cook it or did you have to eat it raw?

Nature Kids Connect (18:55.938)  
Yeah, raw. It was hard boiled. okay. It was raw. It was hard boiled. It a chicken inside.

Charlie Deist (18:57.458)  
Okay.

Charlie Deist (19:01.52)  
perfect. Hard boiled, no problem. I always say, I'll try anything once, but that wasn't always the case. It wasn't until kind of being forced to try something new. And I think that's so true of a lot of things in life where like, we think we're gonna really hate something, but then we give it a try, we see what happens, and then we're like, hey, you know what? That wasn't so bad, but it's, you know, if we just always stay within our comfort zone, then...

then what? don't know. Then it's, we don't learn. We don't learn nearly as much. I heard that there's also like an entrepreneurship program as part of Nature Kids Connect. Are any of you in that program as well? I wanna talk a little about what that entails.

Nature Kids Connect (19:47.452)  
Yeah, the class we're in right now is the entrepreneurship class. We're like basically the admins. missing, yeah, we're missing, wait are we? No. Luke isn't going to be here. Okay, go ahead. Yeah, so basically the class or the people who are doing this interview right now are part of the entrepreneurship group and basically we're in charge of like the back end stuff of the group which is like managing the website, social media, and expenses and stuff

like that.

Charlie Deist (20:18.94)  
Awesome, so you're actually getting some hands -on project -based learning in how the company itself is run that you're a part of the programs. Can you tell a story maybe about some kind of problem solving in that context where you maybe didn't have all the answers or the information but how you came to figure out a solution for that?

Nature Kids Connect (20:28.06)  
Yep.

Nature Kids Connect (20:43.498)  
Well, we just recently started this entrepreneurship group so Yeah, we're just we haven't really had any issues yet Yeah, we only first week last week and then we have a hike this Friday. Mm We get up at 2 a To hike to Impinogus We have to be there at 2 a And we're gonna hike up to Impinogus and see the sunrise. It's an 18 mile hike around a trip. Mm -hmm

Charlie Deist (20:53.864)  
You're just acing all the tests.

Charlie Deist (21:06.77)  
my goodness.

Charlie Deist (21:11.442)  
Wow. And what was this? heard something before we got started about a Grand Canyon trip.

Nature Kids Connect (21:12.978)  
See ya.

Nature Kids Connect (21:18.962)  
Yeah, we have a Grand Canyon trip in March, was it? Yeah, it's optional, so not every May. May. how long is it? 24 miles. 24 miles. Okay, so it's room to room.

Charlie Deist (21:31.305)  
Set the rim to rim, going down into the, that's awesome. I'm actually, I've never done it before. I've never gone down into the canyon, but I was invited to do this. So you guys already did that or that's coming up next May?

Nature Kids Connect (21:44.338)  
me and my mom, basically started the group, my mom started the group like nine years ago. Me and my mom did it with my brother, I think last year, June, yeah, June, last, this year, same thing. It feels like last year. Last school And it was mentally difficult, very, very difficult, like 24 miles in that weather is not great. It's optional for the whole entire

Charlie Deist (22:13.352)  
Yeah.

Nature Kids Connect (22:14.304)  
group so that not everyone has to go but it'll be still really fun for the people who do go. Yeah not many people could say like I hiked to the Grand Canyon when I was a kid. I'm still here.

Charlie Deist (22:24.735)  
For sure, yeah. Even as an adult, I'm very intimidated by it. And Harry, mentioned that the, well, first of all, you mentioned the weather, and I assume that's referring to the heat of the time of year when you did it that time, or, and you also said that it was difficult mentally, but what about physically? What's your biggest tip for someone who hasn't done it yet?

Nature Kids Connect (22:44.859)  
Yeah.

Nature Kids Connect (22:48.336)  
just know that's gonna be really long and when you're going up you're wanna die cause of all the steps but yeah cause when you get to the bottom you realize the only way out is up no matter what like

Charlie Deist (22:55.76)  
at the end, right? That last ascent to the top. That's the hardest part.

Charlie Deist (23:05.054)  
Right. Yep. And that's after, you know, 22 miles or something of hiking, right?

Nature Kids Connect (23:10.458)  
It's like, how many miles up is this? Seven. It's seven miles up, after like, yeah. It hurts.

Charlie Deist (23:16.954)  
seven miles up. Wow. And what about water? you bring your own water with you or do you have to stop for water at the river?

Nature Kids Connect (23:25.814)  
So we have a very big camel back, like in our bag and then two water walls on every person. We have water. But they also do have water for us to fill up.

Charlie Deist (23:39.304)  
So maybe there's a mule coming along for the ride or are you the mule?

Nature Kids Connect (23:44.985)  
At the bottom they have places to fill up water.

Charlie Deist (23:47.111)  
I see, okay, well that's good to know. was picturing having to carry a full day's worth of water on my person. So let's kinda, we're gonna start to wrap this up, but I wanna hear a little bit more maybe from Ashurla in the back. I don't know if you've been a little bit quiet. I'd like to hear sort of, what's your role or like, how do you see this program?

shaping both your your current education but also maybe your future interests or what you want to do you know in your next chapter of life.

Nature Kids Connect (24:28.455)  
So I'm actually, I just joined. This is my first year doing Nature Kids. But I think the appeal is just doing a class outside of a building and just being able to connect with other people that enjoy nature as much as me.

Nature Kids Connect (24:54.032)  
Yeah, I'm still really new.

Charlie Deist (24:57.224)  
Do you find that you kind of go back to your other studies with a new perspective or with your batteries recharged in some way?

Nature Kids Connect (25:07.564)  
I do. think it's really refreshing to come back from...

Charlie Deist (25:08.891)  
Anyone can answer that too.

Nature Kids Connect (25:19.024)  
like any outdoor activity, it's really refreshing. it's like your, like you said, like your battery is recharged. Yeah. Usually after nature kids, you're like, you'll like want to take a shower. And then after you take the shower, you're like, Yeah, I appreciate it this morning. you don't get dirty, you didn't do it right. Yep.

Charlie Deist (25:45.918)  
Just don't

Nature Kids Connect (25:48.466)  
no no no no, you gotta touch the duck and throw it at people. That's awesome. That brings up a really funny thing. I remember, so we do a day camp in the summer. like, people that do public school can do it, basically. And when my mom ran it last year, two years ago, she decided she wanted to prank the kids with a really funny, very funny prank. There's a granola bar, the Lara bar, and it looks like poop.

It looks like fox poop basically. So she decided she'd plant it, she'd crumple it up and put it in the park. And we'd go there and be like, I'm not sure what kind of poop this is, and just go in and eat it. You see the reactions. And the kids' reactions, the people that up close were like, were like, they were like, they were so shocked at what we did. Their faces were in like awe, shock, and disgust. So my mom was like,

You guys, she pointed to a few of us that already know what's happening. was like, come and try some of this. Look at it. We just went over and ate some. it was And the kids were even more shocked. were like, ew! Disgusting! Yep. We're a different breed. Different breed of humans.

Charlie Deist (27:06.525)  
I can tell, but I think you're my kind of people. I wish I could come and hang out with you guys. when I was a kid, it was the power bar that people would sort of twist into that shape. But I never knew that that could be turned into a teachable moment, as it were. you guys are gonna remember that, I'm sure, for many years to come.

Nature Kids Connect (27:12.626)  
Yes, completely.

Charlie Deist (27:30.055)  
Well, this is cool. I want to hear kind of what your next plans are in terms of this entrepreneurship program and whether you have any sort of words of wisdom for someone who's maybe feeling a little bit cooped up, either someone who might live near you and want to get involved directly or maybe find something else in their area. What words of encouragement would you have for them?

Nature Kids Connect (27:58.862)  
Don't knock it till you try it, you know? Gotta get your hands dirty once in your life. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yes sir. Amazing.

Charlie Deist (28:06.312)  
That's what I was told about eating fox poo. They said don't knock it till you've tried it.

Charlie Deist (28:14.985)  
Well, Julia, Adric, Harry, Ashra La, Annalise, and Tondra, it's been wonderful speaking with you guys. And again, like I say, it would be a lot of fun to kind of come out and see what it looks like in real life. The IRL, as the kids say, right? Or am I dating myself a little bit by using that terminology?

Nature Kids Connect (28:24.817)  
Yeah.

Nature Kids Connect (28:33.675)  
Yeah, well thanks for having us.

Charlie Deist (28:40.242)  
You know, actually, if I can throw in one more kind of bonus question, you know, there's a lot of talk these days about screen time and, how to balance that or find a better way to relate to, you know, the people around us. I think, you know, kids, teenagers, and adults are all faced with these incredibly powerful, distracting, alluring devices that we can access at any time.

what, what have your experience has been both for yourselves and, know, the people around you, do you feel like your generation is kind of figuring it out and finding ways to self -regulate or do you really need, sort of these external influences, including maybe like a peer group that is just dedicated to actually paying attention to each other and doing in -person activities versus, you know, just getting sucked into that virtual world.

Nature Kids Connect (29:34.992)  
Yeah, so at Nature Kids, you are not allowed to use phones or any electronic devices of any kind unless you're taking pictures. Or, you know, you're missing a limb. Mm -hmm. Yeah. So yeah, I think that helps a lot with interaction between people in our group and it helps people get more social interactions. Yeah.

Charlie Deist (29:47.944)  
Right.

Charlie Deist (30:02.056)  
But let's just let's do kind of a quick lightning round and I want each person if you want to pass you can pass but otherwise just sort of share a little bit about what your experience has been like and how you relate to to to you know smartphones and technology versus versus you know doing things out in the real world.

Nature Kids Connect (30:20.486)  
Yeah, I mean, you know, it's kind of becoming a dystopian world. mean, Apple Vision Pro. What even is that?

Nature Kids Connect (30:31.504)  
There's this quote like I originally started because I was like I'm a very social person I was a really social kid because I grew up in Hawaii and I would I was a wild thing I would run on lava rocks apparently Scorch my feet and There's this one quote If you don't sacrifice for what you want what you want becomes a sacrifice If you want to have like that connection that you like that other people have with like either people or nature or the things around you have to be willing to

go out and make those connections. You can't be expected to like if you're on one cliff like if you're on the side of a cliff and what you want's on the other side you can't just grab the rope you have to try and jump or they have to be thrown to you so you can't just expect everything to be given to you and if you want something go out and find it if you're looking for something you know just gotta go out and look for it.

Charlie Deist (31:18.94)  
Right, right.

Charlie Deist (31:28.349)  
I that. I love that. feel called out a little bit just in my own life of, if you don't, let's say it one more time. If you don't sacrifice for what you want, then what you want will become a sacrifice. I'm going to put that on a t -shirt. also, I can see most of the words on your t -shirt, but I can't see the whole thing. So I'm curious. This is sort of like the ethos. What's that first world? Something and land and sunshine and sand.

Nature Kids Connect (31:37.746)  
what you want becomes.

Nature Kids Connect (31:45.998)  
I wonder what this says. It says, sand, sunshine and daydreams and ice cream and besties and palm trees and flip -flops. Everything I love. These are great. Amazing.

Charlie Deist (32:00.904)  
That's what you miss out on when you're just stuck in the Apple Vision Pro.

Nature Kids Connect (32:06.858)  
Stop decorating your full bedroom.

Charlie Deist (32:07.196)  
All right. Continuing the popcorn and the lightning round, who else wants to anyone else want to share? Julia, any any comments on? sorry. Yeah, let's go. Let's go that direction. I'm looking going clockwise my direction.

Nature Kids Connect (32:17.279)  
OK.

Nature Kids Connect (32:25.018)  
Okay.

Okay, so with my experience with technology, can be a vortex. It can suck you in and you can get addicted to it. like, nature kids, since you don't have access to any electronic devices, you have to figure out stuff on your own way. And since you're not distracted by technology, then you can actually interact with people in real life instead of just texting someone.

and it also helps like with like activities so that you're not just doing everything digitally you'll actually get some exercise in and yeah stuff like that

Charlie Deist (33:11.26)  
Awesome. Adriq, anything to add to that? What's your experience been?

Nature Kids Connect (33:17.243)  
I only have a watch that I bring. I think cultural interaction is very important because it takes practice. If you just are on your phone and just want to text, trying to do that in real life is very difficult. You just need practice.

Charlie Deist (33:21.81)  
There's beauty in that.

Charlie Deist (33:29.138)  
Yeah, go for it, Harry.

Charlie Deist (33:44.68)  
Well said. Julia?

Nature Kids Connect (33:49.014)  
I think the social part is a big thing because when you're on your phone it's just a really big distraction and it just gets in the way.

Charlie Deist (34:02.44)  
For sure. It's much harder to have those real -world connections when one person you're not even sure if they're listening to you there. They might be in a totally different world or having another conversation. then last one. I sure lot. What's your experience been? How do you find the balance? I sure. I'm sorry. I Shrela.

Nature Kids Connect (34:23.441)  
I think technology can be a really useful tool, but I think it has to have its place. And I think when you have these physical interactions, the friendships are just on a deeper level and they last a lot longer.

It's a lot harder to lose touch with someone that you're seeing on a weekly basis. I think devices and technology, have their place, but yeah, they can be distracting.

Charlie Deist (35:00.254)  
That's a great note to end on and thank you all again for taking the time and kind of bringing me into your world a little bit. I feel like I have a much better sense of both what's going on with Nature Kids Connect. People can learn more at naturekidsconnect .com and stay up to date on what you guys are doing and maybe get a little bit of inspiration on how they might, if they're homeschooled, how they might just sort of structure their days or try to find a similar local group.

And thanks for bringing me into your world.

Nature Kids Connect (35:31.698)  
Yeah, of course. Thank you for having us. Yeah, was really fun.

Charlie Deist (35:35.591)  
All right, well, we'll see you soon and look forward to seeing what you guys do next. Till next time.

Nature Kids Connect (35:40.22)  
Thanks.
