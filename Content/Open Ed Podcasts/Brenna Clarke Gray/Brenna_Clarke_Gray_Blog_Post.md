# How Grading Your Child's Passion Actually Destroys It

**Ela Richmond**
*OpenEd Daily*

When your child becomes obsessed with something—mythology, coding, ancient Egypt, whatever it is—your instinct as a parent is immediate: *Let me support this.* Make it part of their curriculum. Turn it into a learning opportunity. Structure it. Grade it.

Brenna Clarke Gray has watched this happen dozens of times. She's a critical educational technologist and former college instructor who spent nine years teaching Canadian literature before transitioning to faculty support and research at Thompson Rivers University. She hosts the *Community of Praxis* podcast, where she explores big ideas about how systems shape learning. But her most important qualifications for this conversation might be simpler: she's a parent who's noticed something troubling in how we approach our children's natural interests.

And her observation is blunt: turning passion into curriculum is how you kill what made the learning beautiful in the first place.

"Nothing kills intrinsic motivation like assigning grades to it," she told me in our recent conversation. "Everybody who's good at a craft, then opens an Etsy store and hates that craft. As soon as you impose external standards on something you loved for its own sake, that kills motivation for a lot of us."

She knows this from lived experience. Her eight-year-old developed an encyclopedic knowledge of mythology during the pandemic. We're talking stacks of mythology books. Mythology podcasts. Facts about ancient Egypt and the Greek pantheon that would put a classics scholar to shame. This wasn't forced. It was the kind of interest kids develop when they have unstructured time and freedom to follow their curiosity.

Then Brenna had a thought that seemed harmless enough: *Maybe we can make this into a school project.*

"He stopped," she said simply. "My kid doesn't want to do school projects about mythology just because he loves it."

## Why Homeschooling Parents Should Rethink How They Grade Child-Led Learning

The difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation might be the most important distinction in education that most parents never think about.

Intrinsic motivation is when you learn something because you want to. You're not chasing a grade. There's no external reward. You're drawn by curiosity, by the simple pleasure of understanding something you're interested in. Brenna uses a perfect example from her own life: she's an obsessive Formula One fan. Nobody tests her on it. Nobody gives her a grade. But she has "a vast back catalog of details" about F1 because it makes the racing experience richer, more fun. That's intrinsic motivation.

Extrinsic motivation is everything else—the grade, the praise, the external standard imposed from outside. And here's what the research shows, and what Brenna has witnessed: the moment you add extrinsic motivation to something someone loves for its own sake, you don't amplify the motivation. You replace it.

The child who loved mythology because it was their choice, pursued on their terms, suddenly experiences that same interest very differently when it becomes *homework*. When there's a rubric. When their parent or teacher is evaluating whether they did it "correctly." The locus of control shifts from internal (I want to know this) to external (I have to do this to get this grade).

Brenna describes it as a kind of bargain with the brain: *What made this fun was that it was yours. Now it's ours. Now you're doing it for us.*

And the brain, quite reasonably, checks out.

## How External Standards Kill Child-Led Interests in Homeschool

Brenna uses a metaphor that lands hard: "Everybody who's good at a craft, then opens an Etsy store and hates that craft."

This is real. There's actually research on it. The moment something you loved becomes something you have to sell—when it transforms from hobby to hustle—something essential dies. The joy of creation becomes contaminated by the need to produce. To optimize. To make money.

The same mechanism is at work when you turn a child's passion into curriculum.

Your kid was reading mythology because *they wanted to know*. Because there's something alive in that kind of self-directed learning, something that can't be manufactured by the best curriculum money can buy.

The moment it becomes a school project, even a *supported* school project, even a school project about something they love, the mechanism shifts. They're no longer learning for themselves. They're learning for you. For the grade. For the external validation.

And they know the difference, even if they can't articulate it.

## When Good Parenting Backfires: The Unintended Consequences of Structuring Child Passions

Here's what makes Brenna's observation particularly poignant: she recognizes her own role in this dynamic with her son. She didn't do anything wrong. She was being a good parent, trying to support his interests, trying to create learning opportunities.

And in doing so, she inadvertently demonstrated one of the central paradoxes of education: *the more explicitly you try to make something a learning opportunity, the less like learning it becomes.*

"Hard for education systems though," she said. "Do a project on this thing you love, now you hate it and I killed it."

Note that phrasing: *I killed it.* Not the system. Her. She recognizes that her good intentions, her desire to scaffold and structure and support, functioned as a kind of poison to the very thing she was trying to nurture.

This is what makes her insights so valuable. She's not preaching from theory. She's reflecting on her own choices as a parent and saying: *This is how easily it happens. This is how good intentions can backfire.*

## How Unstructured Time and Boredom Actually Build Lifelong Learners

If turning your child's passion into curriculum kills their motivation, what's the alternative?

The surprising answer is: nothing. Or rather, less.

Brenna's breakthrough with her own children came during the pandemic, when structure collapsed and boredom became inevitable. "Boredom is incredibly important to learning," she says. "My eight-year-old loves mythology from anywhere in the world...that came from boredom, particularly during pandemic closure. He was three or four, just starting to read. He had time to figure stuff out."

The mythology obsession didn't emerge from a carefully designed unit study. It emerged from a child with free time, access to books, and nothing else to do.

This doesn't mean you shouldn't support your child's interests. It means the support needs to look different.

Instead of making it part of the curriculum, you might:

**Protect the space for it.** Keep the thing they love separate from school, grading, and external evaluation. Let it remain theirs.

**Provide access, not direction.** Stock the house with books on topics they're interested in. Listen to podcasts together. Take field trips. But let them lead the exploration.

**Notice what they're actually drawn to.** Brenna listens to podcasts with her kids constantly. When her son gravitates toward the mythology ones, she doesn't turn it into a lesson plan. She just observes: *okay, that's where his mind is going.*

**Trust that interest is enough.** You don't need to systematize every passion. Sometimes the best thing you can do is get out of the way and let curiosity do its work.

"We plant seeds," Brenna said, "and hope that we're not crushing them with education's other structures."

The irony is profound: in trying to formalize and structure a child's interest, we crush the very thing that made the interest worth supporting in the first place—the child's own internal drive to understand something that fascinates them.

## Stop Forcing the Homeschool Timeline: Why Learning Doesn't Follow Your Schedule

One more piece of Brenna's wisdom that's worth sitting with: "Motivation and learning don't follow a school-year rhythm."

A connection a child makes at age 8 might not blossom into something they pursue until they're 14. Or 25. Or 40. You can't see the arc because you're inside it.

This means that your job isn't to optimize every learning moment. It's not to turn every interest into a curriculum unit. It's to create the conditions where curiosity can flourish—and then step back.

A house full of books. Unstructured time. Parents who are genuinely curious about what makes their kids come alive. Permission to follow rabbit holes without needing to document the learning or assign a grade.

These aren't flashy interventions. They don't look like educational best practices. They look like... a normal childhood. The kind Brenna had, growing up in a CBC household with books everywhere and parents who modeled curiosity.

The difference is that in our current moment, a normal childhood has to be intentional. You have to actively protect unstructured time. You have to resist the urge to turn every interest into a learning objective.

And you have to be willing to watch your child learn something you care nothing about—encyclopedic Pokemon knowledge, the entire history of Minecraft redstone contraptions, whatever it is—and let that be enough.

Because that's how you know the learning is real. That's how you know the motivation is theirs.
