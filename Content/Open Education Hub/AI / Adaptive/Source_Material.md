## OpenEd Podcast Guest Quotes

### On AI as Tool, Not Replacement

**Teresa King (OpenEd Foundation CEO):**
"I hope that it is intelligent AI that can draw out and expand on skills that students have. From almost a tutoring perspective of not giving them the answers, right? But helping them get to answers - doing intelligent work with them."

**Aaron Osmond (Knowledge Pillars CEO):**
"AI is nothing more than a technology tool. It does make things happen faster, more effective, more efficiently, but it doesn't problem solve everything for you. If you don't learn problem solving and critical thinking skills, you will not be successful in any career."

**Connor Boyack (Tuttle Twins creator):**
"Children don't need to be repositories of information... they must be actors who assemble and compile resources on their own."

### On Screen Time Quality

**Amir Nathoo (Outschool CEO):**
"Not all screen time is created equal. Just watching stuff on YouTube is completely different to building a virtual world or learning a tool or building a virtual world with others."

Children coming away from collaborative online classes are "brimming with creativity and excitement," unlike the "detox time" needed after passive consumption.

**Anjan Katta (Daylight Computer founder):**
"It's unrealistic and probably not in the best interest of your child's development to be a Luddite - to completely get away with technology."

"The promise here is not 'my kid's gonna be a million times smarter.' It's that instead of four hours with more tantrums and more difficulty, it gets done in an hour or 45 minutes, they're engaged, and now there's more time."

Standard screens cause "screen apnea" - shallow breathing and a stressed nervous system due to blue light and flicker.

**Joey Mascio (Teen coach):**
"If you play Fortnite for four hours... when you turn it off and look around in your real life, there's been no change... your real life is not improving."

### On Human Connection

**Ray Ravaglia (Stanford Online High School founder):**
"Even gifted students in asynchronous, self-paced courses had attrition rates north of 30%. With synchronous, community-based classes, it fell dramatically."

"The problem isn't access to information. It's not even personalization or pace. It's connection. It's mentorship. It's the irreplaceable experience of one human being caring whether another human being learns."

**Ben Somers (Synthesis/Recess founder):**
"School treats all knowledge like it goes in a line. In reality, knowledge is not ordered in a straight line. It's ordered in a big complex graph of ideas that are connected to each other in different ways."

"The number one predictor of retention was if the kid had a friend in their class. We spent, at one point, $10 million a year on games... and the games had less of an impact on retention than Friend in a Class, which is close to free."

**Dr. Claire Honeycutt (Neuroscientist):**
AI only provides an "illusion of thought" and cannot replace the uniquely human requirements of "reasoning, thinking, [and] creating."

### On Practical AI Use

**Meg Thomas (Homeschool coach):**
"With ChatGPT, you can grab your phone, take a picture of a math problem and say, 'explain this answer to me like I'm a third grader.'"

"Screen time actually makes them have a shorter attention span... it can create anxiety and it lowers social skills."

**Brettani Shannon (OpenEd mom):**
Uses Perplexity AI to design custom unit studies, such as a four-day plan for a child who loves animals: "AI gave me a roadmap" for book lists and hands-on activities.

**Mackenzie Price (Alpha Schools):**
Advocates for a model that uses AI tutors to personalize learning so that core academics can be compressed into just two hours, freeing up the rest of the day for passions.

### On Adaptive Learning

**Shalinee Sharma (Zearn):**
"If a student gets stuck, the lessons adapt... helping them visualize it."

**Matt Bowman (OpenEd founder):**
When a child finds the right digital tool, their mindset shifts: "It's not you, it's the curriculum."
