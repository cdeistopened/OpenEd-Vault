# What is Open Education (1)

Open education is **a personalized approach to education where families design learning around the child** — combining resources from schools, online classes, mentors, and real-world experiences.

# What is Open Education?

**Education That Adapts to Your Child—Not the Other Way Around.**

## Personaliz(ed) Learning
for Every Child

Open education starts with a simple observation: **no two children learn in exactly the same way, at the same pace, or for the same reasons.** Every learner brings a unique blend of strengths, curiosities, and ways of understanding the world.

## The Future of Education Is Open

No child is standard. Their education shouldn’t be either.

**‍**

**For a century, school was built for efficiency, not individuality.**

Open Education is a personalized approach to learning where families take back ownership, and design a learning path that fits the child’s strengths, interests, and pace.

Today, families are rewriting the rules. Combining co-ops, curricula, classes (in-person and online), tutors, and real-world experiences to build something better.

## **Here's What It Looks Like:**

A child pursuing an open education might play volleyball at the local public school, take online math through Khan Academy, join a weekly homeschool co-op for science labs, work with a private tutor for SAT prep, and take an Outschool class on coding Minecraft mods.

Parents are discovering they can combine Charlotte Mason nature studies with Montessori math materials, enroll in a microschool three days a week, and use AI tutors for personalized practice.

**These aren't edge cases anymore—they're becoming the norm.** Traditional brick-and-mortar schools are increasingly viewed as just one component in a child's education rather than a one-stop shop. Families are **unbundling** these services and rebuilding them in ways that work for their children.

Why Open Education Matters

## **We’ve Personalized Everything—Except Education**

For over a hundred years, education followed one model: bell schedules, age groups, and standardized tests.

But the world has changed.

We work remotely, learn on demand, build careers from laptops and kitchen tables. **We’ve personalized nearly every aspect of our lives except the education system,** which never caught up.

## **It's Already Happening**

The walls defining "education" are dissolving. Families everywhere are unbundling the traditional model and designing custom combinations.

It’s not public *or* private. Not homeschool *or* online. Not one way *or* the other.

‍**Open education** means:
✅ Take what works from anywhere.
✅ Leave what doesn’t.
✅ Build a learning plan that fits your child.

**It’s education designed around the learner, not the system.**

Here is what an Open Education might look like for a student:
🏐 Play sports at a local public school
🧮 Take math online through Khan Academy
🧪 Join a weekly science co-op
🧑🏫 Learn history with a private tutor
💻 Take an Outschool class on coding Minecraft mods

# Classical Education: Understanding the Model and Approach [ARTICLE] (1)

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e31168e49f5b7e6f76f0e5/68a66dcf79edc4eff2491365_Blog%20Thumbnail%20%231%20(1).webp)

# Classical Education: Understanding the Model and Approach | OpenEd

Classical education is making a comeback.

The [number of classical schools has doubled in the past decade, with hundreds opening since the pandemic alone](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/classical-education-is-taking-off-whats-the-appeal/).

Homeschoolers have been at the forefront of this revival, following hybrid approaches that combine online courses (like [Great Hearts Online](https://greatheartsonline.org/)), local co-ops (like [Classical Conversations](https://classicalconversations.com/)), and traditional curricula. This mixing and matching—of old and new, in-person and online—exemplifies what we call 'open education.'

But pinning down exactly what "classical education" means has proven difficult. This may be more of a feature than a bug—the variety of options means families can choose approaches that align with their specific goals. Yet to understand the possibilities, we need to first pin down what modern families are trying to recover.

## **What is Classical Education?**

The debate begins with the term itself. Ancient Greeks didn't call it "classical education"—they just called it education. (Like how Italians don't call pasta carbonara 'Italian food.')

In fact, the phrase was rarely used until 1994, when Douglas Wilson founded what became [the Association of Classical Christian Schools](https://classicalchristian.org/).

Aloysius Aeschliman, a scholar of early modern education and Latin teacher at the Geneva School in Orange County, points out that “there's no clear historical precedent which people can base [the term classical education] on.”

Instead, he identifies three distinct periods that are often conflated by modern classical education advocates:

**Antiquity:** Philosophers like Cicero pioneered the *artes liberales*, the "liberating arts" that would free the mind for independent thought and effective citizenship (though this was available to only a small class of privileged males).

**Medieval Cathedral Schools:** After Rome's fall, education was still limited to a tiny percentage of literate people. Most learning happened in monasteries or around cathedrals for those training for religious life.

Attempting to recreate ancient or medieval approaches today would be more like historical reenactment than actual education, Aeschliman notes. These societies were so different that even if it were technically possible, you wouldn't necessarily want to replicate them.

The third period, **Renaissance Humanistic Schools**, lasted from the late 1400s through the 1800s with remarkable consistency—building on the previous two. This was the first systematic educational model that modern families could realistically emulate.

### The Modern Revival

In 1947, British author and scholar Dorothy Sayers proposed a renewed vision of classical education in a lecture called ["The Lost Tools of Learning."](https://www.pccs.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/LostToolsOfLearning-DorothySayers.pdf)

In it, she coined memorable new terms for the developmental stages of the medieval “trivium”:

- **"Poll-parrot"** stage (grammar): young children who love to memorize
- **"Pert"** stage (logic): middle schoolers who love to argue
- **"Poetic"** stage (rhetoric): teenagers who are ready to express themselves

This lecture, later adapted into an essay, sparked three dominant strands of the modern classical education movement:

1. Susan Wise Bauer's [*The Well-Trained Mind*](https://www.amazon.com/Well-Trained-Mind-Classical-Education-Fourth/dp/0393253627) for homeschoolers
2. Mortimer Adler's Great Books movement
3. Wilson's classical Christian schools

Each drew inspiration from earlier traditions.

What unifies the modern classical education movement is its fundamental respect for the Western tradition. It takes the wisdom of the ancients seriously and encourages a more integrated curriculum centered on learning to think critically. This contrasts with much of modern education, which often neglects classical Western texts and divides knowledge into distinct subjects, administered in 50-minute increments.

## **Classical Education Model vs. Modern Education**

The longest-lasting historical model flourished in Europe for several hundred years—from Renaissance humanistic schools through 18th-century academies. Its advocates, including Erasmus, called it "humanistic education." 

Douglas Wilson found compelling historical precedent for this model's superiority in early 19th century Germany. Germany had introduced science-focused "real schools" ([*Realschule*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_school)) alongside its more traditional humanistic schools. Students from humanistic schools (emphasizing Latin, Greek, and literature) consistently outperformed the “real school” students at Universities—even in the sciences they'd never formally studied.

This pattern shows up today in classical schools like [Great Hearts](https://www.greatheartsamerica.org/) and its flexible virtual program, [Great Hearts Online](https://greatheartsonline.org/), which emphasize foundational critical thinking over standardized curricula.

As Dr. Roger La Marca, Director of Great Hearts Online, explains: "Paradoxically, it's not by prepping kids for the test that they achieve the best scores; it's by teaching them to learn so they pursue knowledge on their own. A very high percentage of our graduates end up in science, technology, engineering, and medical fields because we teach them logic, rhetoric, reading, and grammar."

## **Classical Education and Homeschooling**

The historical humanistic model worked on three key principles: personal tutoring (not classroom management), deep study of the same great texts over years, and true integration where Latin was the medium of instruction. 

Today, only one school successfully maintains an immersive classical-language approach: the [Vivarium Novum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accademia_Vivarium_Novum) in Italy, where students speak only Latin and Greek. "Everybody who graduates speaks fluent Latin and reads classics fluently," Aeschliman observes.

But whether or not you're ready to go full-on Ancient-Latin-Language-Immersion, homeschooling naturally recreates much of what made the humanistic model so powerful. Instead of managing thirty students, parents give individualized attention and adapt to each child's pace. Families can weave subjects together naturally—reading Plutarch covers history, literature, character formation, and writing all at once. They can integrate character development into daily rhythm. And rather than racing through state standards, families can spend months with rich texts that capture their child's imagination.

With this understanding, the practical question becomes: what resources can help families implement classical education effectively?

## **Classical Education Curriculum and Resources**

***"But I Don't Have a Classical Education Myself"***

This is a common worry that applies to homeschooling beyond just the topic of classical education. How can you teach Calculus if you never learned it? How can you discuss Aristotle if you haven't read him?

The good news is you don't need to be a scholar to implement classical education (or any other subject). You need to be willing to learn alongside your child and know how to find the right resources.

Families have access to resources that make classical education more achievable than ever before.

[Great Hearts Online](https://greatheartsonline.org/) provides expert classical instruction while maintaining homeschooling flexibility. Families can take individual courses through their [Flex Program](https://greatheartsonline.org/flex-program/) or complete programs. The Flex Program allows part-time enrollment for specific subjects like Latin, logic, or literature. This kind of educational customization was impossible just a decade ago.

Great Books programs serve families seeking deep engagement with Western tradition. Originally conceived as somewhat remedial—helping students who lacked basic cultural references—these programs remain valuable for building foundational knowledge.

Classical Co-ops—chief among them, [Classical Conversations](https://classicalconversations.com/)—offer weekly community meetings where trained tutors guide students through memory work and discussions. This hybrid approach combines homeschool flexibility with classroom interaction.

Many families start small: begin with great books and family read-alouds, add Latin when children show interest, incorporate memory work gradually, or use classical approaches in some subjects while maintaining others elsewhere.

And for families committed to recreating the "gold standard" of deep study of classical texts (in the original languages), the core curriculum starts with Latin. Aeschliman recommends the [University of Dallas "Latin Through Stories" series for K-5 students](https://k12classical.udallas.edu/k-5-latin-curriculum/), and [*Lingua Latina*](https://hackettpublishing.com/lingua-latina-per-se-illustrata-series) as the best option for advanced middle or high school students who want authentic Latin immersion.

Beyond this foundational Latin study (which enables all further engagement with original classical texts like Virgil's *Aeneid*), families have dozens of other options.

## **The Open Education Advantage**

Whether you choose a complete classical program, blend classical elements with other approaches, or simply begin reading great books as a family, you're participating in humanity's longest educational tradition.

As Dr. La Marca puts it: "If you're looking for an approach that will challenge your child to grow into their best self, prepare them for success in any field they choose, and equip them with the timeless skills and virtues they need to thrive in an ever-changing world, look no further than classical education."

For those ready to go deeper, the tools and methods that sustained European humanistic education for centuries remain available, not as historical curiosities but as living educational principles waiting to be rediscovered.

The "lost tools of learning" aren't lost for good—they're just waiting to be found again.

# A Guide to Classical Education with OpenEd

In 1947, British scholar Dorothy Sayers delivered a lecture titled "The Lost Tools of Learning," reigniting an educational tradition that had produced many of history’s greatest thinkers. She identified a powerful pattern: for over two thousand years, Western civilization transmitted wisdom by teaching students to master language before logic, and logic before rhetoric. It was an integrated approach that worked.

Today, that tradition is experiencing a remarkable revival. The number of classical schools has doubled in the past decade, and homeschoolers are at the forefront, creating hybrid approaches that combine online courses, local co-ops, and traditional curricula. This mixing and matching—of old and new, in-person and online—is the heart of open education. It’s a recognition that you don't need to enroll in a specific school or commit to a rigid program to access timeless wisdom.

## What is Classical Education?

Classical education spans millennia but maintains consistent principles. It begins with the ancient Greek *artes liberales*—the "liberating arts" that free the mind for independent thought—and follows a developmental progression, often called the trivium:

- **Grammar Stage (Elementary):** Young children who love to memorize and chant absorb facts and build foundational knowledge.
- **Logic Stage (Middle School):** Students who love to argue and question learn to analyze arguments and think systematically.
- **Rhetoric Stage (High School):** Teenagers ready for self-expression synthesize knowledge and communicate persuasively.

It is a commitment to engaging directly with the Western tradition, reading original sources, integrating subjects around history, and prioritizing wisdom and virtue. This approach aligns perfectly with open education, which trusts that education should adapt to the child, not the other way around.

## Benefits and Evidence of a Classical Approach

Research reveals striking outcomes for students in a classical environment. Studies consistently show classical students scoring in the 80th percentile or higher on standardized tests, but the deeper transformation goes beyond test scores.

Dr. Roger La Marca of [Great Hearts Online](https://greatheartsonline.org/) explains: "Paradoxically, it's not by prepping kids for the test that they achieve the best scores; it's by teaching them to learn so they pursue knowledge on their own. A very high percentage of our graduates end up in science, technology, engineering, and medical fields because we teach them logic, rhetoric, reading, and grammar."

Historical evidence supports this. In 19th-century Germany, students from humanistic schools (emphasizing Latin, Greek, and literature) consistently outperformed students from science-focused "real schools" (*Realschule*) at universities—even in the sciences they'd never formally studied. The classical training in *how to think* transferred across all disciplines.

Classical education develops:

- **Mental discipline** through memorization and language study.
- **Critical thinking** through formal logic and Socratic discussion.
- **Cultural literacy** through engagement with foundational texts.
- **Expression skills** through rhetoric and composition.
- **Character formation** through exposure to virtue in literature.

It produces not just smart students but wise ones—capable of discerning truth, articulating positions, and contributing meaningfully to society.

## Elementary Years: Building Foundations (The Grammar Stage)

The grammar stage (roughly ages 5-12) capitalizes on children's natural ability to absorb information. This is the "poll-parrot" stage, where young minds delight in patterns, songs, and stories. Classical education harnesses this through memory work, often using resources from [Classical Conversations](https://classicalconversations.com/) or [Memoria Press](https://www.memoriapress.com/) to build a rich mental "furniture" of facts, dates, and vocabulary.

This stage is perfect for blending approaches, a core principle of Open Education. A typical day might include:

- **Morning memory work** from a classical curriculum.
- A gentle introduction to Latin through a fun, song-based program like [**Song School Latin**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://classicalacademicpress.com/collections/school-latin).
- Learning history as an epic narrative with [***Story of the World***](https://www.amazon.com/Story-World-Vol-Publisher-Peace/dp/B004VG5RPC).
- Building a deep conceptual understanding of math using the hands-on, visual methods of [**Singapore Math**](https://www.singaporemath.com/).
- Ending the day with nature study and classic literature, inspired by the Charlotte Mason method.

## Middle School: Learning to Think (The Logic Stage)

The logic stage (roughly ages 12-14) marks a shift from absorbing facts to analyzing relationships. As students naturally become more argumentative (the "pert" stage), classical education channels this into formal reasoning. Formal logic becomes a central subject, where students learn to identify fallacies and construct valid arguments using curricula like [***The Art of Argument***](https://classicalacademicpress.com/products/the-art-of-argument-revised-student-edition).

With the flexibility of Open Education, you can create a powerful, integrated curriculum. For instance, you could:

- Pair a formal logic course with a subscription to [**Generation Genius**](https://www.generationgenius.com/) or [**Mystery Science**](https://mysteryscience.com/), challenging your child to apply principles of valid reasoning to the scientific method.
- Deepen Latin studies with an immersive reading program like [***Lingua Latina per se Illustrata***](https://www.hackettpublishing.com/lingua-latina-per-se-illustrata-series) while also exploring modern coding languages, seeing how both require systematic thinking.
- Integrate subject matter by studying the Middle Ages through its literature, architecture, and scholastic philosophy.

## High School: Finding Your Voice (The Rhetoric Stage)

The rhetoric stage (roughly ages 15-18) synthesizes everything learned into original, persuasive, and beautiful expression (the "poetic" stage). Students move from analyzing others' arguments to constructing their own. Original sources replace textbooks entirely. Students read Plato's dialogues, not summaries of Plato.

Open Education allows high schoolers to become the true architects of their learning. A student's week might involve:

- Participating in a Socratic Great Books seminar through [**Great Hearts Online**](https://greatheartsonline.org/).
- Honing persuasive essays using a modern composition curriculum like the [**Institute for Excellence in Writing (IEW)**](https://iew.com/).
- Taking dual enrollment courses at a local community college for advanced STEM subjects.
- Pursuing a real-world apprenticeship that applies their well-honed critical thinking skills to a modern field.

# Classical Education: Understanding the Model and Approach

In 1947, British scholar Dorothy Sayers delivered a lecture that would reignite an educational tradition dormant for decades. In "The Lost Tools of Learning," she argued that modern education had abandoned the very methods that produced history's greatest thinkers—from Aristotle to Aquinas, Newton to Jefferson.

She wasn't calling for nostalgia. She was identifying a pattern: for over two thousand years, Western civilization transmitted wisdom through a specific approach to learning. Students mastered language before logic, logic before rhetoric. They read original sources rather than textbooks. They integrated subjects rather than fragmenting them. And it worked.

Today, classical education is experiencing a remarkable revival. The number of classical schools has doubled in the past decade. Through open education, families are creating their own classical paths—hiring Latin tutors online, joining homeschool co-ops for Socratic seminars, taking [Great Hearts Online](https://greatheartsonline.org/) courses, or simply beginning with great books and family discussions.

## What is Classical Education?

Classical education spans millennia but maintains consistent principles. Ancient Greeks pioneered the *artes liberales*—the liberating arts that free the mind for independent thought. Medieval schools organized these into the trivium (grammar, logic, rhetoric) and quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy). Renaissance humanists integrated classical languages as the medium of all learning.

The modern revival, sparked by Sayers and developed by educators like Susan Wise Bauer, typically follows this progression:

- **Grammar Stage (Elementary):** Children absorb facts and build foundational knowledge through memorization and repetition
- **Logic Stage (Middle School):** Students learn to analyze arguments, identify fallacies, and think systematically
- **Rhetoric Stage (High School):** Young adults synthesize knowledge and express themselves persuasively

But classical education is more than stages. It's a commitment to engaging directly with the Western tradition—reading Homer rather than summaries of Homer, studying Latin to access original texts, tracing ideas from their ancient origins through their modern expressions.

This naturally aligns with open education principles. Just as open education insists that children are unique individuals who learn differently, classical education has always adapted to the student. Renaissance tutors didn't force all students through identical curricula—they observed each pupil's aptitudes and adjusted accordingly.

## Classical Education Model

The classical model structures learning around developmental readiness. Dorothy Sayers coined memorable terms for these stages:

- **"Poll-parrot" stage:** Young children who love to memorize and chant
- **"Pert" stage:** Middle schoolers who love to argue and question
- **"Poetic" stage:** Teenagers ready to express themselves creatively

Each stage builds on the previous, creating a spiral of deepening understanding. A child might memorize Latin vocabulary in elementary school, analyze Latin grammar in middle school, and translate Virgil in high school.

The model emphasizes:

- **Integration:** All subjects connect through history as the organizing principle
- **Primary sources:** Original texts over textbooks whenever possible
- **Socratic discussion:** Questions that lead students to discover truth
- **Virtue formation:** Character development through exposure to noble examples

## Classical Education vs Modern Education

The contrast between classical and modern approaches reveals fundamental differences in educational philosophy.

**Modern education** typically:

- Fragments knowledge into disconnected subjects
- Prioritizes current relevance over timeless wisdom
- Measures success through standardized testing
- Values practical skills over intellectual development
- Changes methods frequently based on trends

**Classical education** instead:

- Integrates all learning around core ideas
- Studies the permanent things that shape civilization
- Measures success through demonstrated mastery
- Develops the whole person—mind, body, and character
- Maintains proven methods refined over centuries

Historical evidence supports classical education's effectiveness. In 19th-century Germany, students from humanistic schools (emphasizing Latin, Greek, and literature) consistently outperformed "real school" (*Realschule*) students at universities—even in sciences they'd never formally studied. The classical training in how to think transferred across disciplines.

## Classical Education and Homeschooling

Classical education naturally suits homeschooling. The historical model relied on personal tutoring, adapted pacing, and deep engagement with texts—exactly what homeschool families can provide.

Popular homeschool approaches include:

[**The Well-Trained Mind**](https://welltrainedmind.com/) method by Susan Wise Bauer provides comprehensive guidance for implementing classical education at home, with detailed book lists and teaching strategies for each stage.

[**Classical Conversations**](https://www.classicalconversationsbooks.com/) offers community-based programs where families meet weekly for memory work, discussions, and presentations while completing assignments at home.

**Charlotte Mason** classical fusion combines classical content with Mason's emphasis on living books, nature study, and short lessons—proving that classical principles can blend with other approaches.

The flexibility of homeschooling allows families to:

- Adjust pacing to each child's readiness
- Spend months on topics that capture interest
- Include or exclude religious content as desired
- Mix classical elements with modern resources
- Start classical education at any age

## Classical Education Curriculum

# Classical Education with OpenEd

In 1947, British scholar Dorothy Sayers delivered a lecture that would reignite an educational tradition dormant for decades. In "The Lost Tools of Learning," she argued that modern education had abandoned the very methods that produced history's greatest thinkers—from Aristotle to Aquinas, Newton to Jefferson.

Students mastered language before logic, logic before rhetoric. They read original sources rather than textbooks. They integrated subjects rather than fragmenting them. And it worked.

Today, classical education is experiencing a remarkable revival. The number of classical schools has doubled in the past decade. But here's what makes this moment unique: you don't need to enroll in a specific school or commit to a rigid program. Through open education, families are creating their own classical paths—hiring Latin tutors online, joining [Classical Conversations](https://classicalconversations.com/) co-ops, taking [Great Hearts Online](https://greatheartsonline.org/) courses, or simply beginning with great books and family discussions.

This flexibility isn't a dilution of classical education—it's a return to its roots. The humanistic schools of the Renaissance operated through personal tutoring, adapted pacing, and deep engagement with texts. Modern families are recreating these conditions, not through wealth or privilege, but through the tools and networks of open education.

## Defining Classical Education Method

Classical education resists simple definition because it spans millennia. Ancient Greeks pioneered the *artes liberales*—the liberating arts that free the mind for independent thought. Medieval schools organized these into the trivium (grammar, logic, rhetoric) and quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy). Renaissance humanists integrated classical languages as the medium of all learning.

The modern revival, sparked by Sayers and developed by educators like Susan Wise Bauer, typically follows this progression:

- **Grammar Stage (Elementary):** Children absorb facts and build foundational knowledge through memorization and repetition
- **Logic Stage (Middle School):** Students learn to analyze arguments, identify fallacies, and think systematically
- **Rhetoric Stage (High School):** Young adults synthesize knowledge and express themselves persuasively

But classical education is more than stages. It's a commitment to engaging directly with the Western tradition—reading Homer rather than summaries of Homer, studying Latin to access original texts, tracing ideas from their ancient origins through their modern expressions.

This naturally aligns with open education principles. Just as open education insists that children are unique individuals who learn differently, classical education has always adapted to the student. Renaissance tutors didn't force all students through identical curricula—they observed each pupil's aptitudes and adjusted accordingly. Modern families do the same, perhaps emphasizing languages for one child and Great Books for another.

The key insight is that classical education isn't a rigid system but a living tradition. You can start with [Song School Latin](https://classicalacademicpress.com/collections/song-school-latin) and children's mythology, add logic puzzles in middle school, or jump straight into reading classics together. The tradition is robust enough to meet you where you are.

## Benefits of Classical Education

Research on classical education reveals striking outcomes. Studies from the [Association of Classical Christian Schools](https://classicalchristian.org/) show classical students scoring in the 80th percentile or higher on standardized tests, compared to the 50th percentile average. But standardized tests miss the deeper transformation.

Dr. Roger La Marca of Great Hearts Online explains: "Paradoxically, it's not by prepping kids for the test that they achieve the best scores; it's by teaching them to learn so they pursue knowledge on their own. A very high percentage of our graduates end up in science, technology, engineering, and medical fields because we teach them logic, rhetoric, reading, and grammar."

Historical evidence supports this. In 19th-century Germany, students from humanistic schools (emphasizing Latin, Greek, and literature) consistently outperformed "real school" (*Realschule*) students at universities—even in the sciences they'd never formally studied. The classical training in how to think transferred across disciplines.

These benefits mirror what open education seeks: students who can adapt to any challenge, learn independently, and integrate knowledge across domains. Classical education develops:

- **Mental discipline** through memorization and language study
- **Critical thinking** through formal logic and Socratic discussion
- **Cultural literacy** through engagement with foundational texts
- **Expression skills** through rhetoric and composition
- **Character formation** through exposure to virtue and vice in literature

The classical approach produces not just smart students but wise ones—capable of discerning truth, articulating positions, and contributing meaningfully to society.

## Classical Education with OpenEd

Traditional classical schools charge premium tuition. Complete homeschool curricula require significant investment. Private Latin tutors command high hourly rates. For many families, classical education seemed financially out of reach.

This flexibility honors both classical and open education principles. You're not locked into one curriculum or timeline. You can emphasize what resonates with your family—whether that's intensive Latin study, Great Books discussions, or classical approaches to history and literature.

## Classical Education for Elementary School

The grammar stage (roughly ages 5-12) capitalizes on children's natural ability to absorb information. Young minds delight in patterns, songs, and stories. Classical education harnesses this through:

Memory work becomes the foundation. Children memorize math facts, historical dates, Latin vocabulary, and poetry—not as rote drudgery but through songs, chants, and games. This creates mental "furniture" that later thinking can arrange and rearrange.

Latin begins early, often through programs like [Song School Latin](https://classicalacademicpress.com/collections/song-school-latin) or [Prima Latina](https://www.memoriapress.com/curriculum/latin/prima-latina/). Children aren't expected to translate Virgil—they're building familiarity with the language that underlies half of English vocabulary.

History follows chronological progression, often using resources like [Story of the World](https://welltrainedmind.com/) or the [Famous Men](https://www.memoriapress.com/curriculum/classical-studies/) series. Children learn history as narrative, following humanity's story from ancient times to present.

Open education families might blend these classical elements with other approaches:

- Morning memory work from Classical Conversations
- Afternoon nature study from Charlotte Mason
- Evening read-alouds from classic literature
- Weekend projects integrating week's learning

## Classical Education for Middle School

The logic stage (roughly ages 12-14) marks a shift from absorbing facts to analyzing relationships. Students naturally become argumentative—classical education channels this into formal reasoning.

Formal logic becomes central through resources like [The Art of Argument](https://classicalacademicpress.com/products/the-art-of-argument-revised-student-edition) or [Traditional Logic](https://www.memoriapress.com/curriculum/logic-and-rhetoric/traditional-logic-i/). Students learn to identify fallacies, construct valid arguments, and think systematically.

Latin progresses to translation. Programs like [Latin for Children](https://classicalacademicpress.com/collections/latin-for-children) or [Lingua Latina](https://www.hackettpublishing.com/lingua-latina-per-se-illustrata-series) move students from vocabulary to actual reading of classical texts.

Subject integration deepens. When studying the Middle Ages, students read medieval literature, examine Gothic architecture, explore scholastic philosophy, and trace mathematical developments. Every subject illuminates the others.

Many families find this stage ideal for mixing approaches:

- Classical logic training with modern science curriculum
- Latin study alongside coding languages
- Great Books discussions combined with current events analysis

## Classical Education for High School

The rhetoric stage (roughly ages 15-18) synthesizes everything learned into original expression. Students move from analyzing others' arguments to constructing their own.

Rhetoric and composition become central through programs like the [Institute for Excellence in Writing](https://iew.com/) or classical rhetoric texts. Students learn not just to write correctly but persuasively, adapting their message to their audience.

Original sources replace textbooks entirely. Students read Plato's dialogues, not summaries of Plato. They work through Euclid's proofs, not modern geometry textbooks. They engage directly with the tradition they've been preparing to join.

Great Books seminars, whether through [Great Hearts Online](https://greatheartsonline.org/), local co-ops, or family discussions, become the centerpiece. Students wrestle with life's biggest questions through humanity's greatest texts.

Open education families at this stage often blend classical foundations with modern opportunities:

- Dual enrollment for STEM subjects while maintaining classical humanities
- Online tutorials with classical scholars worldwide
- Apprenticeships that apply classical learning to modern fields
- Gap year programs like Paideia Institute's [Living Latin in Rome](https://www.paideiainstitute.org/)

## Classical Curriculum

Classical curriculum isn't a fixed canon but a living tradition you can enter at any point. Open education families use these resources as tools, adapting them to their children's needs:

**For Beginning Families:**

- Start with [D'Aulaires' mythology books](https://www.amazon.com/Daulaires-Greek-Myths-Ingri-dAulaire/dp/0385015836) and library classics
- Add simple Latin like [Minimus](https://www.amazon.com/Minimus-Pupils-Book-Starting-Latin/dp/0521659604) or [Song School Latin](https://classicalacademicpress.com/collections/song-school-latin)
- Include memory work through [Classical Conversations](https://classicalconversations.com/) or independently
- Begin logic with puzzles and [The Fallacy Detective](http://www.fallacydetective.com/)

**For Committed Classical Families:**

- Full programs like [Memoria Press](https://www.memoriapress.com/) or [Veritas Press](https://veritaspress.com/)
- Systematic Latin through [Lingua Latina](https://www.hackettpublishing.com/lingua-latina-per-se-illustrata-series) or [Cambridge Latin](https://www.cambridgescp.com/)
- Great Books discussions through [Great Hearts Online](https://greatheartsonline.org/) or local seminars
- Formal logic and rhetoric training

**For Hybrid Approaches:**

- Classical languages through apps like [Duolingo Latin](https://www.duolingo.com/course/la/en/Learn-Latin) plus weekly tutoring
- Selected [Great Hearts Online Flex](https://greatheartsonline.org/flex-program/) courses
- Classical elements in humanities with modern STEM
- Mix of classical and contemporary literature

All secular classical materials and curricula are 100% reimbursable through OpenEd's funding programs.

# V2 - Classical Education with OpenEd

In 1947, British scholar Dorothy Sayers delivered a lecture that would reignite an educational tradition dormant for decades. In "The Lost Tools of Learning," she argued that modern education had abandoned the very methods that produced history's greatest thinkers—from Aristotle to Aquinas, Newton to Jefferson.

She wasn't calling for nostalgia. She was identifying a pattern: for over two thousand years, Western civilization transmitted wisdom through a specific approach to learning. Students mastered language before logic, logic before rhetoric. They read original sources rather than textbooks. They integrated subjects rather than fragmenting them. And it worked.

Today, classical education is experiencing a remarkable revival. The number of classical schools has doubled in the past decade. But here's what makes this moment unique: through open education, families are creating their own classical paths—hiring Latin tutors online, joining homeschool co-ops for Socratic seminars, taking Great Hearts Online courses, or simply beginning with great books and family discussions.

## What is Classical Education?

Classical education spans millennia but maintains consistent principles. Ancient Greeks pioneered the *artes liberales*—the liberating arts that free the mind for independent thought. Medieval schools organized these into the trivium (grammar, logic, rhetoric) and quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy). Renaissance humanists integrated classical languages as the medium of all learning.

The modern revival structures learning around developmental readiness. Dorothy Sayers coined memorable terms for these stages:

- **"Poll-parrot" stage (Elementary):** Young children who love to memorize and chant absorb facts and build foundational knowledge
- **"Pert" stage (Middle School):** Students who love to argue and question learn to analyze arguments and think systematically
- **"Poetic" stage (High School):** Teenagers ready for self-expression synthesize knowledge and communicate persuasively

But classical education is more than stages. It's a commitment to engaging directly with the Western tradition—reading Homer rather than summaries of Homer, studying Latin to access original texts, tracing ideas from their ancient origins through their modern expressions. The model emphasizes integration of all subjects through history, primary sources over textbooks, Socratic discussion that leads students to discover truth, and character development through exposure to noble examples.

This naturally aligns with open education principles. Just as open education insists that children are unique individuals who learn differently, classical education has always adapted to the student. Renaissance tutors didn't force all students through identical curricula—they observed each pupil's aptitudes and adjusted accordingly.

## Benefits and Evidence

Research reveals striking outcomes. Studies show classical students scoring in the 80th percentile or higher on standardized tests, compared to the 50th percentile average. But standardized tests miss the deeper transformation.

Dr. Roger La Marca of Great Hearts Online explains: "Paradoxically, it's not by prepping kids for the test that they achieve the best scores; it's by teaching them to learn so they pursue knowledge on their own. A very high percentage of our graduates end up in science, technology, engineering, and medical fields because we teach them logic, rhetoric, reading, and grammar."

Historical evidence supports this. In 19th-century Germany, students from humanistic schools (emphasizing Latin, Greek, and literature) consistently outperformed "real school" (*Realschule*) students at universities—even in sciences they'd never formally studied. The classical training in how to think transferred across disciplines.

Classical education develops mental discipline through memorization and language study, critical thinking through formal logic and Socratic discussion, cultural literacy through foundational texts, expression skills through rhetoric and composition, and character formation through exposure to virtue in literature. It produces not just smart students but wise ones—capable of discerning truth, articulating positions, and contributing meaningfully to society.

## Elementary Years: Building Foundations

The grammar stage (roughly ages 5-12) capitalizes on children's natural ability to absorb information. Young minds delight in patterns, songs, and stories. Classical education harnesses this through memory work that becomes the foundation—children memorize math facts, historical dates, Latin vocabulary, and poetry through songs, chants, and games. This creates mental "furniture" that later thinking can arrange and rearrange.

Latin begins early, often through programs like Song School Latin or Prima Latina. Children aren't expected to translate Virgil—they're building familiarity with the language that underlies half of English vocabulary. History follows chronological progression using resources like Story of the World, as children learn history as narrative, following humanity's story from ancient times to present.

Open education families might blend classical elements with other approaches: morning memory work from Classical Conversations, afternoon nature study from Charlotte Mason, evening read-alouds from classic literature, weekend projects integrating the week's learning.

## Middle School: Learning to Think

The logic stage (roughly ages 12-14) marks a shift from absorbing facts to analyzing relationships. Students naturally become argumentative—classical education channels this into formal reasoning.

Formal logic becomes central through resources like The Art of Argument or Traditional Logic. Students learn to identify fallacies, construct valid arguments, and think systematically. Latin progresses to translation through programs like Latin for Children or Lingua Latina. Subject integration deepens—when studying the Middle Ages, students read medieval literature, examine Gothic architecture, explore scholastic philosophy, and trace mathematical developments.

Many families find this stage ideal for mixing approaches: classical logic training with modern science curriculum, Latin study alongside coding languages, Great Books discussions combined with current events analysis.

## High School: Finding Voice

The rhetoric stage (roughly ages 15-18) synthesizes everything learned into original expression. Students move from analyzing others' arguments to constructing their own.

Rhetoric and composition become central through programs like Lost Tools of Writing. Students learn not just to write correctly but persuasively, adapting their message to their audience. Original sources replace textbooks entirely—students read Plato's dialogues, not summaries of Plato. They work through Euclid's proofs, not modern geometry textbooks.

Great Books seminars become the centerpiece. Students wrestle with life's biggest questions through humanity's greatest texts. Open education families often blend classical foundations with modern opportunities: dual enrollment for STEM while maintaining classical humanities, online tutorials with classical scholars worldwide, apprenticeships that apply classical learning to modern fields.

## Classical Curriculum Resources

Classical curriculum provides structure while allowing customization. For beginning families, start with mythology books and library classics, add simple Latin like Song School Latin, include memory work independently or through co-ops, and begin logic with puzzles and critical thinking games.

**Core Resources by Stage:**

Grammar Stage: First Language Lessons for grammar, Story of the World for history, Singapore or Saxon Math, classic children's literature

Logic Stage: The Art of Argument for informal logic, Traditional Logic for formal logic, primary historical sources, Teaching the Classics for literature

Rhetoric Stage: Lost Tools of Writing for composition, Lingua Latina for advanced Latin, Great Books discussions, Rhetoric Alive! for persuasive speaking

Complete programs like Memoria Press, Veritas Press, and Great Hearts Online offer comprehensive curricula, while families can also create hybrid approaches mixing classical elements with modern resources.

## Classical Education with OpenEd

Classical education has traditionally been expensive—private classical schools charge premium tuition, complete curricula require significant investment, and Latin tutors command high hourly rates. OpenEd changes this completely.

Through partnerships with public schools, OpenEd provides funding that makes classical education accessible to all families. Every secular classical resource—from Latin programs to logic curricula to Great Books sets—is 100% reimbursable.

But OpenEd offers something more valuable than funding: flexibility. Classical education through OpenEd means taking individual Great Hearts Online courses without full enrollment, joining Classical Conversations for community while maintaining your own pace, hiring online tutors from the Paideia Institute, mixing classical elements with other approaches, or starting small with library books and expanding as interests develop.

You're not locked into one curriculum or timeline. You can emphasize what resonates with your family—whether that's intensive Latin study, Great Books discussions, or classical approaches to specific subjects. This flexibility honors both classical and open education principles, proving that the education which shaped Western civilization shouldn't be reserved for the privileged few.

## Reclaim the Lost Tools

The "lost tools of learning" were never truly lost—they were waiting to be reclaimed. Through OpenEd, families can access humanity's longest educational tradition without choosing between classical rigor and financial reality.

Whether you want full classical immersion or just to add Latin and logic to your existing approach, OpenEd provides the funding and flexibility to make it possible. The wisdom that shaped Western civilization for two millennia belongs to every child ready to receive it.

# V1 - Classical Education with OpenEd: Fund Your Journey Through the Great Tradition

Classical education is experiencing a remarkable revival, with the number of classical schools doubling in the past decade. But you don't need to enroll in a specific school or commit to a rigid program to give your child a classical education.

Through OpenEd, families can access funding and support to pursue classical education however it fits their lives—whether that's hiring Latin tutors, purchasing Great Books curricula, joining Classical Conversations co-ops, or mixing classical approaches with modern resources.

## What is Classical Education?

Classical education emphasizes the "liberating arts" that free the mind for independent thought. Modern classical education typically follows Dorothy Sayers' interpretation of the medieval trivium:

- **Grammar Stage (Elementary):** Young children absorb facts and memorize foundational knowledge
- **Logic Stage (Middle School):** Students learn to analyze arguments and think critically
- **Rhetoric Stage (High School):** Teenagers express themselves persuasively and originally

What unifies classical education is respect for Western tradition, integrated learning across subjects, and emphasis on original sources over textbooks. But here's the key: there's no single "right way" to do classical education, which makes OpenEd's flexible funding model perfect for families pursuing this path.

# Classical Education Options in the United States (K–12 and Beyond)

*Classical education* is a model that emphasizes the enduring value of the **liberal arts and classical languages**, often structured around the **Trivium** (three stages of learning – grammar, logic/dialectic, and rhetoric). It typically involves deep study of foundational texts (the “Great Books”), **Latin and/or Greek**, formal logic, and eloquent expression. Below is a comprehensive overview of classical education options in the U.S. for families interested in this approach. We focus on K–12 offerings across several categories, and also note a few higher-education examples. Each resource is labeled as **secular** or **faith-based**, with notes on grade levels and accessibility for independent learners.

## 1. Online Curriculum and Virtual Academies (K–12)

**Online classical programs** allow students to learn from home with structured curricula and live or self-paced classes. These range from secular academies to Christian-affiliated online schools. Many offer **accreditation, transcript services, and college-prep coursework**. Below are prominent examples:

- **Well-Trained Mind Academy (WTMA)** – **Secular**, live online classes for roughly grades 5 or 6–12. WTMA is an accredited program built around classical education principles (focusing on the Trivium) and is ideal for families wanting classical rigor **without religious affiliation**[*[1]*](https://www.wtmacademy.com/#:~:text=The%20Well,passion%20for%20helping%20students%20excel). Classes are taught by qualified instructors in small groups, with options for live or delayed-view sessions and even one-on-one tutoring. WTMA emphasizes teaching students *how to learn* through classical methods and welcomes homeschoolers seeking part-time or full-time courses[*[2]](https://www.wtmacademy.com/#:~:text=The%20Well,passion%20for%20helping%20students%20excel)[[3]](https://www.wtmacademy.com/#:~:text=Classical%20Education%3A%20Teaching%20Students%20How,to%20Learn)*. As a secular program, it’s accessible to independent learners from any background. Parents are encouraged to stay involved but the structured courses and assessments provide substantial guidance.
- **Great Hearts Online** – **Secular (public charter)**, full-time **tuition-free** online schools currently serving grades K–11 (expanding to K–12) for residents of Arizona and Texas, with a national private option for those out-of-state. Great Hearts is an extension of the Great Hearts classical charter school network, delivering a rich **classical liberal arts curriculum** via virtual classes[*[4]*](https://greatheartsonline.org/#:~:text=Great%20Hearts%20Online%20academies%20are,our%20National%20Academy%20Flex%20Program). The program includes advanced math and science, literature, history, **foreign languages**, and fine arts, all oriented toward “truth, goodness, and beauty” in the classical tradition. As a public charter academy, it is non-sectarian. Parents take on a “co-teacher” role at home, especially for young grades, to facilitate learning, but certified teachers lead the instruction. Great Hearts Online emphasizes community through optional in-person meetups and projects, making it a robust, structured option for independent learners who want an accredited classical education at home.
- **Scholé Academy** – **Christian (Classical Christian)**, online courses for grades K–12 operated by Classical Academic Press. Scholé Academy offers live classes in core subjects, Latin, Greek, logic, rhetoric, and more, guided by the idea of “restful learning” (scholé). Classes tend to be small and slower-paced, focusing on contemplation and mastery rather than busywork. While faith-based (instructors sign a statement of faith), the approach is ecumenical and focuses on classical content. This is a good option for families wanting a supportive Christian classical framework with flexibility to choose à la carte classes. It can supplement homeschool curricula or provide a full course load. Parental involvement is welcomed but not as intensive as in a co-op; students engage directly with instructors. *(Note: Scholé Academy also coordinates with local Scholé* *Communities* *for in-person gatherings – see Communities section below.)*
- **Veritas Scholars Academy (VSA)** – **Christian (Reformed)**, online K–12 program run by Veritas Press. VSA offers two formats: self-paced online courses (interactive lessons students can do anytime) and live online classes led by teachers. The curriculum is classically based and **Biblically integrated**, following a timeline of history (Ancient to modern) and emphasizing **Great Books and classical literature**. Latin is taught from elementary grades. This program is accredited and provides **diploma tracks** or single courses. It is designed for homeschoolers – independent learners can navigate the self-paced courses with minimal parent help, whereas the live classes offer real-time accountability. As a faith-based academy, Bible and theology are part of the curriculum. Veritas is known for rigorous academics; families should be prepared for a substantial workload.
- **Memoria Academy** – **Christian (Classical Christian)**, online courses affiliated with Memoria Press. Memoria Press (a publisher of classical curricula) runs this online academy to deliver its **classical Christian curriculum** in a live class format. The program is rooted in a traditional approach – lots of **Latin (using Memoria’s Latin series), logic, classical literature**, and an emphasis on Western civilization and the **“Christian West”**[*[5]](https://www.memoriapress.com/homeschool/?srsltid=AfmBOoqVYJMRvkbzrQ84kULKVIGASwZ5jcjxuxq91b0FYdj9nn2lSp11#:~:text=Memoria%20Press%20features%20a%20complete,heritage%20of%20the%20Christian%20West)[[6]](https://logosonlineschool.com/#:~:text=Education%20logosonlineschool,that%27s%20both%20affordable%20and%20accredited)*. It serves K–12 with various course offerings and even complete grade-level packages. Being faith-based, it includes Christian studies and often approaches classical works from a Christian perspective. Memoria Academy can be used full-time or for individual subjects (e.g. Latin or Logic classes). Parental role is moderate – students get live instruction and feedback from teachers, but parents oversee homework and pacing at home, especially for younger kids.
- **Wilson Hill Academy** – **Christian**, live online school for grades 4–12. Wilson Hill is an accredited classical Christian program originally catering to homeschoolers needing quality online classes. It offers a range of courses and uses a **“flipped classroom”** style for some subjects (students watch lecture material independently, then class time is for discussion). Courses are college-prep and many are honors or AP. The academy is non-denominational Christian in orientation. Independent learners benefit from the scheduled classes and teacher feedback, but parents are still partners in education. Wilson Hill emphasizes a dialogical style (Socratic discussions in humanities, for example) similar to a classical classroom experience, just virtual.
- **Kolbe Academy Online** – **Catholic (Classical Catholic)**, online program for K–12. Kolbe Academy is a longstanding Catholic homeschool program that offers **live online classes and self-paced courses** with an *authentically Catholic, classical curriculum[[7]](https://www.kolbe.org/#:~:text=At%20Kolbe%20Academy%2C%20your%20child,suit%20their%20unique%20learning%20style)*. The Ignatian educational approach is combined with Great Books reading, and students can pursue a Kolbe diploma or just take courses. Latin is introduced early; high-schoolers read authors like Homer, Virgil, Augustine, Aquinas, etc. Kolbe’s live classes require students to attend on a regular schedule; thus, it provides structure and accountability good for independent learners, though parents (especially in younger grades) guide students offline. For devout Catholic families wanting a classical education, Kolbe is a top choice; secular families might prefer a different program as religion is woven throughout.
- **Classical Liberal Arts Academy (CLAA)** – **Secular-focused (Catholic-run)**, an online curriculum project offering *free* self-paced courses in the traditional **seven liberal arts** and classical subjects[*[8]](https://classicalliberalarts.com/blog/secular-homeschool-curriculum/#:~:text=How%20the%20CLAA%20Can%20Help)[[9]](https://classicalliberalarts.com/blog/secular-homeschool-curriculum/#:~:text=If%20you%20are%20interested%20in,the%20Classical%20Liberal%20Arts%20Academy)*. Despite being run by a Catholic educator, CLAA positions itself as providing a **secular classical curriculum** accessible to all, emphasizing the classical philosophical tradition (Plato, Aristotle, etc.) without modern or political biases[*[10]*](https://classicalliberalarts.com/blog/secular-homeschool-curriculum/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20benefits%20of,the%20common%20good%2C%20virtue%2C%20etc). The CLAA covers subjects like Grammar, Latin, Formal Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music theory, and Astronomy in a way that revives the **medieval liberal arts curriculum**. It also includes classical philosophy courses. Because it is largely self-paced and text-based, highly motivated independent learners can dive into these materials for free (or low cost), but there is less hand-holding. (Families can optionally enroll in premium plans for tutoring or grading services.) This might appeal to those who want a very **old-school classical** curriculum (including heavy Latin and even scholastic philosophy) either secularly or in tandem with a religious upbringing. It’s a unique resource for enrichment or a full curriculum, but requires discipline and parent/mentor support for younger students due to its rigor.

**Accessibility Note:** Generally, online academies vary in how independent a student can be. **Secular programs like WTMA or Great Hearts Online** are designed so that a motivated student can follow the schedule, attend classes, and complete assignments with relatively minimal parental instruction (parents mostly provide oversight). **Christian online programs** often similarly allow independent work, though some (especially those for younger grades) assume a parent is coaching at home. Always check each academy’s expectations for parent involvement. Most provide tech support, online forums, or advisors to help independent learners succeed. Many also offer **clubs or social events online**, such as Latin clubs, writing clubs, etc., to build community in a virtual setting.

## 2. In-Person Schools and Co-Ops (Classical Campuses, Microschools, & Homeschool Groups)

For families who prefer brick-and-mortar or face-to-face learning, there are **many classical schools and cooperative groups** across the U.S. These range from tuition-free public charter schools to private academies and parent-led co-ops. Below are key types:

- **Classical Charter Schools (Public, Non-sectarian):** In recent years, a wave of public charter schools embracing classical education has spread across multiple states. These schools are **tuition-free and secular** (cannot endorse religion due to public funding) but feature a classical curriculum (emphasis on Western literature, **Founding documents, Latin**, logic, etc.). Examples include the **Great Hearts Academies** network (with 30+ schools in Arizona and Texas) and various charters launched with support from **Hillsdale College’s Barney Charter School Initiative**. Hillsdale College (a liberal arts college in MI) has helped start **over 100 classical charter schools in 33 states** as of 2023[*[11]](https://hillsdalecollegian.com/2023/11/hillsdale-expands-charter-school-network/#:~:text=This%20year%2C%20the%20Hillsdale%20K,in%20its%20network%20to%20106)[[12]](https://hillsdalecollegian.com/2023/11/hillsdale-expands-charter-school-network/#:~:text=intellectual%20and%20moral%20virtue)*. These schools often use Hillsdale’s American Classical Curriculum or similar content focusing on the Great Books and American heritage. Classical charters like these are open to all students in their areas (via lottery if oversubscribed) and make a rigorous classical education accessible to families regardless of income[*[13]*](https://hillsdalecollegian.com/2023/11/hillsdale-expands-charter-school-network/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHillsdale%20classical%20public%20charter%20schools,%E2%80%9D). Grade levels vary; many are K–8 or K–12. Because they’re public, they administer state tests and follow state graduation requirements, but they differ from traditional schools by forgoing progressive fads in favor of time-tested literature and teaching methods. For independent learners, charters provide a structured environment with certified teachers—parents cede day-to-day instruction to the school but can be assured of a like-minded philosophy guiding the classroom.
- **Private Classical Schools:** Hundreds of private schools across the country identify as classical schools. Many are religious (Christian denominations or Catholic), but a few are secular private schools with a classical bent. On the Christian side, the **Association of Classical Christian Schools (ACCS)** alone has over **500 member schools** (Protestant evangelical) with roughly 50,000+ students combined[*[14]*](https://x.com/a_c_c_s?lang=en#:~:text=Association%20of%20Classical%20Christian%20Schools,Education), and there are Catholic classical school networks (for instance, the Chesterton Academies, which are Catholic high schools using a Great Books curriculum, now in over 50 locations). These private schools typically charge tuition (some offer scholarships) and integrate faith with classical learning (e.g. reading Augustine and Aquinas in theology class, or studying logic alongside Scripture). A hallmark is often a **strong Latin program**, formal logic and rhetoric courses in high school, and often **uniforms and strict discipline** harkening to classical ideals of virtue. For example, a K–12 classical Christian school might use **Saxon Math, teach Latin starting in 3rd grade, require senior thesis defenses**, and hold daily chapel. Secular private classical schools also exist (often just called “liberal arts academies”); one example is **Trivium School** in Massachusetts (Catholic but welcoming non-Catholics), or certain elite prep schools that maintain a Great Books/humanities focus. If considering a private classical school, families should note whether it’s accredited and whether it leans more on classical language and literature or classical education *methods*. **Recommended ages:** These are full-time schools for K–12 or subsets (some are K–8 “Grammar schools” plus a separate 9–12 “Classical high school”). **Accessibility:** independent learners thrive in these environments if they enjoy reading and structure, but the trade-off is less flexibility – the school sets the curriculum and schedule. Parents have a more traditional role (supporting homework, not teaching directly), except in schools that emphasize partnership with parents.
- **Homeschool Co-Ops and Cottage Schools:** A very popular option for classical homeschoolers is joining a co-operative or hybrid program. **Homeschool co-ops** are typically parent-organized groups that meet once or twice per week so students can learn some subjects together (often those that benefit from discussion or group projects). In classical co-ops, parents might take turns teaching classes in literature, history, Latin, etc., following a classical curriculum plan, while other days kids study at home. One well-known nationwide network is **Classical Conversations (CC)** – a **faith-based (Christian)** program where local communities meet weekly under the guidance of a trained parent-tutor. CC provides a unified curriculum: in the **Grammar stage (grades K–6)**, kids do memory work in facts (history timelines, Latin vocabulary, math formulas, etc.), and in **Challenge (middle and high school)**, they delve into seminars on logic, rhetoric, debate, Latin, literature, science labs, and more. The motto is to “learn together, do life together,” and it’s very much **community-oriented**[*[15]*](https://classicalconversations.com/#:~:text=Classical%20Conversations%20empowers%20you%20to,the%20way%20children%20naturally%20learn). Parents attend with their children and are considered the primary teachers at home, while the weekly tutor sessions equip both students and parents[*[15]](https://classicalconversations.com/#:~:text=Classical%20Conversations%20empowers%20you%20to,the%20way%20children%20naturally%20learn)[[16]](https://classicalconversations.com/#:~:text=You%20and%20your%20child%20benefit,a%20lifelong%20love%20of%20learning)*. CC is explicitly Christian in content (e.g. timeline starts with Biblical events, worldview discussions in upper levels) and is structured enough to provide accountability, which helps independent learners stay on track. However, it requires a significant parent commitment (both time and some cost).

Other classical homeschool groups include **Scholé Groups/Communities** (affiliated with Classical Academic Press) which are often more relaxed (“restful”) and meet less frequently, perhaps bi-weekly or monthly, to discuss great books or do group activities. These can be secular or Christian (many are Christian but in an ecumenical way). Scholé Communities emphasize friendship and a slower pace, cultivating contemplation in learning rather than checking boxes[*[17]](https://scholecommunities.com/#:~:text=Education%20is%20done%20best%20in,minded%20families)[[18]](https://scholecommunities.com/#:~:text=Restful%20Learning)*. For example, a Scholé community day might involve nature study, art, Latin practice, and a shared meal, with parents and kids learning side by side in a gentle atmosphere. This is ideal for families who want camaraderie and support without the intensity of weekly presentations or memory drills.

Additionally, many regions have independent “cottage schools” or hybrid models – essentially part-time schools for homeschoolers. **University-Model Schools** are one example: students attend classes 2–3 days per week and homeschool the other days, following the teachers’ lesson plans. These are often classical in curriculum. For instance, **Regina Caeli Academy** is a network of Catholic hybrid schools in multiple states where students go to a center two days a week (in uniforms, with hired tutors instructing in a classical curriculum) and are taught at home the other days by parents. Similarly, Protestant communities have university-model academies – sometimes an existing church school will allow homeschoolers to enroll in courses a la carte. These setups preserve parental involvement while giving structured classroom experience. They usually serve K–12 or specific grade ranges (some are elementary-only or high-school-only). **Accessibility:** For independent learners, co-ops and cottage schools strike a balance – students must be self-motivated on home days and complete work without daily teacher oversight, but they get regular in-person engagement that can keep them inspired. Parents in these models must be actively involved as co-educators. It’s a good choice for families who want the **flexibility of homeschooling with some in-person support**.

- **Microschools and Learning Pods (Classical-focused):** Microschools are very small schools or organized learning pods, often multi-age and run either by parents or an entrepreneur-teacher, that have become more popular recently. Some microschools adopt classical curricula. For example, an enterprising teacher might start a one-room classical academy in their home or a rented space, with 5–10 students of various ages. These can be secular or faith-based depending on the founder. A directory of microschools shows several labeled “Classical” – e.g., *Archway Christian Learning Center* in TX (a microschool for PreK–12 using individualized classical methods), or *Moses & Mary Academy* in FL (a Christian micro-school focusing on classical curriculum plus bilingual education and sports)[*[19]](https://www.meridian-learning.org/microschool-directory/wpbdp_category/classical/#:~:text=Archway%20Christian%20Learning%20Center)[[20]](https://www.meridian-learning.org/microschool-directory/wpbdp_category/classical/#:~:text=Name%20of%20School)[[21]](https://www.meridian-learning.org/microschool-directory/wpbdp_category/classical/#:~:text=Grades%20or%20ages%20served)*. Microschools often emphasize personalization: low student-teacher ratio means independent learners can soar (or get extra help when needed). Some follow a **“college-style” schedule or tutorial approach**. Networks like **Prenda** or **Acton Academy** support microschool creation; while those models aren’t inherently classical (Acton is more project-based, Prenda is personalized/blended learning), some families incorporate classical content within them. Essentially, a microschool could use classical resources (like *Story of the World* for history or **Socratic discussions** of literature) but in a very small communal setting. If a family doesn’t have a classical charter or private school nearby, they might find (or start) a microschool to collaborate with a few other families. **Recommended ages:** Many microschools cluster around elementary or middle grades, but some span K–12 in one program. **Accessibility:** Very dependent on the specific microschool – some are more formal (regular hours, a hired teacher) and others are informal (parent rotation). For a self-driven student, a microschool can be wonderful due to high flexibility. Just ensure the guide/teacher is competent in classical subjects if pursuing this route.

## 3. Extracurricular Programs and Clubs (Classical Enrichment)

Classical education isn’t only about core classes; it also prizes the **development of virtue, eloquence, and cultural literacy** through enrichment activities. Many families pursuing classical education involve their kids in clubs and competitions that complement their studies. Here are some notable extracurricular programs and clubs related to the classical model:

- **Latin Clubs and the National Junior Classical League (NJCL):** If your student is studying Latin (a hallmark of classical curricula), joining a Latin club can greatly enhance their experience. The **National Junior Classical League** is a massive organization of middle and high school Latin/Greek clubs, with over **45,000 members and 1,000+ chapters worldwide**[*[22]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Junior_Classical_League#:~:text=organization%20of%20secondary%20%20school,that%20of%20%2058%20classical). NJCL-affiliated clubs (often in schools or homeschool groups) celebrate Classical civilizations through activities like Certamen (a quiz-bowl style Latin trivia competition), Latin banquets, costume contests, and state and national conventions. These clubs **encourage love for ancient languages and cultures**, aligning well with classical education’s emphasis on Greco-Roman heritage. They are secular (open to anyone studying Latin/Greek). Participating students can take the **National Latin Exam**, qualify for Latin Honor Society, and even compete for scholarships. Independent learners can join as part of a local chapter (some areas have community-based homeschool JCL chapters). It’s a fun way to meet peers who also know their *amo, amas, amat* – combining socialization with academic motivation in the classical languages.
- **Speech and Debate (Rhetoric in action):** Mastery of rhetoric and persuasive speaking is a key goal of classical education, and **debate clubs or forensic leagues** provide an arena to practice these skills. Many classical schools and co-ops form teams in leagues such as the **National Speech & Debate Association (NSDA)** – which is the main secular high school league in the U.S. – or in specialized homeschool leagues. Homeschool families, especially Christian ones, often participate in **NCFCA (National Christian Forensics and Communications Association)** or **Stoa**, both of which run tournaments nationwide for speech events (persuasive speeches, interpretive readings, etc.) and debate formats (Lincoln-Douglas, Team Policy, etc.)[*[23]*](http://clashdebate.org/#:~:text=CLASH%20Debate%20Club%20About%20CLASH,league%20in%20Santa%20Clara%20County). Through debate, students steeped in logic and ethics (from classical studies) can apply those lessons to crafting arguments on contemporary issues. **Mock Trial** is another popular activity: students simulate real courtroom trials, taking on roles of attorneys and witnesses. This builds understanding of law, logical case-building, and public speaking. Many states have a **High School Mock Trial competition** (often coordinated by bar associations); homeschool teams are usually allowed. For classical students who have read about Cicero’s orations or studied logic, these clubs are the practical extension of those lessons. Typically, age range for formal debate and mock trial is **junior high through high school** (some areas have middle-school programs, but high school is most common). **Accessibility:** Independent learners can join local community teams or even form their own club if none is nearby. The leagues often provide training materials. It does require time and often travel to tournaments, but it’s one of the most direct ways to fulfill the rhetoric training of classical education.
- **Classical Music, Art, and Drama:** The classical tradition values the Fine Arts as part of a well-rounded education (“music” was one of the original seven liberal arts). Thus, many classically educated students pursue extracurricular arts:
- *Music:* Learning an instrument (piano, violin, etc.) or vocal training (choir) not only enriches the soul but also reinforces patterns and discipline (remember, “Music” in the liberal arts included musical theory and mathematics). Families often enroll children in community youth orchestras, string ensembles, or choir programs. Some classical schools have their own choirs, orchestras, or Schola Cantorum (chant choir, especially in Catholic contexts). There are also competitions and festivals (like **National Guild of Piano Teachers auditions, ABRSM or Royal Conservatory exams** for classical music) which set goals for students.
- *Art:* Similarly, art classes or clubs can complement a classical study of art history. Students might take sketching, painting, or calligraphy classes. Some co-ops organize **Art Guilds** where students learn about classical artists and practice techniques (drawing Greek busts, for example).
- *Drama:* Theater is a fantastic way to bring classical literature to life. It’s common for classical academies or homeschools to stage plays by Shakespeare or Greek tragedies/comedies. There are even **Shakespeare competitions** (the English-Speaking Union runs one for high school monologues) that classical students often excel in due to their familiarity with the language. Local community theaters or church drama clubs can serve as outlets too. Through drama, students gain confidence in public performance and deepen their comprehension of great works.

These artistic extracurriculars aren’t exclusive to classical education, of course, but classical educators particularly appreciate them as they cultivate an appreciation for “beauty” and require practice of the virtues (patience, precision, teamwork). They are generally open to a wide age range (many start music lessons young, whereas drama clubs might be tween/teen-focused). For an independent learner, involvement in music or art can often be done through private lessons or community centers alongside their academic studies.

- **Civic and Historical Clubs:** A classical education places heavy emphasis on history and virtuous citizenship (often reading about statesmen, philosophers, etc.). As such, activities that engage students with history and civic knowledge align well. For example, participating in **National History Day** (a competition where students research a historical topic and create a project/exhibit) can be a great supplement – many classical homeschoolers join this and often choose topics from Ancient or Medieval history that they love. **Quiz Bowl or History Bee** teams allow students to show off their factual knowledge (classical students often have lots of memorized facts from their curriculum!). Some areas have **Latin Quiz Bowls (Certamen)** beyond JCL, or **Classics Day events** at local colleges where high-schoolers can attend workshops. Additionally, **philosophy clubs** or **book discussion circles** for teens can extend the Great Books learning beyond class; for instance, a group might meet monthly to discuss a Plato dialogue or a Chesterton novel that isn’t in their syllabus. These kinds of clubs might need to be initiated by motivated students or parents, but they are excellent for deeper dives into classical content.
- **Athletics and Physical Pursuits with a Classical Twist:** While not “classical” in content, it’s worth noting that many classical schools offer sports and even connect them to virtues (talk of honor, perseverance, etc., often referencing ancient ideals of sportsmanship). Some homeschool communities form their own sports teams or join local rec leagues. A few classical programs incorporate unique physical activities: for example, **fencing clubs** (swordplay has an old-world flair) or **Scout troops** (Boy Scouts, Trail Life USA, etc.) for developing character and outdoor skills in a structured way. Physical education was valued by the ancients (“mens sana in corpore sano” – a sound mind in a sound body), so classical education families do encourage sports, even if it’s not an academic pursuit. The key is balancing athletics with academics and ensuring sports participation reinforces virtues rather than undermining study time.

In summary, extracurricular opportunities for classical students abound. Whether through **academic clubs** (Latin club, debate, mock trial) or **cultural activities** (music, art, drama), these programs allow students to apply and expand their learning in social contexts. They also help develop well-rounded individuals – a chief aim of the classical model. Parents seeking these for their children can often plug into existing school teams or homeschool networks; if none exist, starting a simple club (even just a monthly “Great Books Club” or a Latin study group) can greatly enrich the classical journey.

## 4. Books and Guides for Parents Implementing Classical Education at Home

For parents new to classical education, there are numerous resources that explain the philosophy and offer practical guidance. These books and guides help parents understand *what* classical education is and *how* to teach using this model, especially in a homeschool setting. Below is a selection of highly-regarded titles, along with notes on their perspective (secular vs. faith-based):

- ***The Well-Trained Mind: A Guide to Classical Education at Home*** by Susan Wise Bauer & Jessie Wise – *Secular-friendly.* This hefty guide (originally published in 1999, now in its 4th edition) is one of the most influential books for homeschooling parents. Susan Wise Bauer, who was classically homeschooled herself, lays out a **comprehensive, step-by-step plan from preschool through 12th grade**[*[24]*](https://welltrainedmind.com/about/?srsltid=AfmBOor3rXzfKMe8Y5sLa2yaZFtnWAXGjyo1GckYgajIwKm9sb5CCuLL#:~:text=This%20book%20will%20instruct%20you%2C,tools%20you%E2%80%99ll%20need%20to%20teach). It covers every subject (language arts, history, science, math, Latin, etc.) with recommendations for curricula and schedules at each stage of the Trivium. The tone is secular/academic – religious content is not built into the plan (the author’s Christian, but the book is used by many non-religious families). Key features include the idea of teaching history in four chronological cycles, emphasizing narration and writing, and lots of reading of quality literature. The book also gives advice on study habits and handling multiple ages. **Why it’s useful:** It’s like a blueprint or reference manual – parents can follow it closely or just use it to inform their own approach. The latest edition even addresses modern resources (online classes, etc.). For independent homeschoolers, *The Well-Trained Mind* provides structure so you can ensure your child gets an “academically rigorous, comprehensive education… training them to read, think, and understand”[*[24]*](https://welltrainedmind.com/about/?srsltid=AfmBOor3rXzfKMe8Y5sLa2yaZFtnWAXGjyo1GckYgajIwKm9sb5CCuLL#:~:text=This%20book%20will%20instruct%20you%2C,tools%20you%E2%80%99ll%20need%20to%20teach) in true classical fashion.
- ***An Introduction to Classical Education: A Guide for Parents*** by Christopher Perrin – *Christian (but broadly applicable).* This is a much shorter read (~48 pages) that serves as a friendly primer on classical education’s history and key concepts[*[25]*](https://classicalacademicpress.com/products/an-introduction-to-classical-education-a-guide-for-parents?srsltid=AfmBOormNKtOZs_TZ7oAacq4EeIGRlJiUoPy7ynXcvya_5_JBnIM74hE#:~:text=This%2048,by%20the%20author%2C%20is%20also). Dr. Perrin is a leader in the classical education movement and co-founder of Classical Academic Press. His booklet traces the roots of classical education from ancient times through its modern renaissance and explains terms like trivium and quadrivium in approachable language. It highlights distinctive elements such as **teaching Latin and Greek, focusing on grammar/logic/rhetoric**, and the proven success of classical students[*[25]*](https://classicalacademicpress.com/products/an-introduction-to-classical-education-a-guide-for-parents?srsltid=AfmBOormNKtOZs_TZ7oAacq4EeIGRlJiUoPy7ynXcvya_5_JBnIM74hE#:~:text=This%2048,by%20the%20author%2C%20is%20also). There are anecdotes, diagrams, and FAQs, making it great for someone just beginning to research this educational style. It’s also written from a Christian perspective (acknowledging how classical education was carried on through church history) but doesn’t dive into theology – non-Christian readers can still gain the core insights. Notably, this guide is often **available as a free PDF** from Classical Academic Press, making it an easy starting point. For a parent who wants the “big picture” without wading through a big manual, this is ideal.
- ***The Core: Teaching Your Child the Foundations of Classical Education*** by Leigh A. Bortins – *Christian.* Leigh Bortins is the founder of Classical Conversations, and this book (2010) distills her perspective on why the basics matter. It’s particularly focused on elementary-age education (the “grammar stage”). Bortins explains **why memorization and mastering fundamentals** (like math facts, phonics, history timelines) are essential and how they form the core of later learning[*[26]](https://www.christianbook.com/teaching-your-child-foundations-classical-education/leigh-bortins/9780230100350/pd/10035X?srsltid=AfmBOorKxQbbNgAblL849GpG0rnxhb8pXXgVqQHCt2l0ykPVYKR5z8qC#:~:text=With%20details%20on%20the%20,238%20pages%2C%20indexed%2C%20softcover)[[27]](https://www.christianbook.com/teaching-your-child-foundations-classical-education/leigh-bortins/9780230100350/pd/10035X?srsltid=AfmBOorKxQbbNgAblL849GpG0rnxhb8pXXgVqQHCt2l0ykPVYKR5z8qC#:~:text=the%20multiplication%20tables%2C%20children%20can%27t,on%20the%20classical%20model%2C%20including)*. She provides practical methods to implement a rigorous, thorough curriculum at home using classical techniques – for example, she has chapters on reading, writing, math, geography, etc., each with tips and resources. The tone is **encouraging and down-to-earth**, mixing theory with her personal anecdotes from homeschooling four boys. As a Christian, Bortins frames education as not only academic but also character-building, though the book’s primary advice on curriculum and habits can serve any homeschooler. If you’re planning to use or mirror the Classical Conversations approach, *The Core* is a must-read. Even outside CC, many find it helpful for drilling down to “what should my young child learn first, and how do I teach it classically?” It emphasizes starting with a firm foundation – hence the title.
- ***Teaching the Trivium: Christian Homeschooling in a Classical Style*** by Harvey & Laurie Bluedorn – *Christian (Bible-centered).* The Bluedorns were early adopters of classical homeschooling in the evangelical Christian community. Their book, published in 2001, takes a somewhat different approach than *The Well-Trained Mind*. It’s part philosophy (arguing why Christians should prefer classical education, with lots of scripture references) and part practical (with an emphasis on delaying formal academics a bit – they advocate not starting formal grammar until age 10, for example, focusing on reading aloud and oral language in early years). They also strongly encourage learning **Biblical Greek and Hebrew** in addition to Latin. This book is useful for parents who want to integrate a **strongly faith-driven approach** with classical elements, or who are worried that classical education might neglect the Bible – the Bluedorns show you can do both. It’s less of a grade-by-grade curriculum guide and more of a collection of essays, schedules, and resource lists. Keep in mind it has a conservative Christian tone (for instance, they discuss shielding children from certain content until they’re mature). For an independent homeschooling parent wanting to ensure *God remains at the center* of a classical curriculum, this is an encouraging resource.
- ***Classical Education: The Movement Sweeping America*** by Gene Edward Veith Jr. & Andrew Kern – *Christian.* This book gives a broad overview of the resurgence of classical education (especially in Christian circles). It’s not a “how-to” manual for homeschooling but rather an explanation of what classical education is, why modern education has strayed from it, and how a return to classical principles is benefiting students. Veith and Kern share stories from both classical schools and homeschools, making the case that classical education produces superior outcomes in critical thinking, cultural literacy, and virtue. They outline the Trivium and subjects like **music, art, literature**, showing how they contribute to the formation of a student’s soul. For a parent who needs some conviction or wants to understand the “why” deeply (perhaps to explain it to skeptical friends or family), this is a great read. It’s relatively short and very readable. It will resonate most with those of a Christian worldview, but even a secular reader can appreciate the critique of progressive education and the championing of time-tested learning.
- **Other Notable Mentions:** There are many more resources, but a few that often come up for parent reading include:
- *The Lost Tools of Learning* by Dorothy Sayers – actually an essay (1947) that sparked the modern classical education movement. Sayers humorously and insightfully argues for the Trivium-based approach, matching learning stages to child development. It’s free to read online and worth the 20 minutes it takes – you’ll understand where the terminology of “grammar, logic, rhetoric stages” came from.
- *Norms and Nobility* by David Hicks – a dense but profound book (1981) often cited by classical educators. It’s more philosophical, discussing what it means to educate for virtue (“norms”) and how classical curriculum nurtures nobility of mind and character. This is more for the enthusiast or someone involved in schooling, as it can be heavy reading, but it’s full of quotable insights.
- *The Liberal Arts Tradition* by Kevin Clark & Ravi Jain – a newer book that expands the classical model beyond the Trivium, re-incorporating the Quadrivium (mathematical arts) and emphasizing things like music, philosophy, theology in a holistic curriculum. It’s semi-academic, aimed at educators (many classical schools use it for teacher training). Ambitious homeschooling parents interested in the theoretical framework will find it rewarding.
- *Consider This: Charlotte Mason and the Classical Tradition* by Karen Glass – an interesting read if you’ve heard of Charlotte Mason (a British educator) and wondered how her ideas intersect with classical education. This book argues that Mason’s methods (lots of living books, nature study, narration) complement the classical goals. It’s great for parents attracted to a gentler approach but who still want the structure of classical education.
- *Latin-Centered Curriculum* by Andrew Campbell – for those particularly keen on the language aspect, this book makes the case that focusing heavily on Latin (and Greek) will naturally bring forth excellence in other areas. It provides a model schedule with Latin as the core around which other subjects revolve. While somewhat niche, it’s inspiring for language-loving families and offers an alternative emphasis compared to more history-centered classical programs.

In essence, parents have a **wealth of literature** to guide them. Whether you prefer a **detailed plan (like WTM) or a** big-picture vision (like Veith/Kern) **or a** devotional approach (like Bluedorns)**, there’s a guide out there for you. These books often reference each other and many authors are part of the same circles, so after a couple of them you’ll start seeing the common themes (trivium, great books, virtue, etc.). They’ll not only help you map out curricula and daily schedules, but also keep you** inspired and informed** on your classical education journey.

## 5. Tutors and Professional Support Services for Classical Subjects

Teaching classical subjects—particularly Latin and Greek, as well as formal logic and rhetoric—can be challenging for parents if they haven’t learned those subjects themselves. Fortunately, there are tutors and professional services that specialize in classical content, available both locally and online. Here’s how you can get help in these areas:

- **Online Classical Tutors & Courses (Latin/Greek Focus):** A number of organizations offer live tutoring or small classes in Latin, Greek, and other classical disciplines. One renowned example is **The Lukeion Project** – an online academy founded by classical scholars that provides **live, interactive courses in Classical Latin and Ancient Greek (up to very advanced levels), as well as related subjects like classical literature, history, and even rhetoric**[*[28]](https://www.homeschoollatinhelp.com/lukeion-latin-project-online-course/#:~:text=Lukeion%20Latin%20Project%20Online%20Course,translation%2C%20history%2C%20philosophy%2C%20rhetoric%2C)[[29]](https://www.homeschool.com/resource-guide/the-lukeion-project/#:~:text=The%20Lukeion%20Project%20,Philosophy%2C%20AP%20English%20Literature)*. Lukeion employs experienced instructors (often with M.A./Ph.D. in Classics) and has been operating since 2005. The courses are known for being rigorous and **mastery-based**, aimed at college-preparatory excellence[*[30]](https://www.lukeion.org/#:~:text=The%20Lukeion%20Project%20offers%20Classical,experience%20using%20unique%20tools%20to)[[31]](https://www.lukeion.org/#:~:text=Why%20Add%20Classics%20to%20Your,Educational%20Program)*. For example, Lukeion offers Latin I through Latin VI (covering AP® Latin by year 4 and beyond) and Greek I through VII, meaning a student can continue classical language study beyond the AP level, reading actual ancient authors in the original[*[32]](https://www.lukeion.org/latin.html#:~:text=Lukeion%20Latin%20The%20Lukeion%20Project,wide%20variety%20of%20educational%20goals)[[33]](https://www.lukeion.org/uploads/9/8/2/9/98299716/2024-25_academic_catalog_final-081424.pdf#:~:text=,high%20school%20level%20for%20both)*. They also teach informal “word roots” workshops for younger kids, literature in translation (like mythology courses), and logic/critical thinking electives. Students anywhere can register à la carte. This is a fantastic resource if you as a parent don’t know Latin/Greek – you can outsource that subject to Lukeion and be confident your child is getting expert instruction (with homework, assessments, etc.). Classes meet live weekly; the rest is independent work. They even cater to different learning styles with dynamic visuals and a bit of humor to keep students engaged[*[34]](https://www.lukeion.org/#:~:text=options,middle%20and%20high%20school%20years)[[35]](https://www.lukeion.org/#:~:text=teach%20students%20effectively%20,your%20supplies%20through%20this%20website)*. Other similar providers include **Schole Academy’s Latin classes** and **Memoria Press’s online classes**, but Lukeion is particularly lauded for languages.
- **Classical Learning Resource Center (CLRC):** CLRC is another online platform offering **classes and tutoring in classical subjects**. They have a comprehensive Latin program for elementary through high school, using either traditional or immersive methodologies[*[36]*](https://www.clrconline.com/classical-latin/#:~:text=CLRC%20Latin%20classes%20are%20offered,Catullus%2C%20Horace%2C%20Ovid%2C%20and%20others). They prepare students for exams like the National Latin Exam and AP Latin, and even offer dual-enrollment college credit for advanced Latin reading courses[*[36]*](https://www.clrconline.com/classical-latin/#:~:text=CLRC%20Latin%20classes%20are%20offered,Catullus%2C%20Horace%2C%20Ovid%2C%20and%20others). CLRC also offers **Classical Greek** (from beginner through advanced), **formal Logic and Rhetoric courses**, **Great Books discussions**, and other subjects like History, Literature, and even Math and Modern Languages, all taught from a classical perspective (many instructors have backgrounds in classical Christian education). You can either enroll in classes or arrange for one-on-one tutoring through CLRC. Notably, CLRC is friendly to homeschoolers and is used by some **Orthodox Christian homeschool communities** as well (they offer a few Orthodox Christian studies courses), but their academic courses themselves are generally secular in content (aside from their explicitly Christian studies offerings). They emphasize deep understanding, such as **grammar mastery in Latin, rich reading of Latin authors**, and logical thinking. If a student needs extra help, say in Latin translation or logic proofs, CLRC’s **tutoring services** can pair them with an expert. This can be a lifesaver if you hit a tough spot in Latin III and need someone to explain the subjunctive mood!
- **One-on-One Tutors (Local or Online Marketplaces):** Beyond organized programs, there are many individual tutors who specialize in Latin, Greek, or other classical areas. Some places to find them:
- **Tutor Marketplaces:** Websites like **Wyzant**, **com**, or **UniversityTutor** allow you to search for tutors by subject. You can often find graduate students or teachers of Classics willing to tutor Latin or Greek online. Verify their background (e.g., a tutor who majored in Classics or taught at a school) and look for reviews.
- **College Classics Departments:** If you live near a college or university with a Classics department, reach out – often, advanced undergraduates or graduate students will tutor high schoolers in Latin/Greek for a reasonable hourly fee. Some universities even have programs to connect with the community. This in-person tutoring can be great for an independent learner who just needs a weekly check-in or help with translations.
- **Local Homeschool Networks:** In areas with active homeschool groups, sometimes a parent with expertise or a retired teacher will offer classes or tutoring. E.g., a Latin tutor might hold a small class in her home for homeschool teens, or a local co-op might have a teacher you can hire for extra sessions. Tap into your community via Facebook groups or homeschool association newsletters.
- **Classical Conversations Tutors:** In CC, the term “tutor” refers to the parent leading the weekly classes. Some of those tutors (especially Challenge level directors) are quite skilled in Latin or logic and might be open to private tutoring outside of community day. It doesn’t hurt to ask around within any classical co-op or CC community if anyone tutors on the side.
- **Online Language Tutors:** There are also services like italki or Preply which are known for finding foreign language tutors (more for spoken languages), where occasionally you might find someone offering Latin tutoring. Latin being less spoken, it’s rarer on those sites, but there are a few (especially tutors from Europe, or priests/seminarians proficient in Latin).

When working one-on-one, the experience can be tailored exactly to the student’s needs – whether it’s drilling Latin declensions, practicing rhetorical speech delivery, or discussing a Plato text. Independent learners who want to go faster or deeper in a subject often thrive with a mentor guiding them. For example, a teen excited about Greek philosophy could hire a tutor to read **Aristotle’s Ethics** together weekly, far beyond what a typical high school offers.

- **Rhetoric and Writing Coaches:** Classical education values good writing and speaking. If a parent feels unsure how to critique their student’s essays or coach their oratory, they can seek a specialist. Some online academies (WTMA, Schole, etc.) offer **writing tutoring or composition classes**. There are also freelance editors who focus on teaching writing to teens – for instance, **The Well-Trained Mind Academy** offers a writing assessment service and one-on-one writing tutors for various levels[*[2]](https://www.wtmacademy.com/#:~:text=The%20Well,passion%20for%20helping%20students%20excel)[[37]](https://www.wtmacademy.com/#:~:text=Course%20Formats)*. For speech, if not in a club, a student could work with a coach (sometimes drama teachers or debate alumni offer public speaking tutoring). Even recording a speech and sending to a knowledgeable mentor for feedback can be beneficial. Some classical organizations host **rhetoric workshops or camps** in the summer where students get intensive practice – those can be golden opportunities (e.g., the Institute for Cultural Communicators and others do this in Christian circles).
- **Math and Science in a Classical Context:** While math and science are not uniquely “classical” (except for the historical approach, like Euclid’s Elements in geometry), classical homeschoolers sometimes seek help to ensure strong STEM skills too. Many general tutor services (like Kumon centers or math tutors) are available, but a few classical programs integrate these subjects classically. For example, **Novare Science** (by John Mays) is a curriculum that classical schools use; while they may not have tutoring services directly, being aware of the curriculum can help you find a tutor who’s familiar with it. Some classical high schools teach science through a historical lens – if you want a tutor aligned with that, you might search for one who has taught using the **Great Books approach to science** (like reading Newton, Galileo firsthand). These are niche requests; typically, a standard science/math tutor works fine even if you’re a classical family, as long as they respect your student reading Euclid or doing logic puzzles as part of their learning.
- **Professional Teacher Services from Curriculum Providers:** Certain homeschool curricula providers offer grading or teacher support for a fee. For instance, **Mother of Divine Grace School (MODG)** is a Catholic classical homeschool program where enrolled families can opt for a “Teacher Assisted” option – certified teachers will grade assignments, give feedback, and even meet with the student periodically. Similarly, Kolbe Academy (mentioned above) and Seton Home Study (Catholic, semi-classical) have teacher support services. **Memoria Press** offers an online academy (Memoria Academy) and also sells lesson plans for homeschool with the option to enroll in their **“Sodalitas” support groups** or forums to ask questions. These aren’t one-on-one tutors in the traditional sense, but they act as a safety net for parents schooling at home. If you purchase a full curriculum, having an expert grade your child’s Latin translations or history papers can ensure you’re on track. It’s worth checking if the curriculum you’re using has this kind of support.

In summary, no parent should feel that a lack of Latin or logic background is a deal-breaker for classical education. There is a robust support ecosystem, from **dedicated online programs like Lukeion and CLRC (bringing top-notch classical teachers to your home) to freelance tutors and community resources**. Many families mix-and-match: perhaps using an online class for Latin, hiring a local tutor for math, and handling other subjects themselves. With today’s connectivity, even rare skills like ancient Greek are teachable via Zoom. The key for independent learners is to seek help when needed – a short stint with a good tutor can prevent frustrations and keep the love of learning alive. And as students get older, these mentors can also inspire them towards classical fields in college (e.g., a great Latin tutor might encourage a student to minor in Classics). The investment in expert help often pays off in the student’s proficiency and enthusiasm.

## 6. Networks of Tutors and Classical Learning Communities (Homeschool Support & Hybrid Models)

Classical education has given rise to various **networks and communities** designed to support families, especially homeschooling families or those in hybrid situations. Some we’ve touched on (Classical Conversations, Scholé Communities), but here we’ll highlight how these networks function and other resources for building community and finding tutors in a broader sense:

- **Classical Conversations (CC) Communities:** CC is not just a curriculum, it’s a network of local communities (over 2,500 communities worldwide). Each community meets weekly and is led by parent-tutors, but importantly they are connected by the larger CC infrastructure – there are training events, online forums, and standardized materials across communities. If a family moves, they can usually plug into a new CC group on the same cycle. CC also hosts regional and national events (like academic competitions, “Memory Master” contests, etc.). The **community aspect** means families support each other – older students might help younger, parents swap teaching tips, and there’s a built-in social group for kids. CC’s motto is equipping parents to be great educators, and indeed many parents say they “learn alongside their kids” in the program[*[15]*](https://classicalconversations.com/#:~:text=Classical%20Conversations%20empowers%20you%20to,the%20way%20children%20naturally%20learn). This network has a Christian mission at its core, so families seeking secular community might look elsewhere. But even secular classical homeschoolers can learn from CC’s model (some have created secular analogues or simply join other general co-ops). CC requires membership fees and class fees (and you must usually use their materials), but the value is in **having a consistent support system**. It addresses the isolation that can sometimes come with independent homeschooling by creating a tight-knit group “doing life together”[*[38]*](https://classicalconversations.com/#:~:text=We%20believe%20education%20is%20best,an%20extra%20hand%20running%20errands). In addition, CC has an online presence (like *CC Connected* for sharing resources) and even an accredited high school option (through *Classical Conversations Plus* in partnership with colleges). In short, CC functions as a tutor network in that the local tutors are trained by CC and follow a common methodology, making a huge pool of experienced classical educators accessible to families around the country.
- **Scholé Communities:** These are essentially an alternative network to CC, developed by Classical Academic Press. A Scholé Community is usually smaller and may be more fluid in its curriculum (CAP provides suggested curricula and resources, but communities have some leeway). What unifies them is the philosophy of “Scholé” – learning with contemplative leisure, not frantic cramming. They often include both students and parents in learning (for example, the group might have a parent book discussion while kids have a class). Scholé Communities can register with CAP, which gives them access to certain resources, a listing in the directory[*[39]*](https://scholecommunities.com/#:~:text=Joining%20an%20existing%20Schol%C3%A9%20Community,out%20to%20your%20local%20community), and use of the **ClassicalU** training for their tutors/parents. Many Scholé groups meet in church facilities or homes. They might only meet biweekly or follow a relaxed co-op schedule (e.g., 3 ten-week terms instead of a full 30-week school year). Because they are **committed to being “restful, classical, communal”**[*[18]](https://scholecommunities.com/#:~:text=Restful%20Learning)[[40]](https://scholecommunities.com/#:~:text=Image%3A%20leaf%20representing%20restful%20homeschooling)*, families find them a refreshing antidote to the pressure that can come with rigorous academics – yet they still deliver solid classical content. The network aspect means if you start a Scholé group, you’re not alone: you can connect with other leaders, share ideas on the Scholé blog, and even do combined activities with nearby Scholé communities. Also, as noted earlier, **Scholé Academy online classes** can supplement what you do in person[*[41]*](https://scholecommunities.com/#:~:text=Restful%2C%20Classical%20Learning%20Online). So if your local Scholé group doesn’t have a calculus teacher, a teen could take math through Scholé Academy and everything meshes philosophically. This kind of hybrid support (local + online) is increasingly common in classical circles.
- **Classical Tutor Consortiums (Marketplaces):** A newer development is the creation of **online marketplaces for classical educators**. **Kepler Education** is one such platform: it’s described as a *consortium of independent teachers* using an online system to offer classes to students (mainly targeting homeschooling junior high and high school students)[*[42]*](https://romanroadspress.com/live-classes/?srsltid=AfmBOoo4Xuz3zxyoFjbYu7sO_FQ5SnwqnMB_T1jqSl8yNo7CYKfy4v9v#:~:text=Kepler%20is%20a%20consortium%20of,high%20and%20high%20school%20students). Think of it like a marketplace where you can pick a teacher and course that fits your student’s needs, rather than enrolling in a single school. For instance, on Kepler you might find five different Latin II classes taught by five different instructors – each with a slightly different style or schedule. Parents choose which one (if any) fits their philosophy or their child’s learning style. Kepler emphasizes **parental control and teacher freedom**, aligning with the classical homeschool ethos that parents are the primary educators and should customize their child’s program[*[43]*](https://romanroadspress.com/live-classes/?srsltid=AfmBOoo4Xuz3zxyoFjbYu7sO_FQ5SnwqnMB_T1jqSl8yNo7CYKfy4v9v#:~:text=Kepler%20is%20a%20Marketplace%20for,Live%20Online%20Classical%20Christian%20Classes). It is also explicitly Christian (teachers have statements of faith visible, and most courses integrate a Christian worldview). However, the range of courses is huge – beyond core subjects, there might be electives like “Medieval Philosophy” or “Poetry of the Psalms” depending on teachers’ expertise. This model essentially creates a network of tutors (the teachers) accessible to anyone in the country (or world). Another example is the *Classes by Veritas Press* (Veritas Press has their own platform, but they also allow à la carte enrollment similar to a marketplace) and *Outschool* (not classical-specific, but one can find some independent tutors offering Latin or mythology classes there as well). For independent learners, these marketplaces are gold mines: a student can craft a full schedule by cherry-picking courses from various teachers, often ending up with a more tailored education than any single school could provide. And parents retain oversight, mixing and matching as desired.
- **Hybrid and Microschool Networks:** We touched on microschools earlier; here, consider networks that support their formation. One secular example is **Prisma** (an online-mediated microschool network) and one faith-based example is **Exodus Academy** (which seems to be a Christian microschool startup network in some areas). While not all are strictly classical, there are likely families within those networks using classical curricula. If you find a like-minded pod or microschool through such networks, it can operate almost like a shared tutor group – e.g., maybe four families hire a tutor together for high school humanities seminars, effectively creating a mini classical class. There is also the **University-Model Schools International (UMSI)** organization which many hybrid schools join; some of those are classical in curriculum. For Catholic families, the **Regina Caeli Academy** network functions across the U.S. so if you join RCA, you plug into a larger system (with standardized curriculum and even an annual gala/meet-up in some cases). On a smaller scale, local support groups (like a state’s classical homeschool association) can connect you to tutors or microschools. In essence, these networks provide the *infrastructure and community* to make homeschooling less isolated and tutoring more collaborative.
- **The Society for Classical Learning (SCL) and CiRCE Institute:** These are more aimed at educators than students, but they indirectly benefit homeschooling parents and cooperatives by training tutors/teachers and fostering community. The **Society for Classical Learning** is a fellowship primarily of classical school teachers and leaders (mostly Christian, including charter folks too) that offers conferences, webinars, and an online job board. If you are looking for a classical tutor or teacher to hire (for a co-op or micro-school), networking through SCL could help find someone. The **CiRCE Institute** (founded by Andrew Kern) certifies teachers in the “CiRCE apprenticeship” – some homeschool parents take this training and then may offer tutoring services as “CiRCE certified” classical educators. CiRCE also has an online list of **recommended tutors**/consultants and a social media presence where one could ask for referrals. Both SCL and CiRCE have regional cohorts – attending a conference might connect you with a tutor in your area or at least give you leads. They also produce *content* (podcasts, blogs) that keep the classical community connected and encouraged. While not a “tutor network” in the direct sense, these organizations strengthen the ecosystem that independent learners rely on.
- **Curriculum Provider Communities:** Some curriculum publishers cultivate user communities which can function as informal support networks. For example, **Ambleside Online** (though Charlotte Mason, not strictly classical) has forums where users help each other. **The Well-Trained Mind Forums** (hosted on welltrainedmind.com) is a popular place where thousands of parents (classical and otherwise) discuss curricula, challenges, and often swap tutoring advice. You might find a recommendation for an online logic course or a Latin tutor in those discussions. **Memoria Press** has an online community especially through their forum and Facebook groups (they also host an annual conference where homeschoolers mingle with classical school teachers). **Classical Conversations** has local Facebook groups and larger groups where people sometimes post looking for a math tutor or selling used materials. Tapping into these networks, even if you’re not using their exact curriculum, can yield help. Classical homeschoolers are generally eager to share resources – it’s in the collegial spirit of the pursuit of truth.

In conclusion, while the image of classical homeschooling might be an isolated child reading Latin by candlelight, the reality today is that **community and support are readily available** through various networks. Whether you formally join a program like CC or just informally connect with other classical educators online, you are not alone. These tutor networks and communities ensure that families can find guidance, encouragement, and expertise when needed. By engaging with them, independent learners get the benefits of a **larger “school” community** while still enjoying the freedom and intimacy of homeschooling. Classical education, after all, is a tradition passed down through generations – by joining these communities, you and your children become part of that living tradition, learning alongside others “in pursuit of truth, goodness, and beauty.”

## Classical Education in Higher Education (Beyond K–12)

While the focus of this overview is K–12, it’s worth mentioning that the classical model continues into colleges and universities for those interested:

A number of American colleges offer **Great Books programs or liberal arts curricula** that mirror classical education ideals. For example, **St. John’s College** (with campuses in Annapolis, MD, and Santa Fe, NM) is famous for its Great Books program – all students, regardless of major, read and discuss the classic works of Western civilization (and some Eastern) in small seminar classes over four years. There are no traditional majors; the idea is a unified classical liberal arts education (including studying Ancient Greek, learning geometry from Euclid, etc.). A secular institution, St. John’s has been doing this since the 1930s and attracts many classically homeschooled students.

Several faithfully Catholic colleges also use a Great Books approach, such as **Thomas Aquinas College** in California & Massachusetts and **Wyoming Catholic College** in Wyoming – both require all students to follow a prescribed curriculum of theology, philosophy, literature, Latin, and more (with TAC reading many of the same texts as St. John’s but through a Catholic lens, and Wyoming Catholic even incorporating outdoor leadership as a modern “virtue training”). **New Saint Andrews College** in Idaho is a Protestant Christian liberal arts college heavily influenced by classical Christian education; it’s small and has a rigorous curriculum including Latin, classical music, logic, etc.

Additionally, some mainstream universities have honors programs that emulate classical learning. For instance, **Hillsdale College** in Michigan, while offering conventional majors, has core requirements steeped in classical learning (all students study the Western Heritage, U.S. Constitution, a foreign language, and often read Great Books in core courses). Hillsdale is also notable for its public outreach – free online courses on classics and history, and as mentioned, its role in K–12 charter schools. **University of Dallas** (Catholic) and **Gonzaga University’s Honors Program** are other examples where undergrads engage deeply with the Great Books and classical languages alongside their degrees.

For students who want to become classical educators themselves, there are now graduate programs as well. **Hillsdale College** launched a graduate school of classical education (for M.A. degrees focused on training teachers and administrators in classical schools). **Templeton Honors College at Eastern University** offers a Master’s in Classical Teaching. **Memoria College** (affiliated with Memoria Press) offers an online M.A. in Classical Education. These programs recognize the growth of the movement and aim to produce the next generation of classical teachers.

In short, the journey doesn’t have to end at 12th grade. Many classical homeschoolers or charter graduates find a comfortable home at liberal arts colleges where conversing about Aristotle over lunch is the norm. And even if a student chooses a modern university for STEM or other pursuits, their classical background will serve them well. The **habits of mind** cultivated (critical thinking, eloquent writing, broad cultural awareness) are highly prized in higher ed. Parents exploring K–12 classical options can take heart that this model lays a superb foundation for college, and if desired, students can continue in a classical environment through higher education and even into careers in academia, law, public service, or any field that values well-rounded, articulate thinkers.

**Conclusion:** From online academies and charter schools to co-ops, clubs, and self-help books, the classical education landscape in the U.S. is rich and varied. Families can choose a fully secular path or a faith-integrated one, or blend the two as needed. Key differences often come down to **worldview (secular vs. Christian), structure (institutional school vs. homeschool vs. hybrid), and level of parent involvement.** There are classical options suitable for almost every situation: urban or rural, full-time work-at-home parents or stay-at-home parents, gifted students or those with learning challenges (yes, there’s even a movement for **classical education for special needs** called “Simply Classical”).

Crucially, the classical model is about *forming a learner for life*. So even independent learners can thrive by using these resources in combination – perhaps attending a charter school but supplementing with a Latin club, or homeschooling independently but taking an online logic class and meeting with a weekly co-op. The resources listed in each category above provide starting points with **official websites and organizations** to explore. As you delve in, you’ll likely discover an enthusiastic community of fellow parents and educators ready to help, because one thing about classical education is that it creates a fellowship – all of us reading the same great stories and wrestling with big ideas tend to enjoy discussing and sharing them!

By leveraging the options in this guide, you can craft a classical education journey that fits your family’s needs, ensuring your children grow not just in knowledge, but in wisdom and virtue – the timeless goals of classical learning.

# Classical Education for Elite Boys (1500s–1800s)

**Classical education** in early modern Europe and the United States was an educational paradigm centered on the languages, literature, and values of ancient Greece and Rome. It was predominantly reserved for elite boys and aimed to cultivate learned, virtuous gentlemen equipped for leadership in church, state, or intellectual life. Formal instruction typically began in childhood (often around age 7 in many regions[*[1]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_school#:~:text=Students%20often%20studied%20in%20Latin,could%20stay%20in%20school%2C%20although)) and progressed through a rigorous curriculum of Latin and (later or more rarely) Greek, with liberal arts subjects built on this linguistic foundation. The Renaissance humanist movement had rekindled the ideal that by mastering classical languages and texts, students would absorb the civic virtues and wisdom of antiquity[*[2]*](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1583/education-in-the-elizabethan-era/#:~:text=The%20universities%20were%20organised%20as,classical%20texts%20the%20civic%20values). Across different countries – whether in Britain’s grammar schools, France’s collèges, Germany’s Gymnasien, or the American colonial **Latin schools** – classical education shared common features but also varied in structure, starting age, and pedagogical style. Below is a detailed overview by region, followed by a special focus on the Jesuit model and a comparative analysis of differences and goals.

## British Education: Grammar Schools and Private Tutors

*An illustration of a traditional English grammar school classroom (19th-century depiction, similar to earlier centuries). Such classrooms, often attached to parish or town institutions, changed little from Tudor times through the 18th century, emphasizing rote learning of Latin grammar and classical texts.*

In England (and later Britain) from the 1500s through 1800s, elite boys typically received a blend of home-based tutoring and formal schooling in **grammar schools**. Formal education often began with a **petty school** or home tutor around age 5–7, where basics of reading (often using a hornbook) and religious catechism were learned[*[3]](https://www.history.com/articles/13-colonies-school#:~:text=The%20first%20law%20related%20directly,%E2%80%9CLatin%20grammar%E2%80%9D%20or%20secondary%20school)[[4]](https://www.history.com/articles/13-colonies-school#:~:text=The%20youngest%20children%2C%20ages%20five,%E2%80%9D)*. By around age 7–9, boys who excelled could move on to a Latin *grammar school*, the core institution of classical education[*[5]*](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1583/education-in-the-elizabethan-era/#:~:text=A%20boy%20who%20performed%20well,1536%20CE). At grammar school, the curriculum revolved around Latin – mastering Latin grammar, vocabulary, and translation – with some schools introducing Greek at higher levels (though Greek was taught “much more rarely” in Elizabethan times)[*[6]*](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1583/education-in-the-elizabethan-era/#:~:text=attended%20from%20around%20the%20age,1536%20CE). Classical literature (e.g. Virgil, Cicero, Homer) and the Bible (in Latin) were staple texts, occasionally supplemented by works of Renaissance humanists like Erasmus[*[6]*](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1583/education-in-the-elizabethan-era/#:~:text=attended%20from%20around%20the%20age,1536%20CE). A few advanced grammar schools or private tutors even taught **Hebrew** (especially in Puritan contexts) as a tertiary classical language[*[7]*](https://prezi.com/xffugkaalhdi/puritan-education/#:~:text=The%20grammar%20schools%20of%20the,college%20and%2C%20ultimately%2C%20for).

**Instructional methods** in British grammar schools were typically rigorous and repetitive. Boys spent long hours in school – a schedule from 16th-century England shows classes beginning at 6 AM, breaking at midday, then continuing until 4 or 5 PM[*[8]*](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1583/education-in-the-elizabethan-era/#:~:text=Classes%20began%20early%2C%20around%206,the%20lessons%20with%20the%20master). Much learning was by rote memorization of grammar rules and recitation of Latin paradigms. Translating Latin *sententiae* and classical passages back and forth between Latin and English was a daily exercise[*[9]*](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1583/education-in-the-elizabethan-era/#:~:text=Advertisement). Competition was encouraged, often underpinned by fear of punishment: discipline was strict and corporal punishment (the **birch cane**) was a routine tool to enforce diligence[*[10]](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1583/education-in-the-elizabethan-era/#:~:text=Memorising%20texts%20and%20performing%20endlessly,In%20short%2C%20education%20was)[[11]](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1583/education-in-the-elizabethan-era/#:~:text=Grammar%20school%20teachers%20were%20as,preparation%20throughout%20the%20academic%20year)*. Older boys might serve as *ushers* or assistant teachers to younger boys, reinforcing their own learning by teaching the basics to juniors[*[12]*](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1583/education-in-the-elizabethan-era/#:~:text=usually%20left%20free%20on%20Thursday,the%20lessons%20with%20the%20master). Despite occasional progressive voices (Erasmus himself questioned dull drilling methods), the prevailing approach “taught the subject and not the child,” emphasizing visible results in language mastery over gentler developmental pedagogy[*[10]*](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1583/education-in-the-elizabethan-era/#:~:text=Memorising%20texts%20and%20performing%20endlessly,In%20short%2C%20education%20was).

**Social setting and duration:** Grammar schools were often town-based and could enroll both local day students and boarders (boarders, called “tablers,” paid for meals and lodging)[*[13]*](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1583/education-in-the-elizabethan-era/#:~:text=Schools%20often%20had%20a%20mix,continued%20until%20they%20were%2018). While open in theory to any who could pay (and some endowed “free schools” existed), in practice these schools served the gentry and professional classes; girls were generally excluded beyond basic literacy. School fees (perhaps a few pence per day, adding up to £20 a year) made grammar schooling a significant expense, so only well-off families sustained a boy’s education to the upper forms[*[14]*](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1583/education-in-the-elizabethan-era/#:~:text=Schools%20often%20had%20a%20mix,continued%20until%20they%20were%2018). Students commonly left grammar school by age 14 or 15 once they had a solid grounding in Latin, though some stayed on until 17 or 18 to prepare for university entrance[*[15]*](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1583/education-in-the-elizabethan-era/#:~:text=per%20day%20but%20could%20add,continued%20until%20they%20were%2018). Outside the formal school system, wealthy families often hired **private tutors** to educate their sons at home. In fact, for the highest aristocracy (e.g. ducal or princely families), it was *preferred* that the heir be tutored privately rather than sent to any school where he might mix with lower-status boys[*[16]](https://www.paullettgolden.com/post/a-gentlemans-education#:~:text=languages%20,to%20send%20their%20heir%20or)[[17]](https://www.paullettgolden.com/post/a-gentlemans-education#:~:text=Image%3A%20Painting%20of%20two%20boys,in%20a%20tutoring%20session)*. A tutor’s curriculum for an aristocratic boy still centered on Latin and Greek, but often included modern languages (French was essential for diplomacy), history, geography, mathematics, fencing, music, and genteel accomplishments – all tailored to prepare the young noble for his future duties[*[18]*](https://www.paullettgolden.com/post/a-gentlemans-education#:~:text=Heirs%20would%20inherit%2C%20and%20thus,Instead%2C%20they%20had). The **philosophical goal** was as much about character and leadership as about academics: an heir was to learn virtue, proper manners, and the skills to manage estates and political affairs[*[18]*](https://www.paullettgolden.com/post/a-gentlemans-education#:~:text=Heirs%20would%20inherit%2C%20and%20thus,Instead%2C%20they%20had). As one account notes, the education of an heir focused on “duties and roles, virtues and morals, behavior and manners,” with scholastic studies (languages, rhetoric, etc.) seen as underpinning the ability to lead and converse effectively[*[19]*](https://www.paullettgolden.com/post/a-gentlemans-education#:~:text=Heirs%20would%20inherit%2C%20and%20thus,essentially%2C%20home%20schooled%2C%20but%20by).

By the 18th century, Britain’s elite educational pattern evolved into a combination of **boarding schools** (the famous “public schools” like Eton, Harrow, Winchester, etc.) and continued use of private tutors. The typical age of entry to boarding schools like Eton was around 13, though before the 1830s this was not standardized and many boys entered earlier or later[*[20]](https://www.paullettgolden.com/post/a-gentlemans-education#:~:text=to%20be%20,and%20promoted%20by%20the%20King)[[21]](https://www.paullettgolden.com/post/a-gentlemans-education#:~:text=the%20others,Beverly%20from%20the%20Word%20Wenches)*. (One source notes that in the Georgian era, enrollments at Eton ranged from as young as 7 or 8 up to mid-teens[*[22]*](https://www.paullettgolden.com/post/a-gentlemans-education#:~:text=the%20others,Beverly%20from%20the%20Word%20Wenches).) These schools provided a classical curriculum comparable to grammar schools – intensive Latin and Greek study remained their “bread and butter” even into the 19th century, alongside some math, literature, and eventually science[*[23]*](https://www.paullettgolden.com/post/a-gentlemans-education#:~:text=the%20advantage%20of%20their%20eldest,A%20younger%20son%20could). Discipline in 18th/19th-century English public schools was famously severe and student life spartan, aiming to build toughness and character. Indeed, by the 19th century, British classical education incorporated ideals of **character-building** (“muscular Christianity”), using sports and prefect systems to mold future imperial administrators, though those aspects were only beginning to take shape in the late 1700s. **University** was the capstone for many: Oxford and Cambridge (entirely classical in their entrance requirements and curricula) were the preserve of those aiming at the clergy or elite careers. Not all gentlemen pursued university, but those who did usually matriculated in their late teens (14–18 was common in the 16th–17th centuries[*[24]*](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1583/education-in-the-elizabethan-era/#:~:text=at%20this%20level%2C%20education%20continued,was%20the%20most%20important%20factor); by the eighteenth century, entering at 16–18 was typical). At Cambridge or Oxford, students continued with the **seven liberal arts** (grammar, rhetoric, logic, geometry, arithmetic, music, astronomy) and advanced classical studies, alongside theology or law, in courses lasting 3–4 years for a bachelor’s degree[*[25]*](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1583/education-in-the-elizabethan-era/#:~:text=carried%20out%20in%20small%20groups,Studies%20also). The guiding humanist philosophy – at both school and university – was that classical learning instilled *civic virtue* and practical wisdom. Even as studies became more secular by Elizabethan times, the idea was that knowledge of Latin and Greek authors would help form wise, moral statesmen “armed with…civic values which would allow them to best serve their careers and the state”[*[25]*](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1583/education-in-the-elizabethan-era/#:~:text=carried%20out%20in%20small%20groups,Studies%20also).

In summary, British elite education from 1500s–1800s started with early literacy at home, proceeded through Latin grammar schooling or private tutoring in youth, and culminated for some in the residential public schools and ancient universities. Throughout, the content was steeped in the Classics and the **aim was to produce well-rounded gentlemen** – fluent in classical tongues, conversant with ancient literature and history, firm in character and piety, and prepared either to govern, to serve in clergy, or simply to take their place as educated members of the ruling class.

## French Education: Collèges and Lycées for the Elite

In France during the 16th–18th centuries, classical education for boys was delivered mainly through institutions called **collèges** (not to be confused with modern “college,” these were roughly equivalent to secondary grammar schools). Many of these collèges were run by religious orders – notably the Jesuits (until their suppression in 1760s) and the Oratorians – or by Catholic dioceses and universities. Formal schooling often began a little later in France than in England; elementary instruction (in basic reading, writing, and catechism) might be obtained at a **petite école** or parish school in boyhood, but by age 10 or so talented boys of the elite would enter a *collège* for a multi-year program of Latin humanist education[*[26]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education_in_France#:~:text=By%201710%20France%20had%20about,but%20in%201789%20during%20the). By 1710, France had approximately 360 such collèges, typically **six- to eight-year programs** that enrolled boys roughly from age 10 up to 17–20[*[26]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education_in_France#:~:text=By%201710%20France%20had%20about,but%20in%201789%20during%20the). These schools collectively educated on the order of 50,000 young men – a significant but still elite fraction of the youth – in the classical curriculum[*[26]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education_in_France#:~:text=By%201710%20France%20had%20about,but%20in%201789%20during%20the).

**Curriculum and methods:** The French collège curriculum closely mirrored the pan-European humanist model. Latin was the core subject, taught through grammar drills, reading of classical authors, and composition in Latin. Students progressed through structured classes (often named **sixième, cinquième, quatrième, etc.** up to **rhétorique** and **philosophie** in the final years). Greek was taught in the upper forms of the best schools, and brilliant students would read Homer or Plato in the original. Classes in **rhetoric** (the art of persuasive speaking and writing) crowned the later years – reflecting the goal of training eloquent, learned young men. Additionally, the top class often called *philosophie* introduced basic scholastic philosophy, logic, and sometimes sciences. For example, an ordinance from Napoléon’s era (1808) fixed the lycée syllabus as including “ancient languages, history, rhetoric, logic, music, and the elements of mathematical and physical sciences”[*[27]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education_in_France#:~:text=After%20more%20than%20a%20decade,like%20discipline). This shows that by the early 19th century, even as France reformed education, Latin and Greek remained central but were supplemented by math and science. Indeed, under **Napoleon (First Empire)**, the French state re-established elite secondary schools called **lycées** (from 1802 onward) which were essentially revamped classical colleges. They taught French and classical languages plus modern subjects, and were usually boarding schools run with military-like discipline[*[27]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education_in_France#:~:text=After%20more%20than%20a%20decade,like%20discipline). The Napoleonic lycée system aimed to produce a new generation of officials and officers, combining the traditional classical studies with Enlightenment-informed sciences – a slightly broader curriculum than the old monastic collèges.

During the 17th–18th centuries, **teaching style** in French classical schools was often shaped by the Catholic pedagogy. Jesuit and Oratorian teachers were highly educated clergy who used methods outlined in the Ratio Studiorum (for Jesuit colleges) – emphasizing structured progression, frequent examinations, theatrical exercises (student debates or Latin plays), and a balance of encouragement with discipline. Memorization and recitation were as important in France as elsewhere: boys would memorize Latin vocabularies, classical orations, and versify in Latin. One hallmark of the Jesuit collèges was the use of academic **competitions and prizes** to motivate students, in addition to corporal punishment when necessary. French schools generally maintained strict discipline (the *piquet* or confinement and caning were not unknown), but Jesuit schools, in particular, prided themselves on cultivating student loyalty and piety to minimize severe punishment. Most collèges were residential or had options for boarders, bringing together sons of nobles and bourgeois from a wide region. Notably, many French collegians received scholarships (bursaries) from the school’s endowments – by 18th century, most collèges had endowments from benefactors or the Crown that could fund poor but talented boys[*[26]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education_in_France#:~:text=By%201710%20France%20had%20about,but%20in%201789%20during%20the). This indicates a commitment (at least in theory) to educating *gens de talent* regardless of wealth, although in practice the student body skewed toward the well-off and urbane.

**Starting age and length:** As mentioned, French boys typically entered a collège around age 10–12. The course length varied; some did a full eight-year course (roughly equivalent to modern secondary plus two years of advanced study), whereas others might do a shorter six-year version[*[26]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education_in_France#:~:text=By%201710%20France%20had%20about,but%20in%201789%20during%20the). It was not unusual for a boy to finish the standard humanities curriculum by around age 17 or 18. Those aiming for higher studies (university faculties of law, medicine, or theology) would continue on to those at about age 18–20. However, the French **universities** of the Old Regime were often in disarray or had a narrow focus (many were primarily for professional degrees in law/medicine). Thus, the *collège* education was in many cases the pinnacle of a young elite’s schooling – a self-contained liberal arts training. After the Revolution, the disruption of church-run schools led to a temporary vacuum (many collèges closed or lost funding when revolutionary government seized church properties in the 1790s[*[28]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education_in_France#:~:text=By%201710%20France%20had%20about,off%20properties%20because%20it%20needed)). Napoleon’s lycée system in the early 1800s restored a centralized, state-controlled classical education, ensuring that the classical tradition persisted into the 19th century albeit under secular and standardized management[*[29]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education_in_France#:~:text=After%20more%20than%20a%20decade,like%20discipline).

**Philosophical goals:** French classical education was intended to form both *good Christians* and *able public men*. In the Catholic monarchical context of the 16th–18th centuries, that meant fostering religious orthodoxy, eloquence, and knowledge of Latin culture to serve either in the Church or royal administration. An educated noble or bourgeois in France was expected to quote Latin authors, know ancient history, and uphold moral virtues extolled by classical and Christian teachings. After the Revolution, the rhetoric shifted – the state wanted education to instill **patriotism and secular virtue**, but it still leaned on classical models. For instance, revolutionary reformers like Condorcet planned universal schooling that included humanistic studies (though their plans were cut short)[*[30]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education_in_France#:~:text=Condorcet%20in%201792%20drew%20up,Condorcet%27s%20plan%20was%20not%20adopted). Napoleon explicitly geared lycées toward producing loyal, capable civil servants: the inclusion of modern sciences alongside Latin and Greek was meant to balance classical moral training with practical knowledge for bureaucracy or military. Nonetheless, the enduring **ideal of the French lycée** (which persisted through the 1800s) was a person steeped in *belles-lettres* – literature, ancient languages, philosophy – on the assumption that this formed the most rational, articulate, and morally grounded citizens[*[31]*](https://www.encyclopedia.com/children/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gymnasium-schooling#:~:text=During%20the%20nineteenth%20century%2C%20the,than%20through%20the%20German%20gymnasium). In comparison to Britain, French schools were more tightly controlled by either Church or State, and schooling had a more official role in shaping ideology (e.g. during the Third Republic late 1800s, schools became a battleground between secular republican values and Catholic traditionalism[*[32]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education_in_France#:~:text=Catholic%20and%20secular%20or%20anti,an%20emphasis%20on%20teaching%20republicanism)). But through the 1500s–1800s, despite political shifts, the content of elite education in France remained overwhelmingly classical and humanistic.

## German Education: Latin Schools and the Gymnasium Tradition

In the German-speaking lands (Holy Roman Empire and succeeding states like Prussia) from the 16th to 19th centuries, elite boys likewise followed a classical curriculum, institutionalized in the form of **Latin schools** and later the modern **Gymnasium**. The Protestant Reformation gave a strong impulse to education: Reformers like Luther and Melanchthon advocated schooling so that all (boys) could read scripture, and this led many Protestant cities and principalities to found or expand Latin schools in the 1500s. The term *Gymnasium* in this context simply meant an advanced secondary school for classical studies – analogous to grammar schools or collèges elsewhere[*[33]](https://www.encyclopedia.com/children/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gymnasium-schooling#:~:text=Two%20periods%20are%20distinguished%20in,The%20first%20truly%20Protestant)[[34]](https://www.encyclopedia.com/children/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gymnasium-schooling#:~:text=degrees%20which%20they%20would%20go,hence%20for%20the%20learned%20professions)*. The *Gymnasium* model was famously shaped by Johann Sturm’s school in Strasbourg (1538), which became a prototype blending a full Latin curriculum with elements of higher learning[*[35]*](https://www.encyclopedia.com/children/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gymnasium-schooling#:~:text=schools%2C%20after%20the%20so,a%20complete%20range%20of%20classes). Throughout the 17th–18th centuries, German **Gymnasien** (or *Akademien* in some cases) were centers of humanist learning for the urban elite and served as preparatory schools for university and the clergy.

**Structure and starting age:** A German boy destined for higher learning typically attended a local **Grundschule** or parish school in early childhood to learn reading, writing, and catechism (often from age 6 to 9). At around age 9 or 10, he would enter the Gymnasium if he showed academic promise[*[36]*](https://www.historians.org/resource/appendix-iii-history-in-the-german-gymnasia/#:~:text=The%20German%20gymnasium%2C%20whether%20the,rounded%20symmetrical%20education). The Gymnasium course was long – often around 8 or 9 years, taking the student through adolescence. By the 19th century in Prussia, the Gymnasium was formally a **nine-year course for ages ~10–18**, culminating in the *Abitur* examination (or *Maturität*), which was required for university admission[*[37]*](https://www.encyclopedia.com/children/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gymnasium-schooling#:~:text=legitimized%20by%20legislation,matriculation%20at%20a%20German%20university). (An official 1812 Prussian regulation declared that only schools titled “Gymnasium” could send students on to university, cementing the Gymnasium as the college-prep track[*[38]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(school)#:~:text=This%20use%20of%20the%20term,were%20once%20part%20of%20these).) Early on, some Latin schools were shorter or lacked upper grades, but the trend over these centuries was toward a comprehensive curriculum under one roof – by the late 18th century a Gymnasium would typically have lower grades focused on grammar and upper grades on humanities and philosophy.

**Curriculum:** Latin was the undisputed foundation. In the 1500s–1600s, students in German Latin schools would spend years drilling Latin grammar (often using the textbooks by Donatus or later *Manuel Alvares*, a standard Jesuit Latin grammar), reading classical authors, and writing compositions. Instruction was conducted largely *in Latin* – Latin was the language of academia, law, and government paperwork in many German states well into the 18th century, so fluency was essential[*[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_school#:~:text=Medieval%20%20Europe%20thought%20of,3)[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_school#:~:text=schools%20taught%20Latin%20by%20using,3)*. Greek was also taught, especially in Protestant schools where reading the New Testament in Greek was valued. However, emphasis on Greek became even stronger in the **late 18th-century “Neohumanist” movement**. German educators around 1770–1810 (figures like Wilhelm von Humboldt) championed Greek language and literature as the purest source of humanistic Bildung[*[41]](https://www.encyclopedia.com/children/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gymnasium-schooling#:~:text=During%20the%20late%20eighteenth%20century%2C,of%20the%20French%20Revolution%2C%20the)[[42]](https://www.encyclopedia.com/children/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gymnasium-schooling#:~:text=humanistic%20scope%3A%20classical%20languages%20and,completely%20new%20curriculum%2C%20including%20modern)*. Thus, while 17th-century curricula might have treated Greek as optional or second-tier, by the 19th century the *Humanistisches Gymnasium* required extensive study of both Latin and Ancient Greek (along with some Hebrew if preparing for theology). In addition to languages, the German gymnasium curriculum covered the broad liberal arts. Students studied **rhetoric, poetics, history, geography, math, and philosophy** in the upper forms. A typical 18th-century syllabus in a Gymnasium included Aristotelian logic and ethics, some geometry and astronomy (remnants of the medieval quadrivium), and perhaps elements of natural science, though classical philology dominated[*[43]*](https://www.encyclopedia.com/children/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gymnasium-schooling#:~:text=legitimized%20by%20legislation,matriculation%20at%20a%20German%20university). By the early 19th century, Prussian reforms explicitly added modern subjects: modern foreign languages (French, and later English), more mathematics, and natural sciences were introduced **alongside** the classical languages[*[43]*](https://www.encyclopedia.com/children/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gymnasium-schooling#:~:text=legitimized%20by%20legislation,matriculation%20at%20a%20German%20university). This broadened curriculum reflected an effort to create “harmonious cultivation of the mind” as Humboldt put it – combining ancient and modern knowledge to produce well-rounded graduates[*[37]*](https://www.encyclopedia.com/children/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gymnasium-schooling#:~:text=legitimized%20by%20legislation,matriculation%20at%20a%20German%20university).

**Teaching style and environment:** German gymnasia, whether Catholic or Protestant, tended to be academically rigorous and structured by class level. Teachers (often Lutheran ministers or Jesuit priests, depending on region/confession) were well-educated and the prestige of teaching was comparatively high. Class sizes could be large – one report from the late 19th century notes classes of 30–50 were common and sometimes up to 100 in lecture portions[*[44]](https://classicalu.com/wp-content/uploads/Catholic-Tradition-Six-Temp.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Teacher%20should%20be%20a,is%20to%20train%20his%20students)[[45]](https://classicalu.com/wp-content/uploads/Catholic-Tradition-Six-Temp.pdf#:~:text=before%20advancing%20to%20philosophy%20and,Purpose%20of%20Ratio%20Studiorum)*, though that source refers to Jesuit practice elsewhere, German schools too could be crowded. Methods included a mix of memorization (e.g. Latin grammar rules), **prelection** (the teacher would read and explicate a Latin text, while students listened and took notes[*[44]*](https://classicalu.com/wp-content/uploads/Catholic-Tradition-Six-Temp.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Teacher%20should%20be%20a,is%20to%20train%20his%20students)), and regular oral and written examinations. Corporal punishment was used (the cane or rod was a universal tool in early modern schooling), but 18th-century Enlightenment influence and pietist religious influence (e.g. schools like August Hermann Francke’s in Prussia) encouraged more gentle moral discipline in some places. By the 19th century, Prussian schools were supervised by state authorities who issued detailed regulations on curricula and even pedagogy – the **Lehrplan** (curriculum plan) was considered “a sacred thing” and remarkably uniform across schools[*[36]](https://www.historians.org/resource/appendix-iii-history-in-the-german-gymnasia/#:~:text=The%20German%20gymnasium%2C%20whether%20the,rounded%20symmetrical%20education)[[46]](https://www.historians.org/resource/appendix-iii-history-in-the-german-gymnasia/#:~:text=This%20symmetrical%20education%20is%20made,of%20all%20such%20influence%E2%80%94but%2C%20whatever)*. This centralization meant that in any Prussian Gymnasium, a given grade would be studying the same Latin author or math topic as another Gymnasium in a different city. Consistent with German bureaucratic organization, testing was formalized – the Abitur exam at the end tested Latin, Greek, math, etc., and only those who passed received the certificate allowing university entrance. The selectivity of the Gymnasien was notable: even by the late 1800s, only about **3%** of German youth attended a Gymnasium (and under 1% went on to university)[*[47]*](https://www.encyclopedia.com/children/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gymnasium-schooling#:~:text=The%20downfall%20of%20Latin%20as,elite%20though%20it%20admitted%20a), meaning it was an elite route primarily for sons of the educated middle class (Bildungsbürgertum) and nobility.

**Goals and ideals:** The purpose of classical education in Germany evolved over the period but consistently intertwined scholarly erudition with moral formation. In the 16th–17th centuries, the Latin school/Gymnasium was intended to train future **clergymen, jurists, and officials** – essentially to perpetuate a “learned estate” of Latin-educated leaders[*[41]*](https://www.encyclopedia.com/children/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gymnasium-schooling#:~:text=During%20the%20late%20eighteenth%20century%2C,of%20the%20French%20Revolution%2C%20the). Students were often the sons of city councillors, professors, pastors, or prosperous merchants who needed Latin for their trade. As the Enlightenment and *Neohumanismus* took hold, German educators reframed the goal as *Bildung* – the cultivation of the individual’s mind and character through contact with the great works of literature and thought[*[48]*](https://www.encyclopedia.com/children/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gymnasium-schooling#:~:text=professional%20ethic%20in%20a%20society,of%20the%20classical%20education%20was). The ancient classics, especially Greek poetry and philosophy, were seen as vehicles to develop aesthetic appreciation, critical reason, and a strong ethical compass. After the French Revolution, there was also a patriotic element: a classically-educated bourgeoisie was to become the backbone of a reformed, robust nation (this was especially true in Prussia after 1806, where educational reform was part of recovering from military defeat). Humboldt’s 1810s reforms explicitly made the Gymnasium a tool for creating enlightened citizens and able civil servants, not just clergymen. Thus by the 19th century, the **Gymnasium ideal** was that a young man spends nearly a decade in deep study of Latin, Greek, mathematics, history, etc., emerging at 18 with a “certificate of maturity” (*Abitur* literally signifies maturity) indicating both intellectual and personal maturity[*[49]*](https://www.encyclopedia.com/children/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gymnasium-schooling#:~:text=neglected,matriculation%20at%20a%20German%20university). With this formation, he could enter university to specialize or go directly into public service. To summarize, German classical education aimed to transmit the intellectual heritage of antiquity **and** to instill disciplined thinking and virtue – “the new ideals of humanity and aesthetic purity” were believed to be found in the Classics, and mastering them was the *rite of passage* into the educated class[*[50]*](https://www.encyclopedia.com/children/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gymnasium-schooling#:~:text=a%20meritocratic%20ideology,a).

It’s worth noting that by the late 1800s, Germany (and neighboring countries influenced by its model) also developed alternative schools – e.g. **Realgymnasium** (teaching Latin and modern languages but no Greek) and **Oberrealschule** (no Latin/Greek, all modern subjects) – reflecting debates over the practicality of classical studies[*[51]*](https://www.encyclopedia.com/children/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gymnasium-schooling#:~:text=curriculum%20with%20fewer%20classical%20subjects,elitist%20ideology%20of%20the%20gymnasium). However, through most of our period (1500s–1800s) the traditional classical Gymnasium held primacy, and knowledge of Latin (and often Greek) remained a hallmark of the *Bildungselite*. A student who completed this education had not only linguistic skills but also a shared cultural canon – from Caesar and Cicero to Homer and Sophocles – which was supposed to guide his ethics and civic life. In fact, well into the 19th century many German universities required proof of Latin and Greek (*Latinum* and *Graecum* certificates) for entry into fields like law, medicine, or theology[*[52]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(Germany)#:~:text=For%20certain%20subjects%2C%20such%20as,Latin%20or%20Ancient%20Greek%2C%20respectively), underscoring how classical education was intertwined with all higher learning.

## Education in Colonial and Early America: The New World Adaptation

Classical education crossed the Atlantic with the settlers and remained the standard for educating elite boys in the American colonies and early United States (17th–early 19th century). The New England Puritans, in particular, placed strong emphasis on literacy and scriptural study, which dovetailed with classical training. The very first secondary school in the English colonies, Boston Latin School (founded 1635), was a direct transplant of the English grammar school model and focused on Latin and Greek from its inception. Generally, in 17th–18th century America, **formal schooling began early** – basic reading was taught at home or in small local “dame schools” from about age 5 onward[*[53]*](https://www.history.com/articles/13-colonies-school#:~:text=by%20boiling%20the%20bark%20of,swamp%20maple). By ages 7–8, boys who were to receive advanced education might attend a *grammar school* (often called a **Latin school**). These colonial grammar schools were essentially identical in curriculum to their English counterparts: *“The curriculum was heavily weighted to Latin and Greek, plus some mathematics”*, as one summary puts it[*[54]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_Thirteen_Colonies#:~:text=Education%20in%20the%20Thirteen%20Colonies,%28Yale). Students drilled Latin grammar (using texts like Lily’s Grammar or later American reprints), read classical authors, and learned some Greek to handle the New Testament and classical Greek works. One hallmark of Puritan education was the inclusion of **Hebrew** study as well – since ministers needed to read the Old Testament in the original tongue, some grammar schools taught basic Hebrew alongside Latin and Greek[*[7]*](https://prezi.com/xffugkaalhdi/puritan-education/#:~:text=The%20grammar%20schools%20of%20the,college%20and%2C%20ultimately%2C%20for). Overall, colonial elite education was explicitly designed to prepare boys for **college (university)** and largely for the ministry. Harvard College (founded 1636) set the template: its entrance requirements in the 17th century demanded proficiency in Latin and knowledge of Greek. This standard persisted; for example, in the 18th century Harvard and other colonial colleges like Yale required applicants to be able to read classical texts in the original languages. John Adams and John Hancock, for instance, attended Harvard where “admissions required fluent reading of Cicero and ease in Latin and Greek”[*[55]*](https://www.usconstitution.net/classical-influence-on-founding-fathers/#:~:text=Princeton%29). In practice, this meant a boy headed for Harvard would, by his mid-teens, be reading authors like Vergil, Cicero, and the Greek gospels in school (or with a tutor). Indeed, many Founding Fathers had intense classical training: Alexander Hamilton, entering King’s College (Columbia) in 1773, could already read several of Cicero’s orations and Virgil’s *Aeneid* in Latin and translate the Gospel of John from Greek[*[56]*](https://www.usconstitution.net/classical-influence-on-founding-fathers/#:~:text=Classical%20Education%20of%20the%20Founding,Fathers); James Madison had read deeply in Latin literature (Virgil, Horace, Tacitus, etc.) before attending Princeton[*[57]*](https://www.usconstitution.net/classical-influence-on-founding-fathers/#:~:text=Thomas%20Jefferson%27s%20early%20training%20in,now%20Princeton).

**Educational institutions:** In New England, towns were mandated (by laws such as Massachusetts’ 1647 “Old Deluder Satan Act”) to establish a grammar school once they reached a certain size[*[3]*](https://www.history.com/articles/13-colonies-school#:~:text=The%20first%20law%20related%20directly,%E2%80%9CLatin%20grammar%E2%80%9D%20or%20secondary%20school). These were usually all-male schools aimed at preparing local boys for Harvard or for leadership. Such grammar schools were typically small (perhaps one master and a handful of pupils) and funding was a mix of town funds and tuition. The History.com article notes that in colonial Massachusetts, a town grammar school charged tuition, but sometimes accepted payment in kind (goods) and often relied on local taxes or charity for support[*[58]](https://www.history.com/articles/13-colonies-school#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIn%20the%20colonial%20era%2C%20all,it%20could%20go%2C%E2%80%9D%20says%20Janek)[[59]](https://www.history.com/articles/13-colonies-school#:~:text=In%20Massachusetts%20towns%2C%20tuition%20at,or%20be%20fined%204%20shillings)*. In the Middle Colonies (New York, Pennsylvania, etc.), education was more often provided by church-run or private academies, and had a bit more diversity (including some practical subjects) due to influences of Quakers and others, but classical learning was still a marker of the elite. In the South, formal schools were fewer; planter families often hired **private tutors** for their sons or sent them to England for schooling. For instance, George Washington did not attend a grammar school long (his formal education was limited), but wealthy Virginians like Thomas Jefferson studied under tutors (Jefferson learned Latin, Greek, and French from clergyman tutors in his youth[*[60]](https://www.memoriapress.com/articles/classical-education-founding-fathers/?srsltid=AfmBOookjtnUmnrkmxADGGZgOEa9KzxBXiv1i949vgmqxypFd6gezmdQ#:~:text=Cothran%20www,a%20classical%20academy%20in)[[57]](https://www.usconstitution.net/classical-influence-on-founding-fathers/#:~:text=Thomas%20Jefferson%27s%20early%20training%20in,now%20Princeton)*). Several Southern colonies eventually founded colleges (e.g. the College of William & Mary in 1693, King’s College in New York in 1754, etc.), and to feed these, private academies or “colleges” (meaning secondary schools) were established in the 18th century. By the **early U.S. (post-1776)** period, there was a proliferation of academy-style schools (often called “Latin academies” or just academies) which combined classical curricula with some newer subjects. For example, Benjamin Franklin in mid-18th century advocated for an Academy in Philadelphia that would teach English, modern subjects, and classical languages – reflecting some push to broaden education. But the dominant expectation remained that any boy aspiring to the higher professions must study Latin and Greek in his youth.

**Curriculum and methods in colonial schools:** A contemporary description of a colonial Latin school would closely resemble that of an English grammar school. The **New England Primer** and Bible were used in early reading education for basic literacy[*[61]*](https://www.history.com/articles/13-colonies-school#:~:text=The%20petty%20schools%20taught%20reading%2C,learning%20popular%20at%20the%20time). Once in grammar school, the boy plunged into Latin. Typical routine: memorizing Latin grammar rules (perhaps from Cheever’s Latin Accidence), reciting conjugations and declensions, translating Latin sentences to English and back. Canings for mistakes were common – Puritan schoolmasters were as strict as their Old World counterparts, if not more so. An observer noted that in these schools, “students would mostly memorize and recite passages” – rote learning was the order of the day[*[61]*](https://www.history.com/articles/13-colonies-school#:~:text=The%20petty%20schools%20taught%20reading%2C,learning%20popular%20at%20the%20time). School days were long when farm work didn’t intervene (though outside of towns, many pupils attended only part-time, especially in planting or harvest seasons)[*[62]*](https://www.history.com/articles/13-colonies-school#:~:text=New%20England%20petty%20schools%20were,up%20where%20they%20left%20off). By the late teens, a diligent student would have read portions of classical histories, poetry, and orations. For those headed to college, there was an expectation to also grasp some **basic arithmetic and geometry**, though many college entrants in the 1700s had only rudimentary math compared to their fluency in Latin. Notably, the **philosophical and civic goals** of American classical education mirrored the European: New England Puritans saw it as essential for raising knowledgeable clergymen and magistrates who could govern morally. Literacy was cast as a religious duty (“for Puritans, reading was a religious duty” because it enabled Bible study[*[63]*](https://www.history.com/articles/13-colonies-school#:~:text=For%20Puritans%2C%20Reading%20Was%20a,Religious%20Duty)). This religious imperative fueled the establishment of schools at a higher rate in New England than elsewhere. By the Revolutionary period, classical schooling also took on a patriotic dimension. The American Founders believed that understanding Greek and Roman history and republican ideals was vital to building the new nation. They consciously drew lessons from antiquity: for instance, the Federalist Papers assumed readers knew references to ancient republics, and the likes of Madison and Hamilton invoked Greek and Roman examples in political debate[*[64]*](https://www.usconstitution.net/classical-influence-on-founding-fathers/#:~:text=The%20Founding%20Fathers%20drew%20direct,an%20understanding%20of%20these%20allusions). Thus, a classical education was seen as cultivating **civic virtue** – the ideal of the citizen who, like a Roman senator or Athenian citizen, could put the common good first. Thomas Jefferson argued for broad liberal education to nurture an informed citizenry, saying that an educated and virtuous populace was the only safe guardian of the American republic[*[65]*](https://www.usconstitution.net/classical-influence-on-founding-fathers/#:~:text=itself%20to%20safeguard%20liberty). In practice, of course, only the male gentry received full classical schooling; women and lower-class boys had very limited access to advanced education in this era.

By the early 19th century, the United States slowly began to diversify curricula (the rise of public schools and West Point’s focus on engineering, for example, introduced more math/science). But well into the 1800s, the old classical model dominated preparatory education. The Ivy League colleges required Latin and Greek for admission until late in the 19th century. An anecdote: as late as 1828, Yale issued a famous report defending the classical curriculum as the best way to discipline the mind, highlighting the staying power of Latin and Greek in American elite education. In sum, colonial and early U.S. education for elite boys was a transplant of European classical schooling with a Puritan and later republican flavor – it aimed to produce learned ministers, lawyers, and statesmen steeped in the Classics and capable of both moral leadership and intellectual discourse.

Jesuit colleges similarly often provided personalized instruction to noble youth, aiming to form both their intellect and character (Richard Wilson, public domain).*

No discussion of classical education in 1500s–1800s is complete without examining the **Jesuits**, whose teaching institutions set the gold standard (and sometimes the lightning rod for controversy) in early modern education. The Society of Jesus (Jesuits), a Catholic order founded in 1540, rapidly became renowned for its network of colleges across Catholic Europe (and beyond). By leveraging a highly organized pedagogy – codified in the *Ratio atque Institutio Studiorum Societatis Iesu* of 1599 (known as the *Ratio Studiorum*) – the Jesuits established hundreds of schools that educated the sons of the Catholic elites (and often talented commoners) in a rigorous classical curriculum[*[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_Studiorum#:~:text=The%20Society%20of%20Jesus%20had,desire%20for%20a%20standard%20plan)[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_Studiorum#:~:text=The%20Ratio%20was%20a%20collection,mathematics%2C%20and%20the%20natural%20sciences)*. One hundred years after their founding, the Jesuits were running over 400 schools; by 1739, some **669 Jesuit institutions** were in operation worldwide[*[66]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_Studiorum#:~:text=The%20Society%20of%20Jesus%20had,desire%20for%20a%20standard%20plan), a testament to their pervasive role in education.

**Curriculum and structure:** Jesuit colleges were typically secondary schools (sometimes with additional higher-level classes) that accepted boys who had already learned basic reading and catechism at home or elementary school – the Ratio Studiorum “did not contain provisions for elementary education,” focusing on secondary and higher studies[*[67]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_Studiorum#:~:text=The%20Ratio%20was%20a%20collection,mathematics%2C%20and%20the%20natural%20sciences). The Jesuit program was divided generally into three main stages: **grammar, humanities, and rhetoric**. According to one summary, *“the Jesuits began educating students (mostly of middle-school age) with 3 years of grammar, transition to 1 year of humanities, and then end with rhetoric”[[45]](https://classicalu.com/wp-content/uploads/Catholic-Tradition-Six-Temp.pdf#:~:text=before%20advancing%20to%20philosophy%20and,Purpose%20of%20Ratio%20Studiorum)*. In practice, this corresponded to roughly five grades of the **lower school** (often called *Grammar* grades: lowest was sometimes “rudiments” followed by grammar levels often named infima, grammatical, syntaxis, and humanitas) and two higher-level years (usually *rhetoric* and *philosophy*). The **grammar stage** focused on Latin fundamentals: grammar drills, Latin composition, and basic readings (e.g. fables, Erasmus’ dialogues). Greek was introduced usually after a couple of years of Latin; by the humanities year, students read Greek and Latin authors more extensively. The **rhetoric class** (approximately for ages 15–16) was the capstone where students read the great orators (Cicero, Demosthenes), poets (Virgil, Homer), and practiced eloquence through orations, debates, and drama[*[45]](https://classicalu.com/wp-content/uploads/Catholic-Tradition-Six-Temp.pdf#:~:text=before%20advancing%20to%20philosophy%20and,Purpose%20of%20Ratio%20Studiorum)[[44]](https://classicalu.com/wp-content/uploads/Catholic-Tradition-Six-Temp.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Teacher%20should%20be%20a,is%20to%20train%20his%20students)*. Some Jesuit colleges also had a **philosophy course** (covering logic, natural philosophy, metaphysics) for the oldest students, which made their schools resemble a combined high school & junior college. The Ratio Studiorum prescribed in detail which authors to cover and how: for instance, Cicero and Aristotle in rhetoric/philosophy, and in lower levels smaller classical works and humanist texts. It “relied on the classical subjects – theology, philosophy, Latin and Greek” as its core, and even when revised in 1832, it still built on those while adding a bit more native language, history, geography, math, and science in response to modern needs[*[67]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_Studiorum#:~:text=The%20Ratio%20was%20a%20collection,mathematics%2C%20and%20the%20natural%20sciences).

**Teaching methods:** Jesuit pedagogy was famously systematic and student-engaging. Classes usually began with a **prelection**: the teacher would read a short passage from a Latin (or Greek) text slowly, explain its content, vocabulary, and grammar points (students did *not* take notes during the prelection, they were to listen attentively)[*[44]*](https://classicalu.com/wp-content/uploads/Catholic-Tradition-Six-Temp.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Teacher%20should%20be%20a,is%20to%20train%20his%20students). After this, students might be called on to **recite** memorized grammar rules or to translate bits of the passage. The Ratio encouraged creating academic rivalry in a friendly way – students were often divided into two teams (Romans and Carthaginians, for example) and earned points for their team by answering questions well. Regular **examinations and promotions** were held; the best students could be promoted to a higher class mid-year if merited. Another distinctive feature was the emphasis on **drama and oratory**: Jesuit schools had students put on Latin plays (often on classical or biblical themes) and practice declamations. The Ratio mentions that parts of the curriculum included drama (comedy and tragedy) in Latin, since if students could act and speak powerfully in Latin, it proved they had truly mastered the language[*[45]](https://classicalu.com/wp-content/uploads/Catholic-Tradition-Six-Temp.pdf#:~:text=before%20advancing%20to%20philosophy%20and,Purpose%20of%20Ratio%20Studiorum)[[44]](https://classicalu.com/wp-content/uploads/Catholic-Tradition-Six-Temp.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Teacher%20should%20be%20a,is%20to%20train%20his%20students)*. The goal was to build confidence, memory, and a “presenter’s persona” before an audience[*[44]*](https://classicalu.com/wp-content/uploads/Catholic-Tradition-Six-Temp.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Teacher%20should%20be%20a,is%20to%20train%20his%20students). Similarly, **disputation** was used in upper classes – students might have to argue opposing sides of a thesis in Latin, sharpening their reasoning.

Discipline in Jesuit schools was generally strict but tempered with moral and religious guidance. The Jesuits believed in **forming character and piety** alongside intellect. The Ratio Studiorum explicitly states the *aim of education is to lead students to the knowledge and love of God[[68]](https://classicalu.com/wp-content/uploads/Catholic-Tradition-Six-Temp.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Ratio%20Studiorum%20begins%20with,Seeley%20Jesuit%20teachers%20and%20students)*. A famous Jesuit maxim: *“In order to form a Christian, they must first form a man”*, emphasizing virtue development[*[69]*](https://classicalu.com/wp-content/uploads/Catholic-Tradition-Six-Temp.pdf#:~:text=general,Seeley%20Jesuit%20teachers%20and%20students). Teachers were exhorted to be caring and act in loco parentis – to *love* the students but also correct them firmly. The use of corporal punishment was allowed but with moderation and only by certain officials. The Jesuits also pioneered what we might call **guidance counseling**: the Prefect of Studies and Prefect of Discipline in each college monitored student progress and conduct, providing support or admonition as needed.

Another Jesuit hallmark was **free education**. Many Jesuit colleges charged no tuition, being funded by endowments or state subventions. This opened their doors to talented non-aristocrats (though nobles and wealthy bourgeois attended in large numbers too). For example, in late 16th century, *“Jesuits founded their own schools and offered free training in Latin grammar, Philosophy, Theology, Geography, etc., for boys”* as part of the Counter-Reformation effort to educate both laymen and future priests[*[70]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_school#:~:text=After%20the%20Protestant%20Reformation%20%2C,Latin%20grammar%2C%20Philosophy%2C%20Theology%2C%20Geography). This was a novel idea at the time – providing high-quality education at no direct cost – and it made Jesuit schools extremely popular and competitive.

**Geographical scope:** The Jesuit model was implemented not only in Catholic strongholds like France, Spain, Italy, and the Catholic German states, but also in places like Poland, Bohemia, and missions as far as the New World and Asia. Wherever they went, Jesuit educators took the Ratio Studiorum as a blueprint, yielding a remarkably consistent curriculum across continents. This consistency helped make “Jesuit education” a brand associated with academic excellence and rigorous classical training. Even Protestants acknowledged (sometimes grudgingly) the effectiveness of Jesuit pedagogy; many non-Catholic schools in the 17th century started imitating certain Jesuit methods (like periodic class rankings and prize ceremonies).

**Goals:** The philosophical and moral goals of Jesuit education were twofold: to produce devout, learned young men who would be **loyal to the Catholic Church** and to equip them for leadership roles in society (as clergymen or lay leaders). A Jesuit school graduate ideally embodied the Jesuit motto *“Ad maiorem Dei gloriam”* (For the greater glory of God) in his virtuous life, and also the humanist ideal of the eloquent, rational gentleman. The Jesuit curriculum stressed developing both *virtue and intellect*. The Ratio stated students should “improve in **character**, literary skills and learning in general”[*[68]*](https://classicalu.com/wp-content/uploads/Catholic-Tradition-Six-Temp.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Ratio%20Studiorum%20begins%20with,Seeley%20Jesuit%20teachers%20and%20students). The Jesuits believed that a well-ordered mind, trained by the Classics, would also be a moral mind. They also placed importance on service: many Jesuit-taught alumni went on to serve in courts, governments, and armies, and the Jesuits took pride in influencing these men to act for the common good of both Church and state. In fact, Jesuit schools often educated the sons of the Catholic nobility (e.g. in France or Austria), effectively shaping the next generation of rulers. This raised suspicions among some secular authorities who feared Jesuit influence – but it attests to how deeply the Jesuit educational model penetrated the fabric of elite formation in the early modern period.

The Jesuit model faced a setback when the order was suppressed in 1773 (temporarily, until restoration in 1814) – during that hiatus, other orders or state officials tried to fill the gap using modified Jesuit curricula. The enduring legacy of the Jesuits in education is evident: even after 1773, the standardized classical curriculum they had championed remained the template in many places. In summary, the Jesuits exemplified the *height of classical education* – highly structured, thorough in classical languages, pedagogically innovative, and aimed at both intellectual and spiritual excellence. Their schools produced many of the leading scholars, churchmen, and statesmen of the 17th–18th centuries, thus deeply influencing the course of European education.

## Comparative Differences and Philosophical Goals Across Regions

Classical education, while sharing a core devotion to Latin, Greek, and the liberal arts, was not monolithic. Different countries and periods introduced variations in **starting age, curriculum content, teaching style, and underlying purpose**. Below are some key differences and commonalities:

- **Age of Starting and Duration:** In most regions, formal classical schooling began around age 7–10, after basic literacy was acquired. English boys often started grammar school by 7–8[*[5]*](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1583/education-in-the-elizabethan-era/#:~:text=A%20boy%20who%20performed%20well,1536%20CE), whereas French boys tended to enter collèges a bit later (around 10)[*[26]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education_in_France#:~:text=By%201710%20France%20had%20about,but%20in%201789%20during%20the), and German boys entered Gymnasium about 9–10[*[36]*](https://www.historians.org/resource/appendix-iii-history-in-the-german-gymnasia/#:~:text=The%20German%20gymnasium%2C%20whether%20the,rounded%20symmetrical%20education). Elite British public schools by the 18th century commonly admitted boys at 12–14 (though younger admissions occurred)[*[20]](https://www.paullettgolden.com/post/a-gentlemans-education#:~:text=to%20be%20,and%20promoted%20by%20the%20King)[[22]](https://www.paullettgolden.com/post/a-gentlemans-education#:~:text=the%20others,Beverly%20from%20the%20Word%20Wenches)*. Across the board, a full classical course lasted into the mid or late teens – e.g. finishing at 14–15 for many English grammar school boys[*[15]*](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1583/education-in-the-elizabethan-era/#:~:text=per%20day%20but%20could%20add,continued%20until%20they%20were%2018), or around 18 in a German Gymnasium or Napoleonic lycée[*[49]*](https://www.encyclopedia.com/children/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gymnasium-schooling#:~:text=neglected,matriculation%20at%20a%20German%20university). Thus, while the starting point could differ slightly, the endpoint of producing a young man ready for university or society by about age 16–18 was common. Notably, **university entry ages** skewed younger in the 16th–17th centuries (14–16 was not unusual at Oxford/Cambridge[*[24]*](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1583/education-in-the-elizabethan-era/#:~:text=at%20this%20level%2C%20education%20continued,was%20the%20most%20important%20factor)), but by the 19th century it normalized closer to 18–20 in many places.
- **Curriculum Emphasis:** All classical schools taught Latin grammar and literature as the central pillar. The **breadth of curriculum** varied:
- In England and colonial America, there was relatively *little* mathematics or science in the classical schools (these were considered separate or lower-priority; a grammar school might teach only modest arithmetic). The focus was squarely on language and moral literature.
- Germany, especially by the 19th century, integrated more math and science into the Gymnasium (Humboldt’s reforms added modern subjects to the previously classical-only syllabus[*[43]*](https://www.encyclopedia.com/children/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gymnasium-schooling#:~:text=legitimized%20by%20legislation,matriculation%20at%20a%20German%20university)).
- France’s lycée from 1800s similarly included “elements of mathematical and physical sciences” alongside Latin/Greek[*[27]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education_in_France#:~:text=After%20more%20than%20a%20decade,like%20discipline), whereas the old collège of the 1700s was almost purely classical.
- The **presence of Greek** was another differentiator: in 16th–17th century, not all schools taught Greek thoroughly (e.g. smaller English grammar schools “much more rarely” taught Greek[*[6]*](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1583/education-in-the-elizabethan-era/#:~:text=attended%20from%20around%20the%20age,1536%20CE), and some German Lateinschulen omitted Greek). But by the late 18th century, **Greek had a resurgence** in curricula (thanks to Neohumanism and general Enlightenment interest in Greek democracy and art). German Gymnasien after 1780 and British public schools in the 19th century made Greek a staple subject alongside Latin. Puritan New England also gave attention to Greek (for scripture) and even Hebrew, which was unusual elsewhere[*[7]*](https://prezi.com/xffugkaalhdi/puritan-education/#:~:text=The%20grammar%20schools%20of%20the,college%20and%2C%20ultimately%2C%20for).
- **Modern languages** were largely absent from curricula until the late 18th–19th centuries. French nobility might learn Italian or Spanish from tutors for polite accomplishment, and British aristocrats learned French as the language of diplomacy, but these were often extracurricular. The formal school curriculum did not include modern vernacular literature study until the 1800s (for instance, Prussian reforms introduced German literature as a subject only after the Napoleonic period).
- **Instructional Style and Discipline:** Memorization, recitation, and corporal punishment were common to all regions in the 1500s–1700s. However, there were some nuanced differences:
- Jesuit schools employed more **active learning** strategies (drama, debates, team competitions) than some of their secular or Protestant counterparts, which leaned heavily on rote learning[*[44]*](https://classicalu.com/wp-content/uploads/Catholic-Tradition-Six-Temp.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Teacher%20should%20be%20a,is%20to%20train%20his%20students). This made Jesuit classes somewhat more dynamic.
- English public schools by the 18th–19th century developed a **prefect system** and student “fagging” that made older boys partially enforce discipline – a unique cultural element of British boarding schools meant to instill leadership (albeit with much bullying). Continental schools did not have this self-governance system; discipline remained teacher-centered.
- The **severity** of discipline could also vary by cultural context: e.g., Puritan New England masters were famously strict (education was a grave moral duty), while some 18th-century Enlightenment-influenced teachers in Europe began to question excessive flogging. By early 19th century, one sees more emphasis in some German and French pedagogical writings on understanding student psychology and not just beating lessons into them – yet old habits died hard, and the rod remained a symbol of schooling almost everywhere until well into the 19th century[*[10]](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1583/education-in-the-elizabethan-era/#:~:text=Memorising%20texts%20and%20performing%20endlessly,In%20short%2C%20education%20was)[[11]](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1583/education-in-the-elizabethan-era/#:~:text=Grammar%20school%20teachers%20were%20as,preparation%20throughout%20the%20academic%20year)*.
- Another difference was class size and individual attention: aristocratic children with private tutors (in England, France, etc.) obviously had personalized instruction – their education might include more field trips (Grand Tours, etc.) and practical learning (dancing, riding, conversation) than a large classroom could offer. On the other hand, a day boy in a Latin school might be one of 30 pupils of a single master. German states by 1800 had larger, more bureaucratic classes, whereas a small New England village Latin school might only have a handful of students spanning different ages in one room.
- **Religious vs Secular orientation:** All classical education before the late 18th century had a strong religious underpinning – the Bible (in Latin or Greek) was often a text in class, and moral instruction was intertwined. But differences existed:
- Protestant regions (England, northern Germany, New England) tended to use classical education to bolster **Biblical literacy and Protestant doctrine** (e.g., grammar schools in Elizabethan England still taught prayers and catechism alongside Latin[*[71]*](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1583/education-in-the-elizabethan-era/#:~:text=Schooling%20was%20still%20mostly%20for,guardian%20was%20often%20illiterate%20themselves)).
- Catholic education (France, Habsburg lands) under Jesuits aimed to reinforce Catholic orthodoxy and produce loyal churchmen.
- By the late 1700s, with the Enlightenment, **secular or civic rationales** for classical education grew. For example, the French Revolutionary government briefly de-emphasized religious content and tried to make education about producing enlightened citizens (Condorcet’s plan)[*[30]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education_in_France#:~:text=Condorcet%20in%201792%20drew%20up,Condorcet%27s%20plan%20was%20not%20adopted). Similarly, late 18th-century Prussian education incorporated Enlightenment values, although religion remained, especially in predominantly Protestant Prussia, a key subject (often one class period of *Religion* was mandatory even in 19th-century Gymnasium). The early U.S. was somewhat unique in tying classical learning to republican self-government, as described above, but that was really an extension of secular civic humanism which had existed in European thought for a while.
- **Philosophical Goals:** In essence, classical education was viewed as *education for leadership*. The nuances of that leadership ideal varied:
- **Civic Virtue and Republicanism:** Drawing from Renaissance humanism, educators everywhere believed classical history and literature taught moral examples. This was explicit in the training of statesmen. For example, the Founding Fathers’ classical education fueled their political philosophy about liberty and mixed government[*[64]](https://www.usconstitution.net/classical-influence-on-founding-fathers/#:~:text=The%20Founding%20Fathers%20drew%20direct,an%20understanding%20of%20these%20allusions)[[72]](https://www.usconstitution.net/classical-influence-on-founding-fathers/#:~:text=The%20principle%20of%20checks%20and,check%20itself%20to%20safeguard%20liberty)*. In Europe, even absolute monarchies wanted officials who admired Roman virtus and Greek wisdom in order to be effective servants of the state. The idea of **civic virtue** – that education should inculcate duty to the community – was a through-line from Italian city-states in 1500s (with their civic humanist schools) to American revolutionaries in 1770s.
- **Preparation for University and Professions:** A very practical goal was always present: these schools prepared boys for the next stage, whether that was university study of theology/law/medicine or direct entry into roles like court officer or military academy. Hence the stress on Latin (the language of law, diplomacy, and academia). In Germany, the Abitur guaranteed access to university and higher civil service, making the Gymnasium explicitly a pipeline to the professions[*[73]*](https://www.encyclopedia.com/children/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/gymnasium-schooling#:~:text=neglected,matriculation%20at%20a%20German%20university). In England, grammar schools were said to prepare students for *college and ultimately for the clergy or learned professions[[7]](https://prezi.com/xffugkaalhdi/puritan-education/#:~:text=The%20grammar%20schools%20of%20the,college%20and%2C%20ultimately%2C%20for)*.
- **Moral and Religious Formation:** All systems saw moral upbringing as central. A Jesuit schoolmaster aimed to produce a devout Christian who was also intellectually adept[*[68]*](https://classicalu.com/wp-content/uploads/Catholic-Tradition-Six-Temp.pdf#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20Ratio%20Studiorum%20begins%20with,Seeley%20Jesuit%20teachers%20and%20students); a Puritan teacher aimed to form a godly, disciplined man who could resist Satan’s wiles (hence the name of the 1647 Act requiring schooling in Massachusetts[*[3]*](https://www.history.com/articles/13-colonies-school#:~:text=The%20first%20law%20related%20directly,%E2%80%9CLatin%20grammar%E2%80%9D%20or%20secondary%20school)); a Church of England grammar school reinforced Anglican piety in the classics, etc. The balance of moral vs intellectual goals sometimes tipped one way or another – e.g. Pietist-influenced schools (like Francke’s in Halle, early 1700s) put special emphasis on personal piety and charitable outlook, whereas some Enlightenment-era teachers focused more on critical thinking skills and less on dogma. But generally, the **ideal outcome** was a well-rounded gentleman: virtuous, knowledgeable, articulate, and capable of reasoned judgment.
- **National and Cultural Identity:** Over time, classical education also became a marker of cultural identity. By the 19th century, to be *gebildet* (cultured) in Germany or *cultivé* in France or a member of the English gentlemanly class meant one had read one’s Virgil and Homer. This formed a kind of social glue among elites across Europe and America – a shared canon. Yet, each nation also bent the classical ideal to bolster its own identity: the French saw themselves as inheritors of Roman imperial glory and Greek taste; the British compared their empire with Rome’s; Germans in the 19th century idolized Greek philosophy and art as models for their own intellectual flowering. Thus, classical education was used to draw parallels between **ancient virtues** and **contemporary aspirations**. For instance, James Madison read about Athenian and Roman republics to help craft the American Constitution[*[64]*](https://www.usconstitution.net/classical-influence-on-founding-fathers/#:~:text=The%20Founding%20Fathers%20drew%20direct,an%20understanding%20of%20these%20allusions), while a French Lycée student under Napoleon might read Caesar’s *Gallic Wars* and see Napoleon as a modern Caesar.

In conclusion, despite regional differences, classical education from the 1500s through 1800s maintained a remarkable continuity. **Latin and Greek** were the twin axes around which the curriculum revolved; **grammar, rhetoric, and logic** were the key skills imparted; and **forming virtuous, learned leaders** was the universal objective. Whether in a Jesuit college in Paris, a Lutheran Gymnasium in Prussia, or a small academy in Massachusetts, an elite boy’s schooling would be steeped in ancient languages and literature. This classical training was believed to sharpen the mind, improve moral reasoning, and connect the student to timeless knowledge – a preparation for whatever high calling (university scholar, clergyman, statesman, or enlightened landowner) his station in life entailed. The legacy of this era of education is profound: it produced generations of thinkers and leaders who, for better or worse, guided their societies with an ethos drawn from Cicero, Plato, and Scripture, all learned on the hard benches of the Latin school.

# Montessori Curriculum for Homeschooling | OpenEd (1)

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e31168e49f5b7e6f76f0e5/68d53b8edeefe408cd98093f_Blog%20Thumbnail%20%231.png)

In 1907, Dr. Maria Montessori walked into a Roman tenement filled with children everyone else had written off. The authorities called them "unteachable." Their parents, working long factory hours, had nowhere else to leave them. Within months, these same children were teaching themselves to read, solving complex math problems, and—most shocking to observers—choosing to work rather than play.

What Montessori discovered in that first *Casa dei Bambini* (Children's House) was more than a teaching method. It was a truth about human nature: children are born scientists, desperate to understand their world. Give them real tools instead of toys, respect instead of condescension, and freedom within prepared limits, and they'll exceed every expectation you never knew you had.

Montessori herself was a revolutionary figure—Italy's first female physician. Her medical training in observation and scientific method shaped everything that followed. She approached education as a scientist, documenting how children actually learn rather than theorizing about how they *should* learn.

"The greatest sign of success for a teacher," she wrote, "is to be able to say, *the children are now working as if I did not exist.*"

More than a century later, her method has produced what [Wall Street Journal called the "Montessori Mafia",](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-IMB-2034) which includes Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Wikipedia's Jimmy Wales. When Barbara Walters asked if having professor parents explained Google's success, Page credited something else:

"We both went to Montessori school, and I think it was part of that training of not following rules and orders, and being self-motivated, questioning what's going on in the world, doing things a little bit differently."

Today, the Montessori method is booming in preschools, microschools, and co-ops—and increasingly being translated into the home environment. Ben Mann, co-founder of AI company Anthropic, [recently explained why his daughter attends Montessori](https://x.com/lennysan/status/1947810003169292371):

***"If this were 10-20 years ago, I'd be lining her up for top-tier schools and extracurriculars. But now I don't think any of it's going to matter. Learning facts is going to fade into the background. What matters is that she's happy, thoughtful, curious, and kind."***

In an AI age, the skills Montessori develops—creativity, independence, problem-solving—become more important, not less.

While some argue that true Montessori requires a classroom community, a growing movement of families is successfully adapting the principles for home use. Aubrey Hargis, M.Ed., homeschooling mom of two and founder of [Child of the Redwoods](https://www.childoftheredwoods.com/), offers [reassurance to hesitant parents](https://www.childoftheredwoods.com/homeschool-help/your-kitchen-is-a-classroom):

***"Your home is good enough! Wherever you are is going to be great. You have what you need—because the most important thing you can offer is carrying a sense of curiosity and joy yourself."***

So how do you transform your kitchen table into a laboratory for independence? Which materials matter and which are Instagram props? Let's dive in.

## Defining Montessori Education

Pinterest boards featuring pristine wooden toys on color-coordinated shelves. Instagram accounts showcasing picture-perfect playrooms. DIY essential oil playdough recipes. While these can inspire, Montessori is far more than an aesthetic—it's a complete reimagining of how children learn.

Dr. Montessori, nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize three times, identified core principles through scientific observation:

**The child is the teacher.** Adults observe, prepare the environment, then step back. Your three-year-old knows exactly what skill she needs to develop next—she just needs access to the right materials at the right moment.

**Everything connects.** Pouring water teaches mathematical precision and hand control for writing. Washing dishes builds concentration for reading. Caring for plants develops patience for long division. Every activity secretly prepares the child for something greater.

**Mistakes teach without shame.** The materials themselves show children their errors—a puzzle piece that won't fit, water that spills, a sum that doesn't balance. No red pen needed. Just information: try again differently.

When we rush to assist, we rob children of the satisfaction of mastery. In other words: Show don't tell. Name don't explain. And perhaps hardest of all—don't point out mistakes. The materials are designed to provide feedback, preserving both dignity and intrinsic motivation.

## Montessori Curriculum

The Montessori curriculum weaves together five interconnected areas, each building specific neural pathways and skills. Unlike traditional subjects that stand alone, these areas support and reinforce each other.

**Practical Life** forms the foundation—not because it teaches academic skills directly, but because it builds the concentration, coordination, and confidence that make all other learning possible. When a three-year-old spends [twenty minutes transferring beans with tweezers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSBfrQ2S42g), she's developing the pincer grip for writing, the left-to-right movement for reading, and the focused attention for mathematics.

As educator [Marietta Rawson illustrates in her book Work, Work, Work](https://www.amazon.com/Work-Montessori-Education-Marietta-Rawson/dp/B0006R4N82): "If I were to go down to the seashore and were to come upon a man filling a wheelbarrow with sand, and a small boy filling a toy wheelbarrow with sand... when the boy finished filling the wheelbarrow, he very probably would dump it out and refill it any number of times, whereas the man would never in the world do such a thing."

The boy isn't playing at work; he is working at mastery. Activities like pouring, spooning, buttoning, and polishing connect children to real work that matters. 

**Sensorial Materials** function as keys to understanding the world. The [famous Pink Tower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXFwOcfdLIM), with its ten precisely graduated cubes, helps children internalize mathematical relationships through their muscles and eyes long before they encounter numbers. [Color Tablets](https://reachformontessori.com/the-montessori-color-tablets-explanation-and-presentation/) train visual discrimination for distinguishing 'b' from 'd.' [Sound Cylinders](https://www.wonderfulmontessori.com/sound-cylindersboxes-presentation1-matching) develop auditory processing essential for phonics. Each material isolates one quality—size, color, texture, weight—allowing the child to build a mental catalog of sensory experiences.

**Language** acknowledges that children learn to write before they read—a reversal of traditional teaching that makes perfect sense once you observe children. The [Moveable Alphabet](https://montessorioutlet.com/small-movable-alphabet-box-capital-cursive-510400384.html) lets them build words before their hands can form letters. [Sandpaper Letters](https://a.co/d/4nOHK5C) connect sound to symbol through touch. Grammar transforms from rules to memorize into games with colorful symbols. Reading emerges naturally when ready, without force or frustration.

**Mathematics** becomes concrete through the [Golden Beads](https://www.alisonsmontessori.com/Golden_Bead_Material_Complete_Set_p/m92.set.htm). Children literally hold units, tens, hundreds, and thousands in their hands. They discover place value by exchanging ten units for a ten-bar. They understand addition by physically combining quantities. The progression from concrete to abstract happens gradually, with children often working with materials and symbols simultaneously until abstraction feels natural.

**Cultural Studies** encompasses geography, history, science, art, music—woven together in "Cosmic Education." Rather than isolated subjects, children learn about their interconnected world. They trace writing's development while studying ancient civilizations. They explore botany while learning about biomes. They discover their place in the universe's grand story.

## Montessori Homeschool Curriculum

### Elementary School Montessori Homeschool Curriculum

In Montessori's framework, human development occurs in distinct six-year planes, each with unique characteristics and needs. Around age six, a profound transformation occurs. The absorbent mind of early childhood—which soaked up everything in the environment—evolves into a reasoning mind hungry for understanding. The child who was content to name and classify now demands "Why?" and "How?"

This is a period of relative physical stability but intense intellectual exploration, characterized by a burgeoning imagination that can travel through time and space. Socially, the child moves away from parallel play and develops a strong "herd instinct"—a need to belong to a group and collaborate with peers.

Elementary Montessori responds with the **Five Great Lessons**—epic narratives that provide a framework for all knowledge. These aren't textbooks you purchase but dramatic presentations you give, complete with experiments, timelines, and charts:

1. **The Coming of the Universe and Earth** - The Big Bang through Earth's formation, told with experiments showing states of matter and volcanic eruptions
2. **The Coming of Life** - Evolution from single-celled organisms to complex ecosystems, presented with the Timeline of Life
3. **The Coming of Humans** - Early humans developing language, tools, and civilization
4. **The Story of Writing** - Cave paintings to modern alphabets, shown with actual examples of different scripts
5. **The Story of Numbers** - How humans developed mathematical thinking across cultures

These carefully crafted narratives give children cosmic perspective. Every subject studied afterward connects back to these origin stories. Learning fractions? That's the Babylonians from the Story of Numbers. Studying photosynthesis? That's Chapter Two in the Coming of Life. The Egyptians you're researching? They appear in multiple lessons—writing hieroglyphics, developing irrigation, creating number systems.

The genius is that children see all knowledge as interconnected, not isolated subjects. They understand their place in the grand story of the universe. The elementary child craves "big work"—projects taking weeks, research requiring library visits, experiments that might fail spectacularly. The Great Lessons spark this work.

## Middle & High School Montessori Homeschool Curriculum

Here's where Montessori's vision takes a radical turn. She believed that after age 12, adolescents don't need more academics—they need real work that matters. Her solution was *Erdkinder* (earth children), where students would live and work on farms, running actual businesses and solving genuine problems.

Montessori argued that the adolescent craves purpose, contribution, and evidence of their value to society. Traditional high school academics divorced from real application actually work against the developmental needs of this age. She never fully developed a complete high school curriculum because she believed students at this stage should be learning through authentic work experiences, not classroom lessons.

Today's Montessori adolescents might be:

- Starting Etsy businesses selling handmade goods
- Running YouTube channels teaching younger children
- Managing community gardens donating to food banks
- Coding apps solving real problems
- Apprenticing with local craftspeople and entrepreneurs

Academics don't disappear—they become embedded in meaningful work. That garden requires soil chemistry analysis, crop rotation planning, budget management, marketing materials. The Etsy business demands photography skills, persuasive writing, percentage calculations for pricing, customer service communication.

**Middle School Materials (Ages 12-15):**

- [Checkerboard](https://www.nienhuis.com/product/checker-board/500_013701/) for complex multiplication in business calculations
- [Timeline Materials](https://www.alisonsmontessori.com/Montessori_Curriculum_Timelines_s/147861.htm) connecting work to historical context
- [Chemistry Materials](https://www.alisonsmontessori.com/Montessori_Curriculum_Materials_Chemistry_s/707321.htm) for practical applications
- [Botany Nomenclature](https://shopmontessoriprintshop.com/collections/in-color-botany) supporting agricultural projects
- [Grammar Boxes](https://montessorioutlet.com/grammar-boxes-510400690.html) supporting sophisticated writing for authentic audiences

**High School (Ages 15-18):**

Most modern "Montessori high schools" blend these principles with other progressive approaches, since Montessori herself believed that students with authentic Montessori education from the start would have developed the skills to direct their own learning by this age.

OpenEd families at this stage might blend Montessori principles with:

- [**SNHU**](https://www.snhu.edu/) - Self-paced, competency-based program for full college credit, allowing teens to earn an associate's degree in high school
- [**BYU Independent Study**](https://is.byu.edu/) - Flexible courses across all subjects
- [**Bottega University**](https://bottega.edu/) - Project-based tech training to become a full-stack developer

The absence of a formal high school curriculum isn't a failure—it's recognition that truly prepared adolescents don't need to be taught; they need opportunities to contribute. The Montessori foundation—independence, love of learning, deep concentration—serves these students regardless of specific curriculum.

# Montessori Education and Open Education | OpenEd (1)

Maria Montessori discovered something revolutionary: when you prepare the environment, step back, and trust the child's natural drive to learn, extraordinary development happens.

Over a century later, Montessori education has spread to thousands of schools worldwide, producing what the *Wall Street Journal* called the "Montessori Mafia"—innovators like Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Wikipedia's Jimmy Wales—who credit their education with teaching them to question everything and think differently.

But accessing quality Montessori education has meant an impossible choice: expensive private schools ($12,000-20,000 annually) or purchasing materials out of pocket.

OpenEd changes this equation. Through partnerships with innovative public schools, we make Montessori education accessible—whether you want the full prepared environment with classic materials, OR you want to blend Montessori math with classical literature, mixing approaches as your child develops.

[**-> See If You Qualify <-**](https://opened.co/apply)

## **Defining Montessori Education Method**

Montessori education centers on one radical premise: children are intrinsically motivated to learn. Given freedom within structure, they naturally develop concentration, self-discipline, and love of learning.

**The Prepared Environment** — Every material has purpose. The Pink Tower develops spatial awareness and muscle control. The Golden Beads make abstract math concepts tangible. Practical life activities—pouring, buttoning, washing—build coordination and independence.

**Self-Direction Within Limits** — Children choose activities during work cycles, typically 2-3 hours uninterrupted. The adult observes, noting readiness for new concepts, presenting materials at developmentally appropriate moments.

**Hands-On Learning** — Abstract concepts become concrete. Fractions aren't symbols on worksheets—they're metal circles you hold, compare, and manipulate until understanding emerges naturally.

**Mixed-Age Groupings** — 3-year age spans (0-3, 3-6, 6-9, 9-12, 12-15, 15-18) create natural mentorship. Younger children observe and aspire. Older children reinforce learning by teaching. Everyone learns at their actual level.

**Following the Child** — Rather than imposing curriculum at arbitrary ages, Montessori identifies sensitive periods—windows when children naturally absorb specific skills—and provides materials when readiness appears.

The method isn't permissive. Children have profound freedom *within carefully prepared limits.* This paradox—maximum freedom within clear structure—produces the focused, independent learners Montessori environments consistently develop.

## **Benefits of Montessori**

Research consistently validates Montessori outcomes:

**Academic Achievement** — A 2017 study in [*Frontiers in Psychology*](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01783/full) found Montessori students significantly outperformed conventionally schooled peers in math and literacy, with stronger executive function and creativity.

**Executive Function Development** — The sustained concentration of uninterrupted work cycles builds attention control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility—capacities that predict long-term success better than IQ.

**Intrinsic Motivation** — By honoring children's natural interests rather than imposing external rewards, Montessori cultivates genuine love of learning that persists beyond testing and grades.

**Social-Emotional Skills** — Mixed-age environments develop leadership in older students and aspiration in younger. Grace and courtesy lessons build emotional intelligence. Conflict resolution happens peer-to-peer with adult guidance only when needed.

**Independence and Confidence** — When a 4-year-old successfully completes a challenging task they chose themselves, without adult intervention, confidence builds from actual competence, not empty praise.

> Parents often report Montessori children show unusual focus, tackle challenges persistently, and learn eagerly—not because they're rewarded, but because learning itself is rewarding.
> 

## **Montessori with OpenEd**

The Montessori revival has created beautiful opportunities—and significant barriers. Private schools have limited enrollment and high costs. Quality materials run thousands of dollars. Montessori teacher training requires substantial investment.

OpenEd makes this accessible through three elements:

### **Access to Montessori Resources**

Through OpenEd, families can access what they need:

- **Complete materials sets** — Sensorial, practical life, math, language, cultural subjects
- **Montessori co-ops** — Weekly gatherings for work cycles and community
- **Certified Montessori guides** — Private instruction or small-group sessions
- **Digital Montessori programs** — [Montessori Compass](https://www.montessoricompass.com/), [Khan Academy Kids](https://www.khanacademy.org/) (Montessori-inspired)
- **Montessori-aligned curricula** — [Handwriting Without Tears](https://www.lwtears.com/solutions/writing/handwriting-without-tears), [Singapore Math](https://www.singaporemath.com/) (similar philosophy)
- **Parent education** — Montessori teacher training courses to guide effectively

### **Flexibility to Commit or Blend**

Some families are devoted Montessorians pursuing the complete prepared environment. OpenEd makes this possible.

Others take what we call the "open Montessori" approach:

- **Montessori math materials** + adaptive online literacy
- **Practical life activities** + classical Great Books discussions
- **Montessori sensorial work** + project-based science
- **Mixed-age co-op** for work cycles + home for individual pursuits
- **Montessori elementary** transitioning to traditional middle school

Your Montessori identity remains intact whether you're pursuing gold-standard immersion or adapting principles to your child's unique journey.

**Community Without Compromise**

Montessori thrives with:

- **Local Montessori co-ops** for work cycles and mixed-age interaction
- **Parent study groups** learning to prepare environments and present materials
- **Montessori homeschool associations** sharing resources and support
- **Regional meetups** for nature study, cultural celebrations, and community building

You're joining families who've discovered that open education and Montessori aren't opposites—they're natural partners.

[Learn how it works.](https://opened.co/)

## **Montessori Education for Elementary School**

### **Ages 6-12: The Reasoning Mind**

Elementary Montessori responds to dramatic developmental shift. Children become intensely social, morally aware, and fascinated by how things work.

The Great Lessons launch cosmic education—five dramatic narratives (creation of universe, life on Earth, humans, writing, numbers) spark curiosity that fuels years of exploration. A child captivated by the timeline of life might spend weeks researching prehistoric creatures, then transition to plant classification, then explore ecosystems.

**Materials evolve:** [Golden Beads](https://www.alisonsmontessori.com/Golden_Bead_Material_Complete_Set_p/m92.set.htm) become stamp games, then bead frames, abstracting toward traditional math. [Grammar boxes](https://montessorioutlet.com/grammar-boxes-510400690.html) make sentence structure tangible. Land and water forms introduce geography.

**Going out** becomes essential—elementary children conduct research in communities, interview experts, visit museums, bringing real-world learning back to the classroom.

Through OpenEd, families access complete elementary materials, join co-ops for great lessons and collaborative projects, and connect with Montessori guides for support.

### **Ages 12-15: The Social Reformer**

Adolescence brings profound physical and psychological changes. Montessori's vision for adolescents emphasizes real-world engagement, not isolation in classrooms.

The Erdkinder ("children of the earth") model envisions adolescents running a working farm or micro-enterprise—planning, producing, selling, managing finances—while integrating academic study through practical necessity.

Few families have farms, but the principle translates: apprenticeships, entrepreneurial projects, community service, creative production. Math becomes budgeting for actual ventures. Writing serves real audiences. Science addresses actual problems.

Adolescents need meaningful work, not busywork. They need social connection, not social media. They need purpose, not compliance.

OpenEd enables this through access to entrepreneurial mentorship, apprenticeship programs, project-based learning communities, and continued access to Montessori materials for students who benefit from hands-on learning.

## **Montessori Education for High School**

### **Ages 15-18: Preparing for Life**

Montessori high school (relatively rare) emphasizes independence, self-directed study, and preparation for adulthood beyond college admissions.

Students often pursue:

- **Sustained independent research** on topics of genuine interest
- **Real-world internships and apprenticeships**
- **Entrepreneurial ventures** from concept to launch
- **Community engagement** addressing actual needs
- **International experiences** broadening perspective

Academics continue but serve student-directed goals. A student passionate about environmental science might study ecology, chemistry, and statistics while working with conservation organizations—learning driven by purpose, not requirements.

Through OpenEd, high schoolers access mentors, online courses for specialized subjects, materials for continued hands-on learning, and community connections supporting their journey toward independence.

## **Ready to Begin Your Montessori Journey?**

> Maria Montessori discovered a truth: children are born eager to learn. When you prepare the environment, provide appropriate materials, and trust their natural development, extraordinary growth happens.
> 

For over a century, Montessori education has consistently produced independent, focused, intrinsically motivated learners who question assumptions and think differently.

Through OpenEd, your family can access this time-tested method—materials, co-ops, guidance—without choosing between Montessori principles and financial reality, between full immersion and thoughtful blending, between following the child and accessing community.

Whether you want complete Montessori from birth through adolescence, or you want to blend Montessori elements with other approaches as your child develops, OpenEd makes it possible.

# Virtual School: K-12 Solutions for Students | OpenEd (1)

Virtual school enrollment has exploded—over 4 million K-12 students in the United States now learn primarily online. Families have discovered they can learn from anywhere, set their own pace, and access resources beyond their local district. The promise was flexibility.

But most virtual schools deliver only location flexibility while maintaining curricular rigidity. You're assigned a curriculum. Required to attend synchronous classes. Locked into one platform. Can't easily blend online with real-world experiences. You got flexibility of *where* without flexibility of *how*.

OpenEd changes this. Through partnerships with innovative schools, we make it possible to choose ANY virtual curriculum, set your own pace, and seamlessly blend digital learning with in-person experiences. This is virtual school with actual flexibility—not just a different location for the same constraints.

[**-> See If You Qualify <-**](https://opened.co/apply)

## **What is Virtual School?**

Virtual school means K-12 education delivered primarily through online platforms rather than traditional brick-and-mortar classrooms. Students complete coursework, interact with teachers, and progress through curriculum digitally—learning from home, while traveling, or anywhere with internet access.

The virtual school landscape includes several models:

**Full-Time Virtual Schools** — Students complete all coursework online, often with assigned teachers and structured schedules. These can be public (tuition-free) or private (tuition-based).

**Part-Time Virtual Learning** — Students take some courses online while attending traditional school or homeschooling. Common for accessing advanced courses, specialized subjects, or flexible scheduling.

**Asynchronous vs. Synchronous** — Asynchronous programs let students work at their own pace on their own schedule. Synchronous programs require attending live online classes at specific times.

**Self-Paced vs. Instructor-Led** — Some virtual schools provide curriculum for independent learning. Others include regular teacher interaction, assignments, and feedback.

Virtual school's promise: Learn from anywhere, access excellent curriculum regardless of location, move at your own pace, and customize your education. The reality varies dramatically depending on which type of virtual school you choose.

## **Virtual Public School**

Most states now offer free virtual public schools—statewide programs providing online education at no cost to families. Examples include Indiana's Hoosier Academies, Oregon's ORCA, Kansas Virtual Academy, and Minnesota's online programs.

**What Virtual Public Schools Typically Provide:**

✅ **Free tuition** — Publicly funded, no cost to families
✅ **Assigned teachers** — Regular check-ins and progress monitoring
✅ **Complete curriculum** — All subjects provided
✅ **Official transcripts** — Recognized by colleges and universities
✅ **Materials included** — Textbooks, supplies often shipped to homes

**Where Virtual Public Schools Often Fall Short:**

❌ **No curriculum choice** — You're assigned a specific curriculum, can't choose alternatives
❌ **Mandatory synchronous classes** — Required attendance at specific times limits flexibility
❌ **One-size-fits-all pacing** — Must keep up with class regardless of mastery or readiness
❌ **Platform lock-in** — Can't switch to different programs even if it's not working
❌ **Limited blending** — Difficult to integrate with co-ops, apprenticeships, or other approaches
❌ **Restrictive policies** — Often can't participate in outside classes or dual enrollment easily

### **Traditional Virtual Public School vs. OpenEd Virtual Model**

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67c7406fc9e6913d1b92e341/68e822c7b6ad45c5f29f07f3_Feature.jpg)

*Comparison table*

Virtual public schools serve families well when structure, assigned teachers, and complete packages work. OpenEd serves families who need actual flexibility—not just location independence, but curricular freedom and the ability to adapt as needs evolve.

## **K-12 Virtual School**

Virtual schooling works differently across developmental stages. Here's what K-12 virtual learning looks like in practice:

### **Elementary Virtual School (K-5)**

**What Works:** Short, engaging lessons with multimedia content. Hands-on activities mixed with screen time. Parent involvement supporting independent work.

**Common Approaches:**

- [**Time4Learning**](https://www.time4learning.com/) — Animated lessons, automated grading, self-paced
- [**Khan Academy Kids**](https://www.khanacademy.org/) — Free, mastery-based, highly engaging for early grades
- [**Outschool**](https://outschool.com/) — Live classes for enrichment, arts, STEM topics
- [**Beast Academy**](https://beastacademy.com/) — Story-based math that makes elementary students problem-solvers

**Key Consideration:** Balance screen time with physical activity, hands-on learning, and social interaction. Virtual works best as tool alongside real-world exploration.

### **Middle School Virtual Learning (6-8)**

**What Works:** Greater independence with regular check-ins. Subject-specific courses from specialized instructors. Flexibility to pursue interests deeply.

**Common Approaches:**

- **Complete programs** ([Time4Learning](https://www.time4learning.com/), [K12](https://login.k12.com/)) providing all subjects
- **Subject-specific platforms** — [Beast Academy](https://beastacademy.com/)/AoPS for math, IEW for writing
- [**Outschool**](https://outschool.com/) specialized courses in coding, creative writing, sciences
- **Co-op blending** — Virtual for core subjects, in-person for labs and projects

**Key Consideration:** Middle schoolers need social connection. Blend virtual academics with in-person co-ops, sports, clubs, or group projects.

### **High School Virtual Learning (9-12)**

**What Works:** Self-directed learning with support. Access to advanced courses. Flexibility for work, athletics, or college prep.

**Common Approaches:**

- [**Connections Academy](https://www.connectionsacademy.com/school-login/),** [**K12**](https://login.k12.com/) — Full programs with transcripts
- **Dual enrollment** — Community college courses for high school and college credit
- **AP courses online** — Access advanced placement beyond local offerings
- **Specialized platforms** — Codecademy for programming, Coursera for college-level courses
- **Blended approach** — Virtual core + apprenticeships + real-world projects

**Key Consideration:** Transcript management, credit requirements, college preparation, and social opportunities all need planning.

Through OpenEd, access any combination that serves your student—complete virtual programs, subject-specific courses, live classes, or custom blends adapting to each child's needs across all grade levels.

## **Considerations for Virtual High School**

Virtual high school opens opportunities traditional schools can't match—but requires strategic planning:

### **Credits and Transcripts**

**Know your requirements:** Most states require specific credits for graduation. Track carefully.

**Official transcripts:** Many virtual programs ([Connections Academy](https://www.connectionsacademy.com/school-login/), [K12](https://login.k12.com/), [Oak Meadow](https://www.oakmeadow.com/)) provide recognized transcripts. For custom approaches, document learning and create transcripts with advisor support.

**Dual enrollment advantage:** Community college courses often provide both high school and transferable college credit—accelerating progress and reducing future costs.

### **College Preparation**

**Testing still matters:** SAT, ACT, and AP exams provide standardized validation of learning regardless of school model.

**Portfolio building:** Virtual learning enables deep projects, research, and real-world work that make college applications stand out.

**Counseling support:** OpenEd advisors help navigate college applications, essay writing, and showcasing non-traditional learning.

### **Lab Sciences**

**Virtual lab simulations:** Labster and other platforms provide high-quality virtual labs meeting requirements.

**Community college labs:** Dual enrollment courses include in-person lab components.

**Co-op partnerships:** Local homeschool co-ops often offer lab science courses.

### **Social Opportunities**

Virtual doesn't mean isolated:

- **School clubs and activities** — Many virtual schools offer clubs, student government, events
- **Community involvement** — Sports leagues, theater, volunteer work, part-time jobs
- **Co-op participation** — Weekly gatherings for labs, discussions, and group projects
- **Online communities** — Discord groups, gaming communities, interest-based connections

### **Flexibility for Life Goals**

Virtual high school particularly serves students who:

- Compete in athletics requiring travel and flexible training schedules
- Pursue performing arts, competitive gaming, entrepreneurship, or other demanding passions
- Need to work part-time to support themselves or families
- Have health challenges making traditional attendance difficult
- Want to accelerate graduation or pursue college credit simultaneously

Through OpenEd, access virtual high school options that provide official credentials while maintaining flexibility for real-world pursuits.

## **Virtual Schools by State**

Virtual school availability and quality varies significantly by state. Here's what you should know:

### **Understanding State Virtual School Programs**

Most states now offer statewide virtual public schools, but they differ dramatically in flexibility, curriculum, and support. Common state programs include:

- Full-time virtual academies ([K12](https://login.k12.com/), [Connections Academy](https://www.connectionsacademy.com/school-login/) franchises)
- State-run virtual schools operated by education departments
- District-level online programs serving specific counties
- Hybrid programs blending online and in-person learning

**Layout instruction:** Consider expandable sections for each state

### **Indiana Virtual School**

Indiana offers several virtual options including [Hoosier Academies](https://hcca.k12.com/) (K12 program) and [Indiana Connections Academy.](https://www.connectionsacademy.com/indiana-online-school/school-login/) These provide free virtual education but typically require assigned curriculum and synchronous attendance.

**OpenEd advantage:** Indiana families can access ANY virtual curriculum through OpenEd partnerships, not just state-assigned programs. Choose platforms that actually fit your child while maintaining public funding.

### **Kansas Virtual School**

Kansas offers virtual programs through districts and statewide networks. Availability varies by district residency.

**OpenEd advantage:** Kansas families through OpenEd partnerships access premium platforms like [Outschool](https://outschool.com/), specialized math programs, live classes, and can blend virtual with in-person co-ops seamlessly.

### **Oregon Virtual School**

Oregon offers ORCA ([Oregon Connections Academy](https://www.connectionsacademy.com/oregon-online-school/school-login/)) and district-based virtual options. Traditional virtual programs assign curriculum with limited flexibility.

**OpenEd advantage:** Oregon families can choose their virtual approach—complete programs, subject-specific courses, live classes, or custom combinations—with full support.

### **Arkansas Virtual School**

Arkansas Virtual Academy and district programs provide virtual options with varying levels of structure and support.

**OpenEd advantage:** Arkansas families access complete virtual curriculum freedom, blending online learning with in-person experiences as needed.

### **Minnesota Virtual School**

Minnesota offers multiple virtual options including statewide programs and district-based solutions.

**OpenEd advantage:** Minnesota families through OpenEd choose platforms and approaches rather than accepting assigned programs.

### **Montana Virtual School**

Montana provides virtual options through districts, though availability is more limited given rural geography.

**OpenEd advantage:** Montana families gain access to premium virtual platforms and specialized courses often unavailable through state programs.

**Key Pattern:** State virtual schools exist and serve some families well. But they typically assign curriculum, require attendance, and limit flexibility. OpenEd enables virtual learning with actual freedom—choose your curriculum, set your pace, blend approaches, change what's not working.

## **Experience Virtual Learning with True Flexibility with OpenEd**

Virtual school promised flexibility—learning from anywhere, at any pace, with access to resources beyond your local school. But most virtual schools deliver location flexibility while maintaining curricular rigidity.

Through OpenEd, virtual school means actual flexibility: Choose your curriculum from premium platforms. Set your pace without mandatory synchronous classes. Blend online learning seamlessly with in-person experiences. Change platforms if something stops working. Mix and match providers for different subjects.

> Get resources without limitations. Support without loss of control. Community without giving up independence.
