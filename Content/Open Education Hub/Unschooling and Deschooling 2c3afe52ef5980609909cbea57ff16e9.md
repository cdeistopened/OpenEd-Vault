    ### **Deschooling vs. Unschooling**
    
    The term “deschooling” was coined by maverick philosopher Ivan Illich in his 1971 book [*Deschooling Society*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deschooling_Society?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=deschooling-vs-unschooling), which argued that society as a whole needed to move away from its dependence on schools as the primary means of education.
    
    He believed that a functional educational system should have three purposes. It should:
    
    1. “provide all who want to learn with access to available resources at any time in their lives;
    2. empower all who want to share what they know to find those who want to learn it from them; and, finally,
    3. furnish all who want to present an issue to the public with the opportunity to make their challenge known.”
    
    The book was written to influence a societal change – not provide a manual or introduce a new educational approach. But many of his observations are still useful for the parent/educator.
    
    “Even most intentional learning,” Illich wrote, “is not the result of programmed instruction.” (In other words, you probably didn’t learn your best dance moves in PE class.)
    
    _Un_schooling, on the other hand, is an educational approach that individual families can adopt. Developed by an educator named John Holt (also in the 1970s), it argues for letting kids pursue their passions and learn through real-life experiences. Parents act more like tour guides than teachers, providing resources and support but letting the child lead the way.
    
    As Holt wrote, “Children learn from anything and everything they see. They learn wherever they are, not just in special learning places.”
    
    So while deschooling and unschooling aren’t identical twins, they do share some DNA. Both challenge traditional notions of education and emphasize self-directed learning. You could say deschooling is the big-picture relative always talking about changing the world, while unschooling is the cool aunt who lets you build rocket ships in the backyard.
    
    While these ideas might seem radical, they’ve influenced a great deal of mainstream education reform. The growth of project-based learning, personalized education plans, education savings accounts, and even OpenEd all owe a debt to these philosophies.

    ### 🎙️ **Sharpening Critical Thinking with Hannah Frankman**
    
- [Dr. Phil Just Mainstreamed Unschooling 😮 | OpenEd](https://www.notion.so/Dr-Phil-Just-Mainstreamed-Unschooling-OpenEd-5414932ef6b74b9fbcfba4c3a7967f8f?pvs=21)
    
    **But What About Socialization?’** 
    
    It’s the question that’s dogged alternative education for decades, deployed like a gotcha moment against anyone brave enough to question traditional schooling. The translation is clear: “You’re challenging what we’ve always done.” But the reality? Open learners engage with diverse age groups, interests, and communities – preparing them for the real world, not just the next grade level.
    
    ![](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-3.png)
    
    This week, that skepticism got a prime-time reality check when [Dr. Phil featured what he called “the fastest growing trend in American education”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S98fZa6Bh1Y&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=094-the-fastest-growing-trend-in-american-education): unschooling. The episode showcased a family living on a farm, where children learn through immersive experiences – from building fairy villages (geometry in disguise) to managing fires and caring for livestock.
    
    But the real story wasn’t on the screen – it was in the comments section. “I’m a former public school teacher with a Master’s Degree in Education,” wrote one viewer. “I left teaching in 2021… and I believe without a doubt that unschooling is the future of education.”
    
    Another noted, “We live in a day and age where information is free… It’s up to us as parents to take our children’s education into our own hands.”
    
    When this family first shared their unschooling journey on social media, the trolls came out: “Educational neglect!” “Save these children!” But their fury only proved the point: When you challenge people’s assumptions about learning, you discover how deep those assumptions run.
    
    ### Showing up ≠ learning.
    
    Take, for instance, our obsession with time in the classroom. Since the 1983 [“Nation at Risk” report](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED226006&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=093-time-isn-t-the-teacher), American education reform has focused relentlessly on keeping students in seats longer. The math seemed simple: **more hours = more learning.** Yet Finnish students – who consistently rank among the world’s highest performers – spend 5,500 fewer hours in class between ages 7-14 than American students. That’s nearly two full years less instructional time.
    
    Or, consider [Colorado’s Summit School, where students are learning two years of math in a year](https://www.educationnext.org/time-for-school-assessing-inequality-access-instructional-time-united-states/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=093-time-isn-t-the-teacher) (while spending less time in traditional instruction). Their secret? Small groups, personalized pathways, and focused attention on what works.
    
    A child deeply absorbed in solving a real problem for 30 minutes can learn more than one passively sitting through a 2-hour lecture.
    
    So how do we transition from a time-based model to one that emphasizes real learning? One possibility is emerging through technology. [Microsoft just released an AI reading tutor that might be the most patient teacher in history](https://coach.microsoft.com/en-us?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=097-dr-phil-just-mainstreamed-unschooling): it never needs a coffee break, never gets frustrated by repeated questions, and can generate endless personalized stories that match each child’s interests and reading level. As one educator noted this week, “If you are a professorial-style teacher, you will be out of a job. If you are a facilitator, it will enhance your practice.”
    
    But AI is just one piece of a larger transformation. Public schools themselves are evolving, shifting away from endless lecture halls toward what they do best: forums for discussion, peer interaction, laboratories, sports, marching band – all the things that are harder to replicate in a home-based learning environment. In Utah, for example, [Canyons School District just announced they’re opening their doors wider for part-time students](https://yeseverykidfoundation.org/why-public-schools-should-love-esas/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=095-the-power-of-yes-and). Want to take just engineering? Done. Need access to the robotics lab? No problem. Looking for marching band or sports? Come on in. A recent survey found that over 80% of families want this kind of customizable education, but only 38% feel they can currently achieve it.
    
    This brings us back to that perpetual, breathless question: “What about socialization???”
    
    A new answer is coming into focus: Traditional schools can be one venue for social interaction and community engagement – but they’re not the only way, and they never were. The future of education looks less like a set menu and more like a buffet – one where families can mix traditional classes with home learning, combine AI tutoring with human mentorship, and balance structured academics with real-world experiences.
    
    The old either/or thinking is giving way to a both/and future.

    When kids leave traditional school, they have to go through a deschooling process.
    
    Deschooling = unlearning all the bad habits you picked up in school.
    
    Some of the biggest habits kids need to unlearn:
    
    1. Being passive. Traditional school feeds you everything you need. Stand in line, follow the rules, and you'll do well. But if you want outsized results in the real world, you need to go take what you want. Kids need to learn how to take that ownership of their experience.
    2. Waiting for permission. Traditional school requires kids to ask for permission to do anything, from reading a book to going to the bathroom. The real world rewards those who don't wait for permission. Like the startup adage: "don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness."
    3. Deferring to authority. School teaches kids that the adult is always right. In reality, kids need to learn to trust their own judgment and opinions if they want to do well in life. When kids leave school, they have to learn to trust their own inner compass again.
    4. Learning to the test. School rewards late-night cramming and test-it-and-forget-it learning strategies. The only thing that matters is the test score. In the real world, kids need to learn to the task. What really matters is what they can *do* with the knowledge they gain.
    5. Doing the bare minimum to get by. It's easy to get by in school doing "just good enough." But the real world rewards excellence, not mediocrity. Kids need to learn to take pride in their work, and to go above and beyond in their work because they care about the outcome.
    
    The future of school won't be about passivity and permisison. It will be about raising kids who are enthusiastic and self-directed. The kind of education people like @mattbeaudreau, @kerry_edu, and @flowidealism are building.

    ### 00:00 Introduction to Alternative Education
    
    **Hannah:** We live in a very schooled society. Every homeschooler knows that you can learn everything you need to learn in two hours a day of studying. At the end of the day, the goal of an education is to enable your child to live a good life.
    
    **Isaac:** Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm Isaac Morehouse, the sometimes host. Today we have a very prominent voice in the education space. Hannah, welcome. Glad to have you.
    
    **Hannah:** It's exciting to be here, Isaac.
    
    ### 00:59 Meet Hannah: The Voice Behind Rebel Educator
    
    **Isaac:** First, I've got to ask you, I know how passionate you are about alternatives to education and your own homeschool experience, your experience with Praxis, which is a college alternative. When and how did you decide, "I've got to be loud about this. I've got to be a voice about this and get Rebel Educator off the ground"? What's the goal of Rebel Educator, and how did that come about?
    
    **Hannah:** I launched Rebel Educator a little over two years ago. But I've been talking about alternative education long before that. Working at Praxis is actually where I got my start in education commentary. I was writing blog posts for the marketing team, partly about my experience being homeschooled and then not going to college and starting to work in startups instead.
    
    That's when I started to realize that this was something I really liked talking about and that it was really important to talk about. There weren't nearly enough resources out there for parents. Rebel Educator was the culmination of a few years of writing independently about education and slowly formulating this hypothesis that if you really care about the future, the education of our children is one of the most important things to get right.
    
    **Isaac:** In those two years, you've gained about 140,000 followers on Twitter, and for good reason. You're putting out really great stuff. You have some very fun, kind of edgy, but very useful threads and tweets out there. I wanted to use a couple of those as jumping-off points for our discussion today. I'd like to get into three topics: deschooling, critical thinking, and use of pacing.
    
    ### 02:42 The Concept of Deschooling
    
    **Isaac:** Let's start with deschooling. Unschooling has become a popular concept that people have heard of, which is essentially letting your kids have maximum freedom to learn how they want and sort of do what they want and play, without prescribing a lot for them. Deschooling is something different that we used to talk about a lot at Praxis. It's the process of unlearning all the bad habits, primarily that you picked up in school.
    
    Even those of us who grew up homeschooled are in such a schooled society that a lot of the assumptions, mindsets, and beliefs about learning processes are just so pervasive throughout society. Even if you weren't in school, you have less deschooling needed. I used to say this when people would join the Praxis program: if they were homeschooled, we didn't need to take as long to have them unlearn a lot of things. They only needed to unlearn a few things. If they had spent their life in the public school system, or even the private school system, there was more deschooling that needed to be done before we could start to really teach them how to be successful in their career.
    
    You walk through a lot of these things that you think people need to unlearn. Dive into this for me. Walk me through some of these and how you've seen those play out, either in your own life or just with all the people you're interacting with.
    
    **Hannah:** I think you hit on a really important point in teeing up this question, which is that we live in a very schooled society. There's a great little book by Ivan Illich called "Deschooling Society" that everyone should read. The schooled mindset is a very cultural phenomenon. I was homeschooled first grade through 12th grade, barely set foot inside any normal education institution for my entire childhood, and I still had all kinds of mindsets that I'd picked up from the culture that I had to unlearn.
    
    I remember when I was a junior in high school, I took the PSAT because I thought maybe I was going to go to college. I checked that little box at the bottom of the test that said, "Yes, you colleges can send me mailings." I got boxes of pamphlets from colleges, and they were all talking about, "How are you going to change the world?" The language they used had a big impact on my 16-year-old brain as I was thinking about my career. I had to unlearn afterward that doing well in college does not equate to being successful in the real world, but I somehow picked up that I needed an equivalent to doing well in college in order to be okay.
    
    Even if a child is not immersed in the normal education system, they're still going to pick this stuff up. There's a really great book by John Taylor Gatto called "Dumbing Us Down." For those who are not yet familiar, Gatto was a public school teacher in New York City for 30 years. He worked in every type of school imaginable and won Teacher of the Year two years in a row. The second time he won, he accepted his nomination and resigned from his position all at the same time in the pages of the New York Times. He wrote this amazing piece about why he felt like he was doing more harm than good as a school teacher, and if he really wanted to help the youth, he had to find something else to do.
    
    ### 06:43 Implicit Lessons in Traditional Schooling
    
    **Hannah:** Gatto talks about this idea of secondary lessons or underpinning lessons that you're learning when you're in school. We think we send our kids to school and they're learning math, reading, writing, history, and how to solve geometrical equations. They are learning all of those things, but there are also implicit lessons baked into how school is structured.
    
    For example, you have to appease authority and please authority to be considered successful. You have to do things in the correct order and pass the test to have learned something. The measure of your success has nothing to do with what you can do in the real world; it has everything to do with how you're able to score on some standardized measure of your learning.
    
    There are all of these implicit lessons that kids are learning, and most of us go through our entire lives without ever unlearning these things. They're baked into how we engage with the adult world. We look for tests to pass and we look for the authority figure that we have to appease or please in order to get what we want.
    
    If we decide we want to make $100,000 a year, our mindset is, "Okay, we have to go find somebody who's happy enough with us that they will give us permission to make $100,000 a year. They'll sign their name on the dotted line and give us the checks." And that's how you're doing it successfully.
    
    People who have shed some of this mindset or never picked it up in the first place - and a lot of this is just because of personality and nature, less nurture - will be very entrepreneurial and see things very differently. They'll say, "I want to make a hundred thousand dollars this year. I wonder what I can do to make that money happen. Maybe I can launch a drop shipping business. Maybe I can sell an online course. Maybe there's a need in my local market to build a coffee shop or a car wash business that will have high margins and allow me to make $100,000." And those people are, in some ways, deschooled, sometimes not intentionally, but they haven't adopted some of these permission-based mindsets.
    
    **Isaac:** So sometimes the schooling doesn't stick. And often those are people that have an easier time in the market transitioning into roles where there isn't as much of a playbook. If you're not going to go into academia or government, most of those things don't translate very well.
    
    I think that's such a great point that you brought out. There are two different types of learning happening at all times in every situation. There's the explicit stuff - when you're sitting listening to a lecture, the content of what they're telling you. But implicitly in every environment, you are learning through conditioning: what is rewarded, what is praised, what is punished, what has a cost associated with it, what has a benefit associated with it.
    
    Just being aware that that is going on is such a huge thing to step back and consider for yourself and for your kids. It's easy to find the explicit things that are being taught and possibly learned, with varying degrees of success. But what are the implicit lessons that I grew up with? What things was I conditioned to? What was I rewarded for socially, financially, with attention, and what things was I steered away from?

    - Blog Post
        
        
        Hey Eddies,
        
        In certain circles—especially among those rethinking education—Dr. Peter Gray is a living legend. His 2013 book *Free to Learn* became foundational for parents questioning how we educate children. 
        
        Last week, Ela sat down with him for one of the most eye-opening conversations we've had on this podcast.
        
        I know words like “revolutionary” and “eye-opening” get thrown around a lot. Every YouTube video and clickbait article promises to blow your mind and reveal “The shocking truth about X.” 
        
        We didn’t title this episode “The shocking truth about school’s effect on mental health.” But we could have. 
        
        If you're going to listen to one episode this year, make it this one. If you prefer reading, check out the transcript and article version below.
        
        One important note: this conversation touches on sensitive topics related to youth mental health, including anxiety, depression, and suicide. Peter approaches these issues thoughtfully, grounding his perspective in decades of research, but listener discretion is advised!
        
        # Every August, Youth Mental Health Crises Spike. Every June They Plummet. It’s Not a Coincidence.
        
        **Ela Richmond** *OpenEd Podcast*
        
        ---
        
        Every year, right around late May, something statistically unusual happens.
        
        [Teen mental health improves](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10969660/). Emergency room visits for anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and intentional self-harm [drop dramatically](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK552668/) from May through July. Psychiatric hospitalizations decline. Kids breathe easier.
        
        Then August hits. School starts. And it all comes roaring back.
        
        Dr. Peter Gray has been watching this pattern for decades. He's a biopsychologist and the author of *Free to Learn*, published in 2013—a book that became foundational for parents questioning how we educate children. He's spent his career researching how children naturally learn through play, why freedom makes them happier, and what happens when we systematically take that freedom away.
        
        What he's discovered contradicts the story we've been telling ourselves.
        
        Researchers in Canada tracked over 20,000 children and documented the same phenomenon year after year. Mental health admissions plummet when school ends. They spike when it resumes.
        
        Of course, correlation doesn't prove causation. Couldn't it have something to do with the season? Perhaps, but even during COVID lockdowns, the same pattern held. When schools closed in March 2020, mental health improved across the board. It only got worse again when kids returned to in-person classrooms.
        
        When you ask teenagers what's stressing them out, 83% cite one thing.
        
        Not TikTok. Not Instagram.
        
        We've been pointing our worry at screens while ignoring what the data keeps screaming at us.
        
        ---
        
        READ MORE
        
        ## Why School Gets a Free Pass
        
        "As a culture,” Gray tells me, “we would far rather blame social media than blame school.” 
        
        He refers to an undeserved “halo” around school that blinds us to what’s happening. We see our kids glued to phones and assume that's the problem. We *don't* see what happens when school closes for the summer and they suddenly seem lighter. We don't connect the dots, but they’ve been getting more visible for almost 70 years.
        
        The rise in anxiety and depression among young people didn't start in 2010. It didn't start with smartphones or social media. It's been happening [since the 1950s](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2888013/).
        
        By 1990, rates of anxiety and depression among young people were **5 to 8 times higher than they were in 1950**. That's 40 years of gradual, continuous decline in youth mental health—decades before Instagram existed.
        
        Between 1990 and 2000, those rates actually *got better*. Kids' mental health improved significantly. Then it leveled off from 2000 to 2010, only to spike again after 2010.
        
        If social media caused the crisis, why did mental health improve during the decade when the internet arrived? And why did things get worse starting in 2010? Peter suggests a different narrative.
        
        ## **The Decline of Freedom**
        
        Between 1950 and 1990, childhood transformed. The school year increased by five weeks. Homework, which was rare in the 1950s, became standard. Organized sports replaced free play. Television brought kids indoors. Families got smaller, but houses got bigger, so children had no need to leave them.
        
        Every single change eliminated children's freedom. They had no space to play, explore, fail, or figure things out on their own. And mental health declined in lockstep.
        
        The next act in the story comes with the advent of the personal computer.
        
        By the early 1990s, most teenagers had access to computers. By the mid-to-late 90s, they had internet connections. Peter frames this as a new outlet for kids to escape adult micromanagement. They could play games, explore, and interact with peers without constant supervision.
        
        "Computer games are real play, people," Peter said, challenging the panic many parents feel about screen time. "Adults want to demonize them, but that's not the science."
        
        What is the science around video games? The kids who played computer games in the 1990s were doing better psychologically than kids who didn't. 
        
        For a decade, kids had breathing room again. And mental health improved.
        
        Fast forward to 2010. Mental health starts declining again right around the time that smartphones became ubiquitous and social media exploded.
        
        And suddenly, we had ourselves a convenient new scapegoat.
        
        Except, Peter says, [the data doesn't support it](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7012622/).
        
        ## **School Is the Variable**
        
        Hundreds of studies have examined the correlation between social media, smartphone use, and mental health decline among young people. Meta-analyses show [small to moderate correlations at best](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032720323727)—some show slight positive effects, some show slight negative effects. Overall, they largely cancel out.
        
        Furthermore, the United States and the UK are the only two developed countries that experienced this recent mental health spike. Europe adopted smartphones and social media just as quickly but mental health among Kids in France, Germany, and Spain actually *improved* during the same period when it worsened in the US. While the US implemented Common Core—limiting teacher flexibility, increasing standardized testing, and ramping up academic pressure—European educational systems maintained more balanced approaches. In short, it wasn't the phones. It was what was happening inside schools.
        
        None of Peter’s work is intended as an attack on teachers or administrators. His critique is structural.
        
        "We have convinced children that how they're doing in school is a measure of them," Peter explained. "That they are constantly being judged. They're constantly being assessed. They're being compared to others. They're being made to feel like, if I am a failure at school, I'm a failure as a human being."
        
        That constant assessment creates a baseline of anxiety that never fully lifts. Until summer, when it does for 10 glorious weeks of freedom. 
        
        ## Self-Directed Education
        
        The purpose of childhood, according to Peter's research in evolutionary biology, is straightforward: to become independent adults. Children are born totally dependent. The extended childhood period exists for them to gradually develop the capacity to take care of themselves. They need time to do things alone. They need to interact with other children away from adults, learning to get along with peers without supervision. They need to solve their own problems and live with the consequences.
        
        But ever since the 1950s, we've been systematically eliminating those opportunities. Children are monitored and directed by adults constantly. We've scheduled every hour, optimized every activity, turned childhood into a resume-building exercise instead of a crucible for developing capability.
        
        It’s no surprise that kids in more open, self-directed education environments—where they follow their own interests and solve their own problems—show better outcomes than kids in traditional school. They're happier, more capable, more resilient.
        
        "If instead of dropping out of school, students transition to self-directed education—where they follow their own interests with support—they do far better," Peter said.
        
        This is exactly what open education is all about. We believe in providing kids with enough structure to still give them the freedom to explore their curiosities and develop into their own unique human beings. It's about creating environments where children can discover who they are while building the skills they need to thrive.
        
        Peter offered concrete starting points:
        
        ### Make Children Responsible for Their Own Activities
        
        - **Stop being your child's calendar keeper.** Tell them directly: "I'm not your calendar keeper. That's your job. If you need a ride and can't get there yourself, I'll provide it—but you have to remind me."
        - **Use this as a test of genuine interest.** If you have to constantly remind them about an activity, they're probably not genuinely interested in it. Children who truly care about something will remember it themselves.
        - **Let activities drop if they forget.** This approach helps identify which extracurricular activities children actually want versus which ones they feel pressured to attend. Many kids are in far more scheduled activities than they should be and don't have time to do things themselves.
        
        ### Encourage Independent Mobility
        
        - **Children should walk or bike when possible.** Even kindergarteners used to walk to school. This builds both independence and physical health. Now even teenagers don't walk anywhere.
        - **Use public transportation.** If a destination is too far to walk or bike, children should learn to take public transportation rather than always relying on parents for rides.
        - **Start early with outdoor independence.** In the 1950s, even four-year-olds were sent on errands. By age 8, children should be walking to school. By age 10, they should be able to do some shopping independently.
        - **Recognize the environmental and developmental costs of driving everywhere.** Parents driving kids everywhere wastes time, pollutes the atmosphere, and deprives children of fresh air and exercise—all while preventing them from developing the independent mobility they need.
        
        In short, give children back unstructured time. They need it more than they need another activity.
        
        The pattern is too consistent to ignore. The data is too clear. School isn't just correlated with anxiety—it's causing it. Mental health improves when school is out. It declines when school is in. Social media use stays constant. School is the variable.
        
        We've been looking in the wrong direction. The answer isn't taking away phones. It's giving back freedom—the very thing childhood is supposed to provide.
        
    
    ```jsx
    (00:00-00:05)
    PETER: We have convinced children that how they're doing a school
    is a measure of them. That they are constantly being judged.
    They're constantly being assessed. They're being compared to others.
    
    (00:05-00:13)
    PETER: Every year, this has been true for a long time. Every year,
    the rate of suicide and the rate of admission into mental hospitals,
    emergency admissions for pediatric mental health emergencies plummets.
    It goes way down. Every summer, school closes and the kids are doing
    better. School opens up and it gets worse again.
    
    (00:13-00:15)
    PETER: School is a direct cause of anxiety and depression.
    
    (00:15-00:28)
    ELA: So when they asked teenagers what's stressing them out...
    
    PETER: 83% Check school. Nothing else came close.
    
    ```

- **Hook:** Ken invites teens to walk away from school, then flips the classic “are they ready?” objection.
- **Edited Transcript:**
    
    In our first meeting I say to them, oh, I'm sorry you don't like school. Have you ever considered not going?
    
    We're not school.
    
    I don't wanna be in charge of you. You can come here whenever you want. You can leave whenever you want. You can have your phone. You can have your food. Leave me alone. And, uh, and, and you can, um, use us just as you please.
    
    Are born ready for that autonomy. What kind of question is that? I'm gonna yell at you now. Why are kids ready to be allowed to choose how to spend their time? Stop it. That's insulting.
    
    Culture where asking people if they want to do stuff is kind of normal.
    
    Schooling is the abnormal thing. I'm just turning your question around 180 degrees and being like, why would you consider the kookiness of school to be normal?
    
    And, and asking kids what they wanna learn to be abnormal. That's insane.

## Clip 2: "Two Options When School Is Breaking Your Kid"

- **Segments:** 39:37-41:37, 45:17-46:20 (polished transcript)
- **Hook:** Ken hands parents a pragmatic playbook—stay for friendships or leave entirely—and reframes defiance as healthy data.
- **Edited Transcript:**
    - **Ken Danford:** Option one: stay in school for the social piece. Let your kid get lousy grades if that keeps their friends. Assume they’ll leave eventually, grab a GED, and move on. Use the school like a community center and ignore the threats. Option two: pull them out, stack after-school arts, jobs, volunteering, online classes. Relatives will think you’re ruining your kid. They’re wrong. There’s no “falling behind” when the conventional path is hurting them.
    - **Ken Danford:** If you think something’s wrong, you’re probably right. Your kid’s refusal is likely a healthy response. Listen to them. Brainstorm alternatives, including leaving the place demanding senseless things. Celebrate the squeaky wheel—it’s your child standing up for themselves.

*Sunderland, Mass.*

In the fall of 2016, as her daughter struggled through a disastrous first two weeks in middle school, Emily Harding-Morick searched for a way out.

In class, students sat in desks far apart from one another, with barely a moment to chat between periods. During breaks, monitors herded them through the halls with no time to find a bathroom.

“She was just so unhappy,” the mother recalled.

That’s when Harding-Morick called Kenneth Danford.

The veteran educator wasted no time, telling her 13-year-old, “You know, yesterday could be your last day of school.”

They were stunned, but Danford persisted: “You don’t have to go back.”

That began a journey that has become increasingly routine in this region: Harding-Morick disenrolled her daughter from middle school and she joined North Star Teens. Guided by Danford, North Star’s co-founder, she spent a year there studying, relaxing and socializing with a small group of like-minded teenagers. Her mother joined its board, eventually becoming its chair.

At its most basic, North Star is a small, private homeschooling collective for middle- and high-schoolers who know they don’t want to go to school anymore, but aren’t sure what comes next.

### [Reinventing High School: 8 Common Trends at America’s Most Innovative Campuses](https://www.the74million.org/article/campus-road-trip-diary-8-things-we-learned-this-year-about-americas-most-innovative-high-schools/)

As more families question the value of school — and as states and the federal government increasingly offer taxpayer dollars for other options — models like North Star’s could take root beyond western Massachusetts’ Pioneer Valley. As it nears three decades in operation, Danford is moving to replicate it.

For 29 years, the private, non-profit center — don’t call it a school — has been a refuge for kids who chafe at the stress, loneliness or bullying of school. They spend a few months or a few years here, catching their breath as they prepare for life after graduation.

With an enrollment of 65, it offers rigorous, one-on-one tutoring; small, personalized classes in history, math, writing and the arts, and extracurriculars like weekly hiking club excursions. This year, young people designed and taught three courses on Dungeons & Dragons.

Or “members,” as they’re called, can simply show up and read a book, sit with friends, take the public bus into nearby Amherst or curl up on the couch with a bowl of ramen. All that’s required is a weekly check-in with an advisor and regular conferences with families.

But that freedom comes with a healthy dose of self-examination. Danford regularly reminds members, “You’re accountable to yourself. Is this the life you want?”

With a tuition scale that slides from $10,000 annually down to whatever a family can afford, North Star has been a quiet presence in the region since its founding in 1996. It has moved three times since then, but in 2015 landed in a faded two-story structure on State Highway 116 that once housed a used furniture store and a Subway sandwich shop. 

North Star functions like a gym, social club or even a religious institution: Attendance is encouraged but optional. Members can take classes or not. There are no grades, no transcripts or tests, no roll call and no diploma.

Most who seek refuge here have good reason: They’ve been bullied or they’re on the autism spectrum and seeking a smaller, calmer venue. Or they’re LGBTQ and simply don’t feel comfortable at school.

“Some of them are just your non-conformist, skateboarder-poet-musician kids who think, ‘School?’ They roll their eyes,” said Danford. “We tend not to get your football player, cheerleader, sports team kids who want to be popular in school. But we get all the kids they pick on.”

Marley Bernstein, 16, faced years of bullying at a school she said was ill-equipped to stop it. So she stopped going, missing 120 days last year and 64 this year.

She arrived at North Star in late May, filing paperwork to pursue a GED.

“I feel better being here,” she said one recent morning in the large common room. “It’s nice to just sit. You can walk around, you can kind of do whatever you want and not have to look over your shoulder every two minutes.”

Nearby, friends Asha Morbyrne and Tasha Harris chatted. Tasha confided that “a lot of people here are traumatized,” to which her friend replied, “A lot of people. Middle school is a violent place.” 

Both 13, they confided that they’re here mostly to spend time together, occupying their days slurping ramen and rough-housing in the dance studio upstairs.

“This is, like, the only place I have a functioning friend group,” said Asha. 

“Same!” said Tasha.

But beneath the apparent slacking, Danford said, is often a quiet purpose. Last fall, Asha wrote a short play that she recently produced at a local theater, while Tasha learned to swim and is a regular on Thursday hikes.

Others arrive seemingly ready for anything. Joshua Wachtel began teaching at North Star in 2010, and last year brought along his stepson Lysander Woodard, who wanted an alternative to sixth grade.

The 12-year-old is trying a bit of everything. He joined a recent service learning trip to Washington, D.C., and is getting tutoring via Khan Academy. He took all three D&D classes, as well as one on the *Star Wars* canon taught by an adult.

“The freedom is nice,” Lysander said.

Danford urges supporters and skeptics alike to look past the unusual structure and “keep your eyes on the prize.” It isn’t regular attendance or even being a member of the community, he said. “The prize is independent control of your life.”

### Flipping the unschooling paradigm

A powerfully built Gen Xer from Ohio, Danford got straight As in high school in Shaker Heights, a prosperous Cleveland suburb. He cut his teeth teaching social studies in public middle schools in the Washington, D.C., area and in Amherst, but soon grew weary of micromanagement from administrators. 

He left to earn his master’s degree, and was considering leaving education altogether when he read Grace Llewelyn’s seminal 1991 guide [The Teenage Liberation Handbook](https://teenageliberation.space/). Subtitled “How to Quit School and Get a Real Life and Education,” it changed his thinking about student agency, offering a template for young people searching for a different kind of education outside of school, a strategy often called “[unschooling](https://unschoolers.org/what-is-unschooling/).”

> 

Most unschoolers were younger, returning to school by ninth grade. But to Danford, high school was where kids could benefit most from its freedom as they separate from parents and find themselves as individuals.

He essentially flipped the paradigm: “If you made it through elementary school, why don’t you quit while you’re ahead? Make it to sixth grade and *then* quit. Unschool the rest of the way.”

It helps that the state of Massachusetts takes a hands-off approach to homeschoolers and largely stops supervising them once they’re 16.

“You don’t like school?” he tells prospective members, “Don’t go back. Don’t ever go back in the building. Send someone in to get your books. I help families write a homeschooling plan. Do it tonight, this week.”

### ‘I just could not stop crying.’

For Trixie Lawless, enrolling in North Star was a no-brainer. Her mother had worked there as a teacher and knew its benefits. But she had to persuade her father.

By sophomore year, she’d spent a lot of time skipping classes at her high school in Amherst. “I enjoyed my day,” she said, reading, writing short stories, taking in movies or museums.

“I was like, ‘I’m homeschooling right now. If I just had a math tutor, I would be fine.’”

But skipping all those classes meant pointless makeup work and the black mark of unexcused absences. While it was mostly worth it, the prospect of another year in school eventually took a toll.

While visiting family last summer in Connecticut, she recalled, “I just could not stop crying.” Even for Trixie, this was a shock. She can usually hide her emotions, “even when I’m feeling really horrible. So when it got to that breaking point, where it was like, ‘I can’t even keep up with myself anymore,’ that was the first time I’d ever really let it through.”

Her father took notice. Trixie enrolled in the fall. 

Having time to herself in a community of people who all want to be here, she said, is “so much nicer. It definitely wouldn’t be for everyone, but it has given me the space I knew I needed to feel better.”

She’s now studying for the GED with plans to start classes at Greenfield Community College in the fall. After a year at North Star, she’s beginning to appreciate how different members experience the center. 

“It’s about how you fill the space — a lot of people here do that by playing video games and organizing D&D campaigns.” She does it by oversubscribing to English and writing classes. “It’s a place for people who know what works for them.”

### Second-generation members

By now, the center has been around long enough that it’s beginning to serve the children of its original members. One even teaches there: Aaron Damon-Rush arrived at North Star in 2011, when he was just 11, and stayed for seven years. He went on to attend nearby Hampshire College and returned in 2022 as alumni coordinator. Now 25, he teaches courses in film, game design and other disciplines.

At North Star, he took classes in psychology and criminal justice, learning about the morality of the death penalty and victims’ rights when he was just 12. “That was a huge, mind-blowing experience for me,” he said.

In lieu of finals and graduation, each member sits for a meeting with their parents and a handful of staffers where they review the year. They often find it’s their best year of schooling, even though they’re technically not in school. Parents speak tearfully of their kids opening up about classes for the first time, Danford said.

“It is all fantastic, even the hard cases,” he said.

As North Star nears its 30th anniversary, Danford, who’s 59, is nearly two-thirds of the way through what he calls a 45-year plan: In the first 15 years, he built it; in the second, he worked to make it run increasingly without him. Now he’s planning to step away so he can write, speak and consult with other educators who want to create something similar. 

A network of [Liberated Learners](https://liberatedlearners.net/) centers, loosely affiliated with North Star, already boasts about a dozen locations worldwide. And Danford continues to offer the same message to weary young people who show up at his door.

“Just take the year, breathe, wonder what you should be doing,” he said. “Meanwhile we’re gonna unlock the door and give you a couch — and we’ll be nice to you. Turns out that’s really healthy and responsible.” 

While most mainstream educators would say letting young people “do nothing” for a year is out of the question, he sees it differently: In the unschooling world, he said, “there’s no such thing as ‘doing nothing.’ ”
