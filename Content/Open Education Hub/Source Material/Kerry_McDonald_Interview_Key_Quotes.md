# Kerry McDonald Interview - Key Quotes on Open Education

## Open Education Thesis (Restated)

Open education is a proven method that gives parents and children the power to direct, adjust, and navigate learning in ways that work best for them. It recognizes that:

- **Students are not standard** - Each child is unique with different learning styles, paces, and needs
- **Parents are the primary owners** of their child's education, not the school system
- **Education happens everywhere** - Learning is not confined to traditional classrooms
- **Flexibility and choice are essential** - Families should be able to customize and combine different educational approaches
- **One-size-fits-all doesn't work** - The factory model of education fails to serve many students
- **The lines are blurring** - Traditional categories like "public," "private," "homeschool" are becoming less relevant as families create hybrid approaches

## Key Themes and Quotes from Kerry McDonald Interview

### Theme 1: Well-Schooled But Not Well-Educated

**Kerry's Realization:**
> "I looked back on my education experience and said, wow, I was really well-schooled, but I don't feel well-educated."

**The Pivotal Moment:**
> "I think one of the things I loved college and when I went to college, I think it was really where I rekindled my natural love of learning and reading and all of that. I felt like in the public school system, I was checking boxes. I was doing what I was told. I was doing well, as you said. I was succeeding, but I never read for pleasure. I was always just sort of what I needed to do to get the A to move on to the next step."

**The Comparison:**
> "Never before had I sort of seen side by side this conventional classrooms group of second graders and this homeschooled second grader. And it just couldn't have been more stark... It's the sort of the age-segregated classroom and the top-down curriculum and the focus on order and compliance and obedience over creativity and curiosity and originality."

---

### Theme 2: The Economics of Education Choice

**The Question That Started Everything:**
> "One of the things that happened as I was studying economics was I started to wonder, why do we have so much choice and variety in so many of the sort of market-based parts of our lives that are operating within a free market, but we don't seem to have that choice and variety when it comes to education."

**The Connection:**
> "I sort of started going down that rabbit hole of, okay, so most of education is centrally controlled. It's government run in most cases. That's probably why we're not seeing that same level of personalization and variety in education."

---

### Theme 3: The Pandemic as Catalyst

**The Perfect Storm:**
> "There were all of these trends happening before 2020. And then when schools shut down and learning went remote for all of America's school children, all of a sudden parents started to have to be creative. They realized they had to start taking matters into their own hands because schools were in most places staying closed into the fall of 2020."

**The Rise of Pandemic Pods:**
> "You saw in the summer of 2020, this rise of pandemic pods, these sort of spontaneous parent-driven learning communities, parents saying, wow, you know, I have to look at what I need to do for my kids so that they can continue to learn, so they can have safe social interactions. So there was a real sense of parent empowerment."

**The Eye-Opening Experience:**
> "That was occurring alongside remote learning as parents really for the first time in many cases got an up close view of what was actually happening in their students' classrooms. Some of it was dissatisfaction that they observed with the curriculum or the behaviors of teachers or students. But a lot of it from the parents and founders that I've talked to was, hey, I can do this. Like this isn't rocket science."

---

### Theme 4: The Three Preconditions for Action

**Isaac's Framework Applied:**
> "Isaac: The premise... that maybe it was the dissatisfaction with the status quo that's driven all this innovation is not entirely untrue. But I think what you teased out is you're sharing like what you're hearing from people who are actually starting micro schools... was more about what they saw they could do."

**Ludwig von Mises's Three Conditions:**
> "Isaac: My favorite economist Ludwig von Mises talks about three preconditions for humans taking any action: you have to have dissatisfaction with the status quo, a vision of something better, and a belief in your ability to get there. And if you don't have all three of those conditions, you're not gonna act."

**The Pandemic Fulfilled the Third Condition:**
> "Isaac: When the pandemic hit, you suddenly were forced to be the one that tried to help your kids get education in some way, and you just realized, hey, I can get there. And that third condition was fulfilled. Okay, the dissatisfaction is there and I can see something better. And guess what? I actually can do it."

**The Realization:**
> "Isaac: The number of parents I heard say, yeah, my kid kind of just like didn't do anything for the first several weeks when school was canceled. And it didn't really hurt them. They were okay... And that realization that kids are gonna be okay, they can learn with more freedom and less structure and that parents are gonna be okay, the burden is not maybe as heavy as you thought it was."

---

### Theme 5: The Explosion of Accessible Options

**Low-Cost Private Schools:**
> "What you see now, though, is that there are these, there's this tremendous explosion of low cost private schools. And again, with the rise of school choice policies, many of these schools are tuition free or nearly so, making them much more accessible to more families."

**The Homeschool Collaborative Model:**
> "Homeschooling becomes more accessible because many of these micro schools I talk about are actually collaboratives of homeschoolers where you can attend part-time or full-time as a up to a full-time schooling alternative at a fraction of the cost of a traditional private school."

---

### Theme 6: Early Adopters to Mainstream

**Choosing Alternative from the Start:**
> "One of the exciting trends that I'm seeing more recently is that in micro school founders I've talked to they say that their early classes, their kindergarten classes and first grade classes are filling with students who've never before been in a conventional classroom. So these are parents who are choosing unconventional education right out of the gate."

**The Shift in Perception:**
> "Isaac: Growing up homeschooled, people would look at you like you had two heads and right to your face be like, well, you're not gonna be able to socialize... 15 years ago, when our kids are very young and we're homeschooling them, people would look at us like, well, I think I have a friend who did that. That kind of worked well for some people. Fast forward to today, the predominant response we get when we tell parents we homeschooled is, I wish I could do that."

**Moving Along the Adoption Curve:**
> "I think to your point of sort of the adoption, what is it, the diffusion innovation curve, or it talks about early adopters and then early majority, late majority, I think we're moving along that curve because now you're having families see this as a viable option at the very beginning."

**The Middle Majority:**
> "Isaac: You kinda had like, sort of elites as like a luxury good doing these alternatives, and then all the way on the other end, people who are... and now I think kinda like that middle majority, just sort of the average person in the suburbs, middle class, just starting to break in and realize that this is something that's viable for them as well."

---

### Theme 7: Parents No Longer Tolerating One-Size-Fits-All

**The Personalization Expectation:**
> "I think more and more parents are realizing that they have these options, that they're accessible, that they're high quality, that they can really find personalization and education the way they have in all other areas of their lives."

**The Bottom Line:**
> "Parents are just no longer putting up with sort of an outdated one size fits all mass schooling system. You know, when on their smartphones, they have so much personalization and customization, and yet they don't have that in their children's education, I think they're just not tolerating it anymore."

---

### Theme 8: The Blurring of Lines

**The Definitional Challenge:**
> "Isaac: The breakdown in these walls has been a really interesting thing to observe. It makes it harder to talk about these things, which is inconvenient for people like us who do a lot of talking and writing about them. But as a parent in the trenches, I don't care what you call it. I just need to have all the tools available on the table."

**Public vs. Private vs. Homeschool:**
> "Kerry: Even pre-2020, this was happening. But I'll often hear people say, well, what do you mean? You're a homeschooler, but you can go to this school five days a week. And I guess that's a microschool. Some microschools run as programs for students who are legally homeschoolers. Some microschools run as state-recognized private schools. So you're right. There's all of this overlap and muddiness around these definitions."

**Isaac on the Continuum:**
> "You know, even take something that seems as clear cut as public or private. Okay, well public is maybe run by the government and private isn't. Well, then you've got things that are funded by the government like charter schools, but they're privately run. Then the lines blur further... And some of these things... it's really interesting, even online or in person, well, it's kind of a little bit of both."

---

### Theme 9: Regulatory Barriers and Creative Workarounds

**The Nevada Example:**
> "One of the states that's the most difficult to launch, in particular, a secular private school is Nevada because they have occupational licensing requirements. You cannot open a private school, a secular private school in the state of Nevada unless you have a state teacher or administrator license. One of the only states in which that's the case. Yeah, church-based schools are exempt from this."

**The Workaround:**
> "Isaac: So you gotta found a new religion and do it that way as a religion."

**The Solution:**
> "So thankfully, Nevada has some of the most flexible homeschooling laws in the country. And so many of these founders have turned around and created microschools for homeschoolers that essentially work as these low cost private schools for homeschoolers. But the parents are ultimately the ones complying with homeschool regulations."

**Micro is Scalable:**
> "Right now, you know, the latest data that I've gotten from the National Microschooling Center, which is based in Las Vegas, they tell me that there's about 25 or 30 micro schools kind of in the 10 mile radius around the Las Vegas strip serving some 700 students at the moment. So, you know, micro is scalable. It's just that a lot of these programs are scaling small. You know, there's just many of them now."

**The Entrepreneurial Spirit:**
> "Isaac: Entrepreneurs always find really creative ways to like figure it out anyway and fill in those gaps. And you have all these bizarre things happening... But despite them, entrepreneurs always find really creative ways to like figure it out anyway."

---

### Theme 10: Founders Choosing Flexibility Over Formality

**Why Not Become a Private School?:**
> "I've talked to some of these founders who are running essentially five day a week programs for homeschoolers, including in states where they could run a private school relatively easily... And I'll say to them, have you thought about becoming a recognized private school? You're essentially operating like a private school anyway. Why not just become a private school? It's not that hard."

**The Response:**
> "And they'll say to me inevitably, we don't want a traditional schooling model. We want the parents to be empowered to educate their children how they choose. We want them to be able to have the freedom to travel and not be focused on compulsory school attendance laws. We want parents to be able to choose part-time options if they'd like to do that, pick and choose among different days of the week."

**The Goal:**
> "So the founders themselves want that freedom and flexibility that can be found through homeschooling, again, where parents are legally the ones responsible for their children's education, and they don't, in many cases, have any desire to become a recognized private school."

---

### Theme 11: Technology as an Enabler

**The Role of Free Resources:**
> "I do think it's important to recognize technology as such a key tool to enabling the growth of these unconventional educational models that now we're able to tap into such extraordinary, in some cases, free or low cost software, like you mentioned Khan Academy, entirely free that has a great sort of mastery based approach to learning, particularly in math, but other subjects as well."

**The One-Room Schoolhouse Redux:**
> "That just makes these unconventional spaces able to do what they're going to do in many cases because they don't need to have a calculus teacher and a physics teacher. And they don't have to sort of know all of the content in their one room schoolhouse. They can leverage technology in these really clever ways."

**A Market-Based Approach to Screen Time:**
> "I think what we're seeing is a much more market-based approach to education. So a founder of a low-cost private school, micro school, homeschool collaborative will have sort of their own vision for education. And maybe that vision will be unlimited screen time, or maybe that vision would be some parameters around screens... The founders create policies around screens in their programs and then let the market decide."

---

### Theme 12: Competition Improves Traditional Schools

**The Public School Adaptation:**
> "Isaac: What's cool about all this unfolding too is that it forces traditional private schools and public schools to improve and to innovate a little bit... Public schools realize that they're gonna have to, like, hey, maybe this kid's gonna not be in the system for part of the time, but if we want them in our system at all, we gotta be a little bit more flexible."

**The Reality of Flexibility:**
> "Isaac: Kids that will just literally take one period or one class at a public school that they really like, that has a really good teacher and they want to be a part of it, but they want to do the rest of it on their own, or public school students that their parents travel for work and they'll travel for a month and then come back. And like, that's actually okay. Most people don't know that."

**The Catch-Up Effect:**
> "I talked to a lot of founders who get students from traditional public schools who will say that they come to them several grade levels behind in many cases. And then they're quickly able, the students are quickly able to catch up to grade level or beyond because of that individualized learning, because of mastery based academics."

---

### Theme 13: The Hard Truth About Dissatisfaction

**Why People Stayed in the System:**
> "I think for a lot of families, they just swallowed their dissatisfaction prior to COVID and its aftermath because they didn't really have a choice, right? They were compelled under a legal threat of force to send their children to an assigned district school and or pay really, really high tuition for a private school that looked basically the same in many cases."

**The Barriers:**
> "There were lots of barriers to those other options. And so they ended up sending their kids to these local schools, even if they weren't the best fit."

---

### Theme 14: The Data on Growth

**Current Numbers:**
> "If we look at data coming out of the Johns Hopkins University homeschool hub... They're reporting up to about 6% of America's school age population is now homeschooled. About 11% are in private school and about 7% are in charter schools."

**The Trajectory:**
> "Those numbers are going to go up. All of those."

**School Choice Eligibility:**
> "Currently, EdChoice estimates about a little over a third, over 20 million students are eligible or will soon be eligible for a private school choice program."

**The Momentum:**
> "As more and more families expect more options, then I think we're going to see the continued expansion of school choice policies and the continued growth of these new schools and spaces."

**Isaac's Context:**
> "And those numbers have grown fast. If I recall that homeschooling number of 3.5 million, it was like 2.1 million like five years ago. So we're talking some serious, serious growth happening."

---

### Theme 15: The Open Ed Survey Data

**Coming from Traditional Schools:**
> "Isaac: We just did a survey of open ed families and we had almost a thousand people respond and asking if they had, if their kid had ever been in a traditional school setting. And over 55% of them said yes, their kids had been in a traditional school setting before they did open ed."

**Hard to Go Back:**
> "And then we asked how likely would you be to enroll your child in a traditional school system again in the future? And about 80% said unlikely. So it's really interesting. People come and go, but like once you've kind of seen the flexibility you can get with all these various permutations of homeschooling, microschooling, et cetera, it is really hard to go back."

**The Exception:**
> "With the exception that oftentimes there's a high school thing where like if the kids really want to go be in the high school, that's kind of a common thing."

## Conclusion

Kerry McDonald's journey from economics major to leading voice in alternative education perfectly illustrates how open education is driven by:

1. **Economic thinking applied to education** - Recognizing the power of markets, choice, and personalization
2. **The pandemic as catalyst** - Not creating dissatisfaction, but revealing what was possible and empowering parents
3. **The blurring of categories** - Public/private/homeschool distinctions becoming less meaningful as families create hybrid approaches
4. **Technology as enabler** - Free and low-cost tools making personalized education accessible to all
5. **Entrepreneurial innovation** - Founders finding creative ways around regulatory barriers
6. **The shift to mainstream** - Moving from early adopters to the "middle majority"
7. **Parental empowerment** - Parents realizing they are capable and refusing to accept one-size-fits-all

The numbers tell the story: 3.5 million homeschoolers (up from 2.1 million five years ago), over 20 million students eligible for school choice programs, and a movement that shows no signs of slowing down.

As Kerry puts it: "Parents are just no longer putting up with sort of an outdated one-size-fits-all mass schooling system."
