# Jon England Interview - Key Quotes on Open Education

## Open Education Thesis (Restated)

Open education is a proven method that gives parents and children the power to direct, adjust, and navigate learning in ways that work best for them. It recognizes that:

- **Students are not standard** - Each child is unique with different learning styles, paces, and needs
- **Parents are the primary owners** of their child's education, not the school system
- **Education happens everywhere** - Learning is not confined to traditional classrooms
- **Flexibility and choice are essential** - Families should be able to customize and combine different educational approaches
- **One-size-fits-all doesn't work** - The factory model of education fails to serve many students

## Key Themes and Quotes from Jon England Interview

### Theme 1: The Rigidity Problem - When Systems Fail Students

**Jon's Experience as a Teacher and Principal:**
> "I became frustrated as a teacher because I felt like there were all these rules on me as a teacher to be able to make the changes I wanted to for the lives of the children that I was serving. And so I became a principal thinking I could remove some of those rules. I could make things easier. What I found was that being a principal made me a middle manager, and I was just supposed to do whatever the district told me to do, rather than what I knew was best for kids."

**The Layers of Bureaucracy:**
> "If you think about a public school classroom, you have the federal government who's making laws. The federal department of education is making rules about those laws. Then the state government is making laws about what has to happen inside of a classroom. The state board of education then makes rules about those laws. The local school district then makes rules and laws... And all that culminates in a classroom... Teachers are feeling like their hands are tied."

**The Result:**
> "The good teachers just decide to be civilly disobedient and do what they think is best. And the okay teachers will try their best to follow that."

---

### Theme 2: Parents as Primary Decision Makers

**The Core Principle:**
> "I didn't think that was right. I'm not the child's parent, I shouldn't be making that decision as a school principal. The parents should."

**Jon's Controversial Opinion:**
> "This is a controversial opinion as a public school teacher... parents should be able to choose what schools they go to, even if it's a different public school and who their teacher is. Like most public schools don't allow for those things. And you know, this is somebody who's spending a significant amount of time with your child. You should be able to have a voice in that decision."

**Isaac's Insight on Choice:**
> "We just take for granted that lack of choice when it comes to teachers, but in other areas of life... if you are gonna have your kid take 30 minute piano lesson once a week... and you can just tell your kids personality and this teacher's personality don't jive. It's not working. Well, you're going to go find another one... But then in school, we're just sort of, we just sort of accept, well, I hope they get a good teacher this year."

### Theme 3: Specialized Programs Serving Specific Needs

**The Power of Niching Down:**
> "When you get into a business, you don't think about public schools this way, but when you get into a business, finding your niche of who you're serving is a big deal... Public schools don't look at it this way, but these programs are popping up and they're popping up all over the country. They're very specific. They're very niched down."

**Breakout School Example:**
> "There's one program here in Utah called Breakout School. I'm fascinated by this program. It's five days a week, but they spend 80 to 90 percent of their time outside. And it's designed specifically for students with autism and ADHD. Those kids are able to, when they need to, just run over to a playground or run around the park or wherever they're at and get their energy out and then come back and buckle down and do 15 more minutes of math and then go run around for another five minutes if they need to."

**Dr. Dow Richardson's Philosophy:**
> "He calls these problems that they have, their superpower. He's like, public schools don't look at those problems as a superpower... He has kids who come and they hate school. They go back to high school in ninth grade. And he's mentioned multiple times he has students who go back there hating school. They enter high school, they're getting A's and B's and they're loving it because now all of a sudden they found their love of learning by having this program that fit who they were."

### Theme 4: The 80/90% Who Fit vs. The Rest

**Who Traditional School Serves:**
> "As a school principal, I spent the majority of my time working with the students who don't fit in the public school system. You know, maybe it serves 70%, 80%, 90 percent of the local population to go to the public school. Great. If your child loves that type of education, they should go there. But there is definitely a segment of our population of students who don't fit in that system."

**ESAs and Choice Programs:**
> "These programs like an ESA... it's for these students that don't fit in that system. They struggle for whatever reason. Maybe it's sitting for six to seven hours a day, five days a week. Maybe they need a half day program. You can't really do that in the public education system because you're getting paid for the amount of time a student is in their seat."

---

### Theme 5: Public Schools Can Innovate Too

**Competition Drives Change:**
> "During 2020, we lost 700 elementary students in our district during that time, which is a lot. And most of them went to at that point, My Tech High... And so within a quarter, the district changed and all of a sudden had a dedicated online program... That competition from My Tech High created a change faster than I'd ever seen it in my 14 years in public education, because students chose something different."

**The Path Forward:**
> "We need to see the public school system start to take some of these... chances... do things a little bit differently. And they can do it the way that this district did - let's try this little program. If it works with 30 kids, let's grow to 100 kids and let it go. They have the opportunity to do that and they have the funds to do it and they should."

**Not About Shutting Down Alternatives:**
> "Isaac: The answer is not to shut down UFA. It's to open up what the public school teachers can do and give them more of that freedom and flexibility... Public school advocates saying we need those same advantages too so we can compete and let's focus on what we really do well."

### Theme 6: The Three-Day Week Advantage

**Jon on Micro Schools:**
> "We found a local micro school that was very small, like 70 students. And so we enrolled them there and they thrived. They loved it. They loved the smaller classes. It's only three days a week. And so the other two days they could be at home doing stuff with me and my wife."

**Isaac on Adult Patterns:**
> "It is amazing how much of a difference that one change alone makes. And I think it's funny cause we know this as adults... If you have a commitment that's three days a week, two days a week, you have that ability to go in and be refreshed. Sending kids every day, five days a week for a lot of ages... it's just, it's a lot, it's really taxing."

**The Flexibility Advantage:**
> "Just that alone, a lot of times I'm talking to people about homeschooling. They're like, Whoa, but your kid, they're isolated, whatever. But when I say actually they go to a co op, which is kind of just like a small school two days a week. And then it's like, Oh, that actually sounds great."

---

### Theme 7: The Changing Nature of Childhood

**Kids Today vs. Previous Generations:**
> "Isaac: Go back 20, 30 years ago, most kids when they grew up... most kids, when they were not in school, were outside running around... Now kids are not running around outside nearly as much as they did. They're mostly sitting down inside on screens and doing passive activities way, way, way more than they ever did... Even if like back then there was still too much trying to keep kids sitting down inside in schools, but at least then when they weren't in school, they were running around almost all the time. Right now they're not."

**Reversing the Role of School:**
> "When you think about that, it's like, if you say, what do we need, what do kids actually need? Well, when they're not in school, they're mostly just sitting on the couch on screens. Let's use that school time to say, okay, this is the time where you're not going to sit inside and be on a screen where you're going to be outside."

---

### Theme 8: Schools Haven't Evolved

**The 1920s Classroom:**
> "The assumption of what a school should be definitely needs to change. I mean, really, you can go back and you can look at pictures from the early 1900s, and the classrooms don't look fundamentally different today than they did then. Yeah, maybe there's like a smart board or a touchscreen TV up at the front of the room. Maybe the kids have a laptop or a Chromebook in front of them. But for the most part, they're still kind of sitting in rows and doing the same thing that they did back in 1920s."

**The Question:**
> "Have we not found better ways to do things? Like, all other industries have progressed in some way, shape or form, right? You know, we've learned [in medicine] early on, hey, I need to wash my hands between every patient I see... Hey, we learned about this thing called antibiotics... Like, those are amazing things. How come we haven't had that in education? It's because we're all asked to do the same thing."

**The Public School Dilemma:**
> "The public schools are asked to be all things to all people. And therefore, they do a lot of things, but they don't do a lot of things at a very high level."

---

### Theme 9: Post-High School Alternatives

**The Question Jon Is Asking:**
> "I'm looking at my 18 year old daughter. Does a four year of really kind of continuing what happened in the K 12 public education system make sense for her? She didn't love the public K 12 system. Like that's why we pulled her out when she was a junior and did something different. And so maybe it doesn't."

**Gap Years and Career Exploration:**
> "There are organized gap years where you can go and actually explore careers and be like, do I like this? Is this something I want to do? There's other programs out there that will help you really hone in on maybe maybe it's not finding a career you're interested in, maybe it's finding a career that meets your goals."

**The Timeline Myth:**
> "College will always be there. If I decide to wait, I mean, I'm in Utah. We send our kids out on missions for two years and they don't start school until they're 20 or 21. Well, if you're not LDS... you could still take a couple of years and you'll turn out just fine. But if you take a couple of years and do that, you'll have a clearer idea of like, Oh, I do need a degree to go and do this thing because I actually want to be a doctor."

### Theme 10: The Power of Exposure

**The Veterinarian Story:**
> "There was a young lady... she thought she wanted to be a veterinarian. So in her homeschool, luckily in her homeschool, her mom got her an opportunity to shadow a veterinarian for two months. And at the end of it, it's like, mom, I really like animals, but I do not want to be a veterinarian like I don't. And that saved her seven years at least. Right. Because to become a veterinarian, you're basically following a medical path... In two months, she learned that's not the right way for me to go."

**Isaac on Career Discovery:**
> "Instead of trying to be like, I have to find my passion... spend like a year or two and try to answer the question, what are the things that I know I don't want to do? Like, it's easier to find what you hate than to find like the one thing you love because what you love and what you're going to be doing in 20 years, it probably doesn't even exist yet."

**The Narrowing Process:**
> "Go figure out the things that, and start to, that list will narrow down like, okay, I've realized that I don't want this, get as much exposure to these different things. And you'll start to learn about yourself."

**Jon's Advice:**
> "One of the best advice that people who have almost college age kids [is] to go and do, have them go explore the things that they want out there, but also have them list down all the jobs they can think of, and then help them grow that list to 70, 80, a hundred jobs. Most kids, when you do that really can only come up with about 10 jobs. And if that's all, you know, that's all you'll look at doing when you leave home."

---

### Theme 11: Job Market Reality

**The College Degree Myth:**
> "You get on something like Indeed or ZipRecruiter and they pull these reports and, you know, 75 percent of the jobs they have posted on Indeed and ZipRecruiter don't even say that a college degree is preferred, let alone required. And there are good jobs, especially for like an 18 year old, just coming out of college and you can go and explore."

**You Can't Hold a Job You Don't Know Exists:**
> "One of the things they say, and I love this is: You can't hold a job that you don't know exists, right? So going out and just exploring, what is even available to me?"

**Isaac on Job Outcomes:**
> "62 percent of people are working in a job that doesn't require a degree or that is not relevant to the degree that they have. But you have this idea that you have to like pick the one thing."

---

### Theme 12: High School as a Sweet Spot for Public Schools

**The Attraction of High School:**
> "Isaac: I think high school is one of the biggest advantages. That is an area where homeschoolers they get to that age and they just want as much time as they can out of the house, hanging around their friends, the sports and all of the things that come with a high school experience are one of the more attractive parts of that."

**Specialized Classes:**
> "Jon: The other thing that high schools, the local high schools provide is, for the most part, they have highly specialized advanced classes in the topics that the kids are interested in... I can probably teach my kids through eighth grade math... But you asked me to start teaching calculus... I don't think I could teach calculus right now. And so there's a specialized class at the high school. Let the kids go and do it."

**The Opportunity:**
> "Currently under Utah law anyway, the public schools can become a provider and provide those one time classes and create a fee for that, that the Utah Fits All would then turn around and pay for it. And so that's exciting. They have the opportunity. I just don't know if they'll do it."

## Conclusion

Jon England's journey from public school teacher to principal to homeschool parent perfectly illustrates the core tenets of open education. His experience shows that:

1. **The system's rigidity hurts everyone** - teachers, principals, and especially students who don't fit the mold
2. **Parents must be the primary decision makers** in their children's education
3. **Specialized programs can serve specific needs** better than one-size-fits-all approaches
4. **Competition and choice drive innovation** - even in public schools
5. **Early career exploration saves time and money** - exposure to real-world work beats theoretical planning
6. **Flexibility in scheduling** (like 3-day weeks) makes a huge difference for both students and families

The open education model isn't about destroying public schools - it's about opening up all the options, allowing families to customize, and trusting parents to know what's best for their children.
