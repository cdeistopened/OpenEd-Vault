PRAISE FOR OPEN EDUCATION 

“After analyzing countless school models, I’ve discovered one  undeniable truth: Every child is unique. The most effective educational  strategies acknowledge and adapt to this reality. The authors offer a  practical framework to help families turn this principle into actionable  success that will benefit the child’s strengths and learning style.” 

– Deborah Hendrix,  

Executive Director, Parents Challenge 

“In today’s world, difference is valuable. Yet, traditional education  often teaches children to fit narrow boundaries rather than develop  their unique strengths. *Open Education* shows how we can finally  break free from this outdated model, offering practical guidance for  families ready to embrace learning that works with their child’s natural  curiosities rather than against them. This book is a powerful reminder  that every child is different, and that’s exactly as it should be.”

FOREWORD 

STUDENTS AREN’T STANDARD 

One evening, when our youngest daughter was about seven, she    
skipped into our bedroom just to tell us she was going to read a  book. As she skipped back out, I turned to my husband, Matt, and  asked, “At what point does life take that skip out of you? When do we  lose that pure joy in learning?” That question has stuck with me ever  since.  

Too often, I have seen how our traditional education system  slowly replaces that natural joy with rigid expectations and  standardized measures. As we raised our five children—all in the  same home environment and with the same routines, house rules,  and opportunities—we noticed something that every parent before  us already knew: Each child is profoundly different. But what struck  me wasn’t just their different personalities or interests, it was how  differently each one learned and developed. 

Like many parents, we started with traditional approaches. I  volunteered at the local public school and ran the book fair. Matt  coached every sport until our kids were teenagers. We did all the right  things. But our perspective began to shift when our oldest son wanted  to transfer to a brand new charter school, something almost unheard of  in our community at the time. Back then, leaving your assigned district 

i   
ii OPEN EDUCATION  

school was seen as a rejection of public education. The pushback  was immediate. “What are you doing?” people asked. “Do you even  understand what you’re giving up?” We were more concerned about  our child feeling validated and successful than following the expected  path. Each year, we asked if he wanted to return to his district school.  He chose to stay, and he thrived. Later, when our younger children  reached the same age, she chose a different path entirely. Each choice  was different, but each was right for that child. 

During this time, we sat down with a calculator and made a  startling discovery. Our children spent about seven hours a day in  school for 180 days, roughly 1,260 hours per year. That left 2,390  hours of potential learning time at home. The math was undeniable.  Time spent outside the classroom matters. Parents are ultimately  their children’s primary educator, whether they plan for it or not.  This realization led us to ask a bigger question: If our own children  need more flexible, personalized education options, how many other  families face the same challenge?  

In 2009, we created My Tech High (now OpenEd) to help students  access different classes, resources, and opportunities that spoke to their  individual interests and learning styles. Years later, our conviction  about personalized learning was reinforced in a deeply personal way.  One of our sons was everything the public school system could want:  student body officer, varsity athlete in multiple sports, and excellent  grades. He was well-rounded, well-liked, and loved to learn. Yet,  when it came time to take the ACT, he consistently scored below what  colleges expected, despite multiple attempts. Watching him pour his  heart and soul into studying, only to feel crushed by the results again  and again, confirmed what we already knew: Standardized testing  measurements can never capture a child’s true potential nor accurately  reflect what they have learned. During this journey, I felt God speaking  to me, helping me understand something crucial: God is the author  of diversity. A child’s learning style isn’t a flaw to be corrected by  the system, it’s a divine design to be celebrated. Each child’s unique   
Students Aren’t Standard iii 

way of learning is beautiful, intentional, and worthy of honor. This  understanding transformed how we saw education itself. One year, we were excited to see several OpenEd students earn their  Associate Degree before they turned eighteen. Matt suggested we might  want to host an event to celebrate this major accomplishment. I asked  him, “Who decides which achievements are worthy of celebration?”  Why not host an event to celebrate students who started their own  business, or for those who have mastered a musical instrument, or for  those who have achieved their academic goals in their own personal  way through art, dance, sports, or an industry certification?” We’ve  been guided by this perspective ever since. 

Today, at various in-person OpenEd events, parents I have never  met approach me with tears in their eyes, grateful that their children  finally have the freedom to learn in ways that work for them. I’ll  never forget one parent who shared with me that her 8-year-old son  was deeply discouraged. He was profoundly gifted in science and  was convinced he head learned everything there was to know. He  believed his local school had no more challenges to offer him. When  he was given the opportunity to attend a college physics class with his  grandfather, the professor opened his eyes to ongoing discoveries in  quantum mechanics and dark matter. His natural curiosity reignited,  and he realized that human knowledge wasn’t finite. We’re all still  learning, still discovering. This changed his life forever. 

As a teenager, my father encouraged me to become an expert  in something people will seek out. I struggled with that advice as I  thought every field of expertise was already claimed. Now I see the  irony. Through building OpenEd, I have been fortunate to become  an expert in finding ways to help families trust their instincts about  their children’s education. Today, even as two of our own children  are public school teachers, we understand that education isn’t about  choosing between traditional and alternative approaches, it’s about  having the confidence to combine different learning opportunities in  ways that work for your unique child. That’s Open Education.  
iv OPEN EDUCATION  

This book offers a roadmap for that journey. Matt and Isaac break  down the practical insights and systematic approach we’ve developed  over fifteen years of working with families who want more for their  children. The tools to build something better are already in your hands,  and they’re simpler to adopt than you might think.

INTRODUCTION 

The average American child will spend over 13,000 hours in a    
traditional school classroom by the time they graduate from high  school. That’s 13,000 hours in a system where two-thirds of teachers are  dissatisfied, parent satisfaction is at a twenty-five-year low, and student  anxiety, bullying, and depression are rising at an alarming rate. In other  words, traditional schooling isn’t working and almost nobody is happy.  We have accepted this as normal. But normal doesn’t mean necessary. 

Many kids start out loving school with the excitement of learning,  making friends, discovering new ideas. But something changes, often  around third grade. There’s a reason for this shift, which will become  clear in the chapters ahead. 

Fortunately, education is opening up. 

For the first time in history, every approach to learning—from  traditional classrooms to innovative programs, from hands-on  apprenticeships to creative exploration—is becoming available to  every family; not just the wealthy or well-connected. Everyone. 

This means you can shape your child’s education around their  natural curiosity, interests, and learning style. You can adapt and  adjust their learning environment as they grow and change. Most  importantly, you can help them maintain that early love of learning  that too often gets lost in traditional schools.

She paused. How should she answer the question, “Are you  homeschooled?” 

She played volleyball and took a science class at the local public  school. She also took a few online courses from a virtual charter  school. She participated in a homeschool co-op once a week, had  a tutor for math, worked part-time, and mostly “unschooled” on  Fridays—following her own interests and learning through real-world  experiences rather than formal lessons. 

What would you call this educational experience? She didn’t really  know, but she knew she loved it. 

This is becoming more and more common. 

The old lines are blurring. The labels are fraying at the edges. Public, private, homeschool, unschool, large school, microschool,  co-op, independent, accredited, non-accredited, in the classroom, out  of the classroom, traditional, charter, modern, classical, Montessori,  Waldorf, virtual, real-world, synchronous, asynchronous. Parents  used to have to carefully pick and get stuck in one box. Now, every  one of those boxes is opening up. You can take individual items out of  them and craft an educational experience for each child at each stage  based on their unique interests and needs. 

What does an open education look like? In a nutshell, it is different  for each child. 

The need to personalize education is rooted in the way humans  learn and have always learned. The last hundred years have been, in  many, ways a diversion; a grand social experiment far down the road  of factory-style, one-size-fits-all, lump-of-dough education. We are  now tasting the bitter fruit produced by a dehumanizing approach. 

People have a love/hate relationship with school because learning  is lovely but school is often loathsome, certainly when it is forced  upon people in a cold, conveyor-belt manner—treating every student  as an identical product to be processed in exactly the same way. 

This book is about the opening up of education. It is about a growing  movement, the principles behind it, and the stories of families who   
Introduction vii 

are a part of that movement. Beyond that, it is about a mindset, the  open education mindset. It’s about seeing the world in a different way.  Seeing the world as full of possibility. Seeing your child’s education  as something that *can* be changed, that *can* be improved, that *can* be  customized. It’s about seeing every option that is available to you.  Once you begin to see education with an open mind, you can’t help  but open your child’s education. 

Let’s be clear, this is not an anti-public school book, an anti-private  school book, or an anti-anything book. It is a book about helping you  craft the best possible education for your child by opening up all the  available options. 

If you are ready for a practical guide to raising self-directed  learners who are creative, curious, and motivated to succeed and live  happily—today and in the future—this is the book for you. This isn’t  some new-fangled, made-up, fringe way to teach your kids stuff they  don’t need to know, might never use, or will hate learning. Instead,  open education is a proven approach to give you and your child the  power to direct, adjust, and navigate their learning in a way that works  best for them. 

Although this might seem like a no-brainer (of course you  want this for your child), like many parents, you know it isn’t easy to accomplish. Every parent wants to see their children enjoying  learning, seeking opportunities to grow their knowledge of the  world, enhancing their natural intellectual abilities, and sharing what  they learn with others. If your family isn’t there yet, keep reading.  As you do, you may begin to question many deeply-held societal  expectations, pressures, and traditions around learning. You might  even feel some anger that causes you to ask yourself, “Why didn’t  anyone tell me this before?”  

We will help you through this emotional roller coaster. By the  end of the book, you will have the tools and confidence to apply this  modern approach to education and tap into all the learning resources  available to help your child succeed.

***Open education is  a proven method to  give you and your  child the power***  

***to direct, adjust,***  

***and navigate their  learning in a way  that works best for  them.***  
There are innumerable resources at your  disposal to enhance your child’s learning;  you just need to know what they are. As  you identify these learning resources and  opportunities, you will start to realize the  power of an open education mindset, and  you may never view schooling the same  again. As you make this shift, you may  feel scared that you might fail at this new  approach to your child’s learning path.  After all, you will be going against the  

grain of traditional schooling and that will undoubtedly cause some  push-back from your inner circle. As a result, you might think that no  matter what you do for your child, someone will judge you, including  yourself, other parents, grandparents, and neighbors. That’s okay.  Keep doing what’s right for you and your family. 

There is no denying the results of a child learning with an open  education mindset. Here, you will read the stories of many real-life  families who apply the open education mindset with great results.  Every family situation is different, so each idea can be adapted  to individual circumstances, all with outcomes that illustrate the  benefits of this revolutionary approach to learning. You will also be  introduced to two fictional families who might seem familiar to you  in some ways. Neither family is perfect or ideal, but their family  circumstances, challenges, questions, concerns, and decisions are  universal in many ways. In fact, both authors have experienced them  personally. 

**A Little Bit About Us**  

We (Matt and Isaac) have different backgrounds and different points  of emphasis when it comes to education, yet both of us share the open  education mindset.   
Introduction ix 

Matt was educated in the public school system and later worked  in it for years. He has an abiding love for public education, and is  passionate about seeing it become the best version of itself. He’s spent  years advocating for competency-based education, a move away from  standardized testing, and ways for public schools to innovate and  partner with private entities and homeschoolers. 

Isaac grew up homeschooled and has focused his career on ways  to innovate outside of the system and build alternatives. He’s spent  years advocating for apprenticeships, hands-on learning, and ways for  individuals to chart a course without relying on mainstream institutions. 

Both of us are moved by the same vision: open education for every  learner. That includes every type of approach and option available. 

**Matt’s Story** 

When my wife, Amy and I were married and began growing our  family from one child to five, we quickly realized what every family  before us already knew; each child is different. This surprised us.  We raised our children in the same home with the same routines and  same expectations. Our family culture was as consistent as you could  imagine, yet even then it was clear that each child had their own  unique set of needs and wants. It taught us that if two parents raising  five children in the same way resulted in very different pathways for  each child, how could a standardized public education system a offer  personalized learning journey for millions of children? Spoiler alert:  It can’t, at least not alone. The public education system needs to find  ways to partner with innovative, forward-thinking organizations and  empower parents to help them do it. 

Like most parents, we missed the mark many times along our  children’s learning journeys. But we also learned a lot about how  they each learn individually and what their unique needs were as  they became curious about the world and how they fit into it. As our  children grew, we began to research many of the learning resources   
x OPEN EDUCATION  

available to our family at no or low cost. Keep in mind that we made  the intentional decision for Amy to be a stay-at-home mom and that  I would be the solo wage earner. With five children to feed, clothe,  entertain, develop, and educate on one income, we needed to be smart  about how we would spend our funds. 

In the early days, our approach was typical of many families  around us. We visited the public library frequently for free  story time, free book check-out, free audiobooks, and more. We  enrolled our children in the free public school near our home. Amy  volunteered at the school and helped run the book fair, which gave  her a discount to buy even more books. She purchased affordable  summer reading and math books at Costco and Amazon. She also  supported the children when they participated in recreation programs  like swimming, soccer, and flag football. I volunteered as a coach  to get a discounted fee for the kids’ registration and uniforms. I  coached each of our children in almost every sport until they were  about twelve years old and then turned them over to coaches who  knew what they were doing.  

Then, as the internet expanded, we found high-quality online  educational games and interesting resources to supplement everything  the children were learning in their public school classroom. Despite our  efforts to create consistent routines and provide similar opportunities,  each child gravitated toward different activities and learning styles.  What worked brilliantly for one would fall completely flat for another.  We discovered firsthand what would become the foundation of our  educational philosophy: There is no such thing as an average child.   
h   
One fall, as the children prepared to go back to school, I had a thought:  *How many hours in a day can a child engage in learning activities,  including school, homework, chores, sports, free play with friends,  educational games, traveling, etc.?* I concluded it was about ten hours.   
Introduction xi 

Amy and I did some simple math. There are 365 days in the year,  which means there are 3,650 hours per year our children could be  engaged in some type of learning activity. They attend their public  school for about seven hours per day for 180 days, which equals 1,260  hours per year. When we realized that every year they would only  spend 1,260 hours at school (35%) and 2,390 hours outside of school  (65%), we instantly realized how important it was for us to become  homeschooling parents for at least the 65% of the year when they  were learning under our direct supervision. This calculation revealed  something profound about our own responsibility as parents, as well  as the nature of learning itself. The standardized school day, with its  rigid schedules and uniform expectations, represents only a fraction  of a child’s learning potential. Just as our children showed different  preferences for breakfast cereals and bedtime stories, they naturally  gravitated toward different types of learning experiences during those  crucial out-of-school hours. 

We valued quality with our children at home and we also valued  the time they spent at their local public school, but this mathematical  reality made us realize that truly supporting our children’s education  meant thinking beyond the traditional school day. It wasn’t about  replacing school, but about recognizing that education happens  everywhere, all the time, in ways as unique as each child. 

My parents were both educators, so education is both what I  do and who I am. I have always enjoyed exploring entrepreneurial  opportunities (i.e. see a need, fill a need) and started my first education  company at age seventeen. After graduating with a bachelor’s degree  in elementary education, I began my professional teaching career as  a sixth grade teacher in Washington state. During that time, I earned  my master’s degree in education with an emphasis in public school  choice models. Then, in 1996, the state announced a grant to bring this  new thing called the internet into the classroom. As you can imagine,  most teachers balked at the idea, but I jumped on it because it sounded  exciting. As it turns out, the internet is actually a pretty cool thing

and I’ve been involved with innovation in education, online learning,  public school choice, technology, and entrepreneurship ever since.  Our family life and my career were running in parallel. 

My experience as a public school teacher with a master’s degree  in education probably helped us understand how to think differently  about what, when, and how our children learned. Amy’s college degree  is in accounting, which was extremely helpful to manage our family  finances and enable us to budget as we made important decisions and  trade-offs over the years. But even without a background or degree in  education and accounting, every parent soon realizes that children are  born with all kinds of interests and skills. An important role of the parent  is to provide love, guidance, and support to each child as they learn  to thrive in their unique way. We also know that life itself provides an  unlimited expanse of learning experiences, so it’s important to model  for children how learning will bless them throughout their lives. 

This background in education innovation, combined with our  experience raising five unique children, helped us understand  something crucial: while professional expertise can be valuable, the  most important qualification of an adult to guide a child’s education is  simply caring deeply about that individual child. 

One day, our middle child came home from his charter school  where he was attending with his two older brothers and said, “I don’t  want to go to this school anymore. I want to transfer back to my  district school to be with my friends.” At first, we thought he should  just stick it out and stay with his brothers. If we transferred him to his  district school, we would literally have our five children attending four  different public schools and we thought that would be too logistically  challenging. After thinking about it, we concluded we could make it  work and genuinely wanted to honor his preference. The experience  of supporting our children in accessing an education environment that  worked for them prepared us for the day we launched OpenEd in 2009  (you’ll learn more about that later in the book).  
Introduction xiii 

As our knowledge grew about how our kids learn, we sought  insights from other parents on what they found worked or didn’t work  well for their child. We (again) learned that every child is unique, each  family’s situation is different, and it takes a lot of focused energy to  prioritize adjusting the family’s education plan around the needs of  each child. With that knowledge, we moved forward to identify each  child’s needs and interests and discovering which resources we could  source to help them thrive. 

At the height of these important and meaningful discussions  around creating custom education plans for our five children, Amy  and I felt divine inspiration to share our personal and professional  experiences with other families. OpenEd was born, built on  the foundation of what we call the open education mindset, a  groundbreaking, yet time-honored approach to self-directed learning  that allows children to choose their own learning journey with the  input, feedback, and support of parents and other caring adults who  know the child the best.  

When we began this journey in 2009, we called the program  My Tech High, as we were focused on helping 16- and 17-year old students become tech entrepreneurs and launch their own tech  company. To our core, we believed then (and still believe) that if  all children have some level of confidence and competence in both  how technology works and how to think like an entrepreneur, they  can be successful in life no matter what path they chose to follow.  Originally, we thought our students would be able to follow in the  footsteps of modern tech titans like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Steve  Wozniak, Susan Wojcicki, Marissa Mayer, Ursula Burns, Mark  Zuckerburg, Larry Page, and Sergey Brin. However, as it turned out,  the average age of our My Tech High students in the first year was  nine years old. And the most eager to learn new things were the 10-  to 14-year-olds (as the older students felt so much societal pressure  to focus only on college prep).  
xiv OPEN EDUCATION  

This unexpected development led us to a profound realization:  Although technology and entrepreneurship remained vital tools, our  mission was actually much broader. We weren’t just teaching tech  skills, we were empowering families to direct their own educational  journeys. This understanding led us to rename our program OpenEd,  reflecting our expanding vision of education as an experience that  should be open, flexible, and accessible to all learners in whatever  way works best for them. 

We shifted our focus to help younger students thrive in an open  education format, and saw amazing results: five-year-olds learning  to code, six-year-olds starting their own t-shirt businesses, and more.  Over time, we expanded to include early college and career pathways  for older students.  

Our mission became clear: Expand access to high-quality,  personalized education to all families, regardless of income. Rather  than create something entirely outside the traditional system (as  many education reformers advised), we partnered with forward 

thinking public schools to offer flexible education options. Working  with innovative charter schools and district leaders, we have  demonstrated what is possible when we transform education from  within the existing system.  

Through our programs and partnerships, OpenEd cumulative  enrollment has exceeded 100,000 students and continues to grow  rapidly. With each new family, we have refined our understanding of  what open education truly means: A proven method that gives parents  and children the power to direct, adjust, and navigate learning in ways  that work best for them. 

The path hasn’t been easy. Not everyone in the traditional  education system embraces personalized education. We have faced  opposition, legal challenges, sometimes nasty and personal attacks,  and moments of deep doubt. During the COVID-19 pandemic in  2020, when enrollment suddenly skyrocketed, we faced a crucial  decision: scale back or step up. We chose to keep our doors open to   
Introduction xv 

anyone interested, recognizing that the crisis of the moment called  for exactly the kind of flexible, personalized approach we had spent  years developing.  

We imagine a world where families don’t have to pick from one  pre-defined education approach; a world where learners can blend  real-world connection with the flexibility of digital learning; where  technology and entrepreneurship are embraced and wielded for good;  where every student develops independence and the ability to solve  the biggest problems in the world. 

This is the essence of open education—recognizing that each  student’s path is unique, that the world is full of possibilities, and that  learning thrives when students can break free from artificial constraints.  Rather than being forced to choose between public or private, remote  or on-site, part-time or full-time, large or small classes, homeschool or  world school, or any other approach, open education allows learners  to take what works from any of them and adapt it to their goals. It  opens every parent and student to whatever combination of resources  and methods they need, when and how they need them. 

**Isaac’s Story** 

My dad was an accountant and my mom was a young public school  teacher. When kids came, they decided she would become a full time mom and they would homeschool. This was in the 1980s, when  homeschooling was pretty rare and legally dubious. 

I was the youngest of three, and when I was just three years old,  my dad was in a serious car accident that left him brain damaged  and permanently wheelchair-bound. He required (and does to this  day) 24-hour care. My mom decided to continue homeschooling us,  even while taking care of a handicapped husband and running the  household alone. 

This upbringing taught me a great deal of independence and  responsibility from a young age. I always had household chores and   
xvi OPEN EDUCATION  

started earning money from various jobs early. Ever the optimist,  my mom instituted a rigorous curriculum and bought more books at  curriculum fairs than I could count. In practice, besides homeschool  classes and co-ops, our education was pretty *laissez faire*. I played  with LEGOs more than I did workbooks. Even still, we had a very  robust social life, played sports, and did a lot with our church, extended  family, and a network of local homeschoolers. 

In my early teens, I wanted to hang out with my friends more  and join a competitive basketball team. I decided to enroll in a small  private school for my sophomore year. While I enjoyed the sports and  social aspect, I chaffed against the rigid schedule and uniform pace of  learning. Why should every student’s day be dictated by the same bell  when we had radically different abilities and interests? The pace felt  slow and unnatural. I also disliked having few hours left to work and  earn money. 

During my junior and senior years, I attended community  college full-time while working part-time. The curriculum was  better than high school and more customizable, but most classes felt  like make-work. I finished high school with an associates degree  and transferred the credits to the local state university. I earned my  bachelor’s degree in two years there, wondering the entire time  why I was paying all this money for classes nobody seemed to  want to attend (including the professors). I worked nearly full-time  throughout, learning more on the job than I did in the classroom.  This really bugged me, and I resolved to find a better way to help  young people transition from education to career, without all the  debt and waste. 

I got started on my career, bought a house, got married, and had  my first child by the time I was 21\. A few years later, after taking night  classes, I earned a master’s degree. If you’re wondering about the  need for test scores and diplomas, I never got a high school diploma  or GED and I never took the ACT or SAT, but I have an associate,   
Introduction xvii 

bachelor’s, and master’s degree—none of which really helped me in  real life, to be honest—and a great career. 

I loved growing up homeschooled and the independence that  came with it. It was a no-brainer for my wife, Heather, and me to  homeschool our own kids. But we were young and naive and hadn’t  thought too hard about what that would look like. We began with a  very structured and full curriculum for our oldest. He was smart and  verbally advanced, so we figured it would be great to start him at four  and a half years old. It wasn’t. 

He fought us at every turn. He wanted to play, imagine, draw,  and tell stories. He did not want to be told what to do or when.  When it came to reading, for example, we tried every method, but he  wouldn’t accept any of the learning activities we presented to him.  We knew he was capable. Finally, we gave up and decided to let him  learn whenever he wanted to. Not long after, he taught himself. One  night he wanted me to read to him in bed but I said no. It was late  and I was exhausted. I walked past his room a little later and heard  him reading to himself. A lightbulb went on in my mind. *Maybe we  should just let him choose what he wants to learn and when. If he  needs help, he’ll ask us.* That experience, coupled with devouring  books from thinkers like John Holt, John Taylor Gatto and Peter  Gray, and learning about the Sudbury Valley school, led us to go full  unschool. 

As we had more kids (one adopted, two more biological) and they  grew and developed, our education approach was forced to change  too. We saw needs and gaps and desires they had that required more  structure. Over the years, we had them in homeschool tutorials  and co-ops, various at-home and online curricula, a twice-a-week  microschool, a part-time Waldorf school, and every variation in  between. Our oldest wanted to go to a public high school one year,  so we let him. He decided not to go back the next year and instead to  work full time, so we let him.  
xviii OPEN EDUCATION  

These were not easy decisions and we never fully felt we knew  what we were doing (we still don’t have all the answers) but one  major lesson along the way has been humility. We had to swallow a  lot of pride to admit our fancy curriculum wasn’t working. We’d gone  from fully a structured curriculum to fully unschooled for all our kids.  But this didn’t solve every problem for every kid every year. Besides  that, we had to face lots of raised eyebrows and social pressure too.  Then, after I had become an outspoken advocate for unschooling  and alternative approaches to education, I had to swallow my pride  again when more structure was needed and my son enrolled in public  school. This time, I faced skeptical questions from my network of  alt-educators. 

The real lesson is that it’s not about us, the parents. It’s not about  what I think sounds good or makes me look good. It’s about what best  helps my kids. There is a lot of dying to self in this process, but in the  end, the rewards are more than worth it. 

While my wife primarily managed our kids’ education, I started  a few companies dedicated to that goal I had way back in college:  helping young people transition from student to professional. I  worked with lots of great people serving hundreds of individuals with  bootcamps, apprenticeships, alternative credentials, and software  tools to launch their careers. Along the way, I met Matt and learned  about his company, OpenEd (which at the time was called My Tech  High). We came at it from different angles, but our vision was the  same. We hit it off and kept in touch for nearly a decade. When he  approached me about joining the OpenEd team it was the perfect next  step for me and a chance to be a “pioneer of the inevitable,” as my  friend TK Coleman says. 

Between my wife and me, and our four children, we have  participated in just about every form of education there is. Public,  private, homeschool, unschool, and everything in between. The labels  and theories aren’t the most important thing. What matters is the  opportunity for each kid to craft the education combination that works   
Introduction xix 

for them at each stage. We’re still on that journey, so I don’t write as  someone who has figured it all out, only as someone who is learning  out loud in hopes that my experiences will help others. Open education is my mission and passion.   
h   
Have you noticed a marked increase in the number of times you’ve  heard a comment like this from parents at the local playground at the  park: “I’m just not sure about Johnny. He’s not doing great in school,  but what can we do?” Parents know something is wrong, but they  are worried they will ruin their kids’ lives if they pull them out of the  system and customize their education. They feel they aren’t equipped,  and they have tons of what ifs. 

My (Isaac’s) wife comes home more frequently than ever relaying  comments like this. What’s amazing is how often it only takes a few  simple words to take these parents from curiosity to courage and  conviction when it comes to opening their kids’ education. Heather 

usually asks a few questions, then says something simple like,  “Well, I can tell you our kids are not perfect, and their education  isn’t perfect, but it’s easier than you think to take charge and do  something different. It’s okay. You’re not going to ruin their lives.  Why don’t you just try opening things up?” Those words have a  magical effect. It’s like a burden is lifted and they got permission to  consider a different approach for the first time. There are millions of  parents who *want* to open their kids’ education and just need a little  encouragement and to know it’s going to be okay. If that’s you, we  hope this book can help. 

If you’re already exploring open education, don’t underestimate  the power of your experience. Your story, even with its imperfections  and ongoing questions, could be exactly what another parent needs to  hear. Part of this book’s mission is to help you grow in your journey  while equipping you to support others just beginning to question the

status quo. And if you’ve picked up this book because something  isn’t working in your child’s education—whether it’s a dimming  love of learning, a rigid system that constrains rather than enables,  or a sense that there must be a better way—you’re in the right place.  This book exists to help resolve that nagging dissatisfaction with the  educational status quo. 

Read on if: 

**●** Your child is unhappy at school and you want to reignite their  love of learning. 

**●** You are unsatisfied with your child’s current schooling  experience and the dissatisfaction is too painful to continue  as is. 

**●** You believe schooling, work, and life are supposed to be joyful  and meaningful. 

**●** You are mentally and emotionally strong enough to change and  are open to learning other pathways to becoming a successful  and happy adult. 

**●** You are comfortable questioning long-established institutions. **●** You are ready to get out of the daily rat race and find more  peace and joy as a parent. 

**●** You already have an open education mindset and want to learn  even more ideas for what you can do. 

Yes, going against the grain can feel daunting. Friends, family,  even well-meaning teachers might question your choices. But what  we’ve discovered, after working with thousands of families, is that  once parents see learning through an open lens, they can never go  back to viewing education the same way. What happens when we  stop trying to standardize children and start embracing their natural  genius? What becomes possible when we break free from a system  designed for a world that no longer exists? The answer might surprise   
Introduction xxi 

you. More importantly, it might transform how your child experiences  learning forever. 

Let’s begin by understanding the trap that has held education  captive for nearly two centuries, and why now is the perfect moment  to break free.  
b PART I

CHAPTER 1: 

THE TWO-HUNDRED-YEAR-OLD TRAP 

In 1837, Horace Mann stood before the Massachusetts Board of    
Education with a radical proposal. Rather than let children learn  as they always had—through family, apprenticeships, and local  schools—he suggested something unprecedented: a standardized  system that would process students like products in a factory. 

Mann, who was serving as Secretary of the Board at the time, had  just returned from Prussia, where he had witnessed a military education  model that turned boys into obedient soldiers. He was less impressed  with the quality of learning than the efficiency of control. Here was  a system that could take diverse, independent-minded children and  transform them into a uniform, compliant workforce. American  industrialists loved the idea. Factory owners needed workers who  would follow instructions without question. And so began what we  now know as modern public education, not with dreams of expanding  human potential, but with plans to standardize it. 

Perhaps most telling about Mann’s system was how it graded  students using the same A to F scale that meat packers used for beef.  Just as Grade-A meat commanded premium prices while, lower grades  were deemed less desirable, students would be sorted and labeled  according to their ability to conform. The system sorted children by  manufacture date (what we now call grade levels), processed them 

1   
2 OPEN EDUCATION  

into batches, and tested their conformity at regular intervals. Those  who didn’t fit the mold were labeled as troublemakers or failures. This  wasn’t some secret conspiracy. It was all quite open, quite logical . . .  for a world built around factories and mass production. 

The wealthy, of course, kept their children out of this new system.  Their kids continued learning through mentors, tutors, and rich  experiences through an education designed to produce leaders rather  than followers. For everyone else, school became what Mann and  his industrial partners intended: a place where unique human beings  would be standardized into interchangeable parts. 

Even today, this system shapes the lives of our lives. Every  weekday morning, millions of unique young minds file into buildings  designed to make them more alike. The simplicity of the promise  remains seductive: follow the set path—good grades, college, steady  job, retirement—and success will follow. It’s a promise whispered to  parents at every PTA meeting and open house: trust the system, and  your child will thrive. But that promise has expired. Not only because  it is failing to deliver, but because it’s preparing our children for a  world that has already disappeared.  

For over a century, this system worked exactly as intended. But  in the last few decades, parents and teachers began noticing that  young minds don’t flourish on assembly lines. Students are not dead  meat. We are still using an education system designed before the  lightbulb was invented to prepare children for a future that includes  such modern advances as artificial intelligence, robotics, self 

driving vehicles, the blockchain, and 3D printing. A system created  for factory workers cannot possibly prepare children for jobs that  don’t even exist yet. It would be comical if it weren’t impacting  millions of young lives. 

What makes this especially painful is watching the tension between  how children naturally learn and how they are forced to learn. Any parent  who has seen their child master a complex video game, build elaborate  worlds in Minecraft, or dive deep into a passion project knows that kids   
The Two-Hundred-Year-Old Trap 3 

are capable of extraordinary learning when it matters to them. Yet, the  education system insists on grading these dynamic, creative minds like  sides of beef in a meat packing plant: Grade A for above average, or  Grade F for substandard, no room for growth or transformation. The  cracks in this system are becoming impossible to ignore. Some students,  unable to conform to the standardized pace, are labeled as failures  despite their unique talents. Others, capable of moving much faster, are  held back by arbitrary age groupings. Both ends of this spectrum arrive  at the same conclusion: Something needs to change. 

Parents—especially those who remembered their own joy of  learning before school squeezed it out of them—have started pushing  back against the birth-year cohort model, where children are grouped  in a classroom based on their birth year, not their intelligence or  interests. This revolution has unfolded in almost every other aspect of  our lives. Think about how you consume entertainment now compared  to forty years ago when there were only three TV channels. Or how you  now might work remotely instead of commuting to a cubicle, which  was commonplace less than a decade ago. Yet somehow, society has  kept our children trapped in an educational model more rigid than the  factories it was designed to supply. 

The 1990s marked a turning point. Parents and educators from  across the political spectrum, united by their concern for children  rather than ideology, began demanding choice within the public system  itself. They weren’t asking to abandon public education. They were  asking to open it up, to make it flexible enough to serve real children  rather than theoretical averages. This wasn’t just about choosing  between public and private schools, a choice that, let’s be honest, has  always existed for families with means. This was about reimagining  what public education could be. Magnet schools, charter schools,  hybrid programs, and customized learning plans started emerging like  flowers breaking through cracks in concrete. 

What drove this movement was a growing recognition that children  are as unique in how they learn as they are in how they look, laugh, or   
4 OPEN EDUCATION  

dream. Some need more time with certain subjects while racing ahead  in others. Some learn best through books, others through hands-on  experience. Some thrive in traditional classrooms, while others come  alive in alternative settings. The standardized system didn’t just fail  to recognize these differences; it actively worked to eliminate them.  

Informed by Mann’s goal to mirror the meat-grading model onto  children, and under the guise of tax dollar accountability, test scores  inappropriately became the chosen metric for K-12 public education  accountability. Using arbitrary scores through standardized testing as  a way to measure children’s educational development was—still is— misguided, misdirected, and frankly inequitable. No other government  program even comes close to requiring similar metrics to justify its  existence or its massive spending.  

Trillions of public dollars are spent each year on Medicare,  Medicaid, Pell Grants, scholarships, and college financial aid to  name a few. However, none of these programs impose standardized  accountability tests upon the beneficiary to justify their spending. Our  point here is not to support or oppose these programs, nor to hold them  up as examples of efficiency or outcomes, but to highlight how public  education is treated in a wildly different manner than other public  services. 

Imagine if any citizen that received government funding for  healthcare was measured to see how tall they were, and any healthcare  facility that didn’t have a majority of patients at the pre-determined  height was threatened with loss of funds. While height might be a useful  health metric for some people in some cases, the idea of applying it  across the board is absurd. Yet this is exactly the kind of accountability  that is used with public spending on education. The problem is not with  the concept of accountability, but where the accountability comes from,  who is accountable to whom, and what kind of incentives exist within  the system to allow for adjustment and adaptation. Our contention is that  whoever is closest to the student is best positioned to determine what  “good” looks like; the students themselves and their parents being first   
The Two-Hundred-Year-Old Trap 5 

and foremost. Family, friends, teachers, and community members close  to them come next. County, state, and finally federal level bureaucrats  are increasingly far removed from this context, and therefore are worst  positioned to determine accountability metrics. 

**The Hidden Cost of “Free” Education** 

Derrell Bradford, president of 50CAN: The 50-State Campaign for  Achievement, is a rare advocate for both school choice and improving  the public schools. He reminds people that public schools are not, in  fact, tuition free. In practice, home prices act as tuition. To access higher  quality schools, you have to pay more for houses in those districts. This  is one of the reasons he supports opening up more choices in education. 

The people who continue to oppose offering public school choices  to all students are often those who can comfortably afford to buy a  home in a district with top-notch, well-funded public schools. These  elite, “public schools” in wealthy neighborhoods actually act more like  quazi-private schools, fully subsidized by the government through the  high property taxes generated by expensive homes. Restrictive closed  enrollment policies also allow these so-called public schools to deny  enrollment to students whose families cannot afford to move into the  neighborhood and pay an expensive mortgage, which now essentially  has become the cost of private school tuition. 

Whatever you think about public schools, this reality contradicts  their stated purpose for existing; to provide equal access to quality  education, especially for those who can’t afford it.With that in mind,  consider economist Milton Friedman’s insights into the four ways  money can be spent, and the likely outcomes of each: 

1\. Spending your own money on yourself: Here, you are most  likely to be careful and choose only the best value. Poor deci sions are borne entirely by you on both the spending and  receiving side.  
6 OPEN EDUCATION  

2\. Spending someone else’s money on yourself: There is a little  less incentive to be careful, but since you live with the result,  there is still an eye for value. You bear part of the cost of the  decision, the receiving side. 

3\. Spending your own money on someone else: Yes, it’s your  money, but the other person lives with the result, so you’re  less scrupulous here than when buying for yourself. Again,  you bear part of the cost of the decision, the spending side. 

4\. Spending someone else’s money on someone else: The least  accountability to value. You don’t have a strong incentive to  be thrifty or look for high quality. Nothing bad happens to you  if you spend poorly, as you bear no cost on the spending or  receiving side. 

The idea of public education rules out option \#1, as the whole  point is to provide public resources (via tax dollars) to those who  can’t afford or don’t have access to said resources (i.e., a quality  education). Ideally, option \#2 is the best of all because it combines  public funding with personal stake in the outcome. When parents  can use public education dollars to choose their children’s schools  (through vouchers or similar programs), they remain highly motivated  to make good choices since their children’s future depends on it, while  still benefiting from public support to access better options.  

Option \#3 represents traditional private school scholarships or  philanthropy in education, where wealthy donors or foundations  fund others’ education. While this can provide opportunities for some  students, the donors may focus on their own priorities or preferences  rather than what recipients need most, and there is less accountability  for educational outcomes than when parents are directly involved.  And option \#4 should be avoided at all costs because it creates a  system where decision makers bear no direct consequences for either  poor spending choices or poor educational outcomes. Without skin in   
The Two-Hundred-Year-Old Trap 7 

the game on either side, there is little incentive to maximize value or  ensure quality, leading to inefficient use of resources and potentially  worse educational results. 

The public school system represents the fourth type of spending,  and any attempts to make it more efficient and accountable do nothing  to fix these poor underlying incentives. The experts brought in to  come up with accountability metrics are themselves in the fourth  position. They’re spending other people’s money (taxpayer dollars)  to create systems that affect other people’s children. They do not  directly pay for the implementation of their metrics, nor do their own  children necessarily attend the schools they’re evaluating. Without  personal stakes in either the costs or outcomes, these experts lack the  incentives to create truly effective accountability systems. No amount  of centralized spending control or bureaucratic oversight can match  the effectiveness of allowing parents and students to make direct  decisions about their educational resources and options. 

**The Launch (and Failure) of “No Child Left Behind”** 

In 2000, due to the disparity in educational outcomes among students  across the country, plus the continued reports of the US falling behind  other countries in test scores, conservative Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah  and liberal Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts took bi-partisan  bridged the political divide and took action. The following year, a  massive, bi-partisan federal law was passed called “No Child Left  Behind” (NCLB) with overwhelming support from both political  parties. Among other things, the law required that in the subsequent  twelve years, every state needed one hundred percent of its students  to be proficient in math and reading in order to continue receiving  billions of dollars in federal funding. The implementation of NCLB  revealed a deeper problem in education policy.  

By setting an impossible target of 100% proficiency in math and  reading, the legislation created a system designed to document failure   
8 OPEN EDUCATION  

rather than promote success. Both political parties supported this  framework despite its unattainable goals, likely because it provided  leverage for their respective education reform agendas. Democrats  could argue for increased funding to help schools meet these standards,  while Republicans could use falling test scores to advocate for private  sector alternatives. 

The impact on classroom teaching was profound. The obsession  over test scores from NCLB destroyed the joy that many teachers  felt about their career. Instead of fostering deeper learning through  creative teaching methods, educators found themselves constrained by  test-preparation curricula designed to raise scores rather than promote  understanding. This shift not only affected teacher morale but also  transformed the role of educators from mentors and guides into what  many came to describe as babysitting test-preppers. The focus on test  scores overshadowed other vital aspects of education that motivate  both students and teachers, such as comprehension, critical thinking,  and the natural joy of discovery. 

The consequences of test-focused education extend far beyond  academic metrics. The obsession with standardized testing has  stripped a generation of children of vital developmental experiences  and time for arts, social sciences, music, and crucially, unstructured  play. Many children, overwhelmed by the rigid structure and academic  pressure of the school day, began to seek refuge in screens during  their free time. Today, what we often label as iPad addiction might  actually be a symptom of an education system that has stripped away  natural outlets for creativity and relaxation. After spending hours  in highly structured, test-focused environments where spontaneity  and natural learning rhythms are suppressed, children often turn to  screens not out of mere habit, but as a form of mental decompression.  This phenomenon mirrors what many adults experience \- reaching  for phones after intense workdays, seeking what psychologists call  “passive engagement” to recover from cognitive overload.   
The Two-Hundred-Year-Old Trap 9 

For children, whose developing brains are especially sensitive to  stress and overstimulation, the need for downtime is even more acute.  The more packed a child’s school days are with test preparation and  rigid academic structures, the more they seek mindless entertainment  as a form of relief. Ironically, many traditional schools use recess as a  reward for good behavior and yet force misbehaving students to miss  recess and sit quietly to learn how to behave. This is the opposite of  what that child needs. Children need to move their bodies frequently  and benefit greatly from becoming physically exhausted before being  mentally ready to learn. A parent once commented that her young  daughter was extremely social and would talk a lot in class. As a  result, her teacher would punish her daughter by not allowing her to  go to recess; yet recess was the very outlet she needed to address her  yearning to be social with friends so she could successfully focus  on learning during class time. This dynamic has created a political  feedback loop that further entrenches these problems.  

After two decades of NCLB’s failure, both major political  parties continue to weaponize test scores to advance their preferred  solutions. Rather than question the validity of standardized testing  as the primary measure of educational success, lawmakers use poor  test results to justify their existing policy preferences, whether that  is increasing funding or promoting privatization. This approach  has failed to improve education. Incidentally, it has contributed  to declining test scores, leading some states to simply lower their  standards rather than address the underlying issues. The real tragedy  is that this system not only fails to measure what matters in education,  it actively works against it. While politicians and policymakers  debate solutions based on test scores, the fundamental needs of  children—for movement, play, social interaction, and genuine  discovery—continue to be sacrificed in pursuit of metrics that  increasingly appear to measure the system’s failure to understand  how children actually learn and develop.

**The Test Score Paradox** 

Predicting a school’s test scores is so easy that an entry-level  statistician could do it with a high degree of accuracy without ever  looking at actual scores. What method would they use to predict high  test scores? Would they use the per-pupil state spending? No. Just do a  quick comparison of Utah with New York: Utah spends approximately  $10,000 per student to get average test scores, whereas New York  spends about $35,000 per student and gets below average test scores.1 

Maybe the statistician would use factors such as teacher credentials,  teacher experience, school class size, instructional methodology, or  curriculum choice to predict success on state tests. Would that help?  Nope. None of those factors matter when it comes to actual test scores.  In fact, there is only one data point which matters, and it has for nearly  two hundred years: household income.  

According to data from FairTest and College Board, family income  shows a strong correlation with standardized test performance. Students  from families earning under $20,000 annually score approximately  55-60 points below the national average across writing, reading,  and math assessments. In contrast, students from families earning  over $200,000 annually score approximately 72-78 points above the  national average. The relationship appears consistently positive across  all three subject areas, with writing scores showing slightly more  variation at the highest income levels.  

In short, standardized test scores do not reflect the learning that  happens *inside* a classroom, they simply reflect the student’s access to  learning experiences *outside* the classroom. Under the guise of “public  accountability,” parents, teachers, and community leaders have been  convinced that a child’s learning is measurable by a standardized test.  In reality, that assumption is blatantly false. This highly lauded but  misguided testing mechanism simply measures the amount of overall  access a student has with engaging activities above and beyond the  classroom. Therefore, standardized test scores have very little to do   
The Two-Hundred-Year-Old Trap 11 

with a child’s actual schooling experience.  This is where you, as a parent, come in. For  over a hundred years, it has been culturally  acceptable in society for parents to simply  send their child to their boundary district  school and expect the child to receive  a quality education worthy of future  success. No one judged them for that. And

a grandma and grandpa or aunt and uncle at a family gathering won’t  blame a parent for doing that.  

Times are different now.  

**The Post-COVID Awakening** 

The growing resistance to standardized testing became impossible to  ignore in the years following the COVID-19 pandemic. When more  than 200,000 New York parents opted their children out of end-of-year  testing in 2022, they sent a clear message about the toll that testing  was taking on their children’s education.2 This wasn’t just isolated  pushback, it was part of a broader shift in how families approached  traditional education. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, public  school enrollment dropped by 1.2 million students across thirty-seven  states, affecting two-thirds of school districts nationwide.3 

The reasons for this shift are complex. As Stanford University  researcher Thomas Dee has documented, the COVID-era enrollment  declines were due to a combination of factors, including a rise in  homeschooling, a shift to private schools, fewer school-age children,  and some students who simply went missing from the data.4 But the  story doesn’t end there. Once parents got a taste of alternatives during  the pandemic, many started to question the status quo. They began to  explore options beyond the traditional public school system, seeking  educational approaches that better fit their children’s needs and their  family’s values.   
12 OPEN EDUCATION  

Education researcher and author Michael B. Horn describes this  shift as part of a larger trend toward the unbundling of education. In  his work, Horn argues that we are seeing a gradual move away from  the one-size-fits-all model of schooling toward more personalized, à  la carte educational options.5 However, he cautions that this change  isn’t happening overnight. Yet, on a one-hundred-year timescale,  this transformation is happening at a remarkable pace. The rigid,  industrial model of education that has dominated for more than a  century is showing signs of cracking, and alternatives are gaining  traction faster than many anticipated. Still, there are significant  transaction costs associated with piecing together a customized  education plan, which can make the process daunting for many  families. For many parents, it seems the only viable option is simply  to drop their kids off at school from 8:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. every  weekday during the school year (and figure out plans for the rest of  the year when school is not in session), so they can work and support  their family.  

Since the global COVID-19 pandemic, parents at various  income levels have been presented with more flexible, remote  work environments. At the same time, families have experienced  continuously expanding remote learning opportunities for children  and young adults. Still, many parents are reluctant to engage in  different education options for fear of being ridiculed, ostracized,  rejected, or labeled as a bad parent. The weight of tradition and  societal expectations can be heavy, and stepping outside the norm  often requires courage and conviction. 

Thankfully, it is becoming more culturally acceptable to  intentionally choose what is best for your child when it comes to  their education. In fact, the public sentiment is beginning to shift and  parents are often now openly apologizing for not taking a more active  role in their child’s education. This shift does not mean the end for  public schools, but it does signal a need for adaptation. As families  increasingly seek educational options that align with their values and   
The Two-Hundred-Year-Old Trap 13 

their children’s needs, schools and policymakers must evolve to meet  these changing demands. 

The stigma around alternative education approaches is fading.  What was once seen as fringe or unconventional is becoming more  mainstream. Parents who choose to homeschool, enroll in online or  hybrid programs, or piece together a customized, open education plan  are finding more validation and resources than ever before. 

**The Homeschool Pioneers of Open Education** 

For most of history before the public school era, kids generally learned  at home. This was the norm. But when compulsory public education  became widespread, the concept of learning at home in a familiar  environment coupled with regular playtime and community support  was forgotten. There was a sort of cultural amnesia about the fact that  kids can learn at home, and had for thousands of years.  

As early as the 1960s, pioneering parents rediscovered learning  at home, and the modern concept of homeschooling emerged. It was  mostly illegal until a push by the growing homeschool community  throughout the 1980s resulted in court victories and policy changes.  The only choice presented to parents for a century was public school  or private school (which looked a lot like public school) if you could  afford it. Then homeschooling got added to the option set as a rare,  fringe thing. 

There were approximately 100,000 homeschool students in the  U.S. in the early 1980s. It was a small, dedicated, and fast-growing  movement. Parents created networks, newsletters, co-ops, sports  leagues, extra-curricular clubs, conferences, and publishing houses for  curricula. The 1990s saw homeschooling grow from 250,000 students  at the start of the decade to over 1 million by the end. Tracking the actual  number of homeschool students remains difficult, and the numbers are  often dubious, but there are around 3.5 million homeschooled students  in the U.S. today.6 Remember that drop of over 1 million enrollments   
14 OPEN EDUCATION  

from public school since COVID? Homeschooling grew by about 1  million during that same period. 

Early homeschoolers paved the way for the open education  movement of today. These brave parents had to forge their own path,  often with little to no support or resources except what they could  create themselves. They were the radicals. They showed a different  way was possible. 

When Isaac was a kid, people would find out he was homeschooled,  wrinkle their faces, and say to his mother, ‘Aren’t you worried about  social skills?’ Today, the most common response when people find  out we homeschool our children is, ‘Oh cool\! I wish I could do that.’  What society considers acceptable—what political scientists call  The Overton Window—has shifted dramatically on this issue, and  people are increasingly open to educational options beyond traditional  schooling. Thankfully, the landscape of homeschooling has evolved  dramatically since those early days. 

**Homeschooling vs. Open Education** 

The technological and social changes of the past few decades, and  especially since 2020, have opened up possibilities that didn’t exist  for early homeschoolers. These families were fighting for the legal  right to not be forced to attend public schools, even though they were  still forced to pay for them with their taxes. They did not have the  option to pick and choose sports, activities, or elements of public (or  private) school that they might want, and discard the rest. It was an all 

or-nothing deal. You either sent your kid to school and did everything  their way, or pulled your kid out and did everything alone. Now, the option set has exploded. What it means to be homeschooled  is different today than what it once was. Of course, parents may  choose to teach their kids fully at home and not engage with any other   
The Two-Hundred-Year-Old Trap 15 

options, schools, programs, or providers. But if they want to, they can  choose to involve those other offerings in their education. That choice  wasn’t there before. 

Sometimes people ask, “Isn’t open education just another name  for homeschooling?” Yes and no. Homeschoolers are open educators,  to be sure. They are crafting an experience for their children. But not  all open educators are homeschoolers. You might create a combination  of private and public classes, books, experiences, and activities that  don’t look quite like traditional homeschooling or public schooling.  The open education mindset is about thinking beyond the labels. 

The goal is not to replace the current one-size-fits-all system  with an alternative one-size fits all solution. Nor is the goal to exit  or defund traditional public schools that still serve a crucial need for  millions of families. Rather, the objective is to help more parents  recognize that the world is opening up, in some areas quickly, some  areas slowly. The demand for more flexible, responsive education  is already changing the landscape in ways that better serve the  unique needs and potential of each child. Our collective task is to  embrace that change and accelerate it for those who are ready to  take that next step. 

The two-hundred-year-old trap of standardized education is  losing its grip, and this raises urgent questions that every parent  must confront: How do we know when a system isn’t serving our  children? What are we really measuring when we measure student  success? What becomes possible when we stop trying to standardize  children and start embracing their unique potential? The answers  might surprise you.  

To understand these possibilities, we first need to confront an  uncomfortable truth about how our education system views students— and why that view is holding back not just the exceptional few, but  every child who has ever felt that school could be something more.  
CHAPTER 2: 

STUDENTS ARE NOT STANDARD 

Everybody wants a piece of Albert Einstein’s legacy of genius.    
Schools name their gifted programs after him. Companies stamp his  wild-haired face on their motivational posters. His name has become  shorthand for brilliance itself. The irony is that Einstein’s genius  emerged in spite of the education system, not because of it.  

The man who revolutionized our understanding of the universe  was labeled a poor student, failed his college entrance exams, and  struggled to speak until age nine. Yet, he went on to win the Nobel Prize  and change our very understanding of reality itself. There is a quote  attributed to Einstein that perfectly captures this irony: “Everybody is  a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will  live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” Like many of the most  famous Einstein quotes, he likely never actually said this; though,  in keeping with our unshakeable human need to connect wisdom to  Einstein, we’re quoting it anyway. In truth, the line appears to have  originated with an 1898 essay by physicist Amos E. Dolbear of Tufts  University, who wrote a clever allegory about animals being forced  through a standardized school system. But perhaps it is fitting that  we want Einstein to have said it; after all, who better to critique our  education system than history’s most famous struggling student?

17   
18 OPEN EDUCATION  

The story of Einstein’s early schooling illustrates a truth that parents  and educators are finally beginning to acknowledge: Our system of  standardized testing and rigid assessment is not identifying aptitudes nor  helping students learn. Instead, it is breaking our children. It is creating  unprecedented levels of anxiety, depression, and alienation. It is crushing  curiosity and creativity. And perhaps most tragically, it is teaching young  people that their worth can be reduced to a number on a test. 

The problem isn’t that adults want to measure student learning; the  problem is that tests are measuring the wrong things in the wrong ways.  The writer and humorist William Bruce Cameron once observed, “Not  everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts  can be counted.” Like the fish-climbing-trees quote, this quote is also  often mistakenly attributed to Einstein, perhaps because we desperately  want someone with Einstein’s scientific authority to validate what we  know intuitively about human potential. An entire system has been  built around quantifying and standardizing things that, by their very  nature, resist standardization. The result is that we end up valuing  what we can measure, rather than measuring what we truly value. 

Would you ask a fish to climb a tree? A penguin to fly? An  elephant to swing from branches? Of course not. Yet, every day, the  traditional education system subjects children with vastly different  talents, interests, and ways of thinking to this kind of absurdity.  Students are all put through the same standardized tests, measured  against the same arbitrary benchmarks, and then labeled as failures  if they do not meet the standards. The tragedy isn’t just that this  approach fails to recognize individual differences among students;  the real tragedy is that this approach actively punishes them.  

A brilliant young musician might struggle with algebra. A  gifted programmer might have trouble with essay writing. A natural  entrepreneur might find themselves bored to tears in traditional  economics class. These aren’t failures of the students; they’re failures  of a system that insists on measuring everyone with the same rigid  yardstick. Recent research underscores just how damaging this   
Students Are Not Standard 19 

![][image2]  
one-size-fits-all approach can be. A 2021 study in the journal of  *Education Finance and Policy* found that during high-stakes testing  weeks, students’ stress hormone levels spike by an average of 15%  compared to normal school weeks.7 For some students, particularly  boys and those from high-poverty neighborhoods, this increase can  reach as high as 35%. In other words, our testing regime isn’t merely  ineffective, it’s creating trauma. 

Behind these statistics are real children sitting in real classrooms  with hearts racing as they stare at test booklets that will supposedly  determine their future. Picture the third grader who used to love  reading until it became something to be tested, or the middle schooler  who now gets stomach aches every Sunday night, or the high school  student who has learned to equate their self-worth with their SAT  score. These are not mere anecdotes \- they are the human cost of a  system that values standardization over individual potential.  
20 OPEN EDUCATION  

**Meet the Critics Head On** 

Defenders of standardized testing argue that objective measures are  needed to ensure accountability. They ask what other methods are  there to know if students are learning, if schools are performing, and  if tax dollars are being well spent. These are reasonable questions.  But they rest on a misunderstanding of a) how humans learn, b) what  kind of learning actually matters in the modern world, and c) who is  best positioned to determine whether an education is working. Let’s  confront these questions directly.  

When advocates for standardized testing talk about accountability,  what are they really trying to measure? And for whom? Consider how assessment works in other areas of life. When a  young athlete is developing, they are not given a single high-stakes  test to determine their future. Instead, their progress is observed over  time, their improvements are celebrated, and their skills develop  at different rates. When a musician learns, instructors assess their  growing mastery of various techniques, their ability to interpret  pieces, their stage presence, and their collaboration with others. In  education, however, the traditional system clings to standardized tests  as the only way to measure learning \- tests that, as many frustrated  teachers are discovering, artificial intelligence models can now easily  complete and pass. As a middle school student recently remarked to  her teacher, “If AI can answer it, maybe you shouldn’t have asked it  on your test.” That may not always be true, but she understands the  heart of something that many adults seem to have forgotten: that real  education should focus on developing uniquely human capabilities  like creativity, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and the ability  to solve novel problems.  

The irony is that even as the traditional education system clings to  standardized testing in schools, the world beyond education is moving  in the opposite direction. Major companies like Google, Apple, and  IBM have dropped degree requirements for many positions, focusing   
Students Are Not Standard 21 

instead on demonstrated skills and capabilities. Leading universities  are increasingly going test-optional, recognizing that SAT and  ACT scores are poor predictors of college success. Even traditional  professions like law and medicine are rethinking their reliance on  standardized testing, with many law schools now accepting GRE  scores instead of the LSAT. 

So, why persist with a system that the real world is increasingly  rejecting? The answer lies partly in institutional inertia, partly in  the testing industry’s enormous financial interests, and partly in  a fundamental misunderstanding of how humans actually learn.  Consider what employers really want. When surveyed about essential  skills for the modern workforce, they rank creativity, problem-solving,  collaboration, and adaptability at the top of their lists. None of these  can be measured through standardized tests. The testing regime  ignores these very capabilities. No wonder employers are ignoring  grades and test scores. 

When Isaac was young, his mom insisted he do a software program  called “Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing.” He never put his hands and  fingers in the right place on the keyboard. Instead, he typed with only  his two index fingers. He failed the typing technique test miserably. If  testing is really useful, that experience should indicate that he would  not be successful with work that involved typing. To this day, he types  with two fingers. (He typed this very sentence with two fingers.) He  loves to type. He has written over 3,000 articles, written or ghost written twelve books, and has little trouble with speed or accuracy in  typing. Add the presence of touchscreens and voice-to-text, and those  old typing tests seem even less useful. 

This disconnect between traditional grading scales and real-world  success is not lost on today’s students. Whether they’re aspiring  athletes, dancers, chess players, or e-sports enthusiasts, they can see  that making half your shots or winning just over half your points  can make you a star, not a failure. This brings us to perhaps the most  absurd aspect of standardized testing: it demands behaviors that   
22 OPEN EDUCATION  

would be considered counterproductive or even unethical in any real world situation. When faced with a problem to solve, test-takers must  not collaborate with others, must not research additional information,  must work under artificial time pressure, and get only one shot to  arrive at the right answer, with no possibility of fixing or re-doing it  if they get it wrong. In what real-world scenario would this approach  make sense? 

The truth about standardized testing is even more troubling when  we examine what it actually measures. Decades of research has  shown that test scores correlate more strongly with socioeconomic  status than with classroom learning.8 Even the test design itself  can be deliberately misleading. Matt discovered this firsthand in  college while practicing a first-grade reading assessment with a  fellow student. Following the exact instructions led his college 

educated peer to fail a test meant for six-year-olds, not because  she couldn’t read, but because the unclear instructions deliberately  misdirected her attention. When a college graduate can fail a first grade reading test, you have to wonder what we’re really measuring  with standardized tests. 

Standardized tests do not measure education, they measure  privilege, test-taking skill, and the ability to decode hidden  expectations. These flawed metrics are used to make life-altering  decisions about students’ futures. 

Of course we need accountability in education. But there should  also be some clarity about what we’re actually trying to measure and  why. Right now, American schools spend an estimated $1.7 billion  annually on standardized testing, and that’s just the direct costs. Factor  in the instructional time lost to test prep, the narrowing of curriculum,  the disruption to family life and schedule, and the psychological toll  on students, and the true price becomes staggering. Meanwhile, these  tests reveal remarkably little about whether students are developing  the skills they will actually need in life.  
Students Are Not Standard 23 

**The Myth of Standardization as Rigor** 

When people defend standardized testing, they often conflate  standardization with rigor. The assumption goes: When everyone  takes the same test under the same conditions, high standards are  maintained. But this fundamentally misunderstands what real rigor  looks like. 

In fields from athletics to the arts, from entrepreneurship to  scientific research, mastery develops through a different process, one  of feedback, practice, and critique. A scientist, for example, builds on  previous experiments, collaborates with colleagues, submits to peer  review, and revises hypotheses based on new data and arguments. As  education researcher Peter Gray has documented in his studies of self 

directed learning, children naturally tackle complex challenges when  given the freedom to explore their interests. At the Sudbury Valley  School (SVS), where students direct their own learning without  standardized curriculum or testing, nearly 90% of graduates go on to  higher education, with most getting into their first-choice colleges.  Compared to the general population, SVS graduates are more likely  to work in management positions, technology careers, education, and  helping professions. Many become entrepreneurs.9 The key is that  these students haven’t just memorized facts, they’ve learned how to  learn. They have developed personal responsibility, initiative, and the  ability to tackle new challenges with confidence. 

Yet, traditional education has somehow convinced parents and  teachers that real rigor means sitting alone with a test booklet and  racing against a clock, with no access to resources or collaboration. This  standardized approach isn’t just artificial, it actively prevents the kind  of deep learning that true rigor requires. When teachers are pressured  to teach to the test, they can’t foster the kind of rich, open-ended  exploration that leads to genuine understanding. When students know  they will be judged solely on test performance, they learn to prioritize  memorization over comprehension, compliance over creativity.  
24 OPEN EDUCATION  

The belief that meaningful measurement requires uniformity  ignores how assessment works in virtually every other field. A chef’s  skill isn’t measured by a multiple choice test about cooking; it is  demonstrated through the food they create. A programmer’s ability isn’t  determined by standardized coding questions, it’s proven through the  applications they build. A researcher’s impact isn’t evaluated through  timed exams, it’s shown through their contributions to their field. In  each case, excellence is measured through authentic demonstration  of skills in context. The standards are high, but the paths to meet  them are diverse. This is true rigor, which is quite unlike the artificial  uniformity of standardized testing. 

Yes, students who perform well on standardized tests often  succeed in college and careers. Researchers have consistently found  correlations between test scores and later outcomes like educational  attainment and employment. But this correlation reveals less than it  seems. Consider that children from wealthy families tend to score  better on standardized tests. They also tend to have better access to  college and career opportunities. Their test scores don’t predict their  success; their socioeconomic advantages predict both. It’s a classic  case of correlation being confused with causation. More telling  are the success stories that defy the testing narrative: the Sudbury  Valley School graduates who excel in college despite never taking  a standardized test; the entrepreneurs who struggled with traditional  academics but built thriving businesses; the late bloomers who found  their path after leaving the constraints of conventional schooling.  These examples remind us that human potential cannot be reduced  to a number. When test scores are mistaken for destiny, opportunities  become limited for students who might thrive given different ways to  demonstrate their capabilities. 

Similarly, the outdated school system has uncovered a peculiar  belief: that all children should learn everything at the same rate and  age, regardless of their inherent differences and experiences. This idea  is at odds with everything we know about human development.  
Students Are Not Standard 25 

If you have more than one child, you have already seen how  differently children develop. One child might walk at eight months,  while another takes their first steps at eighteen months. One might  show an early facility with numbers, while another excels in language  skills. A third might struggle with reading until age ten, then  accelerate past their peers. Would one child be viewed as smarter or  more advanced than the other? Would one be seen as less capable or  destined for failure? Of course not. Yet, our education system, born  from the industrial revolution, treats these differences as problems to  be solved rather than realities to be embraced.  

The birth-year cohort model—grouping children strictly by age— emerged less from any understanding of how children learn than from  the need to process large numbers of students efficiently, like products  on an assembly line. It was designed for administrative convenience,  not for educational effectiveness. This factory model made some  sense in the 1800s when Horace Mann convinced American industry  executives that the Prussian system of education could produce  obedient workers for their factories. Remember that the goal of this  system was standardization, creating predictable, uniform outputs  (soldiers/workers). Students were divided into cohorts by birth year  and zip code, without any consideration of their individual needs,  interests, or developmental pace. Today, this approach persists despite  mounting evidence of its failures.  

Modern science teaches that brain development varies significantly  among children. Interest and motivation play crucial roles in  learning. Different learning styles and special needs require different  approaches and timelines. Yet, the traditional education model expects  every eight-year-old to read at the same level, every twelve-year 

old to grasp algebra at the same pace, and every teenager to master  complex concepts on the same schedule. Consider how this plays out  in schools. Teachers, knowing they must move all students through  the curriculum at the same rate, face an impossible choice: Move too  quickly, and struggling students fall behind. Move too slowly, and   
26 OPEN EDUCATION  

advanced students become bored and disengaged. The result? In  trying to teach everyone at the same pace, teachers end up targeting a  mythical “average” student who doesn’t actually exist. 

When children don’t progress at the standardized pace, protectors  of the system too often view this as a failure of the child rather than a  failure of the system itself. A student who learns differently becomes  a problem to solve rather than a unique individual to nurture. This  mindset transforms schools from what they should be—active,  exciting discovery centers that inspire a lifelong love of learning— into something more akin to sterile hospitals. Teachers are forced  to diagnose problems through assessment data, issue treatments via  worksheets, monitor progress through homework, and determine  whether the patient (i.e., student) can be issued a clean bill of health  by passing a standardized test. The absurdity of this approach becomes  even more clear in our technological age.  

While the world races forward with AI and other advances,  schools cling to industrial-age methods. Just as previous generations  of educators fought losing battles against calculators in math class,  today’s system often resists rather than embraces new tools that could  help personalize learning. Instead of leveraging technology to allow  students to learn at their own pace, they are forced to power down their  devices and conform to the same uniform schedule. This resistance to  change reveals something fundamental about our education system:  it was never designed for learning; it was designed for processing,  taking diverse groups of students and attempting to standardize them  into uniform outputs. This raises an uncomfortable question: Who is  the education system actually serving? 

**The Student as a Product** 

Without standardized tests, parents and teachers might wonder how  to measure a child’s progress to know when they are ready to move   
Students Are Not Standard 27 

forward. Ironically, nearly all students advance to the next grade  and eventually graduate regardless of whether they’ve mastered the  material. The system doesn’t actually care about learning; it cares  about processing. If a student gets labeled as “D-grade,” they aren’t  sent back for improvement, they’re simply moved along the conveyor  belt with their new inferior-quality label attached. The district’s hands  are clean because they assessed the student, found them wanting, and  informed the parents. The conveyor belt keeps running. 

Follow the money and you will see who this system really  serves. Student loan debt has ballooned to $1.7 trillion. Universities  spend billions more marketing to and recruiting students who have  been properly processed by the K-12 system. College prep alone is  a $12 billion annual industry. This massive financial engine shapes  everything about how society approaches education. In K-12  education, students aren’t actually the customers at all, they are  the product\! The true customers are college admissions offices and  corporate HR departments, or worse yet, government bureaucrats  who have been allowed to dictate the terms of what education should  look like. Instead of children learning life skills and developing their  natural gifts, they are trained to progress from being student products  to higher education products and finally to employee products. Each  transition demands some kind of external validation metrics, even if  they have little to do with growth and fulfillment. 

This manufacturing mindset has created a self-perpetuating  cycle. When teachers are evaluated based on test scores, they  are forced to prioritize test prep over authentic learning. When  curriculum is designed to satisfy college admissions requirements  rather than spark curiosity and develop real-world capabilities,  countless opportunities for meaningful education are lost. When  students are treated as products to be processed rather than minds to  be developed, it’s no wonder they become disengaged from learning  altogether.  
28 OPEN EDUCATION  

**The Transparency Problem** 

There is something fundamentally broken about a system that hides its  assessment criteria from students, parents, and even teachers. Under  the rationale of ensuring testing fidelity, standardized test vendors  insist that all test questions must remain secret. This creates a bizarre  situation where students are expected to prove their knowledge without  telling them what they need to know or how they will be evaluated. 

Consider the various aspects of life where performance and  knowledge are judged. Most often, you know the judging criteria  before undertaking the effort. Imagine trying to get a driver’s license  if the DMV wouldn’t let you review traffic rules before the test. Or a  builder being denied access to construction codes before inspection.  Olympic athletes must know exactly how their performances will  be judged before they perform. No one would expect a gymnast to  practice for years with a coach who doesn’t know the scoring system,  then perform in front of judges without understanding the criteria.  Military service members understand precisely what they need to  demonstrate for promotion. 

Critics of educational transparency often say, “Would you like to  be operated on by a doctor who knew the test questions?” But this  misses the point entirely. Would you rather have a doctor who has  demonstrated expertise through hands-on practical experience, or  one who simply memorized answers to hidden test questions? Yet,  the current education system deliberately hides assessment criteria  from those who need to know it prior to the assessment. These hidden  tests are literally making children sick with stress. Teachers must  guess what might be tested, leading to scattered test prep rather than  coherent instruction. Students learn to fear assessment rather than see  it as a tool for growth. Parents are left in the dark about how to help  their children improve. 

This obsession with secrecy serves no educational purpose. Its  only beneficiaries are the testing companies themselves, who can   
Students Are Not Standard 29 

avoid scrutiny of their questions while maintaining their position as  gatekeepers of educational advancement. In any meaningful learning  experience, students should understand what success looks like. They  should know what they are aiming for and receive clear feedback  about how to improve. Instead, the testing regime treats assessment  like a game of gotcha, where success depends on correctly guessing  what anonymous test creators think is important (and which is most  often learned outside the classroom anyway). 

Parents see the damage this does. A child who loves reading for  the sake of reading becomes anxious about reading comprehension  tests. A student who excels at mathematical thinking starts to doubt  their abilities because they can’t decode what the test questions are  really asking. Teachers report spending weeks teaching students  how to think like the test maker rather than actually deepening their  understanding of the subject matter. 

To anyone who still doubts the barrier posed to real education by  teaching to the test, we return to the man so universally revered for  his creative genius. While Einstein never said the majority of clever  things attributed to him, what he *did* say speaks volumes:  

“School failed me, and I failed the school. It bored me. The  teachers behaved like sergeants. I wanted to learn what I  wanted to know, but they wanted me to learn for the exam . . .  I felt that my thirst for knowledge was being strangled by my  teachers; grades were their only measurement. How can a  teacher understand youth with such a system?”10 

Einstein was speaking about his experience in late 1800s Germany,  the very birthplace of the standardized education model adopted in  the U.S. He lived under the epitome of the Prussian system, with its  rigid hierarchies, strict discipline, and relentless focus on conformity.  While Germany eventually evolved its approach, creating different  educational tracts to accommodate various aptitudes and career paths,   
30 OPEN EDUCATION  

the United States imported the worst aspects of the Prussian model  and then refused to let it evolve.  

A century and a half later, American students still face essentially  the same system that frustrated young Einstein. And we have added  a cruel twist: rather than acknowledging different paths for different  talents, we force every student through the same narrow academic  tunnel, where their future hangs on their grades in a standardized  curriculum. These grades become a brand that follows them for life,  determining college admission, career opportunities, and even self 

worth. The price of this obsession extends far beyond the $1.7 billion  spent annually on standardized testing. When schools become test prep centers rather than places of discovery, when teachers are forced  to act like Einstein’s “sergeants” rather than guides and mentors,  children lose the natural love of learning they all bring to their first  day of school. 

The world needs innovators and problem-solvers who can tackle  complex issues. Instead, the system is producing students who have  learned to seek the right answer rather than think critically, who avoid  risk rather than embrace challenge. Einstein’s thirst for knowledge  was nearly strangled by this system. How many modern-day Einsteins  are we losing to these same practices? 

There *is* a better way. Just as Einstein argued that grades shouldn’t  be the only measurement, our education system needs to evolve and  recognize that learning happens differently for each student, at different  paces, and in different ways and places. But before a reimagined  model of growth and learning can exist, we need to understand how  our obsession with grades has trapped us in a system that confuses  measurement with meaning.  
CHAPTER 3: 

“MASTERED” OR “NOT YET” 

LeBron James is a failure. At least, he would be if we graded him like  we grade our kids. Let’s look at his report card: 

**●** Field Goal percentage: 50% (F)  

**●** 3-point Field Goal percentage: 35% (F)  

**●** Free Throw percentage: 73% (D+)  

**●** Regular Season Winning percentage: 66% (D-)  

**●** Playoff Winning percentage: 65% (D-)  

**●** Finals Winning percentage: 40% (F) 

By academic standards, the man widely considered one of the  greatest basketball players of all time would be on academic probation.  And he’s not alone. Roger Federer, arguably the most elegant tennis  player ever to grace a court, won an impressive 80% (B-) of his  matches but only 54% of the points he played, barely better than a coin  flip. Again, F. Simone Biles, the most decorated gymnast in history,  has won medals in “only” 61% of her Olympic events. In school  terms, she’s lucky to eke out a D-. Baseball is even more extreme. The 

31   
32 OPEN EDUCATION  

greatest hitters get out roughly twice as often as they make it on base.  Something is wrong with this picture. 

Imagine if coaches told these athletes they were failures because  they didn’t score 90% of the time. Imagine if children were held to  standards that would label Michael Jordan, with a career shooting  percentage of 49.7%, a failure. Yet, every day, in classrooms across the  country, this very thing happens. The education system takes young  minds as unique and varied as Federer’s serve, Biles’s floor routine,  and James’s court vision, and reduces them to a crude letter grade that  often means nothing. 

The problem isn’t just that the grading system is too harsh, it’s  that the system of measurement fundamentally misunderstands how  humans learn, grow, and achieve mastery. This system is so obsessed  with sorting and labeling that many of those entrenched in it have  forgotten what education is actually meant to offer. 

Consider what these athletes’ careers demonstrate about learning  and achievement: 

**●** Success isn’t about never failing, it’s about how you respond  to failure. 

**●** Mastery comes through iteration and improvement, not one time performance. 

**●** Different skills develop at different rates. 

**●** The path to excellence isn’t linear. Progress happens in fits and  starts. 

Yet, our education system, with its rigid grading scales and K-12  birth-year cohorts, pretends none of this is true. This system acts as if  learning happens in neat, predictable increments, identical for every  child. It pretends that a percentage point is the difference between  mastery and failure. Worst of all, the system makes children afraid to  take the kinds of risks that lead to real learning.  
“Mastered” or “Not Yet” 33 

**Rethink What Mastery Means** 

Imagine telling LeBron James that his missed shots in practice don’t  count toward improvement. That each game is a one-and-done test,  with no chance to learn from mistakes. That he needs to master  dribbling, shooting, and defense all at the same exact pace as every  other player born in 1984\. 

Watch any great athlete train and you will see the same pattern:  attempt, fail, adjust, try again. When Stephen Curry practices his  legendary three-point shot, he’s not aiming for a perfect score; he’s  seeking constant improvement. Some days he might hit 80% of his  shots, other days only 30%. But each attempt, whether successful or  not, builds toward mastery. 

Musicians understand this intuitively. No one expects a  violinist to perfect a piece in one sitting. They practice sections  repeatedly, sometimes spending hours on a single phrase. They  record themselves, get feedback from teachers, and gradually  piece everything together. The final performance isn’t a test, it’s a  demonstration of accumulated mastery. Likewise, scientists build  their careers on failure. Einstein didn’t solve relativity in one  afternoon. Each failed experiment provided data, each incorrect  hypothesis pointed toward new possibilities. As Thomas Edison  famously said, “I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that  won’t work.” 

Unfortunately, our current education system deems an 89% as  fundamentally different from a 90%, where a C+ student is forever  different from an A student, and where arbitrary letter grades become  permanent labels that follow children through their academic careers.  Mastery doesn’t work this way. Ask any successful coach and they  will tell you that what matters isn’t where you start, but how you  progress. The question isn’t “Did you get it right the first time?” but  rather “Have you mastered it yet?”  
34 OPEN EDUCATION  

A better way to think about learning is through competency-based  education. This concept, already transforming lives in schools and  programs daring to break free from the tyranny of letter grades, is a  simple but powerful idea: the “mastered” or “not yet” approach. 

Take Matt’s daughter, Eliza. At sixteen, she was a capable student  but found traditional schooling painfully rigid. After exploring  different options, she enrolled in a competency-based program that  used this “mastered” or “not yet” model. Instead of racing to keep  pace with arbitrary deadlines, she could focus on truly mastering each  concept before moving forward. She completed her associate degree  in just fourteen months, not because she rushed, but because she could  progress at her own pace, taking more time when she needed it and  accelerating when she was ready. Since then, all five of Matt’s children  have earned one or more competency-based college degrees. 

This philosophy of competency-based education is what drove  Isaac to create the Praxis program, an alternative to college for  entrepreneurial young adults. Rather than following traditional  academic schedules and grading systems, Praxis offers an intensive  36-week professional development program that combines skill 

building, mentorship, and real-world experience. When creating  the program, Isaac used a very old mechanism for demonstrating  competency that has been largely forgotten: oral exams. In addition  to business principles and tech skills, the program had rigorous, self 

guided modules on history, philosophy, and economics. When ready,  participants had 30-minute oral exams with experts and authors in  each field. Could they hold competent conversations? Could they  engage the main ideas, debate, discuss, and explain? These were not  mandatory, but allowed participants to earn optional sections in their  portfolio that showed “Excellent,” “Complete,” or “Incomplete” in  each area. They could reschedule or retake these oral exams, or use  them just for personal discovery rather than to share with the world.  Several of the examiners were also college professors, and they all   
“Mastered” or “Not Yet” 35 

raved about how enjoyable and engaging this experience was for  them, compared to grading multiple-choice and essay tests. This approach isn’t about lowering standards; quite the opposite.  In traditional schools, students routinely advance with Cs and Ds,  moving forward without truly mastering the material. Remember  that old saying: “Cs get degrees”? In competency-based education,  a student either demonstrates mastery or keeps working. There is no  settling for “close enough.” 

**The Three Elements to Real Learning** 

Dr. Tanner Bowman (Matt’s son), after years of research and earning a  doctorate in education, identified something fascinating: True learning  happens at the intersection of three critical elements: 

1\. Choice: Some level of control over how, what, and when stu dents learn.  

2\. Competency: Adequate time, resources, and support to develop  and master key skills.  

3\. Connection: Connecting learning to topics that actually matter  to the learner, and that they are curious about. 

When these three elements come together, transformative learning  happens. We have seen it play out again and again in the lives of  students who have broken free from traditional grading systems.  Consider Olivia George, an OpenEd student who started a business  called Mountain Blue Doodles at age twelve. She wasn’t just *studying* business, she was *living* it. When most kids her age were doing  homework, she was working four jobs to save $2,100 for her first  breeding dog. Marketing wasn’t theoretical for her, it meant building  a website that would convince skeptical adults to trust a teenage  entrepreneur. When she faced challenges (and there were plenty), they   
36 OPEN EDUCATION  

weren’t viewed as red marks on a report card, they were real problems  that demanded real solutions. 

“My parents loved me enough to allow me to fail,” Olivia recalls.  “They understood that success often comes after numerous failures,  and instead of preventing me from experiencing disappointment, they  let me learn from my mistakes.” 

The three Cs came together perfectly in Olivia’s story. She had  the freedom to choose her own path rather than follow a preset  curriculum. She received the resources and mentorship needed to  build real competency, from animal care to business management.  And she was driven by a genuine connection to her work, breeding  dogs that would change people’s lives. The result was a thriving  business that provides service and therapy dogs to families across the  region, and more importantly, a young entrepreneur who mastered  real skills by pursuing what mattered to her. You can’t learn customer  service from a worksheet, develop business acumen from a textbook,  or build financial literacy through multiple choice tests. These skills  came through the powerful combination of personal choice, supported  learning, and genuine passion. 

Choice is more than just picking your favorite flavor of ice cream.  Real choice—the kind that drives deep learning—is about having  agency over your educational journey. Research shows this kind  of authentic choice leads to deeper engagement.11 As psychology  professor Dan Ariely has found, a person’s willingness to work hard at  something is directly tied to how meaningful they perceive the task to  be.12 Through freedom of choice, a young person who wants to learn  something will often do it through whatever means are necessary.  Providing various pathways to learning with supporting resources is  much more valuable than forcing a singular set of tasks, assignments,  or tests. 

Competency means mastering skills at your own pace, with the  support and resources needed. It is about demonstrating real capability,  not just checking boxes.  
“Mastered” or “Not Yet” 37 

Connection means linking learning to real life. Allowing children  to explore their interests creates the authentic energy needed for them  to learn to read, write, and do math. Learning, then, happens at the  point where a child wants to not only learn something new, but has  recognized their own gap in knowing it. Real motivation doesn’t have  to be forced.  

Consider the Thygerson family, whose educational path led them  from their local school in Utah to the foothills of Nepal. The Thygersons  were just a regular family that decided to take education into their  own hands in partnership with OpenEd. While their former classmates  were memorizing facts for standardized tests, the Thygerson kids  were designing safety vests, competing in robotics competitions, and  yes, spending three months in Nepal, all on a modest budget. More  importantly, they were learning how to learn. “The things that you  learn when you travel are not in textbooks,” one of the Thygerson  children said of his education. “They’re not just things that you’re  told. They’re things that you experience and see firsthand.” Each  project became its own competency-based curriculum, where success  meant actually creating something that worked or navigating the real  world, not just scoring well on a test about how things work. 

Across the country and around the world, schools and programs  are proving that when students are allowed to focus on mastery rather  than grades, they thrive. In Southern New Hampshire University’s  competency-based program, students demonstrate mastery through  real-world projects rather than tests. In 2023, 70% of participating  high school seniors graduated with college degrees before they even  finished high school. Not because they were exceptional students,  but because they were given the freedom to learn at their own pace  and demonstrate mastery in their own way. Other universities across  America have adopted competency-based education, as have entire  countries like Finland and New Zealand. They have discovered that  focusing on mastery rather than time spent in class better prepares  students for a rapidly changing world.13  
38 OPEN EDUCATION  

The model is surprisingly simple: 

**●** Students progress at their own pace, with the freedom to pause  when needed. 

**●** Expectations are clear and transparent from the start. **●** Multiple attempts are encouraged, converting “not yets” into  mastery. 

**●** Real-world application matters more than theoretical knowledge. 

This philosophy can even be found in unexpected places. Take  Harry Potter’s “Dumbledore’s Army,” perhaps the greatest argument  for competency-based learning in modern literature. When their  traditional teacher refused to provide practical defense training, the  students created their own learning environment. They practiced at  their own pace, focused on real-world applications, and supported each  other’s growth. Each student developed their strengths, motivated by  a genuine need to learn. It’s a perfect example of what education can  look like when we trust learners to drive their own development. 

**The Freedom to Be Less Than Perfect** 

In a recent commencement address at Dartmouth, Roger Federer (the  F tennis player, remember him?) reflected on his nearly 50% failure  rate at the level of points played. “When you lose every second point  on average,” Federer explained, “you learn not to dwell on every shot.  You teach yourself to think: Okay, I double faulted . . . it’s only a  point. Okay, I came to the net and got passed again . . . it’s only a  point. Even a great shot, an overhead backhand smash that ends up on  ESPN’s Top 10 playlist, that too is just a point.”14 

Like planting a garden, improvement is like a steady drip line  providing small amounts of water daily to nurture growth far better  than flooding the entire area once a week, which drowns the seedlings.  Learning works the same way. Small, daily progress, with plenty   
“Mastered” or “Not Yet” 39 

of room for mistakes, beats the high-pressure deluge of traditional  education. 

This mindset extends beyond sports. Consider Amy, Matt’s  wife and a mother of five who used to see those “World’s Greatest  Mom” mugs and feel like she could never measure up. Then she had  an epiphany: What if being the World’s Okayest Mom was actually  enough? When her first grandchild was on the way, the family even  printed her a World’s Okayest Grammy t-shirt. It became their motto,  right down to Amy’s custom license plate: OK EST. 

Isaac’s grandfather, a rough-and-tumble, salt-of-the-earth WWII  vet who loved working with his hands, used to say when he thought  a project was done, “Good enough for who it’s for.” He was a prolific  craftsman, churning out toys and bird feeders and kitchen utensils  like a one-man factory. He wasn’t trying to win any competitions, he  was just trying to finish the task and enjoy the process. He never let  perfection slow him down. 

As Emily Stewart pointed out in a 2024 *Business Insider* article  titled “The Joy of Average,” our obsession with optimization and  excellence in every area has backfired spectacularly.15 We have created  a world where being anything less than the best—whether as a parent,  employee, or student—feels like failure. But what if, like Federer with  his lost points, we learned to embrace the power of good enough in  some areas so we can focus our energy where it matters most? That is  the power of the “not yet” portion of the mastered or not yet model of  learning. 

Ask yourself this question: Have you mastered everything there is  to do on Earth? Of course not. Even reading that probably made you  laugh. We are all a bunch of “not yets” at countless things, and that’s  okay; it’s simply how life actually works. Think about instant replay  in sports. When refs make a call on the field, they’re making their best  judgment with the information they have. But when new evidence  comes in via replay, the fans don’t consider it failure to change the call,  we consider it progress. It’s converting a “not yet” into a “mastered.”  
40 OPEN EDUCATION  

Every great chef has burned meals, every architect has crumpled  up drawings (or deleted CAD files), every scientist has run failed  experiments. This is how we figure things out. No entrepreneur  launches a perfect product on day one. No athlete performs flawlessly  in their first game. Excellence comes through iteration, through the  freedom to fail forward. But somewhere along the line, the established  education system decided that each attempt was a final verdict. Get a  C in algebra? That’s it, you’re a C student forever. Score poorly on  a standardized test? Clearly you’re not a math person. Learning has  morphed into a one-and-done performance instead of what it really is:  a continuous journey of converting not yets into mastery. 

**Reimagine What’s Possible** 

When thirteen-year-old Logan LaPlante took the stage for his TED talk,  “Hackschooling Makes Me Happy,” he posed a question that stopped  everyone in their tracks.16 As he explained, adults were always asking  him what he wanted to be when he grew up. They expected the usual  answers: astronaut, professional athlete, or neurosurgeon. But Logan  had a different response: “When I grow up, I want to be happy.” 

Like computer hackers who modify systems to work better,  LaPlante saw education as something to be reinvented, customized,  and improved; hence, “hackschooling.” A hacker mindset, he  explained, means seeing a thousand possibilities where others see only  one prescribed path. It sounds simple, maybe even naive. But Logan  was tapping into something profound. While our education system  rushes to prepare kids for careers, it often forgets to prepare them for  life. He went on to identify eight key elements of a healthy, happy  life, from exercise and nutrition to relationships and spirituality. His  question: Why aren’t these core life skills considered as important as  traditional academics? 

Rather than following any single curriculum or approach,  hackschooling means taking advantage of community opportunities,   
“Mastered” or “Not Yet” 41 

learning through direct experience, and never losing sight of happiness  and health as priorities. It’s flexible, opportunistic, and focused on  real-world application. Most importantly, LaPlante emphasized that  any learner can adopt this mindset, not just homeschoolers. Whether  you’re in traditional school or learning independently, the key is to  see education not as a rigid system but as something you can actively  shape and improve. 

There is an old Zen saying that illuminates why even wealthy  people often wake up miserable: “To be happy, one must strive to  become a master of a challenging skill which one enjoys doing.?”  Think about that for a minute. Kids who inherit fortunes or win the  lottery often end up unhappy, despite their millions. Meanwhile,  someone mastering a craft—whether woodworking or coding,  teaching or cooking—finds deep satisfaction even in the struggles.  Add to that wisdom another key ingredient: Find a way to bless  humankind with it. When you connect personal mastery to making  the world better, deep purpose emerges. 

Through hackschooling, LaPlante discovered the power of taking  charge of his own education and finding the resources he needed to  grow. This is what the Zen masters taught their students, and what  more and more families are discovering: One of the most direct paths  to happiness is learning something you’re genuinely interested in,  becoming really good at it, and finding a way to share it with others.  The multiplier effect of this approach creates ripples of joy that extend  far beyond the individual learner. 

The pressure to conform to traditional education isn’t just an  American phenomenon. Consider the recent story of a family who fled  China’s educational pressure cooker for Thailand. In China, the drive  for academic excellence has become so intense that parents literally  upend their lives for it, quitting jobs and renting apartments near  prestigious schools just to hover over their children’s studies. They  call it *peidu*, or “accompanied studying.” But really, it’s educational  martyrdom. The Chinese have even coined terms for this exhausting   
42 OPEN EDUCATION  

race to nowhere: *neijuan*, the rat race that leads to burnout, and *tang  ping*, lying flat, giving up entirely. It’s telling that a culture had to  invent multiple words just to describe educational burnout.17 

Meanwhile in the UK, when officials proposed fining parents  whose kids skip school, children’s laureate Anne Fine pushed back  with a radical suggestion: Stop assuming every child is better off in  traditional school. “Absenteeism,” she argued, “should be thought  of as, ‘Here are a lot of children trying to tell us something. How  can we accommodate what it is they’re telling us?’” She’s right.  Today’s record absenteeism isn’t just about kids skipping school, it’s  about families voting with their feet. Before COVID, we might have  dismissed alternative education as a fringe movement. Now we’ve  seen that children can be self-aware, autonomous learners rather than  empty vessels waiting to be filled.  

The truth is, parents have far more flexibility than they realize.  Most assume they are locked into rigid institutional schedules, but  reality is more fluid. Consider the entrepreneur who loved having his  daughter home during spring break so much that he dreaded sending  her back to school. When told he could simply inform the school that  she would be traveling with him for a few months, he was stunned.  “Can I just do that? Won’t the school be mad?” The school wasn’t  thrilled, but they couldn’t stop him. His daughter had an incredible  few months of learning through travel, returning to school when  it made sense for their family. She wasn’t dropping out, she was  dropping in and out as needed. Once he realized this was possible,  it transformed their approach to education. Like the family who left  China’s pressure cooker for Thailand, or the British parents pushing  back against truancy fines, this father discovered that the traditional  system’s power exists largely in our minds. 

Families everywhere are waking up to these possibilities. Education  can be more flexible, more personalized, and yes, happier than we  have been led to believe. The only question is: what’s stopping you?
