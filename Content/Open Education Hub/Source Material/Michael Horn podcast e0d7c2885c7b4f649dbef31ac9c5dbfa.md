## [00:00:00] Introduction and Welcome

[00:00:00] **Michael:** my perception is size fits all never made sense. It worked for a number of decades cause the expectations were such that like it sort of stayed in line, but it wasn't really the way to optimize learning or development or opportunity. And the system has been breaking for the last several decades.

[00:00:14] **Matt:** Hey, everyone, welcome to this edition of the open ed podcast. We're super excited to have you.

## [00:00:27] Guest Introduction: Michael Horn

[00:00:27] **Matt:** Our guest today is Michael Horn. He is one of the world's most respected thought leaders in education, and he has a long bio, but basically he does everything. And he's thought about everything related education.

[00:00:40] And so we're super excited to have Michael on on with us today.

## [00:00:45] Michael Horn's Recent Book

[00:00:45] **Matt:** I've got to do a little shout out for his most recent book, uh, from reopen to reinvent actually spotlights my tech high, which is now open ed, uh, as one of the providers that he spotlights in his, his book. So [00:01:00] thank you, Michael, for joining us today.

[00:01:01] Super excited to chat with you. Oh,

[00:01:05] **Michael:** a blast to be with you guys. And I was, I was laughing when you did the intro, you know, you said one of the most respected blah, blah, blah. I'm most respected in like your corner of the world. Right. But I don't know about, you know, where, where, where else, you know, I'm not wandering the halls of Congress anytime soon.

[00:01:20] So, you know, who knows?

[00:01:22] **Isaac:** Matt, uh, what, what page was that, that, uh, my tech guy has mentioned in

[00:01:26] **Michael:** guys are a few page. You guys are a few in there. You guys are a few times in there.

[00:01:30] **Isaac:** Matt knows exactly which page the first, uh, appearances. So that's, um, that's how excited, excited we are to, to be on here and chatting with you. So, well,

[00:01:39] **Matt:** so glad to have you, Michael.

## [00:01:40] Personal Story and Connection

[00:01:40] **Matt:** And in fact, let me share a personal story that, uh, I don't even know if you remember, Michael, this was back in 2015, so I had, you know, been running my tech high now, open ed for several years and reading everything that you were writing and I said, I've got to chat with that guy somehow and so I [00:02:00] responded to one of your blog posts It's challenging something you said in it and you actually responded.

[00:02:07] And I was so impressed with that. And then we ended up having a dialogue and, uh, I've just been honored to be connected with you ever since. Cause you know, you, I, what I shared was our model has been following the disruptive innovation cycle to a T. We found non consumers of the public ed system, i. e.

[00:02:27] homeschoolers. We then innovated around the edges of regulation, not, you know, not crossing into law. And then we predicted the regulators would attempt to catch up and edit regulations, even if they weren't changing the law. And so, Like all of those things were in your disruptive innovation cycle. And I thought it's fascinating that you nailed it to a T.

[00:02:52] So,

[00:02:53] **Michael:** No, and I, I mean, I have a, I had forgotten about that one, but I, I remember because I always loved. [00:03:00] Engaging with people who gave like earnest pushback and comments. Cause that's how you learn, right? Like if you're just a jerk, that's like, I'm not going to read that. Right. Um, but then I remember, I think actually I was testifying in Utah.

[00:03:13] I could be wrong. It was some conference in Utah. So I I'm just walking back. I've been in some state legislatures, but the, um, and you came up to me at the conference and you were like, We are doing this, like see what we're doing. And I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then I've obviously learned a lot more about you all, uh, in the years since.

## [00:03:34] Discussion on Education Models

[00:03:34] **Michael:** And I agree like you, not just in the K 12 system, but through college and into employment, you all are truly rethinking, I would argue the value network. Of what it means to get educated in this day and age in a very different world from, you know, the 1930s when there were a lot more middle class jobs that didn't require, uh, advanced learning.

[00:03:59] **Matt:** [00:04:00] yeah, that's a good segue. Tell us more about what you're seeing these days, Michael.

[00:04:06] **Isaac:** yeah,

[00:04:07] **Michael:** Yeah. I mean, where, where do you want to go? I think it's a really interesting time because, My perception, and you guys are much closer to it because you're educating the families. But as I look at it, my perception is one size fits all never made sense. It was never the right way to educate kids, serve families, et cetera.

[00:04:25] It worked for a number of decades cause the expectations were such that like it sort of stayed in line, but it wasn't really the way to optimize learning or development or opportunity. And the system has been breaking for the last several decades. And then.

## [00:04:39] Parental Choices in Education

[00:04:39] **Michael:** My perception is like parents increasingly are not putting up with one size fits all.

[00:04:45] They're saying we are making choices. They're making lots of different choices, right? Some of them are, we're going to the micro school for everything. We're going, you know, to an independent school for everything. We're going, like, you know, we're going to the charter. Some of them increasingly, I [00:05:00] think, are starting to say like, we'll take a little bit from here.

[00:05:02] We'll go here for the sports. We'll take this tutor and cobbling it together. And I think a lot of people are worried about the transaction costs on parents. I am too, but. I think parents have always dealt with this stress in coordinating after school activities, figuring out who's gonna care for their kid summer and so forth.

[00:05:22] And so I think it's less than we think as a, as like an add-on, and parents are acting. And frankly, to your point, policy is starting to catch up I think in some meaningful ways like. You know, depending on how you count it, somewhere between 13 and 19 states now have education savings accounts type policies. It's, I, I think it's very significant, and You know, you obviously have figured out how to partner with districts, right. And help them stand up, um, alternative schooling options in some pretty neat ways, my belief is that [00:06:00] the only way, uh, districts, you know, like this, this competitive pressure is a good thing.

[00:06:05] Cause districts are going to have to find increasing ways to offer a portfolio of options and get out of the one size fits all mindset.

[00:06:12] **Isaac:** you know, Michael, um, you're probably the best person I can think of to ask this question to

## [00:06:18] Adoption Curve in Education

[00:06:18] **Isaac:** I want, I would love your take on. Like where we are on the adoption curve because for decades If you say oh the education system is too rigid. It's too confining. It constrains curiosity You know, ken robinson gave his famous ted talk and it was immediately everybody loved it It's like yes, everyone agrees.

[00:06:37] Nobody's happy. But then all these innovators come out there and say here's this new model here's this new thing they tried to do vouchers back in the 90s and like Either if it's a if it's a private alternative, they never get that much scale or even if it's a policy change It seems pretty limited. I heard a stat, I don't know if this is true, so you can check me on it, that there's 47 million students in the U S [00:07:00] that have access to some kind of school choice program or another, and only 1 million of those are actually.

[00:07:07] Taking advantage of it. And I don't know if that's true, but I wouldn't be shocked if something like that was true. And so there's always been this kind of paradox as somebody who is trying to innovate in this space myself. And in my case, it was college. Everyone would agree. Yeah. College doesn't prepare you for jobs.

[00:07:22] It costs too much, blah, blah, blah. And then I'm like, great, look, I have this thing. It's a net cost of zero. You're going to get hired. 98 percent of our grads do blah, blah, blah. And the market still is really, really small. Right. And so.

## [00:07:32] Challenges in Education Innovation

[00:07:32] **Isaac:** It's felt like the adoption curve and like so you get on this graveyard of cool innovations and policy changes And I want to know like it feels to me like since covid The adoption has actually increased in like a meaningful like an exponential growth not linear growth Like there are more and more parents that actually are ready now for the things everybody's been talking about But I could be wrong like all these esa policy changes that could be innovators getting too far ahead of their skis and the market Might [00:08:00] not be ready for it yet.

[00:08:00] I don't know. I'd love your take I'm like, where are we on that adoption curve

[00:08:05] **Michael:** Yeah, it's a great question. Um, so a couple thoughts, I guess I my guess is that it's more like 10 million students or so are actively taking advantage of choice. Uh, options and the number would be higher if you consider the fact that like families like mine can move to any, you know, locale, uh, in the, almost any locale in the country.

[00:08:29] Um, and therefore we have a choice at that level. So, you know, if you counted it that way, it's like, Probably 25 million. But let's say 10 million or so, I think, are taking advantage of some form of choice. I don't think they're unbundling, right? And doing the more radical forms of choice or permeability, shall we call it, right?

[00:08:50] Where I'm in, I'm moving, and then, you know, Right. Like that's, I think that's much, much lower. That's probably about, you know, that's probably homeschooling populations, probably, you [00:09:00] know, 4 million or something like that. So it's, it's, but let's call it 5 million. Right. Something like that. Um, So I think that's where we are there.

[00:09:09] I agree. It has upticked significantly since COVID. I think that broke, even though a lot of people rushed back to normal, some larger subset said, wait a second, we can do things differently. And it's kind of awesome. Um, and so it unleashed a force. I think the ESA movement is fundamentally different in very important respects from vouchers.

[00:09:33] Um, which is to say a voucher is like a ticket for one thing. It's still one size fits all at some level. And ESA is like, here's a bunch of money. How do you want to distribute it across a bunch of options? And if you save, that's okay. Cause it spills over to next year and increases your options then.

[00:09:51] Right. It's a very different, I think, mindset and so forth. So I, I think, you know, when the wall street journal, like in their news [00:10:00] section calls it a voucher, I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's different, and the difference, I think, matters, in my view. I think they're extremely like grassroots politically popular.

[00:10:13] They're the, you know, not in the RD sort of divide of the world. Right. But like on the ground with actual families, I think they're extremely popular. I think the big question in terms of the, are we getting out ahead of it?

## [00:10:25] Supply and Demand in Education

[00:10:25] **Michael:** And I'm worried about this is like, I don't think the supply side, the demand, I think is growing finally the supply side in terms of a real marketplace of different options that are sustainable.

[00:10:38] I don't think that's mature at the maturity that it needs to be. And I guess I say that in the sense of like, I think you can find an option. I think a lot of the micro schools and other things that I've seen. They don't feel like they have sustainable business models to me past year two or three because it's a lot of teachers being like, I'll volunteer for a year.

[00:10:58] No, no, no, no. I don't want you to [00:11:00] volunteer for a year. I want you to make a living doing this and it like work out for like mutual benefit for everyone. Um, and I, I don't think we've spent enough time. I look, this has to be in bottoms up, not top down, but like, I don't think there's been enough time thinking about real sustainable models.

[00:11:17] Um, That, that, that solved there. I guess the last thing I would say, and I think Matt, this was like the original push you had on me, if I recall, um, was I think I made the statement that like, it's not just clear that disruptive innovation. Is possible in the US K 12 system because there's not a, there's not really a lot of non consumption, right?

[00:11:41] And I think that's still like a reality. There are homeschool families, they're increasing, but like, it feels like public schools are free. They're not actually, by the way, but like, it feels like they are free. Right. And it's, I, it's very hard to compete with universal compulsory free. [00:12:00] Um, in other marketplaces, you have much bigger areas of non consumption and more dynamism.

[00:12:05] And so I think that's why it's been so slow and halting to your point, Isaac, of like why it's taking so long and you have to throw over, frankly, not just like your own family's decision, which is fraught with emotion and social pressure, but also the expectations of your family members on like, you know, Your grandparents and like cousins, what are you doing?

[00:12:28] Right. Neighbors. Um, but also then employers, colleges, like our schools sit in this very complicated ecosystem of value network. I would call it right of lots of different players. And historically, when you see major transformation. I like to say systems disrupt systems. Like system change is a folly. It's actually a whole new system replaces the existing system.

[00:12:53] That's a lot of work when you just think about how interdependent and interlocked and habitual small C [00:13:00] conservative, so many elements of these are like you take your higher ed example, right? Isaac, you know, I think on a micro scale, you can do this, but to get all the companies and all the individuals to buy in to a very different signal of talent, ability, potential, it's just, it's, it's glacial.

[00:13:21] I mean, you know, and last thought, this is an optimistic one, even though it might not sound like it, you know, clay Christensen, when he wrote about the disruption of steel mills, it took 40 years. might take a little bit longer and that's, you know, we, we, we, we need to keep We need to keep pushing at it.

[00:13:42] I think,

[00:13:43] **Matt:** I just want. Yeah, I so agree. I wanted to add a couple thoughts. Uh, I jotted down here. The, the, the Wall Street Journal comment around ESAs are just vouchers.

## [00:13:56] Micro Schools and ESA Policies

[00:13:56] **Matt:** What's interesting that we're seeing is that the data [00:14:00] from these ESA providers, like, still 90 percent of ESAs are going to a single provider private school.

[00:14:07] Right. Except the forecast in Utah is 50%. And the reason people in the market are saying their projection of Utah's. Being 50 percent is because my tech high open ed has been around for 15 years to show that there's a way to all the cart your child's education. And I find that super fascinating that as other states and even you've said it in articles.

[00:14:38] The ESA adoption over time goes from a single payer voucher to an a la carte model. We see that happen over years of an ESA and Utah's ESA starts, actually just started August 7th. So like literally it's the first in the market right now and they're projecting people are going to use it [00:15:00] more a la carte than any other state.

[00:15:02] **Michael:** that's tremendous, Matt. I didn't realize that. I mean, and, and, and I think what you're seeing, the evidence I think is supporting the idea more broadly. I agree with the 90 percent number, but you look at Florida, I think it's now down to 70 percent or something like that. So, More people are realizing I can break this up, fracture it and fractionalize it in different ways.

[00:15:24] And it's something you see in all markets, right? Which is that people are initially not aware of how they want to customize things. You know, Henry Ford Model T, any color, as long as it's black, that's great. It's an automobile. But then I all of a sudden start to become aware of like. Oh, I want a different color.

[00:15:41] Oh, I want a different seating arrangement. Oh, I want to, you know, sedan into a station wagon, into a truck, right? Like all of a sudden choice becomes more viable as, as consumers get more experience with it. And you think about the behavior in this country, we've had, you know, effectively, let's call it [00:16:00] 120 years of people being like, Oh, I go to school. Um, and school includes. Football team, food, academics, you know, on, right. Like it, it's the bundle. And so I think it's, it's going to take some time, I think, um, to, to, to change that. I mean, we had this experience during the pandemic. Sorry, this is not a story I've shared anywhere publicly, but like when we.

[00:16:27] Here you go. Here you go. When we took our kids out of the independent school, they were in Montessori school. They're back in it now. It's great. Um, but when we took, uh, took them out, um, Uh, we, we sort of made an offer, if you will, to, um, where we said, let us help you set up a micro school on your campus where it'll be just a few students and then like, they can opt into here and like, we'll do, you know, unbundle this here and they're like, we're just not ready for that conversation.

[00:16:58] Michael, you go do your thing. [00:17:00] Right? Um, yeah. Okay, we tried. We tried to keep up with the community, but I think that's the other thing is the suppliers aren't like, you know, were it not for my tech high now open ed districts wouldn't even know how to have this like, you know, accommodate this. And I remember distinctly.

[00:17:17] Here's another story. I remember distinctly talking to our local school district during the pandemic and being like, Set up a micro school and they're like, what would that look like? They brought the senior leadership cabinet on a zoom meeting and I started to describe it and they like all went ghost white because like all the amount of work that they were thinking they would have to do to set that up was so high.

[00:17:36] And I was like, well, you could just talk to my tech high. Like there's a provider that could help you do 80 percent of what I just described. But like. This is what it would mean. And, and I think they didn't get over their initial, I approached it wrong. They, they, they didn't get over the initial, uh, shock.

[00:17:51] I remember all the faces, like, I remember all the faces going ghost white. I was like, okay, I screwed that one up. So

## [00:17:58] Vendor Side of Education Marketplaces

[00:17:58] **Isaac:** you know, it's funny that [00:18:00] the vendor side, the provider side, I think is a little bit overlooked. They're sort of this idea. If we pass an ESA and then it's just like, boom, the market's open and all these providers will flood in. But this is a two, this is a two sided marketplace and any two sided marketplace faces the cold start problem.

[00:18:19] And in this case. It's not too hard to get the parents and students because you're basically just offering to give them money That's a really easy thing to sell right like free money is an easy product to sell But on the other side, I think there's been a lot of hesitancy I mean if you go look at most of the existing esa like Marketplaces, that's a probably a overly generous term.

[00:18:41] It's usually just like literally a list Of text with like hyperlinks to different providers and there's there's very little Marketplace functionality, but it's also just too broad. I mean, can you imagine if amazon from day one? Was like, we're the everything store. Literally everything you want can be bought and [00:19:00] sold on our platform.

[00:19:00] Go ahead. Vendors start listing stuff. Like it's too big. They started with used books only. Right. Or Airbnb, if they were like, you can rent anything from anybody. No, it was just, it was just rooms in a house, right? It wasn't like lawnmowers and kitchen utensils. And so I think this, this. That combined with the fact that it's like everything, all education, everything you can, you can list as a provider, but there's also the uncertainty of policy.

[00:19:25] There's kind of a lot of a, let's test out an ESA for 5, 000 people under certain conditions. And there's a bunch of enemies of it and you know, it's going to get sued. You know, the restrictions are going to change and it's, and as an entrepreneur, that's scary because you could invest a lot of time. So there's not a lot of marketing of these resources.

[00:19:43] There's not a lot invested from the vendor side and going insane. Oh, great. An ESA opened up. I'm going to invest millions of dollars in building an amazing education offering that can tap into these dollars. It's kind of like, well, I guess I'll like list some stuff there and dip my toe in and see if anything happens, but it's, [00:20:00] I just don't know.

[00:20:01] There's too much uncertainty and I think that's going to take time. You're going to have to see one or two states that really prove it's not going anywhere. The guidelines are relatively stable. It's navigable to really get some serious investment.

[00:20:16] **Michael:** I think it's such a great point because we know markets like certainty investment, like certainty. Um, I think it's such a, a, such an important point. The other thing we know, out school, who you all know, um, they've done some research out of their foundation arm, um, where they went into different markets and helped, you know, started giving away money like this.

[00:20:38] And to your point, Isaac, easy to give the money away, actually hard to get the families to spend it because there also had to be social trust and recommendations and sort of guidance. Right. And I don't mean that in a top down way, because I think that's often what. People hear when you hear guidance, but like a very bottom up social trust way of, of, of saying, Oh, like that, that, that's a trustworthy [00:21:00] provider and you used it.

[00:21:01] Okay, cool. Like, I'll, I'll, I'll do that. Right? Um, and so that takes some time. And I think you're right. It's better if it's narrow initially, actually. Because it can be understood. It can be digested. It solves, as Clay would have said, you know, one job to be done, not, not like millions of jobs to be done. If you, if you give me something that says it solves millions of jobs to be done, I'll tell you something that's not solving any of them.

[00:21:23] **Isaac:** You know, that's funny. That reminds me of something I wanted to ask you about because I saw, I was looking at your Twitter. And, uh, you had a great tweet or maybe you were retweeting someone else. I can't remember. That was something to the effect of, what if we don't need schools to just keep offering more and more and more different stuff?

[00:21:40] What if they need to just do less and focus on a few things? And you said something like the concept of pruning education is often overlooked. And I think especially for those of us who are like, let's open it up, let's get more possibility on the table.

## [00:21:51] The Importance of Niching Down in Education

[00:21:51] **Isaac:** That may be true for the market as a whole, but for any individual like provider or school, Yeah.

[00:21:56] Yeah. What do you think about narrowing the scope [00:22:00] and getting niching down? So to speak,

[00:22:02] **Michael:** Yeah. I mean, look, it's, I, so I agree with what you said as a market, as a whole. We want. More options varied, et cetera, but we want them to be actually differentiated. So I don't want someone that's doing all things for all people. I want them to be awesome at one thing and choose what they suck at. And then, uh, and, and, and I think we're just really bad at that historically in education, like public school districts.

[00:22:25] They're like, Oh, we should add a program on this. We should add a program on this. We should add a program. They never take anything off their plate. And we know the cost of complexity in terms of subpar performance and cost overrun from an administrative perspective, it's really, really high. Uh, and so I, I just, you know, the whittling of programs that are not perhaps doing what you had hoped that they did.

[00:22:49] Which also, by the way, would mean that you have to have a clear definition up front of what you hope that they do. Um, but also frankly, like we're very wed to tradition in education without asking the [00:23:00] question, is this like, what was the tradition built to do and is this the best way to still get that outcome or is there a better process, right?

[00:23:08] Like, Pep rallies were awesome for building school spirit 50 years ago. They can be pretty alienating to large parts of your population. You know, uh, uh, today, maybe there's other ways to do this. I don't know. I'm not smart enough, but I, we, we never asked the question of what should be cut.

[00:23:24] **Isaac:** it's funny. Um, and Matt, I'll let you jump in here. I know I've been kind of taken over, but it's almost like, um, the curse of a noble business. Like if you tell somebody, I'm passionate about education. I want to do something to help children learn better. That's so noble and everyone loves it so much that they're not going to tell you the things that you shouldn't do nearly as well.

[00:23:46] If you're in like a typical tech startup and you're like, I'm trying to sell a product that helps companies optimize their API web hooks. And your business model is too broad. It's you're very much more likely to run into peers, investors who will [00:24:00] say, you're trying to do too many things. Here's all the things that's wrong with what you're doing.

[00:24:03] If you say, I'm trying to help learners do these 15 things, and they all sound like really good, noble things. People feel they'll just tell you encouraging things and they're less likely to say your business model sucks, right? Because your intentions are so good.

[00:24:17] **Michael:** Yeah, totally.

## [00:24:18] Challenges of Nonprofits in Education

[00:24:18] **Michael:** I mean, this is look, I ran a nonprofit for a decade, right? The Christiansen Institute. Um, it's so hard for nonprofits in this, in this realm in particular, because it's like a death by a thousand cuts. This funder says, start this program. This one starts this program, this one, this one.

[00:24:34] And you all of a sudden have tons of programs with no strategic direction or coherence, right? Among them. Um, Um, and I think that's the, you know, what you just said is the reason why, like, Oh yeah, of course we should do that. Like, of course we should do that, right? How could we not do that for that one kid?

[00:24:50] And the answer is like, actually, maybe that kid would be better served. In a different offering. And like, the best thing we can do is say, we're not the [00:25:00] right outlet, but we will help you get to the right place and say no to you. Um, and I think we're, we're, we're, I totally agree. We're not particularly good at it.

[00:25:08] I actually think because I'm among, like, I really trust you guys. So I'm going to say it's like the hot take that is not popular, but like, I think we do ourselves a disservice by having social entrepreneurs versus just regular entrepreneurs.

[00:25:22] **Isaac:** Amen.

[00:25:23] **Michael:** building a business. Is help like if it takes off, it's helping someone make progress in some meaningful way.

[00:25:29] And so I actually think by creating a category of social entrepreneurship, we invite the problem you just described. Yeah. Yep.

[00:25:37] **Isaac:** I told Matt, uh, when we first started talking about, you know, open ed and me coming on board. I was like, I don't know if you face this map, but when I was running Praxis and I very deliberately for that reason, after having worked in nonprofits, wanted it to be a for profit because I wanted to know if I'm actually creating value in the market, I want those signals and that feedback as fast as possible.

[00:25:57] But I told him, you know, the worst thing in the world when you're [00:26:00] an entrepreneur in the education space, everybody wants to talk with you and they're like, Hey, I'm doing something too. I'm doing good things too. And let's, let's do something together. Check out this thing. And I'm like, You, you have to become kind of a jerk and be like, sorry, not every idea is good.

[00:26:17] Not everything, you know, the number of people that used to come to me and say, you guys should also do this for veterans or older people returning to the workforce or, and I'm like, yes, yes, yes. Those all sound like great ideas. I can't do them. I have no comparative advantage there. So we're never going to offer that.

[00:26:32] I'm sorry, but then you just feel bad, you know, so anyway, uh, nobody likes to feel bad, but you gotta, you gotta figure out what you're good at. Otherwise, it's all going to be weak, weak offerings.

[00:26:42] **Matt:** No, that's super interesting.

## [00:26:44] The Value of Private Pay Options

[00:26:44] **Matt:** I'll just add to that line, Isaac, that you've opened my world to is, Hey Matt, we should have some private pay options. Because that's the best way to get some immediate response of quality of accountability of, [00:27:00] uh, you know, holding the teachers and curriculum to higher standard when you have things that are just free and don't have that threshold of a, of a buy in, uh, you miss out on a feedback loop that, that sometimes is really valuable.

[00:27:16] **Michael:** it feels weird in education. Right. But I, and I, it feels weird as an individual who like my livelihood is based on selling me. Right. But, uh, I think the clearest signal someone really values you. Is that they're willing to spend money right against it and it's not like, uh, I mean, I was telling this non another nonprofit this, um, about a year ago, I was telling the CEO and I was like, you know, you don't have to be afraid of that.

[00:27:41] Like, that's actually a very clear signal. You're doing something amazing for them. If they weren't willing to do it, you know, do they really have skin in the game that they're going to follow through with the things you're trying to help them through? I have my doubts.

## [00:27:54] The Role of Ratings and Reviews in Education

[00:27:54] **Matt:** Yeah, and this also goes to the ESA things we were talking about the, the lack, [00:28:00] the, the generous description calling it a marketplace, but we are missing out on the ratings and reviews that Amazon has mastered, like almost nobody buys stuff on Amazon without looking at the ratings and reviews. And in the ESA marketplaces, we haven't seen that yet and really think that's a missing piece.

[00:28:22] What, what are your thoughts about that,

[00:28:23] **Michael:** I, I, yeah, I totally agree. I think like I've made the argument to my friend Joe Connor who runs Odyssey, right? That's one of these, um, essentially it's a transaction platform at the moment for, for these essays, but I've made the argument that ultimately I think he's going to become the guidance function because he's going to have to have a way to represent, um, I hate the word quality, but like value, let's say, right.

[00:28:48] And ratings and in, in varied ways, because people are not going to be thinking about what value is in the, in, in a monolithic way. And so in some ways he's going to have to innovate. Beyond what [00:29:00] an Amazon or Yelp, uh, have done, I think to try to give texture to like, you know, what is this helping accomplish?

[00:29:07] And did it, you know, did it do so or not? Um, uh, but, but I totally agree. I think, I think we're going to need more of that. Uh, and, and I, I, I would think it should be a very bottoms up solution again, um, to help reduce friction and increase transaction volume, uh, and, and, and, you know, good matches, right? Um, on these platforms

[00:29:30] **Matt:** No, and that is the challenge because sometimes we'll, we'll get feedback from parents. That say, hey, my child loves Alex math, or my child doesn't love Alex math and parents ask, well, what's the difference like describe your child now? So now it needs context in this ratings and review system of what type of child was using this.

[00:29:53] And then, you know, well, based on that, it was a 4 out of 5 for this type of child, but a 1 out of 5 for this other type [00:30:00] of child, and that's complex. Thanks.

[00:30:02] **Isaac:** You know, it's.

[00:30:03] **Michael:** I mean, you know, my wife used to say she works in the food and hospitality industries industry and She hates Yelp because she was like, well someone reviews the Thai restaurant poorly or well like Do they have my sense of what Thai food is? Do they have my taste buds? Do like, do they have my expect?

[00:30:22] I have no idea. Right. And, um, and I, so it's a very like, you know, classic average ratings, which we know are not super actually helpful. What I think helps with Amazon, right. Is you get the qualitative ones below. As well, but I think there's a, I think there's some room to your point to innovate here and create a more textured way to think about what was I trying to accomplish?

[00:30:48] What's the context around my kid and family situation? And was this a good offering to make progress?

[00:30:53] **Isaac:** This is so funny to be having this conversation in the context of education, because most of my career has been [00:31:00] more or less in the education world. But for the last two and a half years before open ed, I was working in B to B SAS startup world. That's tech tech, you know, software companies selling software to other software companies for the most part.

[00:31:12] And we had a podcast and one of the main thesis that you know, I was kind of working around was this. The Infocalypse. There's too much information out there and trust in sort of typical sales and marketing tactics is breaking down. What does that mean? And we interviewed the guy who founded Trust Radius, which is a software review site.

[00:31:32] And he had some really interesting insights and data. There's other software review sites, G2 and others, that basically do what Amazon does. And we, and we call it 4. 7 star syndrome. Everybody has 4. 7 stars these days because everyone figured out how to game the system. If you have 5, it looks fake. If you have less than 4.

[00:31:47] 7, you don't look very good. So everybody figures out how to get there. So the, the ratings don't mean much. And a trust radius, he said, they do all these additional layers of things. And he said, what's fascinating when we survey all these [00:32:00] buyers, the aggregate score that a tool gets is it's like one, like 50 times less important to them than who the rating comes from.

[00:32:13] So someone who is like them, if you are a CFO and you're trying to buy financial software, you don't want to just hear how the software is rated in aggregate. You want to see what a CFO of a similarly sized company thinks of that software. You want to say someone like me, what do they think? And you know, we, we call it the who economy.

[00:32:33] You're moving from the how economy to the who economy, right? Like, I don't ask, how do I solve this? I ask who like me has solved this already that I can go to for help. And so kind of combining, and that's where like, it's so hard to sell into for any vendor, the homeschool market, because it is the definition of the who economy.

[00:32:51] It is word of mouth networks. They barely have functioning Facebook groups or websites or anything in most of these communities that trust me, I've moved. to five different states and plugged in [00:33:00] as a new homeschooler in every one of them. And it takes a couple years before you discover all the opportunities because it's all just like word of mouth networks.

[00:33:08] So trying to combine the trust that's built there in that one to one who do you know sense and put and scale it onto some kind of digital distribution is I think a really unique challenge that we'll start to see solved.

[00:33:21] **Michael:** Yeah, I totally agree with everything you said. I'm not sure I have much to add, except that I think understanding the situation and the circumstance is so critical and then, you know, combating against that. But I guess that's the last piece of it, which is like. Creating social trust in the interim right in the community, because that's what you just said, right?

[00:33:40] It took you two years so interesting to hear those reflections, because I've said that without the depth of experience you've had, but like, um, two companies trying to sell into the homeschool space. But I think word of mouth and trust is like very deep, right? People can hear, Oh, that's how they thought about it.

[00:33:58] This does or doesn't reflect, you know, [00:34:00] my situation, what I'm trying to accomplish. I will or won't take that recommendation.

[00:34:04] **Isaac:** Can I change gears for the last 10 or so minutes here?

## [00:34:09] The Hidden Curriculum: Equipping Kids with Essential Skills

[00:34:09] **Isaac:** I want to get some advice for parents from you because you are a parent yourself. You have kids. So I know you think about this. You've written some really interesting stuff about. What you call the hidden curriculum, which I think is just so, so cool.

[00:34:22] It's like, what are the things that you are learning maybe without even consciously knowing it, like the environment that you're in, the environment that school puts you in, you learn what's explicitly taught, but you also learn other things, right? Like some of them are not necessarily useful things in the market, like that there's one right answer, or you have to wait until somebody tells you what to do to, you know, innovation, whatever, but you, you met, you mentioned things specifically skills like project management, networking.

[00:34:49] Understanding professional norms. I could go on rants for that for a long time when it comes to hiring young people, um, and some of these other like ways of building social [00:35:00] capital. That aren't ever explicitly taught, but that are probably more important than how well you're, you know, how well you do in algebra.

[00:35:08] Um, this kind of hidden curriculum, how do you recommend parents think about this and help equip their kids? How do you try to equip your own kids with these kinds of social capital, emotional intelligence type of skills?

[00:35:22] **Michael:** Yeah. Uh, I, I love the question and, and the way I think about it is like the, what I call habits of success, right? Um, are things that are intentionally or unintentionally generally unintentionally Passed down and what I would say is like, actually, it turns out a lot of families that have navigated these crazy complex education and career systems themselves often historically.

[00:35:48] I'm going to walk back what I'm saying in a moment, but, um, historically have sort of passed down these things through example. And sort of through, because [00:36:00] like actions speak louder than words, right? Um, so sort of showing how you do it where I think in the last 10, 15 years, we've seen, um, things change is that a lot of families have sort of Out of a fear of their kids ever experiencing failure have sort of, you know, jumped in as the helicopter parent, et cetera, jumped in to make sure the kid doesn't learn the lesson of like, no, executive function skills mean like that there is value to you planning yourself and like executing a plan and then learning from that, right?

[00:36:33] Like, um, and, but it's because it was never explicitly taught to. Anyone really, right? We talk about teamwork all the time. That's a big buzz phrase in education, building teamwork. Like we need to build team skills. We don't actually talk about how you run a meeting in a good place, how you do project management, how you coordinate team members.

[00:36:55] And so we get lots of free rider, you know, people hate projects in schools [00:37:00] because they remember like everyone, you know, the one kid did all the work and the other is like, you know, it's free road off of it. Cause like. We never scaffolded how you do a project with other team members. We never like did that.

[00:37:13] We said, just like, go home and do it. Right. Um, and so I guess the net of it is some families get this because the parents are more explicit about it or model it and don't sort of interrupt that, that those lessons, some of this gets conveyed in very interesting ways. Like you learn, don't cheat, don't, you know, right.

[00:37:33] Like certain things like that in school. And frankly, like a bunch of kids, most kids don't get the lessons at all. And to your point, uh, professional, um, uh, decorum is like a really interesting one, right? How you build a resume, how you show up on time, how you talk to someone, how you shake a hand and look at them in

[00:37:54] **Isaac:** when do you, when do you cc or bcc someone in an email? These are things that can make or break [00:38:00] your early job and, and people have never had a concept of the decorum around

[00:38:05] **Michael:** A thousand percent and we don't talk about it or we're not explicit about it in any meaningful way. And so some people sort of kind of get it, they pick up on it. Most people don't. And we have the challenges. Um, That we do, quite frankly, and I think the argument I would make is like if we could much more explicitly embed this into the visible curriculum, um, and use the academic content really as a conduit to teach these habits, we'd all be much, much better off.

[00:38:40] And look, I believe that there's a role for. content knowledge and like, I think I, you know, like background knowledge is critical to jumping into something. And there's lots of background knowledge I could choose to educate someone on. So I think whatever you do, it has to be very explicit about building, uh, these habits in, in [00:39:00] much more visible ways.

[00:39:01] Cause otherwise, I mean, you know, we all see it like certain kids from certain families in certain school systems don't, don't have a clue. And they, they, they don't, Oh, you're expected to be on time. And on time means like ready to work. Not like straggling in at the minute really had no, Oh, you can get fired.

[00:39:19] If you're five minutes late and customers are out the door, really? Like they're surprised by it, but like no one ever told them,

[00:39:27] **Isaac:** You know, Matt, I wonder if you have had this experience with your kids or even just some of the open ended families over the years. But, um, my oldest son loves writing. He's a great writer. And so like, that's one of his strongest skills when he started getting jobs and his teens and stuff, it turns out that being a good writer is a totally different skill from knowing how to text your boss.

[00:39:51] **Michael:** huh?

[00:39:52] **Isaac:** And so things like asking, saying you're going to be on vacation or, You know saying is it okay if I come in late or [00:40:00] i'm quitting a job? How do you quit or when you're in the application process and they ask you something knowing how to respond and he would come to me Fortunately, he would show me he'd be like i'm about to send this text and sometimes i'm like whoa This is totally tone deaf and he didn't get it I'm, like if I were a boss, I would be offended by this and he's like why?

[00:40:17] And I and it was hard for me to even explain why because it's so intuitive. I'm like, well Try saying it this way. So over the years he's done this and now he's so good at it. He's like, I feel like I can get a job anywhere and I can like, get away with anything with my boss. Cause I just know how to text a boss.

[00:40:33] And that is so, such a weird thing you wouldn't think of, but just like the difference between the skill of writing or even speaking and the context of sending a text message to your boss.

[00:40:46] **Michael:** I realized I didn't answer the second half of your question as you were going through that, because you explicitly taught your son, right? That those skills, um, part of the way we're dealing with our kids is we outsourced it to the Montessori school. Cause I think that Montessori is [00:41:00] actually very good at doing several of these things, not the texting your boss one, but like a lot of these other ones, Montessori is very good at doing.

[00:41:07] And so we outsourced, I would argue some of that. Um, and then some of it, frankly, is like, you know, us trying to be more explicit about like, hey, we did this then. Um, the, the reason I thought about the second half of your question when you were telling the story was, A different thing, which is, uh, so I have twins and one of them was like, um, they were both upset at their, at my wife, uh, for something.

[00:41:31] And, um, uh, one of them said the more tactful one said, um, Oh, when I give mommy feedback, this is how I go about it. And she had this huge elaborate, like I butter her up in this way and blah, blah, blah. And then I cuddle in and then I, and then I saved my point. I was like, wow, that's brilliant. The other one was like, Oh yeah, I do the same thing and made up a story.

[00:41:53] And I was like, well, I think you just learned what you should be doing.

[00:41:57] **Isaac:** Matt, you were going to jump in on [00:42:00] this.

[00:42:00] **Matt:** No, just, uh, yeah. Five children, they've all grown up into different, you know, paths of their own. And yeah, we've had those conversations so many times about job interactions and applications and resumes. And, uh, it's just super valuable to have, to, to see children as they get older.

[00:42:18] Applying some of those principles. So no, I absolutely love chatting about that.

[00:42:23] **Isaac:** Well, see, seeing my, my oldest son, who, by the way, the only reason he started asking me about it was because he almost got fired a couple of times and he didn't understand why. Um, but it makes me with my younger kids think maybe there are ways to make some of this invisible curriculum stuff more visible and say, instead of like, Hey, read a book and read a chapter of a book and write a page about it.

[00:42:42] Like, Hey, imagine that you work at a bakery and you just burned something and sold it to a customer anyway. How are you going to tell your boss? Write them, write them an email, right? Like even stuff like that, I think could be potentially, I don't know. I'll

[00:42:55] **Michael:** Well, but you make it right. But right. But you just, you just like, [00:43:00] so I, you know, one of the things is right. Um, persuasive essay, right? You got to persuade your boss that, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You've just made it more relevant. You made the skill much more, uh, uh, you know, less opaque, right?

[00:43:14] Like it's clear what we're actually trying to convey here and why we're trying to convey it. Okay, you did it there. Now let's do it on a, you know, some other, some other, you know, domain, right? Let, let, let, let's transfer because we want you to build the skills so you can take it to different places.

[00:43:32] That's valuable. Ideally, you're doing that, you know, starting with some real world projects and you're then moving into like a argument about the, you know, political landscape and then something about history. Like you can move around. You're Galileo trying to convince people why they shouldn't burn you at the stake, right?

[00:43:48] Like, I, I don't care, but you're trying to build this skill set and we're trying to make it clearer about, Hey, that's not gonna land well, put yourself in the other person's position, why is it, why, why did this argument fall [00:44:00] flat? Well, when you lead off with, listen to me, or whatever else, Turns out that doesn't work.

## [00:44:05] The Benefits of Youth Entrepreneurship

[00:44:05] **Matt:** Well, that's where I just need to give a plug for my passion around young entrepreneurship. I really think that having children dabble and experience with starting businesses at a very young age, even if it's. Our children went around and sold pumpkins out of a wagon that we had from our garden. Those skills just starting to think like an entrepreneur have always been the bedrock of, of MiTek high.

[00:44:31] And now open ed is youth who apply entrepreneurship principles will learn so many other skills that they don't, that of those hidden curriculum, uh, because entrepreneurship just draws those out naturally. And you realize what you don't know. You now need someone to write a marketing flyer for you, or you need someone to code your backend, or you need someone to go manage your finances.

[00:44:57] It creates this, uh, [00:45:00] interdisciplinary group that is natural versus forced. So that's why I really love geeking out on entrepreneurship for kids.

## [00:45:07] Conclusion and Final Thoughts

[00:45:07] **Isaac:** what a, what a mic drop moment to, uh, to end on this. This is so much fun. Michael, uh, so glad you were able to come on and join us.

[00:45:16] **Michael:** Yeah, I know, a total blast. Love what you guys keep doing for kids and schools, uh, and, and frankly, learning ecosystems around, uh, and at all levels. Cause like that, you know, when Matt came to me, it was like, we're reinventing college. And, you know, I was like, whoa, this is cool. Um, and so I, I, I love what y'all are about, what you're doing and where it's going to go.

[00:45:39] **Isaac:** Keep up the good work. We'll see everybody next time on the open ed podcast.

[00:45:43]
