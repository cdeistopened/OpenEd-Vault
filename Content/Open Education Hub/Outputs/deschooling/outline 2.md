# Deschooling & Unschooling (OpenEd Pathway Outline)

## Positioning Statement
- Transitional pathway that reclaims curiosity before layering structure.
- Ideal for families shifting from traditional settings who need decompression and learner-led exploration.

## Learner & Family Fit
- Signals it works: child burnt out/frustrated, family open to experimentation, emphasis on intrinsic motivation.
- Watch-outs: anxiety over “doing enough,” external pressure from skeptics, funding compliance.

## Core Principles to Highlight
1. Deliberate pause to detox from bell schedules and grades.
2. Observation cycles to surface child interests and natural rhythms.
3. Project- and experience-based learning sprints.
4. Reflection rituals for parents and learners to document growth.
