# What Is Open Education?

Open education starts with a simple observation: no two children learn in exactly the same way, at the same pace, or for the same reasons. Every learner brings a unique blend of strengths, sensitivities, curiosities, and constraints. For generations, families were asked to pick a single predefined model—public school, private school, homeschool—and conform to whatever that box demanded. Today, those walls are dissolving. Parents can combine a classical literature circle with a Montessori-inspired maker space, enroll in a microschool three days a week, outsource math to an AI tutor, and spend Fridays volunteering at a nature preserve. The landscape is no longer binary; it is wide open.

Open education is not a rejection of any one approach. It is a mindset that invites families to open every door, remix the tools that fit, and design education around the child rather than forcing the child to fit the system. Matt Bowman and Isaac Morehouse describe it as “a proven method to give you and your child the power to direct, adjust, and navigate learning in a way that works best for them.” That power is practical. It acknowledges the 2,390 hours each year that children spend outside the traditional classroom and asks families to bring intention, curiosity, and community into those hours. It’s less about abandoning schools and more about orchestrating learning everywhere.

Why now? Technology has already personalized every other corner of life. We can work remotely, curate entertainment on demand, and build businesses from a laptop. Yet school often remains an industrial holdover—bell schedules, age-based batches, standardized tests that measure family income more than actual learning. Parent satisfaction with traditional schooling has hit a 25-year low, while homeschooling, microschools, and hybrid options have surged. During the pandemic, millions of parents sampled alternative arrangements and discovered they could be the architects of their children’s education. The old one-size-fits-all promise cracked. Open education answers with an empowering alternative: don’t choose between “all in” and “all out.” Mix, match, and iterate.

<We don't want to reference our hypothetical one true fan.But we can keep an example of a hypothetical parent here.>
Still, openness can feel overwhelming. Families worry about making the wrong choice, isolating their children, or being judged by relatives clinging to conventional paths. Our “One True Fan,” Sarah—the archetype of an overwhelmed but determined parent—longs for educational freedom but wants reassurance that she isn’t jeopardizing her child’s future. She needs more than inspirational quotes; she needs a blueprint. Open education meets her where she is: empathizing with the weight of tradition, acknowledging the fear of failure, and offering practical guidance to design a path that aligns with her values, budget, and time.

The unifying principles of open education give that guidance structure:

1. **Parents know their children best.** Systems treat families as spectators; open education puts them back in the designer’s seat. Your intuition about what sparks your child’s curiosity or crushes it is valid data.
2. **Education should adapt to the child, not the other way around.** Instead of demanding mastery on a rigid timeline, open pathways honor different developmental rhythms. Competency replaces seat time as the measure of progress.
3. **Learning is natural and joyful.** Children are born curious. Open environments protect that spark with play, exploration, and real-world projects rather than endless worksheets.
4. **Preparedness is about life, not tests.** Employers prize creativity, collaboration, and problem-solving far more than standardized scores. Open education prioritizes those human skills.
5. **Freedom requires confidence and community.** Families need mentors, cohorts, and funding support to sustain their choices. Open education doesn’t leave them to DIY everything alone; it builds networks that share wisdom, resources, and courage.

<I feel like we do need some kind of a plug in here for the book itself. We should link to it: OpenEd.co/book.Mention the five building blocks, or I don't know if that could maybe somehow I really like these principles that you gave.>

These principles reveal why open education is compatible with so many approaches. A classical learning circle, a Charlotte Mason nature walk, a Montessori work cycle, and an AI-powered math coach can coexist because they share a learner-centered ethos. Open education is the umbrella that validates all of them—so long as they serve the child in this season. If a method stops working, you pivot. If your teenager thrives in a microschool but wants to dual-enroll in community college, you make that possible. If one sibling needs structured phonics while another learns best through storytelling, you customize accordingly. Flexibility is not compromise; it’s the strategy.

OpenEd exists to make that flexibility accessible to every family, regardless of background or finances. We’ve helped thousands of parents map their learning landscape, secure funding, connect with supportive communities, and build confidence along the way. Our promise is simple: you don’t have to pick one brand of education and hope it fits forever. You can design a vibrant, evolving plan that celebrates your child’s uniqueness and prepares them to thrive in a rapidly changing world. <Feels like maybe we're starting to get a little bit redundant over here.>

Consider how the movement is already reshaping education. Microschools and learning pods create small, relationship-rich cohorts that blend in-person mentorship with digital tools. Homeschool cooperatives orchestrate shared science labs, debate clubs, and theater productions. Hybrid academies let students attend campus twice a week and learn at home the rest. Digital platforms provide access to world-class instructors in everything from calculus to creative writing. Apprenticeships give teens hands-on experience building software, launching businesses, or restoring ecosystems. Each option adds a tile to the mosaic.

Yet, openness is not haphazard. The most resilient families use a simple rhythm—Discover, Design, Fund, Connect, Thrive. They discover their child’s strengths and struggles. They design a custom mix of experiences. They fund that mix creatively, tapping into public programs, savings, or partnerships. They connect with other families and mentors for accountability. They help their children thrive by adjusting the plan as interests evolve. OpenEd provides the scaffolding for each step so Sarah and parents like her don’t have to guess what comes next.

Ultimately, open education is an invitation to reclaim ownership of learning. It asks parents to trust their observation of their child, to honor the individuality in front of them, and to curate an environment where curiosity becomes capability. It reminds us that education is not something done to a child but something built with them. When families adopt this mindset, the labels—public, private, homeschool, microschool—matter less than the lived experience of discovery, mastery, and purpose.

The remainder of this hub is built for that journey. Think of the sections below as templates rather than prescriptions. Each pathway link opens to deeper resources, sample schedules, and stories from families already walking that road. Start with what resonates today, layer in subject-specific supports, and keep iterating. We’ll continue expanding the gallery of options so you always have fresh ideas to explore.
