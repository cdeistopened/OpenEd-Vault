# Classical Education (OpenEd Pathway Outline)

## Positioning Statement
- Time-tested liberal arts framework (Trivium/Quadrivium) reinterpreted through an open education lens.
- Ideal for families seeking intellectual rigor, virtue formation, and Socratic dialogue while maintaining flexibility.

## Learner & Family Fit
- Signals it works: love of reading, interest in history/philosophy, value placed on articulate communication.
- Watch-outs: risk of rigidity, potential overwhelm with heavy reading load, balancing STEM/maker needs.

## Core Principles to Highlight
1. Trivium stages aligned with developmental phases (Grammar, Logic, Rhetoric).
2. Great Books and primary sources as conversation anchors.
3. Habit formation plus moral imagination (stories, biographies, virtues).
4. Integration with modern tools—debate clubs, writing workshops, project-based supplements.
