# Learning Pods (OpenEd Pathway Outline)

## Positioning Statement
- Flexible, small-group collaborations that share teaching duties, costs, and community.
- Ideal for families wanting social learning without committing to a full microschool infrastructure.

## Learner & Family Fit
- Signals it works: group of families with aligned values/schedules, desire for co-planned experiences, need for childcare coverage.
- Watch-outs: coordination fatigue, equity of workload, legal considerations for paid facilitators.

## Core Principles to Highlight
1. Shared vision and norms—co-created agreements keep pods healthy.
2. Modular scheduling—half-day academics, rotating enrichment, field study days.
3. Expertise pooling—parents, tutors, community mentors, virtual instructors.
4. Continuous iteration—regular retros to adjust curriculum and logistics.
