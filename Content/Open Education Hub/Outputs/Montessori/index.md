# Montessori Education with OpenEd


In 1907, Dr. Maria Montessori walked into a Roman tenement filled with children everyone else had written off. The authorities called them "unteachable." Their parents, working long factory hours, had nowhere else to leave them. Within months, these same children were teaching themselves to read, solving complex math problems, and—most shocking to observers—choosing to work rather than play.

What Montessori discovered in that first _Casa dei Bambini_ wasn't a teaching method. It was a truth about human nature: children are born scientists, desperate to understand their world. Give them real tools instead of toys, respect instead of condescension, and freedom within carefully prepared limits, and they'll exceed every expectation you never knew you had.

"The greatest sign of success for a teacher," she wrote, "is to be able to say, _the children are now working as if I did not exist._"

More than a century later, Montessori has exploded in popularity – spawning whole franchises of schools, co-ops, curricula, and even whole product lines of toys, manipulatives, etc.

This trend is likely to continue, {Insert Ben man content up here and speak to sort of the anxiety about the ever increasing pressures to get into a top school, ace the SAT, but parents are questioning whether this is really going to be the most important thing in a world of artificial super into artificial intelligence.Maybe it's the things like:

- Curiosity
- Competence
- Respect for others' dignity

that will characterize success 20 and 30 years from now.}

because it preserves curiosity, builds competence, and honors each child’s dignity.

Open education extends this invitation. Whether you’re guiding a homeschool, participating in a hybrid microschool, or coordinating a neighborhood co-op, OpenEd partners with public schools to help you source materials, fund secular resources, and connect with trained guides—so your Montessori environment can thrive anywhere. Many of the tools we share below are already available to OpenEd families at no cost through approved reimbursements.
## Defining the Montessori Education Method

Forget what you think you know about Montessori. It's not wooden toys on Instagram-perfect shelves. It's not silent children doing worksheets. It's a complete reimagining of childhood itself.

The method rests on observations so radical they got Montessori nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize three times:

**The child is the teacher.** Adults observe, prepare the environment, then get out of the way. Your three-year-old knows exactly what skill she needs to develop next—she just needs access to the right materials at the right moment.

**Everything is connected.** Pouring water teaches mathematical precision. Washing dishes builds concentration for reading. Caring for plants develops the patience for long division. Montessori called this "indirect preparation"—every activity secretly prepares the child for something greater.

**Mistakes are the curriculum.** The materials themselves show children their errors—a puzzle piece that won't fit, water that spills, a sum that doesn't balance. No red pen needed. No shame attached. Just information: try again differently.

**The environment is the third teacher.** After the child and the guide comes the room itself—every object chosen for beauty, purpose, and accessibility. Low shelves instead of toy boxes. Real glass instead of plastic. Child-sized everything, so they never have to ask for help with what they can do themselves.

**Mixed ages create magic.** Six-year-olds teaching three-year-olds to tie shoes. Nine-year-olds helping six-year-olds with reading. The older children solidify their knowledge by teaching; the younger ones see their future selves. Everyone learns patience, leadership, and humanity.

OpenEd families aren't trying to replicate a classroom at home. They're taking these principles and weaving them into daily life—turning kitchens into science labs, backyards into biology field stations, and communities into extended classrooms.

In 1907, Dr. Maria Montessori opened the first *Casa dei Bambini* in a Roman tenement, determined to prove that children labeled “unteachable” could flourish when given freedom, purposeful work, and respect. Her scientific observations shaped her unique approach to education: instead of desks in rows and teachers delivering lectures, she designed materials that invited self-correction, arranged classrooms to the child’s scale, and insisted that adults become calm observers. 

“The greatest sign of success for a teacher,” she wrote, “is to be able to say, *the children are now working as if I did not exist.*” 






## Defining the Montessori Education Method

Montessori rests on a handful of interlocking principles that form a complete system:

- **Respect for the child** – Children are innately driven to learn. Adults observe first, intervene sparingly, and trust the learner’s rhythm.
- **Prepared environment** – Shelves, materials, and routines are curated to invite independence, order, and beauty. Everything has a purpose and a place.
- **Hands-on materials with control of error** – Sequenced works (from Pink Tower to Golden Beads) allow children to grasp concepts concretely and recognize mistakes without adult correction.
- **Long, uninterrupted work cycles** – Two- to three-hour blocks cultivate deep concentration and intrinsic motivation.
- **Mixed-age communities** – Older students mentor younger peers, reinforcing mastery and social responsibility.

The approach scales beyond preschool. Elementary learners follow the “great lessons” of cosmic education, adolescents run micro-economies, and high schoolers design capstone projects that connect them to the wider world. Parents can become guides by studying Montessori’s writings, practicing observation, and collaborating with other families. As Dr. Montessori reminded adults, “Within the child lies the fate of the future.”

## Benefits of Montessori

Modern research—and many parents’ lived experience—underscores what Dr. Montessori observed:

- Public Montessori programs show higher gains in academic achievement and social understanding compared to traditional schools, particularly for historically underserved students ([Lillard et al., *Psychological Science*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797617694381)).
- Montessori’s emphasis on self-directed work builds executive function and self-regulation, protective factors linked to long-term health and economic stability ([American Academy of Pediatrics](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/142/3/e20182058/38649/The-Power-of-Play-A-Pediatric-Role-in-Enhancing)).
- Allowing for adventurous, managed-risk play reduces childhood anxiety and increases resilience ([Dodd & Lester, *Frontiers in Psychology*](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.731058/full)).
- Alumni often report extraordinary creativity, collaboration, and problem-solving—the skill set today’s employers prize over rote knowledge ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-montessori-method-is-in-demand-11644954220)).

Even leaders of cutting-edge technology companies recognize the value. Anthropic co-founder Ben Mann recently explained why his daughter attends a Montessori school: “If this were 10–20 years ago, I’d be lining her up for top-tier schools and extracurriculars. But now I don’t think any of it’s going to matter. Learning facts is going to fade into the background. What matters is that she’s happy, thoughtful, curious, and kind.” Montessori families are ahead of the curve.

## Montessori with OpenEd

OpenEd’s mission is to help families design personalized, mix-and-match education in partnership with public schools. For Montessori households, that translates into:

- **Funding & Materials** – Streamlined reimbursements for secular Montessori resources, shelves, and guide training. Many preferred vendors are pre-approved, minimizing out-of-pocket costs.
- **Coaching & Community** – Parent study cohorts, office hours with trained guides, and introductions to local Montessori pods or hybrid programs.<if you already attent a co-op or hybrid microschool, you can continue... {note open ed does not actively facilitate this}>
- **Compliance Support** – Templates for observation journals, portfolios, and spending logs keep you audit-ready. We’ll flag items that require personal funding (e.g., faith-based lessons) while supporting your holistic plan. {not quite right}
- **Flexible Formats** – Combine home-based work cycles with microschool days, outdoor co-ops, or apprenticeships. Logistics specialists help you protect core Montessori elements while honoring family schedules.

Families are free to layer spiritual practices or cultural traditions into their routine; simply use personal funds for those purchases and submit secular items through OpenEd.

## Montessori Education for Elementary School

Ages 6–12 enter the era of “cosmic education,” where big stories ignite imagination.

- **Great Lessons** launch each year, weaving together geography, history, and science. Follow with research projects, experiments, timelines, and “going out” excursions planned by the children.
- **Mixed-age studios** (6–9 and 9–12) develop leadership and empathy. Encourage older students to mentor younger ones on new materials.
- **Abundant reading**—living books, biographies, primary sources—feeds literacy and cultural awareness. Library cards and digital platforms like [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby) help keep shelves fresh.
- **Math extensions** such as bead chains, checkerboards, and racks-and-tubes transition learners toward abstraction. Supplement with strategy games, budgeting projects, or entrepreneurial ventures.

Helpful supports:

- [Waseca Biomes](https://www.wasecabiomes.com/) geography cards align beautifully with cosmic themes.
- [Trillium Montessori’s Great Lesson Albums](https://trilliummontessori.org/montessori-great-lessons/) offer scripts and follow-up ideas.
- OpenEd field trip grants offset transportation and admission for student-led outings.

## Montessori Education for Middle School

Dr. Montessori called the adolescent environment *Erdkinder*—earth children learning through purposeful work.

- **Micro-economies**: Launch student-run enterprises (gardens, cafes, maker markets) to teach finance, marketing, and collaboration.
- **Apprenticeships**: Weekly mentorship with artisans, nonprofits, or tech firms channels adolescent energy into real contribution. OpenEd coordinators help secure placements and manage paperwork.
- **Socratic seminars**: Literature circles, philosophy dialogues, and current events discussions refine rhetoric and ethics.
- **Outdoor challenges**: Backpacking trips, conservation projects, or design-build challenges offer healthy risk and responsibility.

- [North Star Montessori Adolescent Program](https://www.northstarmontessori.ca/programs/adolescent/) shares model practices.
- OpenEd’s apprenticeship team aligns experiences with state requirements for credit.

## Montessori Education for High School

High schoolers continue the Erdkinder journey with greater independence:

- Blend seminar-based academics with dual enrollment, online mastery courses, or competency-based microschools.
- Support entrepreneurial ventures, internships, and service-learning capstones that solve real community challenges.
- Encourage travel, cultural exchanges, or global service expeditions to widen perspective.
- Use mastery-based transcripts and digital portfolios to translate achievements for colleges or employers.

OpenEd assists by arranging credit-bearing apprenticeships, offering ACT/SAT preparation (when desired), and connecting teens with alumni mentors who have navigated alternative pathways—gap years, startups, trades, and more.
