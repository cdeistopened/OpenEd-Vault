# The Charlotte Mason Method

"Everybody needs to read Plutarch."

[Meg Thomas](https://coachmegthomas. com), a homeschool coach and mother of seven, attended a Charlotte Mason workshop where the instructor insisted on this.

So she tried. She scheduled the lessons, and she pushed through.

"I hated it," Meg admits. "[My kids] hated it. And they don't even remember it... because I didn't really value those things."

This is the trap. Many parents search "Charlotte Mason curriculum," find elaborate book lists and morning time schedules, and assume that following these prescriptions is the only correct way to "do" Charlotte Mason. Everybody needs to read Plutarch. Everybody needs morning time. Everybody needs to follow this exact schedule.

But Charlotte Mason never created a curriculum. She developed a *method*.

The irony is that Plutarch himself is famous for writing that "the mind is not a vessel to be filled but a fire to be kindled." Yet many Charlotte Mason guides treat his work as exactly that - another box to check, another vessel to fill.

Charlotte Mason herself put it differently: "The most valuable knowledge children can receive is self-knowledge, gained through careful observation of their own mental processes." Not content absorption. Not curriculum completion. Self-knowledge through observation.

The book lists and rigid requirements represent just one interpretation - and probably not the version Miss Mason would recommend if she were alive today. Her core principles share more in common with open education than with any packaged curriculum: the world is the best classroom, you don't need to get everything from one place, and children learn best when they're genuinely engaged with real ideas.

One principle unites both philosophies: teach the child, not the grade level. As Simply Charlotte Mason puts it: "It's very common for a child to be ready for, say, third-grade math skills while at the same time be working on second-grade or even first-grade reading skills. That's fine!" Grade levels persist not because they're good for kids but because they're [efficient for institutions](/blog/beyond-mere-choice). Miss Mason understood this over a century ago - kids don't develop like cogs on an assembly line.

You can be inspired by Charlotte Mason without going whole hog. Take the short lessons but skip the nature journals. Use living books but add Singapore Math. Follow her philosophy without following someone else's book list. There's no "everybody needs to" - just principles you can adapt to fit your family.

## The Charlotte Mason Method

Charlotte Mason was a 19th-century British educator who founded a teacher training college and wrote a six-volume series on education. Her writing can feel intimidating - Victorian prose, references to governesses and nurseries. To some, it reads like it was designed for wealthy families with household staff.

But it wasn't. Modern interpreters like Leah Boden, author of "Modern Miss Mason," have worked to make these ideas accessible to today's families. And as Simply Charlotte Mason demonstrates in their guide "[Charlotte Mason Without Breaking the Bank](https://simplycharlottemason. com/blog/charlotte-mason-without-breaking-the-bank/)," a rich education doesn't require a large budget - library books, smart sharing, and free online resources can take you far.

Don't be fooled by the picture-perfect images on Instagram. As one OpenEd mom shares in our podcast on [homeschooling year-round](/blog/how-to-homeschool-year-round-without-burnout), the reality of Charlotte Mason families often looks messier than the aesthetic suggests - and that's okay.

The core principles are simpler than the packaging suggests:

**Children are born persons.** They aren't beakers to fill or problems to manage. They are whole people, worthy of respect, capable of engaging with real ideas from the start.

**Education is the science of relations.** Learning happens when children form connections - to ideas, nature, art, history, literature. The goal is helping children relate to the world, not stuffing facts into heads.

**Living books over "twaddle."** Charlotte Mason had a word for watered-down, dumbed-down content that talks down to children: twaddle. Textbooks that oversimplify. Abridged versions that strip the life out of literature. Bright colors and cartoon characters substituting for substance.

The antidote is what she called "living books" - real literature written by someone passionate about their subject, not a committee producing content for grade-level benchmarks. As education researcher Kerry McDonald observes, "Some families follow Charlotte Mason's literature-rich philosophy; others embrace Wild + Free's focus on nature and wonder." The Wild + Free podcast captures this blend - what some call a "Charlotte Mason-meets-unschooling vibe" for families who value muddy boots, story-rich days, and the wonder of childhood.

**Short lessons.** Fifteen to twenty minutes for young children. Focus intensely, then move on. This keeps attention sharp and prevents the grinding fatigue of hour-long blocks.

Homeschool expert Pam Barnhill developed what she calls [the 10-Minute Rule](/blog/the-10-minute-rule): set a timer for 10 minutes of intense focus on a subject and stop immediately when it goes off. No dragging it out. No "just finish this page." The timer is the boss. This approach matches what we know about attention spans - and it builds the habit of focused work rather than distracted endurance.

OpenEd VP of Learning [Andrea Fife](/blog/episode-005-she-almost-gave-up-on-education) recommends keeping "lessons to 20-30 minute blocks with movement breaks" - especially for learners who struggle with sustained attention. Matt Bowman, founder of OpenEd, suggests something similar: "20 minutes of focused math, 20 minutes of reading, 20 minutes of writing" - with an hour of free exploration between blocks. You need an "exhausted body" through play before a mind is ready to focus.

**Narration.** Instead of worksheets and tests, children retell what they learned. You can't narrate what you didn't absorb. This forces genuine understanding.

One practical framework is [the QUEN Method](/blog/the-3-r-s-are-all-you-need): Question (the big question you're exploring), Evidence (key names and dates), and Narration (summarizing in 4-6 sentences in your own words). This moves information from short-term to long-term memory - active recall before anyone called it that.

**A wide and generous curriculum.** There's no hierarchy of "core" versus "extracurriculars." Art, music, poetry, handicrafts, and nature study matter as much as reading and math. Charlotte Mason called this spreading a "feast" - expose children to many things and see what they reach for.

If this sounds like something you're already doing - or an approach you're drawn to - read on.

## Charlotte Mason by Subject

Here's how those principles play out in practice.

### Reading and Literature

Living books are the foundation. Instead of a textbook about colonial America, you might read *Johnny Tremain* - a Newbery Medal novel about a silversmith's apprentice caught up in the Revolution. Instead of a sanitized biography, you might read actual letters and journals. The difference is palpable: a child who groans at a textbook will beg for one more chapter of a living book.

Curriculum advisor Makenna Hague recommends BookShark as a "literature-based option that keeps learning engaging through stories rather than textbooks." The key is narrative - stories stick where facts slide off.

Sonya Shafer of Simply Charlotte Mason recommends what she calls the "[cliffhanger technique](/blog/the-cliffhanger-technique-for-read-alouds)" for family read-alouds: stop at the good parts, not at chapter ends. This builds anticipation. Imaginations run wild between sessions. Children actually want to come back.

For phonics and early reading, OpenEd mentor teachers often recommend Logic of English. "It teaches spelling rules and phonics together," explains Hayley Black. "There are a lot of components, so read through and choose what works for your family." [Rachael Davie](/blog/are-we-teaching-stem-backwards), OpenEd's curriculum lead, calls All About Reading a "fabulous phonics curriculum" that uses a "multi-sensory, mastery-based approach" - it follows Orton-Gillingham principles without the hefty price tag of formal programs.

### Writing and Composition

Charlotte Mason believed writing should emerge naturally from narration. "Composition should not be taught," she wrote. "It should be the outcome of [spontaneous interest](/blog/breaking-writing-rules-with-purpose-127)."

Daily narration - retelling what you've read or learned - builds toward essay writing without formal instruction. By the time a child needs to write, they've been composing orally for years. Copywork and dictation reinforce spelling and grammar through exposure to good writing rather than drilling rules.

For high schoolers, Brandy Vencel's "Simple Plan for Teaching High School Essay Writing" blends daily narration with creative prompts and real accountability - essay writing that doesn't feel like punishment.

OpenEd mentor teachers have seen what works. "For writing, the Jane Schaffer Method is game changing for essay writing," says Keeley Garban. "It literally has a formula for body paragraphs, teaches transitions, and shows kids how to elaborate. So good for reluctant writers."

Erica Michaelis recommends IEW's Fix-it Grammar for a gentle approach: "Each day you fix up a sentence or two. The student reads the lesson, then fixes the sentences while learning about grammar topics. Easy peasy for parents. It takes 10-15 min and introduces grammar concepts through the editing process."

### Math

The [Simply Charlotte Mason podcast](https://simplycharlottemason. com/blog/the-beauty-of-math/) offers a liberating perspective: "Anytime you're taking something that's chaotic and you're bringing order to it, that's math."

You find math in bird calls, photography composition, organizing a messy shelf. "We don't have to consider ourselves mathematicians to enjoy math."

That said, if your child struggles with math, you don't have to stay pure. Tools like Singapore Math or Right Start work well alongside Charlotte Mason methods. OpenEd mentor teacher Hayley Black recommends Math with Confidence for younger learners: "It's not overwhelming, teaches multiple strategies, and includes games as part of lessons. Lessons are short and keep kids engaged." The philosophy doesn't require one-size-fits-all.

### Handwriting

Charlotte Mason's approach to handwriting mirrors her philosophy everywhere else: slow, methodical, habitual. She recommended starting with simple strokes before even teaching letter formation. Short lessons - five to ten minutes - with the expectation of careful work for that brief time.

Many Charlotte Mason families use italic handwriting programs like Penny Gardner's "Italics: Beautiful Handwriting for Children," which naturally progresses into cursive. But if handwriting becomes a battle, programs like Handwriting Without Tears work fine alongside this approach.

### Nature Study

A nature journal, a patch of woods or a city park, and the habit of paying attention. Miss Mason didn't treat nature as a subject to study but as a teacher. Children observe. They sketch what they see. They record the date, the weather, what caught their eye.

Over time, this builds something no curriculum can manufacture: the habit of noticing. A child who has spent years watching seasons change and birds migrate sees the world differently than one who hasn't.

### Art and Music Appreciation

Picture study: show a child a great painting for five to ten minutes. Let them look without commentary. Then ask: what did you notice?

This builds what Charlotte Mason called "visual vocabulary." The child looks at a painting for several minutes, then describes it from memory. This trains observation skills that transfer to science, writing, and every other subject.

Jen Johnson, OpenEd's Curriculum Team Lead, recommends The Great Artist Program because it offers "short lessons (30-45 minutes) combining an artist biography with a hands-on project." Resources like [A Humble Place](https://ahumbleplace. com/product/bierstadt-picture-study/) provide the paintings and stories behind them. But a library book of art prints works too.

Composer study follows the same pattern. Listen. Notice. Discuss.

### Habit Training

Meg Thomas, the homeschool coach who tried and failed to love Plutarch, discovered something the book lists obscure: habits come before curriculum.

She taught her children household habits first - doing laundry together as a "full family event," making beds, cleaning up after meals. "I didn't realize that these skills I was teaching them was going to help me to make homeschool feasible long-term," Meg says. "I basically am working myself out of a job."

Her framework: [Heart (connection), Habits, then Home (culture)](/blog/meg-thomass-3-part-framework-for-calm-homeschooling). When the home runs smoothly, learning flows. This is pure Charlotte Mason - habits before academics.

## The Charlotte Mason Curriculum Landscape

You might find a curriculum that fits, or you might realize you don't need one at all.

### Free and Low-Cost Options

**Ambleside Online** is free, rigorous, and community-developed. It's the closest thing to a purist Charlotte Mason curriculum - comprehensive book lists, detailed schedules, active forums. Christian worldview throughout. If you want the full experience without spending money, start here.

**Charlotte Mason's original volumes** are public domain and available free online. Victorian prose, but the source material for everything else.

**Your library card** covers most living books. A nature journal and some colored pencils handle nature study. The philosophy is the curriculum.

**Simply Charlotte Mason's blog and podcast** offer practical guidance for free, even if you never buy their materials. Their "Without Breaking the Bank" [resource](https://simplycharlottemason. com/blog/charlotte-mason-without-breaking-the-bank/) demonstrates how to do this affordably.

### Christian and Religious Curricula

Most established Charlotte Mason curricula come from a Christian perspective.

**Simply Charlotte Mason** is the most accessible entry point. Sonya Shafer has built a gentle, supportive community around the method. Christian but not heavily doctrinal.

**The Alveary** is the most academically demanding option. Heavy on original sources and languages. For families who want rigor and challenge.

### Secular and Flexible Options

**Blossom & Root** is nature-focused and literature-based with beautiful design. Secular, though some families note occasional "nature spirituality" language. OpenEd mentor Juliann Akers uses it extensively: "I LOVE Blossom and Root. We have used it for History, Science, and Nature Study. Everything is built in with beautiful living book lists. They have a new poetry tea time curriculum that is a gem. I recommend starting with their Early Years bundle - it covers Science and Nature Study and is gentle and laid back." She notes one caveat: "Just know that you'll have to buy the books separately, which can get pricey. Libraries help a lot."

**Wildwood Curriculum** takes a living books approach with strong emphasis on diverse perspectives and flexible structure.

**Build Your Library** is secular and literature-heavy, more eclectic than a pure Charlotte Mason approach. Good for families who want curated book lists without philosophy lectures.

OpenEd mentor Leanne Smith recommends several curricula depending on family needs: "Blossom and Root is secular and uses living books. Gather Round is Christian and uses living books and short lessons. Torchlight is secular and literature-based." Each takes a different approach to the core principles while maintaining flexibility.

## Charlotte Mason Through OpenEd

OpenEd's flexibility matches Charlotte Mason's flexibility. We fund the approach, not just products.

What OpenEd can support:

- **Living books** - secular titles that bring subjects alive
- **Nature study supplies** - field guides, nature journals, quality art supplies for outdoor sketching
- **Art and music appreciation** - museum memberships, concert tickets, art books, composer study resources
- **Tutoring** - for subjects where you want outside expertise

**Important note:** OpenEd cannot reimburse religious curricula. Simply Charlotte Mason, Ambleside Online, and The Alveary are Christian-based and not covered.

But these principles work with any content. You don't need a labeled curriculum product. Library books, secular living books, nature in your backyard - these are what the method actually requires.

## FAQ

**Is Charlotte Mason only for Christians?**

The original writings are Christian. The principles are universal. Secular families adapt freely, and curricula like Blossom & Root apply these methods without religious content.

**Do I need to buy a curriculum?**

No. Charlotte Mason is a philosophy. Library books, free Ambleside booklists, nature journals, and public domain resources can take you far.

**How is Charlotte Mason different from Classical education?**

Both value great books and liberal arts. But [Classical education](/open-education/classical-education) follows the Trivium - grammar, logic, and rhetoric stages corresponding roughly to elementary, middle, and high school. Charlotte Mason rejected stage-based thinking. She believed children of any age can engage with sophisticated ideas.

Classical can be drill-heavy: Latin conjugations, memory work, recitation. The Charlotte Mason approach emphasizes short lessons, narration, and nature study. Classical often feels more rigorous and academic. Charlotte Mason feels gentler and more organic.

**How is Charlotte Mason different from [unschooling](/open-education/unschooling)?**

Charlotte Mason recommends more structure than pure unschooling - scheduled lessons, required subjects, expectations about what children will encounter. But she shares the unschooling belief that children learn through interest and experience.

Her "wide and generous curriculum" - exposing children to many subjects without deciding in advance which ones matter - echoes the unschooling practice of "strewing" ideas and materials. Many families blend both approaches: Charlotte Mason structure for some subjects, child-led exploration for others.

**What ages does Charlotte Mason work for?**

Originally designed for ages 6-18. Many families adapt it for younger children, though Miss Mason herself advocated for play-based early childhood. Formal academics before age six weren't part of her vision.

**Can I mix Charlotte Mason with other approaches?**

Yes. Singapore Math for a child who struggles with Charlotte Mason math approaches. Handwriting Without Tears when penmanship becomes a battle. Interest-led projects alongside scheduled lessons. The method is a philosophy, not a prison.

Remember Meg Thomas and the Plutarch disaster? She didn't abandon Charlotte Mason - she stopped letting other people's interpretation of Charlotte Mason run her homeschool.

She kept what worked: short lessons, living books her family actually enjoyed, nature walks, narration. She dropped what didn't: the rigid book lists, the guilt about skipping the classics.

That's the point. Charlotte Mason created a method, not a rulebook. The method works when you make it yours.
