# Charlotte Mason Method - Revised Outline

## Title
"The Charlotte Mason Method" (SEO-optimized)

## Core Problems with V1
- Forced quotes where they didn't belong (Matt Bowman in "What CM Believed")
- Too many small sections that didn't breathe
- Checking boxes instead of flowing naturally
- Lost curricula (Oak Meadow?)
- CM vs Classical/Unschooling as standalone sections - should be FAQs
- Missing: modern CM movement making it accessible
- Missing: permission to step outside CM for specific subjects
- Missing: influencer section that actually breathes

## Revised Structure

### Hook
Meg Thomas Plutarch story - keep this, it works. Sets up the "philosophy not prescription" theme.

### Section 1: The Charlotte Mason Method
(Combines "What CM Believed" + core principles)

- Who she was (brief - 19th century British educator)
- Core principles as a flowing section, not a checklist:
  - Children are born persons
  - Living books over twaddle
  - Short lessons
  - Narration
  - Nature study
  - Wide and generous curriculum ("the feast")

- Transition to: Her Victorian writing can feel intimidating. Modern interpreters have made it accessible.

### Section 2: Modern Charlotte Mason
(NEW - this was missing entirely)

- The accessibility movement
- Leah Boden and "Modern Miss Mason" - translating for today's families
- The online communities that have grown up
- How you don't need to read the original 6 volumes to apply the principles
- Permission: you can do CM without the Victorian baggage

### Section 3: Charlotte Mason by Subject
(NEW - practical, breathable, useful)

**Reading & Literature**
- Living books concept
- The cliffhanger technique for read-alouds
- Why CM families care so much about book selection

**Writing & Composition**
- Narration builds toward natural writing
- "Composition should not be taught; it should be the outcome of spontaneous interest"
- Copywork and dictation

**Math**
- "Anytime you're taking something that's chaotic and bringing order to it, that's math"
- Math in nature, daily life
- **Permission to step outside CM**: If your kid struggles with math, tools like Singapore Math work great. You don't have to stay in the CM bubble.

**Handwriting**
- **Permission to step outside CM**: Handwriting Without Tears is not "Charlotte Mason" but it works. Use what works.

**Nature Study**
- Time outdoors observing
- Nature journals
- Not nature as subject but nature as teacher

**Art & Music Appreciation**
- Picture study method
- Composer study
- Building "visual vocabulary"

### Section 4: Charlotte Mason Curriculum Landscape
(Practical guide - what's out there)

**Christian/Religious Options**
- Simply Charlotte Mason (Sonya Shafer) - most accessible
- Ambleside Online - free, rigorous, purist
- The Alveary - most academically demanding
- [Need to find: Oak Meadow? Or was that different?]

**Secular Options**
- Blossom & Root
- Wildwood Curriculum
- Build Your Library

**The DIY Approach**
- Library + nature + narration
- Free Ambleside booklists
- CM's original volumes (public domain)
- "Charlotte Mason Without Breaking the Bank"

### Section 5: Charlotte Mason Through OpenEd

- OpenEd's flexibility matches CM's flexibility
- What we can fund: living books, nature supplies, art resources, museum memberships, tutoring
- What we can't fund: religious curricula
- The point: you don't need a labeled "Charlotte Mason" product

### Section 6: Voices from the CM Community
(Influencers section that breathes)

**Leah Boden** (@modernmissmason)
- Making CM accessible for modern families
- Author of "Modern Miss Mason"
- [Could pull a quote if we have one]

**Sonya Shafer** (Simply Charlotte Mason)
- Practical, how-to focused
- Podcast and blog resources
- Great for beginners

**Autumn Kern** (@thecommonplace)
- Deep philosophy content
- Emphasis on beauty and atmosphere

**Meg Thomas** (coachmegthomas.com)
- OpenEd mom, mother of seven
- "Heart, Habits, Home" framework
- The Plutarch lesson

### Section 7: FAQ

**Is Charlotte Mason only for Christians?**
Original writings are Christian, principles are universal. Secular curricula like Blossom & Root apply CM methods.

**Do I need to buy a curriculum?**
No. Philosophy + library books + nature.

**How is Charlotte Mason different from Classical education?**
(Move the substance here - both value great books, but CM rejects stage-based Trivium, emphasizes gentler approach)

**How is Charlotte Mason different from unschooling?**
(Move the substance here - more structure, but shares interest-driven philosophy, many blend both)

**What ages does CM work for?**
6-18 originally. Many adapt for younger, though CM advocated play-based early childhood.

**Can I use non-CM resources for some subjects?**
Yes! Singapore Math, Handwriting Without Tears, whatever works. CM is a philosophy, not a prison.

### Resources
- Books (Home Education, Modern Miss Mason, A Charlotte Mason Companion)
- Free resources (Ambleside, SCM blog/podcast, public domain originals)
- Communities

## Research Needed

1. **Oak Meadow** - was this the missing curriculum? Need to verify if it's CM-aligned or something else entirely.

2. **More secular living book examples** - Johnny Tremain is good, need 2-3 more.

3. **Any OpenEd podcast guests who discussed CM?**
