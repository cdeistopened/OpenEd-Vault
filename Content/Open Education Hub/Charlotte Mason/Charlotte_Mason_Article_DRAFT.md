# Charlotte Mason: A Philosophy, Not a Curriculum

[Meg Thomas](https://coachmegthomas.com), a homeschool coach and mother of seven, attended a Charlotte Mason workshop where the instructor told her: "Everybody needs to read Plutarch."

So she tried. She bought the books. She scheduled the lessons. She pushed through.

"I hated it," Meg admits. "They hated it. And they don't even remember it... because I didn't really value those things."

This is the trap thousands of homeschooling parents fall into. They search "Charlotte Mason curriculum," find elaborate book lists and morning time schedules, and assume that following these prescriptions is how you "do" Charlotte Mason.

But Charlotte Mason never wrote a curriculum. She wrote a philosophy.

The irony is thick: an approach built on respecting children as whole persons and following their natural curiosity has become synonymous with rigid book lists and prescribed routines. A philosophy designed to bring learning alive has been packaged into products.

At OpenEd, we see Charlotte Mason as one powerful method within the broader umbrella of open education - families stepping outside the industrial-conveyor-belt school model to build learning pathways that actually fit their children. And like any method, it works best when you understand the principles behind the products.

## What Charlotte Mason Actually Believed

Charlotte Mason was a 19th-century British educator who founded a teacher training college and wrote a six-volume series on education philosophy. Her core beliefs are surprisingly simple:

**Children are born persons.** Not blank slates to be filled. Not problems to be managed. Whole people, worthy of respect, capable of engaging with real ideas from an early age.

**Education is the science of relations.** Learning happens when children form connections - to ideas, nature, art, history, literature. The goal isn't to stuff facts into heads but to help children relate to the world around them.

**Living books over textbooks.** Real literature written by someone passionate about a subject beats a committee-produced textbook designed to hit grade-level benchmarks. Charlotte Mason called the watered-down alternative "twaddle" - content that talks down to children, oversimplifies, substitutes bright colors and cartoon characters for substance.

**Short lessons.** Fifteen to twenty minutes for young children. Focus intensely, then move on. Matt Bowman, founder of OpenEd, recommends something similar: "20 minutes of focused math, 20 minutes of reading, 20 minutes of writing" - with an hour of free exploration between blocks. You need an "exhausted body" through play before a mind is ready to focus on math.

**Narration.** Instead of worksheets and tests, children retell what they learned. This forces genuine understanding - you can't narrate what you didn't absorb.

**Nature study.** Time outdoors, observing, drawing, wondering. Not nature as a subject to study but nature as a teacher.

If Charlotte Mason's original writing feels intimidating - Victorian prose, references to governesses and nurseries - you're not alone. Leah Boden wrote "Modern Miss Mason" specifically to translate these principles for today's families. The core ideas are accessible. The 19th-century packaging is optional.

## Twaddle and Living Books

The word "twaddle" sounds quaint, but it names something real.

Twaddle is the abridged version that strips the life out of a story. The textbook that reduces the Revolutionary War to a bulleted timeline. The "age-appropriate" adaptation that assumes children can't handle complexity.

The antidote is what Charlotte Mason called "living books" - literature written by someone who actually cares about their subject.

Instead of a textbook about colonial America, read Johnny Tremain. Instead of a science worksheet, read a naturalist's field notes. Instead of a sanitized biography, read the actual letters and journals.

The Simply Charlotte Mason podcast puts math in the same category: "Anytime you're taking something that's chaotic and you're bringing order to it, that's math." You find math in bird calls, photography composition, organizing a messy shelf. "We don't have to consider ourselves mathematicians to enjoy math."

This is why Charlotte Mason families care so much about book selection. The book isn't just a delivery mechanism for information. It's either alive or it isn't.

## Charlotte Mason vs. Classical Education

Both approaches value great books and liberal arts. Both reject the dumbed-down, test-driven curriculum of conventional schools. But they diverge on key points.

Classical education follows the Trivium - grammar, logic, and rhetoric stages corresponding roughly to elementary, middle, and high school. The grammar stage emphasizes memorization. The logic stage emphasizes analysis. The rhetoric stage emphasizes expression.

Charlotte Mason rejected stage-based thinking. Children are capable of sophisticated thinking at any age. A six-year-old can engage with a living book about history just as meaningfully as a sixteen-year-old - differently, but meaningfully.

Classical education can be drill-heavy. Latin conjugations. Memory work. Recitation.

Charlotte Mason emphasizes short lessons, narration, and time in nature. Less drilling, more observing. Less memorizing, more relating.

Classical often feels more rigorous and academic. Charlotte Mason feels gentler and more organic. Families who want rigor with less grinding often land on Charlotte Mason.

## Charlotte Mason vs. Unschooling

Charlotte Mason has more structure than unschooling. There are scheduled lessons, required subjects, expectations about what children will encounter.

But she shares the unschooling belief that children learn through interest and experience. Her "wide and generous curriculum" - exposing children to many subjects without deciding in advance which ones matter - echoes the unschooling practice of "strewing" ideas and materials to see what a child gravitates toward.

The "feast" concept overlaps with interest-led learning. Spread a table of rich ideas. See what the child reaches for. Then go deeper.

Many families blend both: Charlotte Mason structure for language arts and history, child-led exploration for science and hobbies. The methods are more compatible than their advocates sometimes admit.

## Charlotte Mason in Practice

### Picture Study

Show a child a great painting for five to ten minutes. Let them look without commentary. Then ask: what did you notice?

This builds what Charlotte Mason called "visual vocabulary." Children learn to see art by looking at art - not by reading about art.

Resources like the Albert Bierstadt Picture Study from A Humble Place provide the paintings and the stories behind them. But a library book of art prints works too.

### Reading Aloud

Simply Charlotte Mason recommends what they call the "cliffhanger technique": stop at the good parts, not at chapter ends.

This builds anticipation. Imaginations run wild between sessions. Children learn patience. And they actually want to come back.

### Habit Training

Meg Thomas outlines a framework she calls "Heart, Habits, Home" - connection, habits, then culture.

Before focusing heavily on curriculum, she taught her children household habits. Doing laundry together as a "full family event." Making beds. Cleaning up after meals.

"I didn't realize that these skills I was teaching them was going to help me to make homeschool feasible long-term," Meg says. "I basically am working myself out of a job."

This is pure Charlotte Mason. Habits first, academics second. When the home runs smoothly, learning flows.

### Composition

Charlotte Mason believed writing should emerge naturally from narration. "Composition should not be taught," she wrote. "It should be the outcome of spontaneous interest."

Daily narration - retelling what you've read or learned - builds toward essay writing without worksheets or formal instruction. By the time a child needs to write, they've already been composing orally for years.

## The Curriculum Landscape

If you decide you want a packaged curriculum, options exist. Understanding the landscape helps you make informed choices.

**Simply Charlotte Mason** is the most accessible entry point. Sonya Shafer built a gentle, supportive community around the method. Christian but not heavily doctrinal. Their blog and podcast offer practical guidance even if you don't buy their materials.

**Ambleside Online** is free, rigorous, and community-developed. Closest to the original Charlotte Mason methods. Christian worldview throughout. If you want the purist approach without spending money, start here.

**The Alveary** is the most academically demanding. Heavy on original sources and languages. For families who want challenge.

All three are Christian. If you want secular options:

**Blossom & Root** is nature-focused and literature-based. Beautiful design. Secular with occasional "nature spirituality" but no religious content.

**Wildwood Curriculum** takes a living books approach with strong emphasis on diverse perspectives.

**Build Your Library** is secular and literature-heavy. More eclectic than pure Charlotte Mason, but good for families who want a book list without philosophy lectures.

### The DIY Approach

Many Charlotte Mason families don't use any curriculum.

The Ambleside Online booklists are free. Charlotte Mason's original volumes are public domain. Your library card and a nature journal cover most of what you need.

The philosophy is the curriculum. If you understand living books, short lessons, narration, and nature study, you can implement Charlotte Mason with nothing but library books and time outside.

Simply Charlotte Mason has an entire resource called "Charlotte Mason Without Breaking the Bank" - demonstrating how to provide a rich, literature-based education using smart sharing and free online resources rather than expensive curricula.

## Charlotte Mason Through OpenEd

OpenEd's flexibility matches Charlotte Mason's flexibility.

We fund the approach, not just products. What this looks like in practice:

**Living books.** OpenEd can help fund secular titles - the actual literature that makes Charlotte Mason work.

**Nature study supplies.** Field guides, nature journals, quality art supplies for outdoor sketching.

**Art and music appreciation.** Museum memberships, concert tickets, art books.

**Tutoring.** For subjects that need more structure or expertise than you can provide.

**Key constraint:** OpenEd cannot reimburse religious curricula. Simply Charlotte Mason, Ambleside Online, and The Alveary are Christian-based and not covered.

But Charlotte Mason principles work with any content. You don't need a labeled "Charlotte Mason" product. Library books, secular living books, nature in your backyard - these are what the method actually requires.

## FAQ

**Is Charlotte Mason only for Christians?**
