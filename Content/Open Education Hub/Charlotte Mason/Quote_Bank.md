## Questions

1. Do you have any direct quotes from Leah Boden, Autumn Kern, or Whitney Newby? That would strengthen the nearbound playbook.

2. Keep or cut Matt Bowman's 20-20-20? It connects to short lessons but felt forced in V1.

3. The Meg Thomas Plutarch story - use as hook or save for later in the article?
