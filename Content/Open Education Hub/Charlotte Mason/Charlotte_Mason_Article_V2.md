# The Charlotte Mason Method

"Everybody needs to read Plutarch."

[Meg Thomas](https://coachmegthomas.com), a homeschool coach and mother of seven, attended a Charlotte Mason workshop where the instructor insisted on this.

So she tried. She scheduled the lessons, and she pushed through.

"I hated it," Meg admits. "[my kids] hated it. And they don't even remember it... because I didn't really value those things."

This is the trap. Many parents search "Charlotte Mason curriculum," find elaborate book lists and morning time schedules, and assume that following these prescriptions is the only correct way to "do" Charlotte Mason.

But Charlotte Mason never created a curriculum. She developed a *method*.

The book lists and rigid requirements represent just one interpretation of the popular method - and they're probably not the version "Miss Mason" would recommend if she were alive today. {I think we need one or two lines here to kind of set the stage for what this article is going to be. Talking about how the principles share a lot in common with the overarching OpenEd/OpenEducation ethos especially the idea that you don't need to get everything from one place and that the world is the best classroom.}

## The Charlotte Mason Method

Charlotte Mason was a 19th-century British educator who founded a teacher training college and wrote a six-volume series on education. Her writing can feel intimidating - Victorian prose, references to governesses and nurseries. To some, it reads like it was designed for wealthy families with household staff.

But it wasn't. A number of modern interpreters like Leah Boden, author of "Modern Miss Mason," have worked to make these ideas accessible to today's families.

The core principles are simpler than the packaging suggests:

**Children are born persons.** They aren't beakers to fill, or problems to manage. They are whole people, worthy of respect, capable of engaging with real ideas from the start.

**Education is the science of relations.** Learning happens when children form connections - to ideas, nature, art, history, literature. The goal is helping children relate to the world, not stuffing facts into heads.

**Living books over "twaddle."** Charlotte Mason had a word for watered-down, dumbed-down content that talks down to children: twaddle. Textbooks that oversimplify. Abridged versions that strip the life out of literature. Bright colors and cartoon characters substituting for substance.

The antidote is what she called "living books" - real literature written by someone passionate about their subject, not a committee producing content for grade-level benchmarks.

**Short lessons.** Fifteen to twenty minutes for young children. Focus intensely, then move on. This keeps attention sharp and prevents the grinding fatigue of hour-long blocks.

**Narration.** Instead of worksheets and tests, children retell what they learned. You can't narrate what you didn't absorb. This forces genuine understanding.

**A wide and generous curriculum.** There's no hierarchy of "core" versus "extracurriculars." Art, music, poetry, handicrafts, and nature study matter as much as reading and math. Charlotte Mason called this spreading a "feast" - expose children to many things and see what they reach for.

## Charlotte Mason by Subject

These principles play out differently depending on what you're teaching, and what stage of development your child is in.

### Reading and Literature

As we mentioned, living books are the foundation. Instead of a textbook about colonial America, you might read *Johnny Tremain*. Instead of a sanitized biography, you might read actual letters and journals. The difference is palpable: a child who groans at a textbook will beg for one more chapter of a living book.

Sonya Shafer of [Simply Charlotte Mason](https://simplycharlottemason.com/blog/10-tips-for-reading-aloud/) recommends what she calls the "cliffhanger technique" for family read-alouds: stop at the good parts, not at chapter ends. This builds anticipation. Imaginations run wild between sessions. Children actually want to come back.

### Writing and Composition

Charlotte Mason believed writing should emerge naturally from narration. "Composition should not be taught," she wrote. "It should be the outcome of spontaneous interest."

Daily narration - retelling what you've read or learned - builds toward essay writing without formal instruction. By the time a child needs to write, they've been composing orally for years. Copywork and dictation reinforce spelling and grammar through exposure to good writing rather than drilling rules.

### Math

The [Simply Charlotte Mason podcast](https://simplycharlottemason.com/blog/the-beauty-of-math/) offers a liberating perspective: "Anytime you're taking something that's chaotic and you're bringing order to it, that's math."

You find math in bird calls, photography composition, organizing a messy shelf. "We don't have to consider ourselves mathematicians to enjoy math."

That said, if your child struggles with math, you don't have to stay in the Charlotte Mason bubble. Tools like Singapore Math or Right Start work well alongside CM methods. The philosophy doesn't require purity.

### Handwriting

Charlotte Mason's approach to handwriting mirrors her philosophy everywhere else: slow, methodical, habitual. She recommended starting with simple strokes before even teaching letter formation. Short lessons - five to ten minutes - with the expectation of careful work for that brief time.

Many CM families use italic handwriting programs like Penny Gardner's "Italics: Beautiful Handwriting for Children," which naturally progresses into cursive. But if handwriting becomes a battle, programs like Handwriting Without Tears work fine alongside CM methods. The philosophy doesn't demand purity.

### Nature Study

A nature journal, a patch of woods or a city park, and the habit of paying attention. Charlotte Mason didn't treat nature as a subject to study but as a teacher. Children observe. They sketch what they see. They record the date, the weather, what caught their eye.

Over time, this builds something no curriculum can manufacture: the habit of noticing. A child who has spent years watching seasons change and birds migrate sees the world differently than one who hasn't.

### Art and Music Appreciation

Picture study: show a child a great painting for five to ten minutes. Let them look without commentary. Then ask: what did you notice?

This builds what Charlotte Mason called "visual vocabulary." Children learn to see art by looking at art - not by reading about art. Resources like [A Humble Place](https://ahumbleplace.com/product/bierstadt-picture-study/) provide the paintings and stories behind them. But a library book of art prints works too.

Composer study follows the same pattern. Listen. Notice. Discuss.

### Habit Training

Meg Thomas, the homeschool coach who tried and failed to love Plutarch, discovered something about Charlotte Mason that the book lists obscure: habits come before curriculum.

She taught her children household habits first - doing laundry together as a "full family event," making beds, cleaning up after meals. "I didn't realize that these skills I was teaching them was going to help me to make homeschool feasible long-term," Meg says. "I basically am working myself out of a job."

Her framework: Heart (connection), Habits, then Home (culture). When the home runs smoothly, learning flows. This is pure Charlotte Mason - habits before academics.

## The Charlotte Mason Curriculum Landscape

If you want a packaged curriculum, options exist. Understanding the landscape helps you choose - or decide you don't need one at all.

### Christian and Religious Options

Most established Charlotte Mason curricula come from a Christian perspective.

**Simply Charlotte Mason** is the most accessible entry point. Sonya Shafer has built a gentle, supportive community around the method. Christian but not heavily doctrinal. Their [blog and podcast](https://simplycharlottemason.com) offer practical guidance even if you never buy their materials.

**Ambleside Online** is free, rigorous, and community-developed. It's the closest thing to a purist Charlotte Mason curriculum - comprehensive book lists, detailed schedules, active forums. Christian worldview throughout. If you want the full CM experience without spending money, start here.

**The Alveary** is the most academically demanding option. Heavy on original sources and languages. For families who want rigor and challenge.

### Secular and Flexible Options

**Blossom & Root** is nature-focused and literature-based with beautiful design. Secular, though some families note occasional "nature spirituality" language.

**Wildwood Curriculum** takes a living books approach with strong emphasis on diverse perspectives and flexible structure.

**Build Your Library** is secular and literature-heavy, more eclectic than pure Charlotte Mason. Good for families who want curated book lists without philosophy lectures.

### The DIY Approach

Many Charlotte Mason families don't use any curriculum.

The Ambleside Online booklists are free. Charlotte Mason's original volumes are public domain. Your library card and a nature journal cover most of what you need.

Simply Charlotte Mason has an entire resource on doing "[Charlotte Mason Without Breaking the Bank](https://simplycharlottemason.com/blog/charlotte-mason-without-breaking-the-bank/)" - library books, smart sharing, free online resources. A rich education doesn't require a large budget.

The philosophy is the curriculum. If you understand living books, short lessons, narration, and nature study, you can implement Charlotte Mason with nothing but library books and time outside.

## Charlotte Mason Through OpenEd

OpenEd's flexibility matches Charlotte Mason's flexibility. We fund the approach, not just products.

What OpenEd can support:

- **Living books** - secular titles that bring subjects alive
- **Nature study supplies** - field guides, nature journals, quality art supplies for outdoor sketching
- **Art and music appreciation** - museum memberships, concert tickets, art books, composer study resources
- **Tutoring** - for subjects where you want outside expertise

**Important note:** OpenEd cannot reimburse religious curricula. Simply Charlotte Mason, Ambleside Online, and The Alveary are Christian-based and not covered.

But Charlotte Mason principles work with any content. You don't need a labeled "Charlotte Mason" product. Library books, secular living books, nature in your backyard - these are what the method actually requires.

## FAQ

**Is Charlotte Mason only for Christians?**

The original writings are Christian. The principles are universal. Secular families adapt freely, and curricula like Blossom & Root apply Charlotte Mason methods without religious content.

**Do I need to buy a curriculum?**

No. Charlotte Mason is a philosophy. Library books, free Ambleside booklists, nature journals, and public domain resources can take you far.

**How is Charlotte Mason different from Classical education?**

Both value great books and liberal arts. But Classical education follows the Trivium - grammar, logic, and rhetoric stages corresponding roughly to elementary, middle, and high school. Charlotte Mason rejected stage-based thinking. She believed children of any age can engage with sophisticated ideas.

Classical can be drill-heavy: Latin conjugations, memory work, recitation. Charlotte Mason emphasizes short lessons, narration, and nature study. Classical often feels more rigorous and academic. Charlotte Mason feels gentler and more organic.

**How is Charlotte Mason different from unschooling?**

Charlotte Mason method recommends more structure than pure unschooling - scheduled lessons, required subjects, and expectations about what children will encounter. But she shares the unschooling belief that children learn through interest and experience.

Her "wide and generous curriculum" - exposing children to many subjects without deciding in advance which ones matter - echoes the unschooling practice of "strewing" ideas and materials. Many families blend both approaches: Charlotte Mason structure for some subjects, child-led exploration for others.

**What ages does Charlotte Mason work for?**

Originally designed for ages 6-18. Many families adapt it for younger children, though Charlotte Mason herself advocated for play-based early childhood. Formal academics before age six weren't part of her vision.

**Can I mix Charlotte Mason with other methods?**

Yes. Singapore Math for a child who struggles with CM math approaches. Handwriting Without Tears when penmanship becomes a battle. Interest-led projects alongside scheduled lessons. The method is a philosophy, not a prison.
