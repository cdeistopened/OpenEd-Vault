# The OpenEd Holiday Gift Guide: What Homeschool Families Actually Want

Every homeschool parent knows the calculation.

That toy your kid wants for Christmas? Before it goes in the cart, you're already running the mental math: Does it teach anything? Will it hold their attention past January? Can I justify the space it takes up in a house where the dining table doubles as a classroom?

Most gift guides don't get this. They're written for people who can afford to buy things that exist purely to be fun. For homeschool families, every gift has to work twice - genuinely fun AND genuinely educational. Real engagement that builds real skills. Not a thin coating of learning on top of entertainment.

This guide leans into that. These are gifts that pass the homeschool test. Vetted by our community of teachers and families who've actually used them.

## Learn to Code (Without Screens)

Parents want tech skills. Parents also worry about screen time. This is the eternal tension.

Good news: you can have both.

**EL10T Robot Kit** is our top pick for K-5. It uses physical coding blocks combined with ScratchJr - so kids learn programming logic through tactile play, not screen-staring. Comes bundled with OpenEd's Early Robotics & Programming course, and yes, it's reimbursable through OpenEd.

For the younger set (ages 4-8), **Botley 2.0** is screen-free coding that actually works. Bailey Gittins, one of our OpenEd teachers, put it simply: "My kids have loved the Botley coding robots by Learning Resources. They teach about coding without any screens."

For older kids who want something more challenging, **Turing Tumble** is a mechanical marble-powered computer. No batteries, no screens, just physics and logic puzzles. One of our teachers saw it and immediately said, "This looks like so much fun and I want to get it for my kids." That's the reaction you want.

## Build & Make

Hands-on building is having a moment. From subscription crates to 3D printing, kids want to make real things - not just consume content about making things.

**OpenEd's Stop Motion Animation Course** comes with a physical kit and teaches kids to create their own videos. It hits that sweet spot: creative output that requires patience, planning, and technical skill. Plus kids end up with something they can actually show people.

**KiwiCo** and **Crunch Labs** (Mark Rober's engineering kits) have become homeschool staples for good reason. As Jeanne Mather told us: "I have been impressed with the KiwiCo crates. They have some amazing engineering project kits." Crunch Labs works for ages 6 and up, depending on the kit.

**Snap Circuits** remain a classic - Jeanne's family has been using them for two generations. "Even my husband used to have them when he was a kid!" There's something to be said for toys that stand the test of time.

For teens or serious makers, **3D printing** is worth considering. The machines are pricey upfront, but they open up a whole world of design and engineering. And they qualify as technology purchases through OpenEd.

**The Woobles** deserve special mention - they're beginner crochet kits that solve the frustration gap of learning fiber arts. The yarn comes pre-started, the instructions include video tutorials, and kids actually finish projects instead of rage-quitting. Hot item for 2025.

And here's a zero-cost option: the **Inventor Box**. Michelle Zelaya described it as "a bin filled with a variety of materials that kids can invent and be creative with - paper, coloring materials, string, fabric, paper bags, ribbons, pom poms, old containers, egg cartons." Sometimes the best gift is permission to make a mess.

## The Gameschooling Revolution

The hottest trend in homeschool right now is "gameschooling" - using complex strategy games as actual curriculum. Not dumbed-down "educational" versions of real games. Real games that happen to teach.

**For Math:**

**Sleeping Queens 2** has kids solving addition equations to rescue kings (ages 6-10). **Prime Climb** uses color-coding to teach multiplication and prime factorization in a way that actually sticks. **Cover Your Assets** and **Clumsy Thief** are mental math games that adults enjoy too - always a good sign.

**For Science:**

**Earth** has players building ecosystems and learning taxonomy (ages 12+). **Wingspan** is the ornithology gateway game - it's won every board game award that exists and makes people genuinely care about bird habitat and wingspan-to-body ratios. **Daybreak** is a climate science simulation where you're trying to prevent catastrophe (ages 10+).

**For Logic:**

**Rush Hour** teaches spatial reasoning through traffic jam puzzles. **Chess** remains the OG strategy game for a reason. **Murdle** is murder mystery logic puzzles - it's having a moment in 2025.

As one of our teachers put it: "Board games that teach logical thinking - games like Rush Hour or Chess - can improve problem-solving skills." The research backs this up, but honestly, you can just watch it happen.

## Wild & Free

The "Wild and Free" movement continues strong. These gifts get kids outside and observing.

**Tech Meets Nature:**

The **Birdfy Smart Bird Feeder** uses a camera and AI to identify birds visiting your feeder. It sends notifications to your phone when new species show up. Cassie Shepherd told us: "Last year for Christmas we got our girls this bird feeder with the camera. It has been so fun watching different birds up close!" It turns nature study into something between science class and Pokemon Go.

**Classic Nature Study:**

The **Carson MicroBrite Plus** is a pocket microscope with LED lighting, 60-120x magnification, under $15. The **Insect Lore Butterfly Garden** lets kids raise actual butterflies. The **National Geographic Rock Tumbler** transforms rough rocks into polished stones over several weeks - Cassie's kids "still love" theirs, though she notes it's loud enough to live in the garage.

**Active Adventure:**

**Ninja Warrior Obstacle Courses** have become a homeschool essential. Cassie took hers on a family camping trip and "it was a huge hit." **Strider Bikes** for the little ones (2.5-3 years) - "None of our kids ever used training wheels and we owe it to these bikes."

New for 2025: the **Cosmo JrTrack 5**, a partnership between 1000 Hours Outside and JrTrack. It's a kid-friendly smartwatch with GPS tracking designed specifically for families who want to give children more independence outdoors. If you're bought into Ginny Yurich's philosophy, this is the hardware to match.

## For the Reader

**The Yoto Player** has won the audio player wars for homeschoolers. It uses cards (easier to store than Toniebox figurines) and offers educational content beyond just stories - podcasts, history, science. Cassie's family has had theirs for years and still recommends it.

**Book subscriptions** make gift-giving easy: **Literati** for the younger set, **OwlCrate** for teens who want the whole bookish experience.

And never underestimate a **gift card to the local bookstore**. Let them pick. Throw in a personalized book stamp ("From the Library of...") and you've got a gift that keeps giving.

## Stocking Stuffers That Teach

Quick hits under $25:

**Shashibo** - a magnetic shape-shifting cube that's part geometry lesson, part fidget toy. **Plus Plus** - mini building blocks that punch above their weight class. **Toobs** - those tubes of miniature animals, landmarks, or historical figures that somehow end up everywhere.

Card games: **Sleeping Queens**, **Proof!** (a math game that's actually fun), and any of the small box games from the gameschooling section above.

**Thinking Putty** comes in versions that are magnetic, heat-sensitive, or glow-in-the-dark. Good fidget, minimal mess.

## For the Homeschool Parent

Homeschooling is a job. These gifts acknowledge that.

**Books:**

**Open Education** (hardcover) - the definitive guide to the movement you're part of. Isaac Morehouse recently noted that "the hardcover edition is now available, and it's quite nice I must say! Great gift idea." The Kindle version is free, and the paperback is currently half off on Amazon.

**Until the Streetlights Come On** by Ginny Yurich - the case for outdoor play and childhood independence, from the founder of 1000 Hours Outside. Pairs nicely with that JrTrack watch above.

**Joyful Learning** by Kerry McDonald - a primer on unschooling and self-directed education for parents who want to understand child-led approaches.

**Sanity Savers:**

A heavy-duty electric pencil sharpener. (If you know, you know.) A laminator. A coffee setup that doesn't require leaving the house.

**Identity:**

"Keep Homeschool Weird" merchandise exists and your people will get the reference.

## The Test

The best homeschool gifts pass a simple test: Would your kid play with it even if it weren't "educational"? And can you feel good about the space it takes up?

Every item on this list earns its place in your home. They're fun enough to be genuine gifts, useful enough to count as curriculum, and recommended by families who've actually used them.

Happy holidays from the OpenEd team.
