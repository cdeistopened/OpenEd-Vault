# The OpenEd Holiday Gift Guide: What Homeschool Families Want

Some gifts are fun. Some gifts teach something. The best gifts do both - and those are the ones we're featuring here.

This is the 2025 OpenEd Holiday gift guide: toys, tools, games, and books that inspire curiosity, reward self-directed learning, and hold kids' attention long after the wrapping paper is gone. Everything on this list has been vetted by our community of teachers and families.

## Learn to Code (Without Screens)

Parents want their kids to develop tech skills. Parents also worry about screen time. You can have both.

**[EL10T Robot Kit](https://opened.co)** is our top pick for K-5. It uses physical coding blocks combined with ScratchJr, so kids learn programming logic through tactile play rather than screen-staring. Comes bundled with OpenEd's Early Robotics & Programming course, and it's reimbursable through OpenEd.

For younger kids (ages 4-8), **[Botley 2.0](https://www.learningresources.com/botley-the-coding-robot-2-0)** is screen-free coding that works. Bailey Gittins, an OpenEd teacher, told us: "My kids have loved the Botley coding robots by Learning Resources. They teach about coding without any screens."

For older kids who want more challenge, **[Turing Tumble](https://www.turingtumble.com/)** is a mechanical marble-powered computer. No batteries, no screens - just physics and logic puzzles. Danielle Randall, another OpenEd teacher, saw it and said: "This looks like so much fun and I want to get it for my kids."

## Build & Make

Hands-on building is having a moment. From subscription crates to 3D printing, kids want to make real things - not just consume content about making things.

**[OpenEd's Stop Motion Animation Course](https://opened.co)** comes with a physical kit and teaches kids to create their own videos. Creative output that requires patience, planning, and technical skill - and kids end up with something they can show people.

**[KiwiCo](https://www.kiwico.com/)** and **[Crunch Labs](https://www.crunchlabs.com/)** (Mark Rober's engineering kits) have become homeschool staples. Jeanne Mather, an OpenEd teacher, told us: "I have been impressed with the KiwiCo crates. They have some amazing engineering project kits." She also recommends Crunch Labs for ages 6 and up.

**[Snap Circuits](https://www.elenco.com/brand/snap-circuits/)** remain a classic. Jeanne's family has been using them for two generations: "Even my husband used to have them when he was a kid!"

For teens or serious makers, **3D printing** opens up a whole world of design and engineering. The machines are pricey upfront, but they qualify as technology purchases through OpenEd.

**[The Woobles](https://thewoobles.com/)** are beginner crochet kits that solve the frustration gap of learning fiber arts. The yarn comes pre-started, the instructions include video tutorials, and kids finish projects instead of giving up. Hot item for 2025.

And here's a zero-cost option: the **Inventor Box**. Michelle Zelaya, an OpenEd teacher, described it as "a bin filled with a variety of materials that kids can invent and be creative with - paper, coloring materials, string, fabric, paper bags, ribbons, pom poms, old containers, egg cartons." Sometimes the best gift is permission to make a mess.

## The Gameschooling Revolution

"Gameschooling" - using strategy games as curriculum - is one of the hottest trends in homeschooling right now. These aren't dumbed-down "educational" versions of real games. They're real games that happen to teach.

**For Math:**

- **Sleeping Queens 2** - Addition equations to rescue kings (ages 6-10)
- **[Prime Climb](https://mathforlove.com/prime-climb/)** - Color-coded multiplication and prime factorization
- **Cover Your Assets** - Mental math card game the whole family enjoys
- **Clumsy Thief** - Fast-paced addition to 100

**For Science:**

- **[Earth](https://www.insideupgames.com/earth)** - Build ecosystems and learn taxonomy (ages 12+)
- **[Wingspan](https://stonemaiergames.com/games/wingspan/)** - The ornithology gateway game that's won every board game award
- **[Daybreak](https://www.yoursdaybreak.com/)** - Climate science simulation (ages 10+)

**For Logic:**

- **[Rush Hour](https://www.thinkfun.com/products/rush-hour/)** - Spatial reasoning through traffic jam puzzles
- **Chess** - The original strategy game
- **[Murdle](https://www.murderbook.com/)** - Murder mystery logic puzzles (hot for 2025)

Rachael Davie, an OpenEd teacher, put it simply: "Board games that teach logical thinking - games like Rush Hour or Chess - can improve problem-solving skills."

## Nature & Outdoors

These gifts get kids outside and observing.

**Tech Meets Nature:**

The **[Birdfy Smart Bird Feeder](https://www.birdfy.com/)** uses a camera and AI to identify birds visiting your feeder and sends notifications when new species show up. Cassie Shepherd, an OpenEd mom who writes the blog [Home-Centered Learning](https://homecenteredlearning.com/), told us: "Last year for Christmas we got our girls this bird feeder with the camera. It has been so fun watching different birds up close!"

**Classic Nature Study:**

- **[Carson MicroBrite Plus](https://carson.com/products/microbrite-plus-mm-300/)** - Pocket microscope with LED lighting, 60-120x magnification (under $15)
- **[Insect Lore Butterfly Garden](https://www.insectlore.com/)** - Raise real butterflies from caterpillars
- **[National Geographic Rock Tumbler](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/shop/)** - Transforms rough rocks into polished stones over several weeks. Cassie's kids love theirs, though she notes it's loud enough to live in the garage.

**Active & Adventure:**

- **Ninja Warrior Obstacle Course** - Cassie took hers on a family camping trip: "It was a huge hit!"
- **[Strider Bikes](https://www.striderbikes.com/)** - Balance bikes for ages 2-5. "None of our kids ever used training wheels and we owe it to these bikes."
- **[Cosmo JrTrack 5](https://www.jrtrack.com/)** - A kid-friendly smartwatch with GPS tracking, created in partnership with [1000 Hours Outside](https://www.1000hoursoutside.com/). Ginny Yurich's 1000 Hours Outside movement encourages families to spend 1,000 hours per year outdoors - roughly the same amount of time kids spend on screens. This watch is designed for families who want to give children more independence outside.

## For the Reader

**[Yoto Player](https://us.yotoplay.com/)** has won the audio player wars for homeschoolers. It uses cards (easier to store than Toniebox figurines) and offers educational content beyond stories - podcasts, history, science. Cassie's family has had theirs for years and still recommends it.

**Book subscriptions** make gift-giving easy:

- **[Literati](https://www.literati.com/)** - Curated book boxes for kids
- **[OwlCrate](https://owlcrate.com/)** - For teens who want the full bookish experience

And don't underestimate a **gift card to the local bookstore**. Let them pick. Throw in a personalized book stamp ("From the Library of...") and you've created a gift that keeps giving.

## For the Homeschool Parent

Three books worth giving (or asking for):

**[Open Education](https://a.co/d/0iIjMFJ)** (hardcover) - The definitive guide to the movement you're part of. Isaac Morehouse, co-author, recently noted: "The hardcover edition is now available, and it's quite nice I must say!" The Kindle version is free, and the paperback is currently half off.

**[Until the Streetlights Come On](https://www.1000hoursoutside.com/book)** by Ginny Yurich - The case for outdoor play and childhood independence, from the founder of 1000 Hours Outside. Pairs well with that JrTrack watch above.

**Joyful Learning** by Kerry McDonald - A primer on unschooling and self-directed education for parents exploring child-led approaches.

The best gifts on this list pass a simple test: Would your kid engage with it even if no one called it "educational"?

Everything here is fun enough to be a genuine gift, useful enough to support learning, and recommended by families who've used it. Happy holidays from the OpenEd team.
