# Holiday Gift Guide Intro - FINAL

Greetings Eddies!

If you're still looking for gift ideas - especially for the kids who are hard to shop for - this guide is for you.

Here's the thing about homeschool gift-giving: you don't want to be the person who wraps up a workbook. Or worse, something that looks fun but is really just school in disguise. Kids can spot a Trojan horse a mile away.

The gifts in this guide are different. They're things kids genuinely want to play with - and they happen to inspire curiosity along the way.

"Play is our brain's favorite way of learning," as Diane Ackerman put it. The best gifts understand this.

We asked our community of OpenEd teachers and homeschool families what they're giving this year - what's worked, what their kids keep coming back to, what's earned its place in homes where space is shared between living and learning.

**What we found:** the gifts that last aren't the ones marketed as "educational." They're the ones that inspire genuine curiosity. The ones kids choose to play with on their own. The ones that reward exploration and self-directed learning without announcing it.

We organized everything into ten categories, each with an OpenEd Favorite and a handful of runner-ups. These aren't the only good options - they're the ones our community keeps recommending.
