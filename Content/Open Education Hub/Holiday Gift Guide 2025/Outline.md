## The Hook

Open by acknowledging what makes homeschool gift-giving different - the "dual mandate" of fun + learning.

**Draft concept:**

Every homeschool parent knows the calculation. That toy your kid wants for Christmas? Before it goes in the cart, you're already running the mental math: Does it teach anything? Will it last? Can I justify the space it takes up?

In a home where the dining table is also the classroom, every gift has to work twice - genuinely fun AND genuinely educational. Not a thin coating of learning on top of entertainment, but real engagement that happens to build skills.

This guide leans into that. These are gifts that pass the homeschool test: things your kids will actually want to play with, that also happen to teach something worth learning. Vetted by our community of teachers and families.

## Closing

Circle back to the "dual mandate" concept.

**Draft concept:**

The best homeschool gifts pass a simple test: Would your kid play with it even if it weren't "educational"? And can you feel good about the space it takes up?

Every item on this list earns its place in your home. They're fun enough to be genuine gifts, useful enough to count as curriculum, and recommended by families who've actually used them.

Happy holidays from the OpenEd team.

## Checkpoint 1 Questions

Before drafting:

1. **RESOLVED:** Structure approved. "Dual mandate" framing instead of "veneer."
2. **RESOLVED:** EL10T is primary push, Stop Motion secondary.
3. **OPEN:** Build & Make vs Learn to Code overlap - should we merge these sections? Or differentiate by framing Build & Make as "creative output" (Stop Motion, Woobles, Inventor Box) vs Learn to Code as "STEM/robotics" (EL10T, Botley, Turing Tumble)?
4. **RESOLVED:** Books section expanded with Open Education, Ginny Yurich, Kerry McDonald.
5. **OPEN:** Need specific product links for:
   - Chess set recommendation
   - Nature Explorer Backpack
   - Flower Press Kit
6. **RESOLVED:** Cut Lowe's/Home Depot workshops.
7. **ADDED:** Cosmo JrTrack 5 x 1000 Hours Outside watch in Wild & Free section.
