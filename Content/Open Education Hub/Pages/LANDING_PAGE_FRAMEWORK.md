# Landing Page Framework for Open Education Spoke Pages

## Page Purpose
Convert curious/overwhelmed parents into OpenEd applicants (or book buyers if out-of-state) by showing them they can:
1. Fully fund their preferred approach with OpenEd
2. Mix their preferred approach with other methods
3. Join a supportive community doing the same

## Target Audiences per Page
- **Already practicing this approach** → Need funding/support/community
- **Curious about this approach** → Need confidence it's doable
- **Want to mix approaches** → Need permission/framework to blend

## Core Messaging Architecture

### The "AND" Operator
Position OpenEd as the connective tissue between approaches, not a replacement for any of them.

**Key phrase patterns:**
- "Classical education AND flexibility"
- "Montessori materials AND community support"
- "Your philosophy AND our funding"

### Dual Assurance
Every page must clearly communicate:
1. **Purity play**: "Keep your [Classical/Montessori/etc.] identity intact"
2. **Mixing play**: "OR blend it with other approaches as your child's needs evolve"

### Language Coding
Each page must be "coded" in the vernacular of its community:
- **Classical**: Trivium, Great Books, Latin, virtue, wisdom, Western tradition
- **Montessori**: Prepared environment, follow the child, planes of development, sensitive periods, auto-education
- **Virtual School**: Flexibility, asynchronous, self-paced, location independence
- **Microschools**: Mixed-age, facilitator, part-time, community-integrated

## Standard Page Structure

### 1. Hero Section (150-200 words)
- **Hook**: Start with the approach's growing momentum OR parent's core frustration
- **Bridge**: Acknowledge the typical barrier (cost, isolation, overwhelm)
- **Promise**: OpenEd makes this accessible through funding + flexibility + community

**CTA**: Primary button - "See If You Qualify" or "Apply Now"

### 2. What is [Approach]? (300-400 words)
- Brief, practitioner-language definition
- Core principles (3-5 bullet points)
- What makes it distinct
- Frame as "you probably already know this, but here's how OpenEd fits"

**SEO H2**: "What is [Approach] Education?" or "Defining the [Approach] Method"

### 3. The OpenEd Advantage for [Approach] (400-500 words)
This is the CORE conversion section. Answer:
- What can you fund? (High-level categories, not detailed lists)
- How does it work with part-time/hybrid/full-time?
- What if I want to mix approaches?
- What support do you get beyond funding?

**Key messaging**:
- "Every secular [approach] resource is 100% reimbursable"
- "You're not locked into one curriculum or timeline"
- "Join families who are mixing [this] with [that]"

**SEO H2**: "[Approach] with OpenEd" or "How OpenEd Enables [Approach]"

**CTA**: Secondary - "Learn How It Works" → links to how-it-works page

### 4. By Developmental Stage (400-600 words total)
Break down what this approach looks like at different ages:
- Elementary (6-12)
- Middle School (12-15)
- High School (15-18)

For each stage:
- What changes at this age
- Example of what a week might look like
- How families blend approaches at this stage

**SEO H2s**: 
- "[Approach] for Elementary School"
- "[Approach] for Middle School"  
- "[Approach] for High School"

### 5. High-Level Curriculum Overview (300-400 words)
NOT a detailed resource list. Instead:
- Major categories (e.g., "Latin programs," "Great Books seminars")
- 3-5 specific examples with brief descriptions
- Link to deep dive article for comprehensive lists
- Emphasis on "these are just examples—you choose what works"

**SEO H2**: "[Approach] Curriculum" or "[Approach] Resources"

**CTA**: "Explore Detailed Curriculum Guide" → links to deep dive blog article

### 6. FAQ Section (300-400 words)
Address the top objections/questions:
- "Can I keep my [approach] identity while using OpenEd?"
- "What if I want to blend [this approach] with others?"
- "What if I'm not in an OpenEd state?"
- "How do I know if this approach is right for my child?"

**SEO H2**: "Common Questions About [Approach] with OpenEd"

### 7. Final CTA Section (150-200 words)
- Recap the core promise
- Direct call to action
- Alternative pathways for non-qualifying states

**Primary CTA**: "Apply Now" or "Reserve Your Spot"
**Secondary CTAs**: 
- "Read the Open Education Book"
- "Download Free Getting Started Guide"
- "Join Our Newsletter"

## Page Length Target
- **Total**: 2,000-2,500 words
- **Conversion-focused**: More visual breaks, more CTAs than blog articles
- **Scannable**: Shorter paragraphs, more subheadings, bullet points

## What to AVOID
- ❌ Success metrics/data
- ❌ Specific funding amounts
- ❌ Expert testimonials/quotes
- ❌ Parent testimonials
- ❌ Detailed pricing comparisons
- ❌ State-specific requirements

## Internal Linking Strategy
- Link to hub page ("What is Open Education?") in intro
- Link to deep dive article for detailed resources
- Link to "How It Works" page for process/funding details
- Link to other spoke pages when mentioning blending approaches
- Link to book page in final CTA section

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

### Do:
- Use "you" and "your child" 
- Acknowledge parent fears/doubts
- Celebrate the approach's strengths
- Position OpenEd as enabler, not replacement
- Use practitioner vocabulary naturally
- Keep paragraphs short (2-4 sentences)

### Don't:
- Oversell or hype
- Criticize traditional school harshly
- Make promises about outcomes
- Use jargon without context
- Write in academic/institutional voice

## Mobile Optimization
- Hero section must work as standalone pitch
- Each section should stand alone (for scrollers)
- CTAs should appear every 400-500 words
- Headers must clearly signal content

## SEO Considerations
- Primary keyword in H1
- Secondary keywords in H2s (but maintain natural language)
- Internal links to other content
- Meta description (separate doc): 150-160 characters
- URL structure: /open-education/[approach-name]

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Create this framework
2. Draft Classical page using framework
3. Draft Montessori page using framework
4. Review both for tone consistency
5. Repeat for Virtual School, Microschools, etc.
