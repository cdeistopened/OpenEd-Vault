## HERO

**Layout:** Full-width hero with background image or simple header block

Classical schools have doubled in the past decade—but homeschoolers were there first. Long before the revival became a movement, families were pioneering the mix-and-match approach: combining Great Books seminars from online academies with Latin co-ops meeting in church basements, blending classical literature with Singapore Math, adding logic curricula to Charlotte Mason nature study.

These early adopters proved something important: you don't need institutional infrastructure to access the Great Tradition. You need the right resources, supportive community, and freedom to adapt as your child develops.

But even for homeschoolers, accessing quality classical education has often meant an impossible choice: expensive private schools ($8,000-15,000 annually), going it alone with limited resources, or accepting pre-packaged programs that don't quite fit.

OpenEd changes this equation. Through partnerships with innovative schools, we make classical education accessible with complete flexibility—whether you want systematic Latin through Virgil, logic beginning in middle school, and Great Books as your centerpiece, OR you want to weave classical elements into a broader open education approach, mixing freely as your child's needs evolve.

## What is Classical Education?

**Layout:** Standard content block

Classical education revives the time-tested methods that formed Western civilization's greatest thinkers for over two millennia. Rather than treating knowledge as isolated facts to memorize for tests, it develops the tools of learning itself—training minds to think clearly, learn independently, and express themselves persuasively.

At its heart, classical education emphasizes:

**Language as Foundation** — Latin and Greek aren't decorative but keys unlocking the Western intellectual tradition. When students read Virgil's *Aeneid* in the original, they're engaging directly with texts that have formed minds for millennia.

**The Trivium's Developmental Wisdom** — Young children (5-12) absorb eagerly, memorizing and building foundational knowledge (Grammar stage). Middle schoolers (12-14) become argumentative, ready for formal reasoning (Logic stage). Teenagers (15-18) synthesize into original expression (Rhetoric stage). Classical education works with developmental realities rather than against them.

**Integration Over Fragmentation** — History becomes the spine around which everything wraps. Studying ancient Greece means reading Homer's epics, tracing democracy's development, examining Aristotelian logic, exploring Pythagorean mathematics. The student sees how knowledge coheres.

**Virtue Formation** — Classical education explicitly aims to form character through exposure to noble examples. Students encounter virtue and vice in Homer, courage and cowardice in Plutarch, wisdom and folly in Shakespeare.

Historical evidence validates this approach: In 19th-century Germany, students from humanistic schools emphasizing Latin, Greek, and literature consistently outperformed science-focused *Realschule* students at universities—even in sciences they'd never studied. Classical training in *how to think* transferred across all disciplines.

## Classical Education Model

**Layout:** Content block

The classical model follows three developmental stages aligned with how children naturally learn:

### The Grammar Stage (Ages 5-12)

Young minds absorb information eagerly. This stage emphasizes:
- **Memorization** of facts, dates, poetry, math facts, Latin vocabulary
- **Reading widely** from mythology, fairy tales, historical narratives
- **Building foundations** in language, history, mathematics, science
- **Songs and chants** making memory work enjoyable

Grammar doesn't mean sentence diagrams—it means mastering the fundamental "grammar" or building blocks of each subject.

### The Logic Stage (Ages 12-14)

Adolescents naturally become argumentative. Classical education channels this into:
- **Formal logic** studying valid reasoning and fallacies
- **Socratic dialogue** defending positions and examining assumptions
- **Analytical reading** understanding how arguments work in texts
- **Scientific method** applying logical thinking to natural phenomena
- **Debate** practicing reasoned argumentation

Students learn to think dialectically—not just what to think, but how to evaluate arguments critically.

### The Rhetoric Stage (Ages 15-18)

Mature students synthesize knowledge into original expression:
- **Persuasive writing and speaking** crafting compelling arguments
- **Original research** pursuing questions deeply
- **Great Books seminars** wrestling with civilization's pivotal texts
- **Thesis defense** articulating and defending positions
- **Application** using tools of learning across all subjects

By high school graduation, students possess tools for lifelong learning—they can teach themselves anything.

## Classical Education vs Modern Education

**Layout:** Content block with comparison elements

**Layout instruction:** Consider side-by-side comparison or table format

The difference between classical and modern education goes deeper than curriculum:

| **Classical Education** | **Modern Education** |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Focus:** Tools of learning (how to think) | **Focus:** Content delivery (what to know) |
| **Structure:** Developmental stages (Trivium) | **Structure:** Age-based grade levels |
| **Content:** Great Books, primary sources, original texts | **Content:** Textbooks, secondary sources, digests |
| **Method:** Socratic dialogue, discussion, debate | **Method:** Lecture, worksheets, standardized tests |
| **Goal:** Wisdom and virtue | **Goal:** Career preparation |
| **Subjects:** Integrated around history | **Subjects:** Isolated disciplines |
| **Measurement:** Can the student think, argue, create? | **Measurement:** Can the student recall information? |

Modern education emerged from industrial-era needs: standardization, efficiency, preparing workers for factories. Classical education emerged from asking: What does it mean to be fully human? How do we form wise, virtuous citizens capable of self-governance?

Neither is purely right or wrong. But families choosing classical education prioritize formation over information, wisdom over credentials, the Great Tradition over contemporary trends.

## Classical Education and Homeschooling

**Layout:** Three-column layout for subsections (desktop) or stacked blocks (mobile)

Classical education and homeschooling have become natural partners. The revival of classical education happened largely through homeschooling families rediscovering Dorothy Sayers' 1947 lecture "The Lost Tools of Learning" and Susan Wise Bauer's *The Well-Trained Mind*.

**Layout instruction:** Three equal-width columns below

### [COLUMN 1]

**Why Classical Works at Home**

- **Natural pacing** follows child's development, not institutional schedules
- **Socratic method** works brilliantly in family discussions
- **Read-aloud culture** makes Great Books accessible from young ages
- **Multi-age learning** where older siblings mentor younger
- **Integration** easier to achieve without bell schedules fragmenting learning

Families commonly gather around the dining table reading Homer, discussing Plato, memorizing Latin declensions, and debating history—recovering the household as the primary place of formation.

### [COLUMN 2]

**Classical Community Options**

Classical education thrives with community:

- **Classical Conversations†** — Weekly gatherings for memory work and Socratic discussions
- **Latin co-ops** — Small groups progressing through language together
- **Great Books seminars** — Families wrestling with texts together
- **Debate clubs** — Practicing rhetoric and argumentation
- **Regional classical conferences** — Connecting with like-minded families

Through OpenEd, access community without full-time institutional commitment.

### [COLUMN 3]

**Flexibility to Mix Approaches**

Many families blend classical with other methods:

- **Classical literature and history** + adaptive math programs
- **Latin and Greek** + modern foreign languages
- **Great Books discussions** + entrepreneurial projects
- **Classical Conversations** twice weekly + self-paced home learning
- **Formal rhetoric** + modern public speaking and content creation

OpenEd enables both classical purists and creative blenders—your philosophy stays intact.

## Reclaim the Lost Tools of Learning

**Layout:** Distinct call-out box, different background color, centered content

For over two thousand years, classical education formed the West's greatest thinkers, leaders, and creators. Dorothy Sayers argued we lost these tools—the ability to think clearly, learn independently, and express ourselves persuasively.

But lost tools can be found again.

Through OpenEd, your family can access humanity's longest and most successful educational tradition without choosing between classical rigor and financial reality, between educational community and family flexibility, between honoring the past and adapting to your child's unique present.

Whether you want full classical immersion in Latin, logic, and the Great Books, or you want to blend classical elements with other approaches as your child's needs evolve, OpenEd makes it possible.

The wisdom that shaped Western civilization isn't trapped in expensive institutions or reserved for the privileged few. It's available to every family willing to pursue it—with the resources, support, and community to make it sustainable.
