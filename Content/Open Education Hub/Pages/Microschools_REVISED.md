### Content:

Microschools are redefining what "going to school" means. With typically 5-15 students in mixed-age groups, meeting in homes or community spaces, they combine the personalization of homeschooling with the community of traditional school. Most operate 2-3 days weekly, not five. They're facilitator-guided, not teacher-directed. They're designed for precision, not scale.

As education policy analyst Kerry McDonald observes, many microschools are "collaboratives of homeschoolers where you can attend part-time or full-time...at a fraction of the cost of a traditional private school," making quality education "much more accessible to more families."

The challenge: Most microschools still require tuition and enrollment commitments. Families wanting to blend microschool community with home learning days, or mix approaches as needs evolve, need flexibility that traditional structures don't provide.

OpenEd changes this. Through partnerships with innovative public schools, we make it possible to access microschool communities as part of a broader open education approach—attending when it serves your child, learning at home when that works better, blending small-group learning with individual flexibility.

## SECTION 2: WHAT ARE MICROSCHOOLS?

**Layout:** Standard content block

### H2: Defining Microschools

Microschools resist simple definition because they're defined more by what they're not than what they are:

**Intentionally Small** — Typically 5-15 students, though some networks accommodate up to 30-40. Size matters less than the ability to know each student deeply and adapt to individual needs.

**Mixed-Age by Design** — An 8-year-old works alongside a 6-year-old and a 10-year-old. Older students mentor younger. Younger students observe and aspire. Everyone learns at their actual level, not their age-assigned grade.

**Facilitator-Guided** — Adults guide rather than instruct. They prepare environments, ask questions, connect students to resources, and step back. Students direct learning with adult support.

**Part-Time as Standard** — Most meet 2-3 days weekly, not five. Families blend microschool community days with home learning, creating flexibility traditional school can't offer.

**Radically Specific** — Each serves a precise niche: nature-based learning, Montessori in small groups, classical education community, project-based entrepreneurship, twice-exceptional learners.

Microschools prove you don't have to choose between personalization and community.

### H2: Common Questions About Microschools with OpenEd

**Q: How do microschools work with OpenEd?**

OpenEd enables families to access part-time microschool programs as part of a broader educational approach. Rather than requiring full-time enrollment, participate 2-3 days weekly while maintaining flexibility for home learning, online courses, or other approaches.

Microschool becomes one component of your open education plan, not the entirety. You get small-group, mixed-age community benefits without sacrificing flexibility.

---

**Q: Can we blend microschool with other approaches?**

Absolutely. Families commonly blend:
- Microschool for collaboration + home learning for self-paced academics
- Microschool for hands-on STEM + classical curriculum for literature/history  
- Microschool for social interaction + virtual courses for specialized subjects
- Microschool mornings + apprenticeships afternoons

The question isn't "microschool or homeschool?" It's "How do we blend community with flexibility?"

---

**Q: What if I'm not in an OpenEd state?**

Consider [**OpenEd Academy**](https://openedacademy.com/)—our accredited virtual private school serving students nationwide (K-12). OpenEd Academy provides:

- **Flexible scheduling** working with part-time microschool attendance
- **Accredited diploma and transcripts**
- **Affordable tuition** (K-8: $2,900/year | 9-12: $3,500/year)

---

**Q: What's the difference between a microschool and a co-op?**

**Microschools** typically have:
- Paid facilitators (not just parent volunteers)
- Regular schedules (multiple days weekly)
- Defined educational philosophy
- More structured offerings

**Co-ops** typically feature:
- Parent-run with families teaching
- Less frequent meetings (often once weekly)
- More variable philosophy
- More flexible structure

Many programs blend both. What matters is whether it serves your needs, not the label.

---

**Q: Is microschool right for my child?**

Microschools particularly suit students who:
- Need personalization beyond traditional school
- Thrive in small groups vs. large classrooms
- Benefit from mixed-age interaction
- Want community without full-time commitment
- Need flexibility in pacing and schedule
- Learn better through project-based, hands-on approaches

With OpenEd, try part-time participation. Use microschool for what it does well (community, collaboration, projects), supplement with other approaches for everything else.
