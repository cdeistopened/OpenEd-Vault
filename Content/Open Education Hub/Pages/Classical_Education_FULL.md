## SECTION 1: HERO

### Content:

The number of classical schools has doubled in the past decade. Homeschoolers have been at the forefront of this revival, mixing Great Books seminars from online academies, Latin co-ops meeting in church basements, and logic curricula at kitchen tables. Families are choosing trivium over testing, virtue over vocational prep, the Great Tradition over the latest trends.

But accessing quality classical education has meant an impossible choice: expensive private schools ($8,000-15,000 annually) or going it alone with limited resources and no community.

OpenEd changes this equation. Through partnerships with innovative public schools, we make classical education accessible—whether you want systematic Latin through Virgil, logic beginning in middle school, and Great Books as your centerpiece, OR you want to blend classical literature with adaptive math and mix approaches as your child's needs evolve.

## SECTION 2: WHAT IS CLASSICAL EDUCATION?
**Layout:** Standard content block with optional pull quote

### H2: What is Classical Education?

If you're researching classical education, you already know the basics—Dorothy Sayers' lecture on "The Lost Tools of Learning," the revival sparked by *The Well-Trained Mind*, the three stages that match natural development. What makes it distinctive isn't its age but its integration:

**Language as Foundation** — Latin and Greek aren't decorative but keys unlocking the Western intellectual tradition. When your daughter reads Virgil's *Aeneid* in the original, she's thinking in grammatical categories that shaped our civilization, tracing etymology illuminating half of English vocabulary, engaging directly with texts that have formed minds for two millennia.

**Integration Over Fragmentation** — History becomes the spine around which everything wraps. Studying ancient Greece means reading Homer's epics, tracing democracy's development, examining Aristotelian logic, exploring Pythagorean mathematics. Literature illuminates history. Philosophy emerges from historical context. The student sees how knowledge coheres.

**The Socratic Method** — Through Socratic dialogue, students learn to think dialectically—defending positions, examining assumptions, following arguments to their conclusions. This develops not just critical thinking but intellectual humility: real understanding requires wrestling with ideas, not just consuming them.

**Virtue Formation** — Classical education explicitly aims to form character through exposure to noble examples. Students encounter virtue and vice in Homer, courage and cowardice in Plutarch, wisdom and folly in Shakespeare. They learn ideas have consequences and education should prepare them for life well lived.

**The Trivium's Developmental Wisdom** — Young children (5-12) absorb eagerly, memorizing and building foundational knowledge. Middle schoolers (12-14) become argumentative, ready for formal reasoning. Teenagers (15-18) synthesize into original expression. Classical education works with developmental realities rather than against them.

Historical evidence: In 19th-century Germany, students from humanistic schools emphasizing Latin, Greek, and literature consistently outperformed science-focused *Realschule* students at universities—even in sciences they'd never studied. Classical training in *how to think* transferred across all disciplines.

### H2: Classical Education with OpenEd

The revival of classical education has created a beautiful problem: families know what they want but can't always access or afford it. Private classical schools have limited enrollment. Complete curricula run hundreds to thousands per year. Quality Latin tutors charge $40-100 per hour. Even Classical Conversations communities, while more affordable, require significant investment.

OpenEd makes this accessible through three elements:

---

**Layout instruction:** Three equal-width columns below, each with icon/graphic at top

### [COLUMN 1]

**Access to Classical Resources**

Through OpenEd, families can access the secular classical resources they need:

- **Complete curricula** — Memoria Press, Veritas Press, Classical Academic Press packages
- **Latin and Greek** — From Song School Latin through advanced Lingua Latina
- **Logic and rhetoric** — The Art of Argument, Traditional Logic†, formal reasoning programs
- **Great Books** — D'Aulaires' mythology for young children through college-level primary sources
- **Community programs** — Classical Conversations† enrollment and materials
- **Private instruction** — Tutors for Latin, Greek, Socratic discussion, composition
- **Online academies** — Great Hearts Online courses (Flex Program or full enrollment)

You're not limited to one vendor or one approach. If your child thrives with *The Well-Trained Mind*'s structure, pursue that. If they need the community of Classical Conversations, join that. If you want to curate your own approach mixing resources, build that.

### [COLUMN 2]

**Flexibility to Fully Commit or Freely Blend**

Here's what matters: **You don't have to choose between classical purity and practical flexibility.**

Some families are devoted classicists. They want systematic Latin through translation of major works, formal logic beginning in middle school, and Great Books seminars as the centerpiece of education. OpenEd makes this possible.

Other families take what we call the "open classical" approach—mixing the best of the tradition with other methods:

- **Classical literature and history** paired with adaptive math software that meets children where they are
- **Latin study two days weekly** through a co-op, with project-based science the other days
- **Great Books discussions** combined with entrepreneurial mentorship and real-world business creation
- **Memory work from Classical Conversations** integrated with Charlotte Mason nature study and living books
- **Formal rhetoric training** applied to modern contexts—debate club, startup pitches, persuasive writing for actual audiences

OpenEd enables both paths equally. Your classical identity remains intact whether you're pursuing the gold standard of deep immersion in original languages or adapting classical principles to your child's unique journey.

### [COLUMN 3]

**Community Without Compromise**

One of classical education's great strengths—and challenges—is that it thrives in community. Socratic discussions require multiple perspectives. Latin is easier to sustain with peer accountability. Rhetoric develops through practice with real audiences. The multi-age classroom, with older students mentoring younger, creates natural teaching opportunities that deepen everyone's understanding.

OpenEd families connect through:
- **Local co-ops** meeting weekly for discussion, memory work, and presentations
- **Online Great Books seminars** where families across states wrestle with the same texts
- **Latin study circles** providing accountability and shared progression
- **Regional meetups** for debate competitions, recitations, and academic celebrations

You're not isolated. You're joining families who have discovered that open education and classical education aren't opposites—they're natural partners. Open education provides the framework and resources. Classical education provides the time-tested methods and content.

## SECTION 5: FAQ
**Layout:** Expandable/accordion format recommended

### H2: Common Questions About Classical Education with OpenEd

**Q: Can I keep my Classical identity while using OpenEd?**

Absolutely. OpenEd doesn't require you to change your educational philosophy or adopt a different approach. If you're committed to systematic classical education—Latin through high school, logic in middle school, Great Books seminars as the centerpiece—OpenEd makes this accessible. 

We exist to support the approach you choose, not to impose a different one. Think of us as infrastructure for educational freedom. You maintain complete control over curriculum selection, pacing, and methodology. Your classical identity stays fully intact.

---

**Q: What if I want to blend Classical with other approaches?**

This is the heart of open education. Many families find that classical principles work beautifully for literature and history while other methods serve better for math or science. Others attend Classical Conversations twice weekly and homeschool using different approaches the other days. Still others take individual Great Hearts Online courses while maintaining their own program for other subjects.

Common successful blends:
- Classical Conversations community + Singapore Math + Charlotte Mason nature study
- Latin through a tutor + Project-based science + Entrepreneurial mentorship
- Great Books discussions + Khan Academy math + Real-world apprenticeships
- Traditional Logic + Modern coding + Creative writing workshop

OpenEd enables whatever combination serves your child. The question isn't "Am I doing real classical education if I blend approaches?" The question is "What does my child need right now?" Classical education provides extraordinary tools for developing thinking and wisdom. Open education gives you permission to use those tools alongside anything else that works.

---

**Q: How do I know if Classical education is right for my child?**

Classical education particularly suits children who:
- Love stories and narrative learning
- Enjoy memorization, patterns, and songs (younger children)
- Ask "why?" constantly and love to debate (middle schoolers)
- Want to understand the "big picture" and how ideas connect across time
- Thrive with clear structure and progression
- Show interest in language, literature, or philosophy

But here's what matters more than any list of traits: Classical education works *because* it adapts to natural human development. The trivium isn't arbitrary—it matches how children actually learn. Young minds absorb eagerly. Developing minds question and analyze. Maturing minds synthesize and express.

If your child is curious about the world and you're willing to guide their journey through it, classical education provides a time-tested roadmap. The tradition is 2,000 years old because it consistently produces students who can think clearly, learn independently, and express themselves persuasively—skills that matter in any century, any career, any context.

---

**Q: Can we start Classical education at any age?**

Yes. You don't need to begin at age 5 with systematic memory work. Many families discover classical education when children are older. You can:

- Begin with great books and family discussions at any age
- Add Latin study in middle school or even high school
- Introduce logic when your child becomes naturally argumentative
- Start Great Books seminars in high school without prior classical training

The tradition is robust and accessible. A 14-year-old starting Latin will progress differently than a 7-year-old, but both can engage meaningfully with the language and what it unlocks. A family beginning classical education with a high schooler might focus on Great Books discussions and rhetoric rather than starting with grammar-stage memory work.

The tools of learning can be picked up at any point. The tradition waits for those ready to receive it, regardless of when they arrive.
