# Hero Section Options for Classical Education Page

## Current Structure
No H1 or subtitle—just body copy leading to CTA.

## OPTION 1: No Header (Current - RECOMMENDED)
**Why:** The body copy is strong and immediately speaks to the audience. Adding a header might slow the momentum. The phrase "Classical education is booming..." hooks practitioners immediately.

**Layout:** 
- Body copy (3 paragraphs)
- CTA button

**Pros:** 
- Clean, uncluttered
- Gets to the point immediately
- Classical families already know what they're looking for

---

## OPTION 2: Add H1 Only
**H1:** "Classical Education with Open Education"

**Layout:**
- H1
- Body copy (3 paragraphs)
- CTA button

**Pros:**
- Clear page title for SEO
- Establishes what page is about immediately

**Cons:**
- Might be redundant (page title already in nav/meta)
- Slows entry into compelling copy

---

## OPTION 3: H1 + Short Subtitle
**H1:** "Classical Education with Open Education"  
**Subtitle:** "Latin, Logic, Rhetoric—Made Accessible"

or

**H1:** "Classical Education with Open Education"  
**Subtitle:** "The Great Tradition Meets Educational Freedom"

**Layout:**
- H1
- Subtitle (smaller, lighter text)
- Body copy (3 paragraphs)
- CTA button

**Pros:**
- Immediately signals what's possible
- Good for scanners who don't read body copy

**Cons:**
- Adds extra layer before getting to the compelling narrative
- "Made Accessible" might sound like watering down

---

## OPTION 4: Bold Statement as "Header"
Use first sentence as oversized/bold header-style text:

**"Header" (oversized first sentence):** "The number of classical schools has doubled in the past decade."

**Then:** Body copy continues normally with rest of paragraph

**Layout:**
- First sentence large/bold (but not formal H1)
- Rest of body copy normal size
- CTA button

**Pros:**
- Immediate credibility/momentum
- Feels editorial, not marketing
- No additional words needed

**Cons:**
- Slightly unconventional structure

---

## RECOMMENDATION

**Keep Option 1 (No Header)** - The current approach works because:

1. **Classical families know what they're looking for** - They don't need "Classical Education with Open Education" explained in a header
2. **The opening line hooks immediately** - "Classical education is booming" speaks directly to the movement they're part of
3. **Clean and confident** - Not over-explaining matches classical education's ethos
4. **The body copy does the work** - Each paragraph builds the case naturally

**IF you must add something:**
Go with Option 4 (Bold Statement) - Make the first sentence larger/bolder to create visual hierarchy without adding marketing copy.

**Avoid:**
Option 3 (H1 + Subtitle) - Feels too "salesy" for classical audience. They're sophisticated and don't need taglines.

## For Comparison: Virtual School Hero
Virtual school might benefit MORE from a header because:
- More diverse audience (less defined community)
- "Virtual school" is broader term
- Might need: "Virtual School with Open Education" as H1

But Classical can be more confident/minimal because the audience is more defined.
