## HERO

**Layout:** Full-width hero with background image or simple header block

Virtual school enrollment has exploded—over 4 million K-12 students now learn primarily online. Families discovered they could learn from anywhere, set their own pace, and access resources beyond their local district. The promise was flexibility.

But most virtual schools deliver only location flexibility while maintaining curricular rigidity. You're assigned a curriculum. Required to attend synchronous classes. Locked into one platform. Can't easily blend online with real-world experiences. You got flexibility of *where* without flexibility of *how*.

OpenEd changes this. Through partnerships with innovative public schools, we make it possible to choose ANY virtual curriculum, set your own pace, and seamlessly blend digital learning with in-person experiences. This is virtual school with actual flexibility—not just a different location for the same constraints.

## What is Virtual School?

**Layout:** Standard content block

Virtual school means K-12 education delivered primarily through online platforms rather than traditional brick-and-mortar classrooms. Students complete coursework, interact with teachers, and progress through curriculum digitally—learning from home, while traveling, or anywhere with internet access.

The virtual school landscape includes several models:

**Full-Time Virtual Schools** — Students complete all coursework online, often with assigned teachers and structured schedules. These can be public (tuition-free) or private (tuition-based).

**Part-Time Virtual Learning** — Students take some courses online while attending traditional school or homeschooling. Common for accessing advanced courses, specialized subjects, or flexible scheduling.

**Asynchronous vs. Synchronous** — Asynchronous programs let students work at their own pace on their own schedule. Synchronous programs require attending live online classes at specific times.

**Self-Paced vs. Instructor-Led** — Some virtual schools provide curriculum for independent learning. Others include regular teacher interaction, assignments, and feedback.

Virtual school's promise: Learn from anywhere, access excellent curriculum regardless of location, move at your own pace, and customize your education. The reality varies dramatically depending on which type of virtual school you choose.

## Virtual Public School

**Layout:** Content block with comparison table

Most states now offer free virtual public schools—statewide programs providing online education at no cost to families. Examples include Indiana's Hoosier Academies, Oregon's ORCA, Kansas Virtual Academy, and Minnesota's online programs.

**What Virtual Public Schools Typically Provide:**

✅ **Free tuition** — Publicly funded, no cost to families  
✅ **Assigned teachers** — Regular check-ins and progress monitoring  
✅ **Complete curriculum** — All subjects provided  
✅ **Official transcripts** — Recognized by colleges and universities  
✅ **Materials included** — Textbooks, supplies often shipped to homes

**Where Virtual Public Schools Often Fall Short:**

❌ **No curriculum choice** — You're assigned a specific curriculum, can't choose alternatives  
❌ **Mandatory synchronous classes** — Required attendance at specific times limits flexibility  
❌ **One-size-fits-all pacing** — Must keep up with class regardless of mastery or readiness  
❌ **Platform lock-in** — Can't switch to different programs even if it's not working  
❌ **Limited blending** — Difficult to integrate with co-ops, apprenticeships, or other approaches  
❌ **Restrictive policies** — Often can't participate in outside classes or dual enrollment easily

**Layout instruction:** Consider side-by-side comparison visual

### Traditional Virtual Public School vs. OpenEd Virtual Model

| **Feature** | **State Virtual Public School** | **OpenEd Virtual Model** |
|-------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Tuition** | Free | Free (publicly funded) |

| **Mix & Match** | ❌ Package deal | ✅✅ Complete freedom |
| **Blend In-Person** | ❌ Difficult | ✅✅ Fully integrated |
| **Premium Access** | ❌ No | ✅✅ Fully funded |

Virtual public schools serve families well when structure, assigned teachers, and complete packages work. OpenEd serves families who need actual flexibility—not just location independence, but curricular freedom and the ability to adapt as needs evolve.

## K-12 Virtual School

**Layout:** Content block with age-specific subsections

Virtual schooling works differently across developmental stages. Here's what K-12 virtual learning looks like in practice:

### Elementary Virtual School (K-5)

**What Works:** Short, engaging lessons with multimedia content. Hands-on activities mixed with screen time. Parent involvement supporting independent work.

**Common Approaches:**
- **Time4Learning** — Animated lessons, automated grading, self-paced
- **Khan Academy Kids** — Free, mastery-based, highly engaging for early grades
- **Outschool** — Live classes for enrichment, arts, STEM topics
- **Beast Academy** — Story-based math that makes elementary students problem-solvers

**Key Consideration:** Balance screen time with physical activity, hands-on learning, and social interaction. Virtual works best as tool alongside real-world exploration.

### Middle School Virtual Learning (6-8)

**What Works:** Greater independence with regular check-ins. Subject-specific courses from specialized instructors. Flexibility to pursue interests deeply.

**Common Approaches:**
- **Complete programs** (Time4Learning, K12) providing all subjects
- **Subject-specific platforms** — Beast Academy/AoPS for math, IEW for writing
- **Outschool** specialized courses in coding, creative writing, sciences
- **Co-op blending** — Virtual for core subjects, in-person for labs and projects

**Key Consideration:** Middle schoolers need social connection. Blend virtual academics with in-person co-ops, sports, clubs, or group projects.

### High School Virtual Learning (9-12)

**What Works:** Self-directed learning with support. Access to advanced courses. Flexibility for work, athletics, or college prep.

**Common Approaches:**
- **Connections Academy, K12** — Full programs with transcripts
- **Dual enrollment** — Community college courses for high school and college credit
- **AP courses online** — Access advanced placement beyond local offerings
- **Specialized platforms** — Codecademy for programming, Coursera for college-level courses
- **Blended approach** — Virtual core + apprenticeships + real-world projects

**Key Consideration:** Transcript management, credit requirements, college preparation, and social opportunities all need planning.

Through OpenEd, access any combination that serves your student—complete virtual programs, subject-specific courses, live classes, or custom blends adapting to each child's needs across all grade levels.

## Considerations for Virtual High School

**Layout:** Content block

Virtual high school opens opportunities traditional schools can't match—but requires strategic planning:

### Credits and Transcripts

**Know your requirements:** Most states require specific credits for graduation. Track carefully.

**Official transcripts:** Many virtual programs (Connections Academy, K12, Oak Meadow) provide recognized transcripts. For custom approaches, document learning and create transcripts with advisor support.

**Dual enrollment advantage:** Community college courses often provide both high school and transferable college credit—accelerating progress and reducing future costs.

### College Preparation

**Testing still matters:** SAT, ACT, and AP exams provide standardized validation of learning regardless of school model.

**Portfolio building:** Virtual learning enables deep projects, research, and real-world work that make college applications stand out.

**Counseling support:** OpenEd advisors help navigate college applications, essay writing, and showcasing non-traditional learning.

### Lab Sciences

**Virtual lab simulations:** Labster and other platforms provide high-quality virtual labs meeting requirements.

**Community college labs:** Dual enrollment courses include in-person lab components.

**Co-op partnerships:** Local homeschool co-ops often offer lab science courses.

### Social Opportunities

Virtual doesn't mean isolated:
- **School clubs and activities** — Many virtual schools offer clubs, student government, events
- **Community involvement** — Sports leagues, theater, volunteer work, part-time jobs
- **Co-op participation** — Weekly gatherings for labs, discussions, and group projects
- **Online communities** — Discord groups, gaming communities, interest-based connections

### Flexibility for Life Goals

Virtual high school particularly serves students who:
- Compete in athletics requiring travel and flexible training schedules
- Pursue performing arts, competitive gaming, entrepreneurship, or other demanding passions
- Need to work part-time to support themselves or families
- Have health challenges making traditional attendance difficult
- Want to accelerate graduation or pursue college credit simultaneously

Through OpenEd, access virtual high school options that provide official credentials while maintaining flexibility for real-world pursuits.

## Virtual Schools by State

**Layout:** Content block with expandable state sections

Virtual school availability and quality varies significantly by state. Here's what you should know:

### Understanding State Virtual School Programs

Most states now offer statewide virtual public schools, but they differ dramatically in flexibility, curriculum, and support. Common state programs include:

- Full-time virtual academies (K12, Connections Academy franchises)
- State-run virtual schools operated by education departments
- District-level online programs serving specific counties
- Hybrid programs blending online and in-person learning

**Layout instruction:** Consider expandable sections for each state

### Indiana Virtual School

Indiana offers several virtual options including Hoosier Academies (K12 program) and Indiana Connections Academy. These provide free virtual education but typically require assigned curriculum and synchronous attendance.

**OpenEd advantage:** Indiana families can access ANY virtual curriculum through OpenEd partnerships, not just state-assigned programs. Choose platforms that actually fit your child while maintaining public funding.

### Kansas Virtual School

Kansas offers virtual programs through districts and statewide networks. Availability varies by district residency.

**OpenEd advantage:** Kansas families through OpenEd partnerships access premium platforms like Outschool, specialized math programs, live classes, and can blend virtual with in-person co-ops seamlessly.

### Oregon Virtual School

Oregon offers ORCA (Oregon Connections Academy) and district-based virtual options. Traditional virtual programs assign curriculum with limited flexibility.

**OpenEd advantage:** Oregon families can choose their virtual approach—complete programs, subject-specific courses, live classes, or custom combinations—with full support.

### Arkansas Virtual School

Arkansas Virtual Academy and district programs provide virtual options with varying levels of structure and support.

**OpenEd advantage:** Arkansas families access complete virtual curriculum freedom, blending online learning with in-person experiences as needed.

### Minnesota Virtual School

Minnesota offers multiple virtual options including statewide programs and district-based solutions.

**OpenEd advantage:** Minnesota families through OpenEd choose platforms and approaches rather than accepting assigned programs.

### Montana Virtual School

Montana provides virtual options through districts, though availability is more limited given rural geography.

**OpenEd advantage:** Montana families gain access to premium virtual platforms and specialized courses often unavailable through state programs.

**Key Pattern:** State virtual schools exist and serve some families well. But they typically assign curriculum, require attendance, and limit flexibility. OpenEd enables virtual learning with actual freedom—choose your curriculum, set your pace, blend approaches, change what's not working.
