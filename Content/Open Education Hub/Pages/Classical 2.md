# A Guide to Classical Education with OpenEd

In 1947, British scholar Dorothy Sayers delivered a lecture titled "The Lost Tools of Learning," reigniting an educational tradition that had produced many of history’s greatest thinkers. She identified a powerful pattern: for over two thousand years, Western civilization transmitted wisdom by teaching students to master language before logic, and logic before rhetoric. It was an integrated approach that worked.

Today, that tradition is experiencing a remarkable revival. The number of classical schools has doubled in the past decade, and homeschoolers are at the forefront, creating hybrid approaches that combine online courses, local co-ops, and traditional curricula. This mixing and matching—of old and new, in-person and online—is the heart of open education. It’s a recognition that you don't need to enroll in a specific school or commit to a rigid program to access timeless wisdom.

## What is Classical Education?

Classical education spans millennia but maintains consistent principles. It begins with the ancient Greek _artes liberales_—the "liberating arts" that free the mind for independent thought—and follows a developmental progression, often called the trivium:

- **Grammar Stage (Elementary):** Young children who love to memorize and chant absorb facts and build foundational knowledge.
- **Logic Stage (Middle School):** Students who love to argue and question learn to analyze arguments and think systematically.
- **Rhetoric Stage (High School):** Teenagers ready for self-expression synthesize knowledge and communicate persuasively.

It is a commitment to engaging directly with the Western tradition, reading original sources, integrating subjects around history, and prioritizing wisdom and virtue. This approach aligns perfectly with open education, which trusts that education should adapt to the child, not the other way around.

## Benefits and Evidence of a Classical Approach

Research reveals striking outcomes for students in a classical environment. Studies consistently show classical students scoring in the 80th percentile or higher on standardized tests, but the deeper transformation goes beyond test scores.

Dr. Roger La Marca of [Great Hearts Online](https://greatheartsonline.org/) explains: "Paradoxically, it's not by prepping kids for the test that they achieve the best scores; it's by teaching them to learn so they pursue knowledge on their own. A very high percentage of our graduates end up in science, technology, engineering, and medical fields because we teach them logic, rhetoric, reading, and grammar."

Historical evidence supports this. In 19th-century Germany, students from humanistic schools (emphasizing Latin, Greek, and literature) consistently outperformed students from science-focused "real schools" (_Realschule_) at universities—even in the sciences they'd never formally studied. The classical training in _how to think_ transferred across all disciplines.

Classical education develops:

- **Mental discipline** through memorization and language study.
- **Critical thinking** through formal logic and Socratic discussion.
- **Cultural literacy** through engagement with foundational texts.
- **Expression skills** through rhetoric and composition.
- **Character formation** through exposure to virtue in literature.

It produces not just smart students but wise ones—capable of discerning truth, articulating positions, and contributing meaningfully to society.

## Elementary Years: Building Foundations (The Grammar Stage)

The grammar stage (roughly ages 5-12) capitalizes on children's natural ability to absorb information. This is the "poll-parrot" stage, where young minds delight in patterns, songs, and stories. Classical education harnesses this through memory work, often using resources from [Classical Conversations](https://classicalconversations.com/) or [Memoria Press](https://www.memoriapress.com/) to build a rich mental "furniture" of facts, dates, and vocabulary.

This stage is perfect for blending approaches, a core principle of Open Education. A typical day might include:

- **Morning memory work** from a classical curriculum.
- A gentle introduction to Latin through a fun, song-based program like [**Song School Latin**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://classicalacademicpress.com/collections/school-latin).
- Learning history as an epic narrative with [_**Story of the World**_](https://www.amazon.com/Story-World-Vol-Publisher-Peace/dp/B004VG5RPC).
- Building a deep conceptual understanding of math using the hands-on, visual methods of [**Singapore Math**](https://www.singaporemath.com/).
- Ending the day with nature study and classic literature, inspired by the Charlotte Mason method.

## Middle School: Learning to Think (The Logic Stage)

The logic stage (roughly ages 12-14) marks a shift from absorbing facts to analyzing relationships. As students naturally become more argumentative (the "pert" stage), classical education channels this into formal reasoning. Formal logic becomes a central subject, where students learn to identify fallacies and construct valid arguments using curricula like [_**The Art of Argument**_](https://classicalacademicpress.com/products/the-art-of-argument-revised-student-edition).

With the flexibility of Open Education, you can create a powerful, integrated curriculum. For instance, you could:

- Pair a formal logic course with a subscription to [**Generation Genius**](https://www.generationgenius.com/) or [**Mystery Science**](https://mysteryscience.com/), challenging your child to apply principles of valid reasoning to the scientific method.
- Deepen Latin studies with an immersive reading program like [_**Lingua Latina per se Illustrata**_](https://www.hackettpublishing.com/lingua-latina-per-se-illustrata-series) while also exploring modern coding languages, seeing how both require systematic thinking.
- Integrate subject matter by studying the Middle Ages through its literature, architecture, and scholastic philosophy.

## High School: Finding Your Voice (The Rhetoric Stage)

The rhetoric stage (roughly ages 15-18) synthesizes everything learned into original, persuasive, and beautiful expression (the "poetic" stage). Students move from analyzing others' arguments to constructing their own. Original sources replace textbooks entirely. Students read Plato's dialogues, not summaries of Plato.

Open Education allows high schoolers to become the true architects of their learning. A student's week might involve:

- Participating in a Socratic Great Books seminar through [**Great Hearts Online**](https://greatheartsonline.org/).
- Honing persuasive essays using a modern composition curriculum like the [**Institute for Excellence in Writing (IEW)**](https://iew.com/).
- Taking dual enrollment courses at a local community college for advanced STEM subjects.
- Pursuing a real-world apprenticeship that applies their well-honed critical thinking skills to a modern field.

# Classical Education: Understanding the Model and Approach

In 1947, British scholar Dorothy Sayers delivered a lecture that would reignite an educational tradition dormant for decades. In "The Lost Tools of Learning," she argued that modern education had abandoned the very methods that produced history's greatest thinkers—from Aristotle to Aquinas, Newton to Jefferson.

She wasn't calling for nostalgia. She was identifying a pattern: for over two thousand years, Western civilization transmitted wisdom through a specific approach to learning. Students mastered language before logic, logic before rhetoric. They read original sources rather than textbooks. They integrated subjects rather than fragmenting them. And it worked.

Today, classical education is experiencing a remarkable revival. The number of classical schools has doubled in the past decade. Through open education, families are creating their own classical paths—hiring Latin tutors online, joining homeschool co-ops for Socratic seminars, taking [Great Hearts Online](https://greatheartsonline.org/) courses, or simply beginning with great books and family discussions.

## What is Classical Education?

Classical education spans millennia but maintains consistent principles. Ancient Greeks pioneered the _artes liberales_—the liberating arts that free the mind for independent thought. Medieval schools organized these into the trivium (grammar, logic, rhetoric) and quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy). Renaissance humanists integrated classical languages as the medium of all learning.

The modern revival, sparked by Sayers and developed by educators like Susan Wise Bauer, typically follows this progression:

- **Grammar Stage (Elementary):** Children absorb facts and build foundational knowledge through memorization and repetition
- **Logic Stage (Middle School):** Students learn to analyze arguments, identify fallacies, and think systematically
- **Rhetoric Stage (High School):** Young adults synthesize knowledge and express themselves persuasively

But classical education is more than stages. It's a commitment to engaging directly with the Western tradition—reading Homer rather than summaries of Homer, studying Latin to access original texts, tracing ideas from their ancient origins through their modern expressions.

This naturally aligns with open education principles. Just as open education insists that children are unique individuals who learn differently, classical education has always adapted to the student. Renaissance tutors didn't force all students through identical curricula—they observed each pupil's aptitudes and adjusted accordingly.

## Classical Education Model

The classical model structures learning around developmental readiness. Dorothy Sayers coined memorable terms for these stages:

- **"Poll-parrot" stage:** Young children who love to memorize and chant
- **"Pert" stage:** Middle schoolers who love to argue and question
- **"Poetic" stage:** Teenagers ready to express themselves creatively

Each stage builds on the previous, creating a spiral of deepening understanding. A child might memorize Latin vocabulary in elementary school, analyze Latin grammar in middle school, and translate Virgil in high school.

The model emphasizes:

- **Integration:** All subjects connect through history as the organizing principle
- **Primary sources:** Original texts over textbooks whenever possible
- **Socratic discussion:** Questions that lead students to discover truth
- **Virtue formation:** Character development through exposure to noble examples

## Classical Education vs Modern Education

The contrast between classical and modern approaches reveals fundamental differences in educational philosophy.

**Modern education** typically:

- Fragments knowledge into disconnected subjects
- Prioritizes current relevance over timeless wisdom
- Measures success through standardized testing
- Values practical skills over intellectual development
- Changes methods frequently based on trends

**Classical education** instead:

- Integrates all learning around core ideas
- Studies the permanent things that shape civilization
- Measures success through demonstrated mastery
- Develops the whole person—mind, body, and character
- Maintains proven methods refined over centuries

Historical evidence supports classical education's effectiveness. In 19th-century Germany, students from humanistic schools (emphasizing Latin, Greek, and literature) consistently outperformed "real school" (_Realschule_) students at universities—even in sciences they'd never formally studied. The classical training in how to think transferred across disciplines.

## Classical Education and Homeschooling

Classical education naturally suits homeschooling. The historical model relied on personal tutoring, adapted pacing, and deep engagement with texts—exactly what homeschool families can provide.

Popular homeschool approaches include:

[**The Well-Trained Mind**](https://welltrainedmind.com/) method by Susan Wise Bauer provides comprehensive guidance for implementing classical education at home, with detailed book lists and teaching strategies for each stage.

[**Classical Conversations**](https://www.classicalconversationsbooks.com/) offers community-based programs where families meet weekly for memory work, discussions, and presentations while completing assignments at home.

**Charlotte Mason** classical fusion combines classical content with Mason's emphasis on living books, nature study, and short lessons—proving that classical principles can blend with other approaches.

The flexibility of homeschooling allows families to:

- Adjust pacing to each child's readiness
- Spend months on topics that capture interest
- Include or exclude religious content as desired
- Mix classical elements with modern resources
- Start classical education at any age

# Classical Education with OpenEd

In 1947, British scholar Dorothy Sayers delivered a lecture that would reignite an educational tradition dormant for decades.

Today, classical education is experiencing a remarkable revival. The number of classical schools has doubled in the past decade. But here's what makes this moment unique: you don't need to enroll in a specific school or commit to a rigid program. Through open education, families are creating their own classical paths—hiring Latin tutors online, joining [Classical Conversations](https://classicalconversations.com/) co-ops, taking [Great Hearts Online](https://greatheartsonline.org/) courses, or simply beginning with great books and family discussions.

This flexibility isn't a dilution of classical education—it's a return to its roots. The humanistic schools of the Renaissance operated through personal tutoring, adapted pacing, and deep engagement with texts. Modern families are recreating these conditions, not through wealth or privilege, but through the tools and networks of open education.

## Defining Classical Education Method

Classical education resists simple definition because it spans millennia. Ancient Greeks pioneered the _artes liberales_—the liberating arts that free the mind for independent thought. Medieval schools organized these into the trivium (grammar, logic, rhetoric) and quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy). Renaissance humanists integrated classical languages as the medium of all learning.

The modern revival, sparked by Sayers and developed by educators like Susan Wise Bauer, typically follows this progression:

- **Grammar Stage (Elementary):** Children absorb facts and build foundational knowledge through memorization and repetition
- **Logic Stage (Middle School):** Students learn to analyze arguments, identify fallacies, and think systematically
- **Rhetoric Stage (High School):** Young adults synthesize knowledge and express themselves persuasively

But classical education is more than stages. It's a commitment to engaging directly with the Western tradition—reading Homer rather than summaries of Homer, studying Latin to access original texts, tracing ideas from their ancient origins through their modern expressions.

This naturally aligns with open education principles. Just as open education insists that children are unique individuals who learn differently, classical education has always adapted to the student. Renaissance tutors didn't force all students through identical curricula—they observed each pupil's aptitudes and adjusted accordingly. Modern families do the same, perhaps emphasizing languages for one child and Great Books for another.

The key insight is that classical education isn't a rigid system but a living tradition. You can start with [Song School Latin](https://classicalacademicpress.com/collections/song-school-latin) and children's mythology, add logic puzzles in middle school, or jump straight into reading classics together. The tradition is robust enough to meet you where you are.

## Benefits of Classical Education

Research on classical education reveals striking outcomes. Studies from the [Association of Classical Christian Schools](https://classicalchristian.org/) show classical students scoring in the 80th percentile or higher on standardized tests, compared to the 50th percentile average. But standardized tests miss the deeper transformation.

Dr. Roger La Marca of Great Hearts Online explains: "Paradoxically, it's not by prepping kids for the test that they achieve the best scores; it's by teaching them to learn so they pursue knowledge on their own. A very high percentage of our graduates end up in science, technology, engineering, and medical fields because we teach them logic, rhetoric, reading, and grammar."

Historical evidence supports this. In 19th-century Germany, students from humanistic schools (emphasizing Latin, Greek, and literature) consistently outperformed "real school" (_Realschule_) students at universities—even in the sciences they'd never formally studied. The classical training in how to think transferred across disciplines.

These benefits mirror what open education seeks: students who can adapt to any challenge, learn independently, and integrate knowledge across domains. Classical education develops:

- **Mental discipline** through memorization and language study
- **Critical thinking** through formal logic and Socratic discussion
- **Cultural literacy** through engagement with foundational texts
- **Expression skills** through rhetoric and composition
- **Character formation** through exposure to virtue and vice in literature

The classical approach produces not just smart students but wise ones—capable of discerning truth, articulating positions, and contributing meaningfully to society.

## Classical Education with OpenEd

Traditional classical schools charge premium tuition. Complete homeschool curricula require significant investment. Private Latin tutors command high hourly rates. For many families, classical education seemed financially out of reach.

OpenEd changes this. Through partnerships with public schools, OpenEd provides funding that makes classical education accessible to all families. Every secular classical resource—from Latin programs to logic curricula to Great Books sets—is 100% reimbursable.

But OpenEd offers something more valuable than funding: flexibility. Classical education through OpenEd means:

- Taking individual [Great Hearts Online](https://greatheartsonline.org/flex-program/) courses without full enrollment
- Joining [Classical Conversations](https://classicalconversations.com/) for community while maintaining your own pace
- Hiring online Latin tutors from the [Paideia Institute](https://www.paideiainstitute.org/)
- Mixing classical elements with other approaches—perhaps Saxon Math with classical literature
- Starting small with library books and expanding as interests develop

This flexibility honors both classical and open education principles. You're not locked into one curriculum or timeline. You can emphasize what resonates with your family—whether that's intensive Latin study, Great Books discussions, or classical approaches to history and literature.

## Classical Education for Elementary School

The grammar stage (roughly ages 5-12) capitalizes on children's natural ability to absorb information. Young minds delight in patterns, songs, and stories. Classical education harnesses this through:

Memory work becomes the foundation. Children memorize math facts, historical dates, Latin vocabulary, and poetry—not as rote drudgery but through songs, chants, and games. This creates mental "furniture" that later thinking can arrange and rearrange.

Latin begins early, often through programs like [Song School Latin](https://classicalacademicpress.com/collections/song-school-latin) or [Prima Latina](https://www.memoriapress.com/curriculum/latin/prima-latina/). Children aren't expected to translate Virgil—they're building familiarity with the language that underlies half of English vocabulary.

History follows chronological progression, often using resources like [Story of the World](https://welltrainedmind.com/) or the [Famous Men](https://www.memoriapress.com/curriculum/classical-studies/) series. Children learn history as narrative, following humanity's story from ancient times to present.

Open education families might blend these classical elements with other approaches:

- Morning memory work from Classical Conversations
- Afternoon nature study from Charlotte Mason
- Evening read-alouds from classic literature
- Weekend projects integrating week's learning

## Classical Education for Middle School

The logic stage (roughly ages 12-14) marks a shift from absorbing facts to analyzing relationships. Students naturally become argumentative—classical education channels this into formal reasoning.

Formal logic becomes central through resources like [The Art of Argument](https://classicalacademicpress.com/products/the-art-of-argument-revised-student-edition) or [Traditional Logic](https://www.memoriapress.com/curriculum/logic-and-rhetoric/traditional-logic-i/). Students learn to identify fallacies, construct valid arguments, and think systematically.

Latin progresses to translation. Programs like [Latin for Children](https://classicalacademicpress.com/collections/latin-for-children) or [Lingua Latina](https://www.hackettpublishing.com/lingua-latina-per-se-illustrata-series) move students from vocabulary to actual reading of classical texts.

Subject integration deepens. When studying the Middle Ages, students read medieval literature, examine Gothic architecture, explore scholastic philosophy, and trace mathematical developments. Every subject illuminates the others.

Many families find this stage ideal for mixing approaches:

- Classical logic training with modern science curriculum
- Latin study alongside coding languages
- Great Books discussions combined with current events analysis

## Classical Education for High School

The rhetoric stage (roughly ages 15-18) synthesizes everything learned into original expression. Students move from analyzing others' arguments to constructing their own.

Rhetoric and composition become central through programs like the [Institute for Excellence in Writing](https://iew.com/) or classical rhetoric texts. Students learn not just to write correctly but persuasively, adapting their message to their audience.

Original sources replace textbooks entirely. Students read Plato's dialogues, not summaries of Plato. They work through Euclid's proofs, not modern geometry textbooks. They engage directly with the tradition they've been preparing to join.

Great Books seminars, whether through [Great Hearts Online](https://greatheartsonline.org/), local co-ops, or family discussions, become the centerpiece. Students wrestle with life's biggest questions through humanity's greatest texts.

Open education families at this stage often blend classical foundations with modern opportunities:

- Dual enrollment for STEM subjects while maintaining classical humanities
- Online tutorials with classical scholars worldwide
- Apprenticeships that apply classical learning to modern fields
- Gap year programs like Paideia Institute's [Living Latin in Rome](https://www.paideiainstitute.org/)

## Classical Curriculum

Classical curriculum isn't a fixed canon but a living tradition you can enter at any point. Open education families use these resources as tools, adapting them to their children's needs:

# V2 - Classical Education with OpenEd

In 1947, British scholar Dorothy Sayers delivered a lecture that would reignite an educational tradition dormant for decades. In "The Lost Tools of Learning," she argued that modern education had abandoned the very methods that produced history's greatest thinkers—from Aristotle to Aquinas, Newton to Jefferson.

She wasn't calling for nostalgia. She was identifying a pattern: for over two thousand years, Western civilization transmitted wisdom through a specific approach to learning. Students mastered language before logic, logic before rhetoric. They read original sources rather than textbooks. They integrated subjects rather than fragmenting them. And it worked.

Today, classical education is experiencing a remarkable revival. The number of classical schools has doubled in the past decade. But here's what makes this moment unique: through open education, families are creating their own classical paths—hiring Latin tutors online, joining homeschool co-ops for Socratic seminars, taking Great Hearts Online courses, or simply beginning with great books and family discussions.

## What is Classical Education?

Classical education spans millennia but maintains consistent principles. Ancient Greeks pioneered the _artes liberales_—the liberating arts that free the mind for independent thought. Medieval schools organized these into the trivium (grammar, logic, rhetoric) and quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy). Renaissance humanists integrated classical languages as the medium of all learning.

The modern revival structures learning around developmental readiness. Dorothy Sayers coined memorable terms for these stages:

- **"Poll-parrot" stage (Elementary):** Young children who love to memorize and chant absorb facts and build foundational knowledge
- **"Pert" stage (Middle School):** Students who love to argue and question learn to analyze arguments and think systematically
- **"Poetic" stage (High School):** Teenagers ready for self-expression synthesize knowledge and communicate persuasively

But classical education is more than stages. It's a commitment to engaging directly with the Western tradition—reading Homer rather than summaries of Homer, studying Latin to access original texts, tracing ideas from their ancient origins through their modern expressions. The model emphasizes integration of all subjects through history, primary sources over textbooks, Socratic discussion that leads students to discover truth, and character development through exposure to noble examples.

This naturally aligns with open education principles. Just as open education insists that children are unique individuals who learn differently, classical education has always adapted to the student. Renaissance tutors didn't force all students through identical curricula—they observed each pupil's aptitudes and adjusted accordingly.

## Benefits and Evidence

Research reveals striking outcomes. Studies show classical students scoring in the 80th percentile or higher on standardized tests, compared to the 50th percentile average. But standardized tests miss the deeper transformation.

Dr. Roger La Marca of Great Hearts Online explains: "Paradoxically, it's not by prepping kids for the test that they achieve the best scores; it's by teaching them to learn so they pursue knowledge on their own. A very high percentage of our graduates end up in science, technology, engineering, and medical fields because we teach them logic, rhetoric, reading, and grammar."

Historical evidence supports this. In 19th-century Germany, students from humanistic schools (emphasizing Latin, Greek, and literature) consistently outperformed "real school" (_Realschule_) students at universities—even in sciences they'd never formally studied. The classical training in how to think transferred across disciplines.

Classical education develops mental discipline through memorization and language study, critical thinking through formal logic and Socratic discussion, cultural literacy through foundational texts, expression skills through rhetoric and composition, and character formation through exposure to virtue in literature. It produces not just smart students but wise ones—capable of discerning truth, articulating positions, and contributing meaningfully to society.

## Elementary Years: Building Foundations

The grammar stage (roughly ages 5-12) capitalizes on children's natural ability to absorb information. Young minds delight in patterns, songs, and stories. Classical education harnesses this through memory work that becomes the foundation—children memorize math facts, historical dates, Latin vocabulary, and poetry through songs, chants, and games. This creates mental "furniture" that later thinking can arrange and rearrange.

Latin begins early, often through programs like Song School Latin or Prima Latina. Children aren't expected to translate Virgil—they're building familiarity with the language that underlies half of English vocabulary. History follows chronological progression using resources like Story of the World, as children learn history as narrative, following humanity's story from ancient times to present.

Open education families might blend classical elements with other approaches: morning memory work from Classical Conversations, afternoon nature study from Charlotte Mason, evening read-alouds from classic literature, weekend projects integrating the week's learning.

## Middle School: Learning to Think

The logic stage (roughly ages 12-14) marks a shift from absorbing facts to analyzing relationships. Students naturally become argumentative—classical education channels this into formal reasoning.

Formal logic becomes central through resources like The Art of Argument or Traditional Logic. Students learn to identify fallacies, construct valid arguments, and think systematically. Latin progresses to translation through programs like Latin for Children or Lingua Latina. Subject integration deepens—when studying the Middle Ages, students read medieval literature, examine Gothic architecture, explore scholastic philosophy, and trace mathematical developments.

Many families find this stage ideal for mixing approaches: classical logic training with modern science curriculum, Latin study alongside coding languages, Great Books discussions combined with current events analysis.

## High School: Finding Voice

The rhetoric stage (roughly ages 15-18) synthesizes everything learned into original expression. Students move from analyzing others' arguments to constructing their own.

Rhetoric and composition become central through programs like Lost Tools of Writing. Students learn not just to write correctly but persuasively, adapting their message to their audience. Original sources replace textbooks entirely—students read Plato's dialogues, not summaries of Plato. They work through Euclid's proofs, not modern geometry textbooks.

Great Books seminars become the centerpiece. Students wrestle with life's biggest questions through humanity's greatest texts. Open education families often blend classical foundations with modern opportunities: dual enrollment for STEM while maintaining classical humanities, online tutorials with classical scholars worldwide, apprenticeships that apply classical learning to modern fields.

## Classical Curriculum Resources

Classical curriculum provides structure while allowing customization. For beginning families, start with mythology books and library classics, add simple Latin like Song School Latin, include memory work independently or through co-ops, and begin logic with puzzles and critical thinking games.

**Core Resources by Stage:**

Grammar Stage: First Language Lessons for grammar, Story of the World for history, Singapore or Saxon Math, classic children's literature

Logic Stage: The Art of Argument for informal logic, Traditional Logic for formal logic, primary historical sources, Teaching the Classics for literature

Rhetoric Stage: Lost Tools of Writing for composition, Lingua Latina for advanced Latin, Great Books discussions, Rhetoric Alive! for persuasive speaking

Complete programs like Memoria Press, Veritas Press, and Great Hearts Online offer comprehensive curricula, while families can also create hybrid approaches mixing classical elements with modern resources.

## Classical Education with OpenEd

Classical education has traditionally been expensive—private classical schools charge premium tuition, complete curricula require significant investment, and Latin tutors command high hourly rates. OpenEd changes this completely.

Through partnerships with public schools, OpenEd provides funding that makes classical education accessible to all families. Every secular classical resource—from Latin programs to logic curricula to Great Books sets—is 100% reimbursable.

But OpenEd offers something more valuable than funding: flexibility. Classical education through OpenEd means taking individual Great Hearts Online courses without full enrollment, joining Classical Conversations for community while maintaining your own pace, hiring online tutors from the Paideia Institute, mixing classical elements with other approaches, or starting small with library books and expanding as interests develop.

You're not locked into one curriculum or timeline. You can emphasize what resonates with your family—whether that's intensive Latin study, Great Books discussions, or classical approaches to specific subjects. This flexibility honors both classical and open education principles, proving that the education which shaped Western civilization shouldn't be reserved for the privileged few.

# V1 - Classical Education with OpenEd: Fund Your Journey Through the Great Tradition

Classical education is experiencing a remarkable revival, with the number of classical schools doubling in the past decade. But you don't need to enroll in a specific school or commit to a rigid program to give your child a classical education.

Through OpenEd, families can access funding and support to pursue classical education however it fits their lives—whether that's hiring Latin tutors, purchasing Great Books curricula, joining Classical Conversations co-ops, or mixing classical approaches with modern resources.

## What is Classical Education?

Classical education emphasizes the "liberating arts" that free the mind for independent thought. Modern classical education typically follows Dorothy Sayers' interpretation of the medieval trivium:

- **Grammar Stage (Elementary):** Young children absorb facts and memorize foundational knowledge
- **Logic Stage (Middle School):** Students learn to analyze arguments and think critically
- **Rhetoric Stage (High School):** Teenagers express themselves persuasively and originally

What unifies classical education is respect for Western tradition, integrated learning across subjects, and emphasis on original sources over textbooks. But here's the key: there's no single "right way" to do classical education, which makes OpenEd's flexible funding model perfect for families pursuing this path.
