The barrier: Private classical schools cost $8K-15K/year. Going solo means limited resources and isolation.

**The solution:** OpenEd provides funding + flexibility + community. Full classical immersion OR blend with other approaches. Your choice, fully funded.

## ❓ SECTION 4: FAQ
**Length:** 350 words | **SEO H2:** "Common Questions About Classical Education with OpenEd"

### Questions to Address

**Q: Can I keep my Classical identity while using OpenEd?**
A: Absolutely. OpenEd funds the approach you choose. If you want systematic Latin through high school, logic in middle school, Great Books as centerpiece—we fund this completely. We support your philosophy, not vice versa.

**Q: What if I want to blend Classical with other approaches?**
A: That's open education. Many families use classical for literature/history with different methods for math/science. Others attend Classical Conversations twice weekly and homeschool the rest. Others take individual Great Hearts Online courses. OpenEd funds whatever combination serves your child.

**Q: What if I'm not in an OpenEd state?**
A: You can still:
- Explore classical resources through our guides
- Read the *Open Education* book
- Join our newsletter for support/community
- Connect with families embracing educational freedom

We're working to expand to additional states.

**Q: How do I know if Classical education is right for my child?**
A: Classical education particularly suits children who:
- Love stories and narrative learning
- Enjoy memorization/patterns (younger)
- Ask "why?" constantly (middle schoolers)
- Want to understand how ideas connect
- Thrive with structure and clear progression

But here's what matters: The trivium matches natural development. If your child is curious and you're willing to guide, classical education provides a time-tested roadmap.

**Q: Can we start Classical education at any age?**
A: Yes. Begin with great books and discussions. Add Latin when interest emerges. Introduce logic in middle school. Start Great Books seminars in high school. The tradition meets you wherever you are.
