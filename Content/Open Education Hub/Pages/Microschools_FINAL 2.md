## HERO

**Layout:** Full-width hero with background image or simple header block

Microschools are redefining what "going to school" means. With typically 5-15 students in mixed-age groups, meeting in homes or community spaces, they combine the personalization of homeschooling with the community of traditional school.

Most operate 2-3 days weekly, not five. They're facilitator-guided, not teacher-directed. They're designed for precision, not scale.

As education policy analyst Kerry McDonald observes, microschools are "collaboratives of homeschoolers where you can attend part-time or full-time...at a fraction of the cost of a traditional private school," making quality education "much more accessible to more families."

The challenge: Most microschools still require tuition. Families wanting to blend microschool community with home learning days need flexibility traditional structures don't provide.

OpenEd changes this. Through partnerships with innovative public schools, we make it possible to access microschool communities as part of a broader open education approach—attending when it serves your child, learning at home when that works better.

## Defining Microschools

**Layout:** Standard content block

Microschools resist simple definition because they're defined more by what they're not than what they are:

**Intentionally Small** — Typically 5-15 students, though some networks accommodate larger groups. Size matters less than the ability to know each student deeply and adapt to individual needs.

**Mixed-Age by Design** — An 8-year-old works alongside a 6-year-old and a 10-year-old. Older students mentor younger. Younger students observe and aspire. Everyone learns at their actual level, not their age-assigned grade.

**Facilitator-Guided** — Adults guide rather than instruct. They prepare environments, ask questions, connect students to resources, and step back. Students direct learning with adult support.

**Part-Time as Standard** — Most meet 2-3 days weekly, not five. Families blend microschool community days with home learning, creating flexibility traditional school can't offer.

**Radically Specific** — Each serves a precise niche: nature-based learning, Montessori in small groups, classical education community, project-based entrepreneurship, twice-exceptional learners.

Microschools prove you don't have to choose between personalization and community.

## Benefits of Microschools

**Layout:** Content block, consider pull quote or visual callout

Microschools deliver outcomes traditional schools struggle to achieve:

**True Personalization** — With 5-15 students and flexible structures, facilitators adapt daily to where each child actually is, not where age-based standards say they should be.

**Mixed-Age Learning** — Research consistently shows mixed-age environments benefit everyone. Younger children learn by observing. Older children deepen understanding by teaching. Natural mentorship develops that artificial grade levels prevent.

**Real-World Application** — Small size enables projects traditional classrooms can't accommodate—entrepreneurial ventures, community service, extended field research, apprenticeships with local experts.

**Reduced Social Stress** — Many families report children thrive socially in microschools after struggling in larger environments. Small groups make every child visible and valued.

**Family Flexibility** — Part-time schedules let families maintain control over education while accessing community and structure when it serves them.

**Educational Curation** — Microschool becomes one tool in your toolkit. Use it for collaboration and community while maintaining home days for self-paced academics, passion projects, or family travel.

## How to Join a Microschool

**Layout:** Content block

**Finding Local Microschools**

Microschools often operate semi-privately, shared through word-of-mouth. Search strategies:

- "[Your City] microschool" or "learning pod"
- Local homeschool Facebook groups and associations
- Homeschool co-ops with microschool-style programs
- Parent-run learning communities
- Regional educational freedom networks
- OpenEd advisors who know your area

**Evaluating Fit**

When you find options, consider:

- **Educational philosophy** — Does their approach align with your values?
- **Schedule flexibility** — Can you attend part-time or is full-time required?
- **Facilitator experience** — What's their background and training?
- **Student mix** — Will your child thrive in this age range and group dynamic?
- **Physical environment** — Is the space conducive to learning?
- **Cost and commitment** — What's required financially and time-wise?

**Making It Work with OpenEd**

Through OpenEd, access part-time microschool programs as part of your broader educational approach. Attend 2-3 days weekly while maintaining flexibility for home learning, online courses, or other approaches.

Microschool becomes one component of your open education plan, not the entirety. You get small-group, mixed-age community benefits without sacrificing flexibility.

## How to Start a Microschool

**Layout:** Content block

**The Founder Profile**

Most microschool founders tried reform first—years on committees, advocating for change within traditional systems. They're not entrepreneurs seeking opportunity; they're exhausted educators and parents who couldn't wait anymore.

**Support Networks**

Starting a microschool has become increasingly accessible:

- **Prenda** — Provides full curriculum, training, and support; no education degree needed
- **National Microschooling Center** — Resources, networking, and community connection
- **KaiPod Catalyst** — Two-year post-launch support for new microschools
- **State-specific incubators** — Several states now support new microschool development

**Minimum Viable Microschool**

You need less than you think:
- **8-12 families** committed to the vision
- **$40,000 annual budget** (varies by location and model)
- **Part-time schedule** (2-3 days weekly) reducing costs
- **Shared space** (church, community center, home) not permanent facility

**The Psychological Hurdle**

Starting a microschool requires letting go of what school "should" look like to discover what it could be. This isn't easy—especially for those who succeeded in traditional education—but it's the inflection point every founder faces.

## Online Microschools

**Layout:** Content block

The microschool concept is adapting to virtual environments, creating hybrid models blending online learning with in-person connection.

**KaiPod Learning** — Small groups gather in professional spaces with experienced Learning Coaches. Students use online curriculum of choice for core academics while receiving in-person support, enrichment, and peer collaboration. Combines digital tools with human connection.

**Prisma** — Project-based online microschool for middle schoolers. Small cohorts work on interdisciplinary projects with facilitator guidance. Fully virtual but maintains intimate community feel.

**Hybrid Models** — Many families create custom blends:
- Online curriculum for self-paced academics
- In-person microschool for collaboration and projects
- Virtual tutoring for specialized subjects
- Physical community for social connection

This isn't educational chaos—it's educational curation. Choosing the best tool for each purpose rather than forcing one model to serve all needs.

## Microschool Curriculum Ideas

**Layout:** Content block

The part-time nature of most microschools means families curate complete curriculum. Through OpenEd, access resources that complement microschool participation:

**Self-Paced Academics**
- **Math:** Beast Academy (story-based), Khan Academy (free adaptive), IXL (skill practice)
- **Reading/Writing:** Outschool live classes, local tutors, online writing workshops
- **Languages:** Private language tutors, Duolingo, Rosetta Stone

**Hands-On Enrichment**
- **STEM:** KiwiCo subscription boxes, science co-ops, maker spaces
- **Arts:** Local instructors, online art classes, community programs
- **Physical Education:** Sports leagues, martial arts, dance, outdoor recreation

**Project-Based Learning**
Many microschools center on projects and real-world application. Families supplement with specialized knowledge as projects require—learning coding to build apps, studying ecology for conservation projects, mastering marketing to launch ventures.

The microschool provides community and collaboration. Home days provide focused time for skill-building and passion pursuits.
