## SECTION 1: HERO
**Length:** 150 words

Classical education is booming—schools doubled in the past decade. Families want trivium over testing, Latin over lab prep, virtue over vocational training.

The barrier: Private classical schools cost $8K-15K/year. Going solo means limited resources and isolation.

**The solution:** OpenEd provides funding + flexibility + community. Full classical immersion OR blend with other approaches.

## SECTION 5: FAQ
**Length:** 350 words | **H2:** "Common Questions About Classical Education with OpenEd"

**Q: Can I keep my Classical identity while using OpenEd?**
A: Absolutely. OpenEd funds the approach you choose. Systematic Latin through high school, logic in middle school, Great Books centerpiece—we fund this completely. We support your philosophy, not vice versa.

**Q: What if I want to blend Classical with other approaches?**
A: That's open education. Use classical for literature/history with different methods for math/science. Attend Classical Conversations twice weekly and homeschool the rest. Take individual Great Hearts Online courses. OpenEd funds whatever combination serves your child.

**Q: What if I'm not in an OpenEd state?**
A: You can still explore classical resources through our guides, read the *Open Education* book, join our newsletter, and connect with families embracing educational freedom. We're working to expand.

**Q: How do I know if Classical education is right for my child?**
A: Particularly suits children who love stories/narrative learning, enjoy memorization/patterns (younger), ask "why?" constantly (middle schoolers), want to understand how ideas connect, thrive with structure and clear progression. But the trivium matches natural development—if your child is curious and you're willing to guide, classical education provides a time-tested roadmap.

**Q: Can we start Classical education at any age?**
A: Yes. Begin with great books and discussions. Add Latin when interest emerges. Introduce logic in middle school. Start Great Books seminars in high school. The tradition meets you wherever you are.
