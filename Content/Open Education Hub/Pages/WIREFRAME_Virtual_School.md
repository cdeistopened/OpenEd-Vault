### Hook + Problem + Solution
Virtual school enrollment has exploded—4 million K-12 students now learn primarily online. Families want flexibility, self-pacing, and location independence.

The problem: Most state virtual schools lock you into rigid curricula, mandatory synchronous classes, and limited course selection. You get flexibility of location but not flexibility of approach.

**The solution:** OpenEd provides funding to choose ANY virtual curriculum + blend with in-person experiences + adapt to your child's pace. Virtual school without the virtual limitations.

## 📚 SECTION 1: What is Virtual School?
**Length:** 300 words | **SEO H2:** "What is Virtual School?"

### Purpose
Define virtual schooling broadly, acknowledge state programs exist, pivot to OpenEd's more flexible model.

### Content Structure
**Opening:** Virtual school means different things to different families...

**Three Models:**

1. **Full-Time Virtual Public Schools** — State-run programs with set curricula, mandatory attendance, assigned teachers. Location flexible but schedule/curriculum rigid.

2. **Virtual Private Schools** — More curriculum choice, often expensive ($3K-10K/year), varying levels of support and structure.

3. **Hybrid Virtual Models** — The OpenEd approach: Choose your virtual curriculum, pace, and providers. Blend online and in-person. Adapt as needs change.

**Key Distinctions:**
- **Asynchronous vs. Synchronous** — Self-paced learning vs. scheduled live classes
- **Curriculum freedom** — Mandated lessons vs. choosing what works
- **Blending options** — Online-only vs. mixing digital and real-world
- **Support model** — Assigned teacher vs. advisor who helps you navigate choices

**Transition:** "Virtual school shouldn't mean choosing between flexibility and quality, between structure and freedom. OpenEd enables both."

## ❓ SECTION 5: FAQ
**Length:** 350 words | **SEO H2:** "Common Questions About Virtual School with OpenEd"

### Questions to Address

**Q: How is OpenEd different from state virtual schools?**
A: State virtual schools provide one curriculum with assigned teachers and mandatory schedules. OpenEd provides funding to choose your curriculum, pace, and providers. You get flexibility of approach, not just flexibility of location. Mix virtual platforms. Blend online with in-person. Change what's not working. State virtual schools are one option—OpenEd enables all options.

**Q: Can I use virtual school part-time?**
A: Absolutely. Many families use virtual school 2-3 days weekly and spend the rest doing hands-on projects, attending co-ops, or exploring interests. Or use virtual for subjects where it works (math, languages) and other approaches for everything else. OpenEd funds whatever combination serves your child.

**Q: What if my child needs more social interaction?**
A: Virtual doesn't mean isolated. OpenEd families commonly blend:
- Virtual academics + co-op for labs and discussion
- Online courses + community sports/arts/clubs
- Self-paced learning + group projects
- Virtual instruction + apprenticeships

You're not limited to screens. Virtual is a tool you use when it helps.

**Q: How do credits and transcripts work?**
A: This varies by curriculum provider. Many virtual programs provide official transcripts. For self-directed learners, OpenEd advisors help document learning and create transcripts for college applications. High schoolers often combine virtual courses, dual enrollment, and documented real-world learning.

**Q: What if I'm not in an OpenEd state?**
A: You can still:
- Explore virtual school options through our guides
- Read the *Open Education* book for framework
- Join our newsletter for ongoing support
- Connect with families embracing educational flexibility

We're working to expand to additional states.

**Q: Is virtual school right for my child?**
A: Virtual school particularly suits students who:
- Learn well independently or need self-pacing
- Have scheduling challenges (athletics, health, family)
- Need access to advanced or specialized courses
- Prefer working at their own rhythm
- Want location independence for travel

But remember: With OpenEd, virtual doesn't have to be all-or-nothing. Start with one subject and see how it goes.
