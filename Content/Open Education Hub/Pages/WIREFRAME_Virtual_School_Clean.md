## SECTION 1: HERO
**Length:** 150 words

Virtual school enrollment has exploded—4 million K-12 students now learn primarily online. Families want flexibility, self-pacing, and location independence.

The problem: Most virtual schools lock you into rigid curricula, mandatory synchronous classes, and limited course selection. You get flexibility of location but not flexibility of approach.

**The solution:** OpenEd provides funding to choose ANY virtual curriculum + blend with in-person experiences + adapt to your child's pace. Virtual school without the virtual limitations.

## SECTION 5: FAQ
**Length:** 350 words | **H2:** "Common Questions About Virtual School with OpenEd"

**Q: How is OpenEd different from state virtual schools?**
A: State virtual schools provide one curriculum with assigned teachers and mandatory schedules. OpenEd provides funding to choose your curriculum, pace, and providers. You get flexibility of approach, not just flexibility of location. Mix virtual platforms. Blend online with in-person. Change what's not working. State virtual schools are one option—OpenEd enables all options.

**Q: Can I use virtual school part-time?**
A: Absolutely. Many families use virtual school 2-3 days weekly and spend the rest doing hands-on projects, attending co-ops, or exploring interests. Or use virtual for subjects where it works (math, languages) and other approaches for everything else. OpenEd funds whatever combination serves your child.

**Q: What if my child needs more social interaction?**
A: Virtual doesn't mean isolated. OpenEd families commonly blend:
- Virtual academics + co-op for labs and discussion
- Online courses + community sports/arts/clubs
- Self-paced learning + group projects
- Virtual instruction + apprenticeships

You're not limited to screens. Virtual is a tool you use when it helps.

**Q: How do credits and transcripts work?**
A: This varies by curriculum provider. Many virtual programs provide official transcripts. For self-directed learners, OpenEd advisors help document learning and create transcripts for college applications. High schoolers often combine virtual courses, dual enrollment, and documented real-world learning.

**Q: What if I'm not in an OpenEd state?**
A: You can still explore virtual school options through our guides, read the *Open Education* book, join our newsletter, and connect with families embracing educational flexibility. We're working to expand.

**Q: Is virtual school right for my child?**
A: Virtual school particularly suits students who learn well independently or need self-pacing, have scheduling challenges (athletics, health, family), need access to advanced or specialized courses, prefer working at their own rhythm, or want location independence for travel. But remember: With OpenEd, virtual doesn't have to be all-or-nothing. Start with one subject and see how it goes.
