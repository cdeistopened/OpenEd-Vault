### POST 1: The "Failure Story" Template

I didn't know until my thirties that a church had paid for a large portion of my early education.

I have a learning disability—nothing debilitating, but enough to make traditional classrooms really hard. My mother, a single mom, looked for something different. Then colleagues told her about a private school run by a local church that helped kids with special needs—what today might be called a microschool.

I went. I thrived. That small school changed my trajectory.

Years later, when I was working to help Nevada bring forward the first universal education savings account in the country, the courts shut it down in 2015 before a single family could use it.

But over the past decade, I've watched something bigger than any policy win emerge—a grassroots movement reshaping how millions of families think about education.

Today, there are as many students attending microschools as there are enrolled in Catholic schools—roughly 1.5 million students spread out across 95,000 microschools nationwide.

The question isn't whether you'll "choose microschooling" or stay in traditional school.

The question is: what's the right mix for your family, right now?

### POST 2: The "Before and After" Template

**Before COVID:**
Nevada's universal ESA program was blocked by courts. Policy failure. Game over.

**After COVID:**
95,000 microschools serving 1.5 million students nationwide. Grassroots success. Game on.

Here's what I learned: Sometimes policy losses create space for something better.

When we couldn't get families choice through legislation, families created their own choices anyway.

Nevada now has 20+ microschools supported by one nonprofit. North Las Vegas runs microschools in rec centers and libraries. Three-quarters of students arrive two or more grade levels behind. The program delivers 125% academic growth at one-third the district's per-pupil cost.

The future of education isn't waiting for permission.

It's already here.

### POST 3: The "Pattern Recognition" Template

I've noticed a pattern:

Great education reform doesn't come from policy wins.

It comes from parents who stop waiting for permission.

COVID shut down schools. Courts blocked our ESA program. Traditional reform strategies failed.

But here's what happened instead:

→ Parents started learning pods in living rooms
→ Those pods became microschools
→ Those microschools joined networks
→ Those networks now serve 1.5 million students

Dalena Wallace was homeschooling six kids in Kansas when she realized: "This is hard. I need community."

She opened a Prenda microschool in her home with three families. Within months, she had 16.

Today she runs Wichita Innovative Schools and Educators (WISE) and the AIM Educational Collaborative, helping other parents do what she did.

The lesson?

Stop trying to fix the system.

Start building alternatives.

### POST 4: The "Contrarian Truth" Template

Most people think smaller class sizes are nice-to-have.

I think they're the whole point.

Here's why:

Traditional schools optimize for efficiency at scale—30 kids per classroom, same age, same curriculum, same pace.

Microschools optimize for effectiveness at small scale—5-150 students (median: 16), mixed ages, personalized learning, flexible schedules.

The difference?

In traditional schools, learning happens during designated school hours.

In microschools, learning happens everywhere—and the 2-3 days per week of structured time is by design, not compromise.

This isn't "partial" education. It's intentional design.

Families keep their kids connected to neighborhood activities, sports teams, or other programs while accessing high-quality, structured learning environments.

Age mixing creates natural mentorship. Adult guides facilitate rather than lecture. Each microschool serves a specific community or philosophy—nature-based learning, classical education, project-based learning, or serving twice-exceptional students.

The future of education isn't one-size-fits-all.

It's intentionally small.

### POST 1: The "This vs That" Template

**Traditional School says:**
"Everyone learns the same way, at the same pace, 5 days a week, 180 days a year."

**Microschools say:**
"8-12 students, 2-3 days per week, mixed ages, learning at their own pace."

**Traditional School says:**
"You need certified teachers with degrees."

**Microschools say:**
"About half of guides are parents without teaching credentials."

**Traditional School says:**
"It costs $15,000+ per student annually."

**Microschools say:**
"$2,000-15,000 annually, often with sliding scale pricing."

Here's the result at Prenda microschools:

→ 18 percentage point increases in grade-level proficiency
→ Intrinsic motivation: 27% → 62%
→ Positive feelings about school: 36% → 86%

The question isn't which system is "better."

The question is which system is better for YOUR family.

(H/T to Kelly Smith and the Prenda team for pioneering this model)

### POST 2: The "What Really Matters" Template

Three-quarters of students at North Las Vegas microschools arrived two or more grade levels behind.

Most were already struggling in traditional settings.

Here's what happened next:

→ 125% academic growth compared to typical gains
→ Students mastering grade-level material at rates traditional schools can't match
→ All-in cost: one-quarter to one-third of the district's per-pupil spending

But here's what matters more than test scores:

Students who used to drag themselves to school now actually want to be there.

At Prenda microschools:
- Intrinsic motivation: 27% → 62%
- Positive feelings about school: 36% → 86%

As Kerry McDonald notes: "Early microschool classes—kindergarten and first grade—are now filling with students who've never been in a conventional classroom. These are parents choosing unconventional education right out of the gate."

The real measure of educational success isn't standardized test scores.

It's whether kids love learning again.

### POST 3: The "What If It Was Simpler" Template

What if starting a school was simpler than you thought?

→ 8-12 committed families
→ 2-3 days per week schedule
→ Space to meet (often leased inexpensively from a church or community center)
→ No permanent facility required

That's it.

A minimum viable microschool.

Jon England (Education Innovators) has supported over 100 schools and mentored 20+ founders. His work empowers teachers to create their dream schools.

Kelly Smith (Prenda) has helped over 1,000 adults start microschools serving nearly 10,000 students—no education degree required.

The National Microschooling Center now supports schools across multiple states, providing research, directory services, and connections to state incubators.

We make education complicated.

We assume you need:
- A teaching credential
- A building
- Millions in funding
- Government approval
- 5-day-a-week schedules
- Traditional curriculum

But the best version of education is surprisingly simple:

A small group of families. A guide who cares. A flexible schedule. A learning environment that actually works for YOUR kids.

The psychological hurdle is often bigger than the logistical one.

Letting go of what school "should" look like takes courage.

The permission you're really seeking isn't from the state—it's from yourself.

### POST 4: The "Shoutout" Template

We're seeing something remarkable happen in the microschooling movement.

Leaders like:

→ Kelly Smith (Prenda) - From 7 kids around his kitchen table to helping 1,000+ adults start microschools serving nearly 10,000 students

→ Jon England (Education Innovators) - After 14 years as a public school teacher and principal, now supporting educators in launching microschools where students excel and teachers rediscover their passion

→ Kerry McDonald (National Microschooling Center) - Leading voice documenting how "early microschool classes are now filling with students who've never been in a conventional classroom"

→ Don and Ashley Soifer (Nevada Action for School Options) - When Nevada's ESA program was blocked, they didn't go home. They started supporting microschools one at a time. Now they've helped launch 20+ schools across Nevada.

→ Dalena Wallace (WISE and AIM Educational Collaborative) - Opened a Prenda microschool in her Kansas living room with three families. Within months, she had 16. Now she's helping other parents do what she did.

These aren't policy experts writing white papers.

They're practitioners building alternatives.

1.5 million students are now in microschools—as many as attend Catholic schools nationwide.

The grassroots education revolution isn't coming.

It's already here.

Who are we missing? Tag the microschool founders and leaders doing this work in your community.

### POST 5: The "Crowdsource" Template

Question for parents, educators, and education innovators:

What's the biggest barrier to starting a microschool in YOUR community?

We keep hearing:
- "I don't have a teaching credential"
- "I don't know where to find families"
- "I can't afford a building"
- "I don't know what curriculum to use"
- "The regulations seem too complex"

But here's what we're learning from Kelly Smith at Prenda, Jon England at Education Innovators, and the National Microschooling Center:

The logistical barriers are smaller than you think.

The psychological barriers are bigger.

So help us understand:

What's actually stopping you from starting or joining a microschool?

Is it:
- Finding the right families?
- Understanding the legal requirements?
- Choosing curriculum?
- Fear of "doing it wrong"?
- Something else entirely?

Comment below. Let's identify the real barriers so we can help remove them.

### POST 6: The "Pattern Recognition" Template

We've noticed a pattern:

The most successful microschool founders don't start with credentials.

They start with community.

Dalena Wallace was homeschooling six kids in Kansas when she realized: "This is hard. I need community."

She opened a Prenda microschool in her home with three families. Within months, she had 16.

Kelly Smith started with 7 kids around his kitchen table. Today Prenda serves nearly 10,000 students.

Jon England spent 14 years in traditional schools before realizing: teachers need support to create their dream schools. Now he's helped launch over 100.

The National Microschooling Center started from one question: "Can you help me start a microschool?"

The answer was yes.

Then it was yes again.

And again.

Now they support schools across multiple states.

Here's the lesson:

You don't need permission.

You don't need a building.

You don't need millions in funding.

You need 8-12 families who want something different.

The rest? There are people ready to help you figure it out.

Tag someone who's been thinking about starting a microschool but doesn't think they're "qualified."

### POST 7: The "Study Summary" Template

New data on microschools is starting to emerge.

Here's what we're learning:

**Prenda Network (nearly 10,000 students):**
- 18 percentage point increases in grade-level proficiency (math & reading)
- Intrinsic motivation: 27% → 62%
- Positive feelings about school: 36% → 86%
- About half of guides are parents without teaching credentials

**North Las Vegas Microschools:**
- 75% of students arrived 2+ grade levels behind
- 125% academic growth vs. typical gains
- All-in cost: 1/4 to 1/3 of district per-pupil spending

**National Landscape:**
- 1.5 million students in microschools (equal to Catholic school enrollment)
- 95,000 microschools nationwide
- Median size: 16 students
- Most common schedule: 2-3 days per week

**Parent Satisfaction:**
- 76% "very satisfied" with microschools
- vs. 42% for traditional schools (a 25-year low)

The RAND Corporation's 2025 study notes that outcomes data remains "unavailable, inconsistent, or unrepresentative" across the sector—quality varies dramatically.

But what the data can't capture: kids who actually want to be there. Parents who feel heard. Families who've found something that works.

As Kerry McDonald observes: "Early microschool classes are now filling with students who've never been in a conventional classroom. These are parents choosing unconventional education right out of the gate."

The question isn't whether microschools are "better" universally.

The question is whether they're better for YOUR family.
