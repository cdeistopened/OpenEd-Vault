# Virtual School: K-12 Solutions for Students

Virtual school has permanently shifted the educational landscape, but its definition is changing. The "emergency remote learning" of 2020 is a distant memory, replaced by a sophisticated ecosystem of options. Today, the conversation is moving beyond a simple choice between online and in-person. As [education opens up](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://opened.co/open-education), families are realizing they don't have to choose a single, all-or-nothing program.

This is where the OpenEd model thrives. It represents a hybrid of homeschool and virtual school that can look more like one or the other depending on what a family wants. For families who want structure, we can provide a fully-formed curriculum and teacher support. For those who want freedom, we provide the funding and flexibility to design a completely custom path. You don't just choose a virtual school; you build the _right_ one for your child.

## What is Virtual School?

At its core, virtual school means receiving education primarily through digital platforms. But the modern landscape is defined by its variety. Families can now curate an experience by blending different learning modalities. This includes **synchronous learning**, which involves live, real-time classes that provide structure and peer interaction, and **asynchronous learning**, which allows students to work through self-paced materials on their own schedule.

This "unbundling" of education means you can choose a gamified math curriculum like [**Beast Academy**](https://beastacademy.com/), a live literature discussion on [**Outschool**](https://outschool.com/), and a video-based science course from a provider like [**Subject**](https://www.subject.com/), rather than accepting a pre-packaged, one-size-fits-all program from a single institution.

## Virtual Public School

It's crucial to understand the difference between traditional virtual public schools and the open education model. A **traditional virtual public school**, such as a state-run program powered by a large provider like [**K12 Stride**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.stridelearning.com/who-we-serve/k12-parents-students/) or [**Connections Academy**](https://www.connectionsacademy.com/), operates much like a brick-and-mortar school online. These programs are tuition-free and require full-time enrollment, adherence to a mandatory state-aligned curriculum, and participation in standardized testing.

A defining feature of this model is the highly structured role of the "Learning Coach." The parent is not just a supporter but an on-site facilitator, with a time commitment that can range from 1-3 hours daily for high schoolers to 4-6 hours for elementary students. While this model works well for families seeking the structure of traditional school at home, the trade-off is a significant loss of flexibility and choice.

**The OpenEd model** is fundamentally different. It's a hybrid that combines the funding of public school with the freedom of homeschooling. Instead of being a Learning Coach for a single, mandatory curriculum, you become the Educational Designer for your child, with the power to choose the best resources from any provider nationwide.

## K-12 Virtual School

A successful virtual school experience looks different at each stage of a child's development. The OpenEd model empowers you to adapt the blend of online and offline resources as your child grows.

### **Virtual School for Elementary (K-5)**

Young learners need hands-on, tangible experiences to build foundational knowledge. The best virtual approach for this age group is a blend of limited, high-quality screen time with extensive offline activities. OpenEd excels here by providing funding for the physical resources that make learning real: math manipulatives, science kits from providers like [**Generation Genius**](https://www.generationgenius.com/) or [**Mystery Science**](https://mysteryscience.com/), art supplies, and hands-on [**KiwiCo**](https://www.kiwico.com/) crates.

### **Virtual School for Middle School (6-8)**

Middle schoolers need growing independence and, critically, social connection. A hybrid approach is often ideal. You can use powerful online platforms like [**IXL**](https://www.ixl.com/) for adaptive core skill practice or [**ALEKS Math**](https://www.aleks.com/) for AI-driven math instruction, while using OpenEd funding to facilitate real-world social opportunities through local co-ops, sports teams, or community classes.

## Considerations for Virtual High School

Virtual learning unlocks a world of possibilities for high schoolers, allowing them to pursue advanced academics, career training, and unique interests far beyond what a local school might offer. This flexibility is crucial for a wide range of students, from elite athletes with demanding travel schedules to those with medical needs or those simply seeking a safer learning environment. With OpenEd, families can fund any combination of accredited courses from providers like [**Edmentum**](https://www.edmentum.com/) or [**BYU Independent Study**](https://is.byu.edu/), dual enrollment college classes, or vocational training to build a transcript that truly reflects a student's passions and ambitions.

## Virtual Schools by State

While many states offer their own public virtual school programs, these often come with the same limitations as their brick-and-mortar counterparts: a pre-packaged curriculum and enrollment restricted to a single institution's state-approved catalog. The OpenEd model provides a powerful alternative, offering the freedom and funding to choose from best-in-class resources from across the country.

### **Arkansas Virtual School**

The state offers the [**Arkansas Virtual Academy**](https://arva.k12.com/) (powered by K12 Stride) and Virtual Arkansas for supplemental courses. This creates a binary choice between a full-time, structured program and a limited a la carte menu. OpenEd's program in Arkansas transcends this, allowing families to blend resources from any provider they choose.

### **Indiana Virtual School**

Indiana has robust options like [**Indiana Connections Academy**](https://www.connectionsacademy.com/indiana-online-school/) and Indiana Online. However, state funding rules can be complex. OpenEd's model simplifies this by providing families with direct funding and a clear path to creating a custom educational plan.

### **Kansas Virtual School**

The state's public options are fragmented, with [**Kansas Virtual Academy**](https://ksva.k12.com/) serving only K-6 and Insight School of Kansas covering grades 7-12. This creates a mandatory transition that can be disruptive. OpenEd offers a seamless K-12 journey, allowing for consistency and stability.

### **Minnesota Virtual School**

Minnesota hosts one of the nation's oldest online schools, the [**Minnesota Virtual High School**](https://mnohs.org/). While established, it and other providers offer more rigid structures. OpenEd's flexibility allows families to build a far more personalized program.

### **Montana Virtual School**

Montana uniquely lacks a full-time public virtual school, with the [**Montana Digital Academy**](https://montanadigitalacademy.org/) offering only supplemental courses. OpenEd fills this critical gap, providing the only truly flexible, full-time, and funded option for families in the state.

### **Oregon Virtual School**

Oregon offers programs like [**Oregon Connections Academy**](https://www.connectionsacademy.com/oregon-online-school/). While solid, they still operate within the traditional public school framework. OpenEd families in Oregon receive significantly more funding and fewer restrictions, empowering true educational freedom.

### **Utah Virtual School**

Utah has a wide variety of state options, including [**Utah Online School**](https://utahonline.org/) and Utah Virtual Academy. However, navigating the system can be complex. OpenEd's partner program in Utah is renowned for its flexibility, community, and generous technology allowances.

## Your Virtual School, Your Way [OpenEd CTA]

The families thriving with virtual learning aren't the ones who found a single perfect program. They are the designers who realized perfection comes from customization. They address concerns like screen time and social life by funding offline activities and in-person groups, creating a balanced and joyful approach to learning.

OpenEd makes this revolution accessible. The subscriptions, courses, tutors, and technology you need to build your ideal virtual school are all 100% reimbursable through our program. You can explore hundreds of approved options in the [**OpenEd Marketplace**](https://opened.co/marketplace).

# Virtual School with OpenEd

Virtual school enrollment nearly doubled during the pandemic, jumping from 293,000 to over 590,000 students nationwide. Today, with [562,659 students enrolled full-time](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/tables/201920_Virtual_Schools_table_3.asp) and millions more taking individual online courses, virtual education has permanently changed how families approach learning.

But virtual school today looks nothing like the emergency remote learning of 2020 that most parents got a taste of during the pandemic.

The most successful programs have evolved into flexible educational ecosystems where families can mix live classes, self-paced curricula, project-based learning, and real-world experiences. Through open education programs like OpenEd, families access funding for any virtual resources they choose—from complete online schools to individual enrichment classes.

This flexibility represents a fundamental shift. Instead of accepting whatever their assigned virtual school provides, families now build customized educational experiences using the best resources from multiple providers. A student might take core academics through [Subject](https://subject.com/), add creative writing on [Outschool](https://outschool.com/), and pursue advanced math with [Art of Problem Solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com/).

OpenEd makes this mixing and matching financially possible for all families, not just those who can afford premium programs.

## Defining Virtual School

Virtual school encompasses everything from rigid, schedule-bound programs that mirror traditional classrooms online to completely flexible models where families design their own educational journey. Understanding these different models helps families choose approaches that match their needs.

**Traditional Virtual Schools** like [K12/Stride](https://www.k12.com/) and [Connections Academy](https://www.connectionsacademy.com/) operate as full-time online public schools. Students follow set curricula, attend scheduled classes, take state tests, and receive report cards. These programs provide structure and state-certified teachers but offer limited flexibility.

**Hybrid/Supplemental Programs** let students remain in traditional schools while taking specific courses online. [Florida Virtual School Flex](https://www.flvs.net/), serving over 220,000 students, pioneered this model. Students might take AP Physics online while attending their local school for other subjects.

**Open Education Virtual Models** give families complete control. Programs like OpenEd provide funding for any secular virtual resources families choose, plus support from certified teachers when needed. Unlike traditional virtual schools that mandate specific curricula, families can use [MiaPrep](https://miaprep.com/) for gamified lessons, [VLACS](https://vlacs.org/) for project-based learning, or create their own mix.

## Benefits of Virtual School

Research reveals surprising advantages of well-designed virtual education. Stanford's Ray Ravaglia found that synchronous (live) online classes achieve 97% completion rates compared to 70% for self-paced courses. The difference? Human connection. Students in live classes form relationships that keep them engaged.

Virtual education solves specific challenges traditional schools can't address:

**Medical needs:** Students with chronic illnesses maintain educational continuity

**Geographic isolation:** Rural students access advanced courses unavailable locally

**Safety concerns:** With [21% of students reporting bullying](https://www.pacer.org/bullying/info/stats/), virtual options provide safe learning environments **Family lifestyle:** Military families average 6-9 relocations—virtual school provides consistency

Modern virtual programs also develop crucial 21st-century skills. [Subject](https://subject.com/)'s video-first curriculum teaches media literacy alongside academics. [MiaPrep](https://miaprep.com/)'s gamified approach builds problem-solving through gameplay. These platforms speak to digital natives in their language while maintaining academic rigor.

## Virtual School with OpenEd

OpenEd transforms virtual education from an either/or choice into a both/and opportunity. Through partnerships with innovative public schools, OpenEd provides funding that makes any secular virtual curriculum accessible.

Families might choose complete virtual school programs like [MiaPrep Online High School](https://miaprep.com/online-school/) (starting at $9.95/month), which offers accredited diplomas with teacher support. Or they might prefer [Subject Virtual School](https://www.subjectvirtual.com/), designed specifically for Gen Z with short video lessons and social learning features.

But OpenEd's real power lies in flexibility. Families can:

- Mix curricula from different providers for different subjects
- Add live classes from [Outschool](https://outschool.com/) for enrichment
- Access one-on-one tutoring when needed
- Join local co-ops for hands-on activities
- Pursue dual enrollment or career training

All secular virtual resources are 100% reimbursable through OpenEd's funding programs. This removes the financial barrier that forces many families to accept whatever free option their state provides.

## Virtual School for Elementary School

Young learners need extensive parent involvement—[research indicates at least 5 hours weekly](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA956-5.html). The best elementary virtual programs minimize screen time while maximizing engagement.

[Time4Learning](https://www.time4learning.com/) offers animated lessons that feel like educational cartoons. [Miacademy](https://miacademy.co/) (K-8, starting at $29.95/month) gamifies learning with rewards and safe social features. [Power Homeschool](https://powerhomeschool.org/) provides Acellus courses at budget prices.

OpenEd families often combine these platforms with offline activities. They might use virtual curricula for core academics while funding hands-on science kits, art supplies, and manipulatives that make learning tangible. Many supplement with weekly live classes on Outschool for subjects like foreign languages or music.

## Virtual School for Middle School

Middle schoolers need peer interaction alongside academics. Programs addressing this include virtual clubs, group projects, and optional meetups.

[VLACS](https://vlacs.org/) excels here with competency-based learning that lets students progress when ready. [Michigan Virtual](https://michiganvirtual.org/) combines academics with social-emotional learning. [MiaPrep](https://miaprep.com/) (starting at $9.95/month for grades 7-12) offers moderated social features where students share creative projects.

OpenEd families often use funding to join local sports teams, theater groups, or maker spaces that provide crucial social experiences while maintaining educational flexibility. They can access OpenEd's own clubs and activities designed for this age group.

## Virtual School for High School

High school virtual programs serve diverse populations: early college students, working teenagers ([68% of online students hold jobs](https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/online-learning-statistics/)), elite athletes, and students recovering from traditional school challenges.

[Subject](https://subject.com/) has emerged as the leader in video-first high school curriculum, with courses comprising 100-150 mini-modules perfect for modern attention spans. Each five-minute video lesson includes comprehension checks and assignments, making complex topics digestible. Schools using Subject report 20-30% expansion of their course catalogs.

[MiaPrep Online High School](https://miaprep.com/online-school/) offers two options: standalone curriculum for homeschoolers or full private school with diploma. Their flexibility serves students who need to work at their own pace while maintaining accreditation.

[Laurel Springs School](https://laurelsprings.com/) provides premium college prep with personalized academic counseling. [VLACS](https://vlacs.org/) offers everything from credit recovery to early college courses. [Time4Learning](https://www.time4learning.com/) extends through 12th grade with comprehensive curriculum.

OpenEd funds any of these options plus Advanced Placement courses, dual enrollment, vocational training, or apprenticeships—removing financial barriers to advanced opportunities.
