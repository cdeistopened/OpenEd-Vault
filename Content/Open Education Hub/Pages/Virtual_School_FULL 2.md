## SECTION 1: HERO
**Layout:** Full-width hero with background image or simple header block

### Content:

Virtual school enrollment has exploded—over 4 million K-12 students now learn primarily online. Families discovered they could learn from anywhere, set their own pace, and access resources beyond their local district. The promise was flexibility.

But most virtual schools deliver only location flexibility while maintaining curricular rigidity. You're assigned a curriculum. Required to attend synchronous classes. Locked into one platform. Can't easily blend online with real-world experiences. You got flexibility of *where* without flexibility of *how*.

OpenEd changes this. Through partnerships with innovative public schools, we make it possible to choose ANY virtual curriculum, set your own pace, and seamlessly blend digital learning with in-person experiences. This is virtual school with actual flexibility—not just a different location for the same constraints.

|-------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Tuition** | Free | $3K-10K/year | Free (publicly funded) |
| **Curriculum Choice** | ❌ Assigned curriculum | ⚠️ Some choice | ✅✅ Choose ANY curriculum |
| **Schedule Flexibility** | ❌ Mandatory sync classes | ⚠️ Varies by program | ✅✅ Fully self-paced |

| **Teacher Support** | ✅ Assigned teacher | ✅ Varies | ✅ Advisory support |
| **Mix & Match Subjects** | ❌ Package deal | ⚠️ Limited | ✅✅ Complete freedom |

Virtual school was meant to provide flexibility—learning from anywhere, at any pace, with access to resources beyond your local school. OpenEd delivers on that promise. You're not trading location constraints for curricular constraints. You get true educational freedom.

### H2: Virtual School with OpenEd

Most virtual schools offer a partial solution: learn from home but follow our curriculum, attend our mandatory sessions, stay on our platform. OpenEd makes complete flexibility possible through three elements:

**Layout instruction:** Three equal-width columns below

### [COLUMN 1]

**Choose Your Virtual Curriculum**

Unlike state virtual schools that lock you into one platform, OpenEd provides access to whatever works for your child:

- **Premium virtual platforms** — Outschool, Khan Academy, CTC Math, Time4Learning
- **Subject-specific programs** — Beast Academy for math, Brave Writer for writing, Labster for virtual labs
- **Live online classes** from specialized providers across all subjects
- **Self-paced courses** that let students move at their natural rhythm
- **Virtual tutors** for targeted, one-on-one support
- **AP and advanced courses** beyond what state programs offer
- **Electives** in coding, entrepreneurship, creative arts, languages—subjects state virtual schools rarely provide

Mix and match freely. Use Khan Academy for math, Outschool for enrichment, a private tutor for writing. Or choose one complete program. Change platforms mid-year if something stops working. The flexibility is real, not theoretical.

---

### [COLUMN 2]

**Virtual + In-Person = True Flexibility**

Virtual school through OpenEd doesn't mean screens 24/7. Families commonly blend:

- **Virtual core subjects** (math, language arts) + **local co-op** for labs, discussions, and group projects
- **Asynchronous online learning** allowing flexible schedules + **community sports, arts, clubs** for social connection
- **Self-paced academics** 3 days weekly + **nature school or apprenticeships** 2 days weekly
- **Virtual instruction** providing curriculum structure + **project-based real-world application** showing learning in action
- **Online high school courses** + **dual enrollment** at community college for advanced students

Virtual is a tool, not a cage. Use it when it serves your child's learning. Supplement with hands-on, in-person experiences when that serves better. You're not forced to choose between digital and physical—you integrate both.

---

### [COLUMN 3]

**Beyond State Virtual Schools**

State-specific virtual schools exist and can work for some families. But they come with significant limitations:

State virtual schools typically:
- ❌ Assign curriculum (no choice)
- ❌ Require synchronous attendance
- ❌ Lock you into one platform
- ❌ Make blending difficult
- ❌ Limit course selection

OpenEd enables:
- ✅✅ Complete curriculum freedom
- ✅✅ Self-paced, asynchronous learning
- ✅✅ Platform switching anytime
- ✅✅ Seamless online and in-person blending
- ✅✅ Access to premium platforms and specialized courses

Virtual school was meant to provide flexibility. With OpenEd, it actually does.

## SECTION 5: FAQ
**Layout:** Expandable/accordion format recommended

### H2: Common Questions About Virtual School with OpenEd

**Q: How is OpenEd different from state virtual schools?**

State virtual schools provide one curriculum with assigned teachers and mandatory schedules. OpenEd makes it possible to choose your curriculum, pace, and providers. 

You get flexibility of approach, not just flexibility of location. Mix virtual platforms. Use Khan Academy for math and Outschool for enrichment. Blend online learning with in-person co-ops. Change what's not working mid-year. Take classes from multiple providers simultaneously.

State virtual schools are one option among many. OpenEd enables all options.

---

**Q: Can I use virtual school part-time?**

Absolutely. Many OpenEd families use virtual school 2-3 days weekly and spend the rest doing hands-on projects, attending co-ops, or exploring interests through apprenticeships and real-world experiences.

Or use virtual for specific subjects where it excels—adaptive math programs, language learning, advanced courses your local area doesn't offer—while using other approaches for everything else.

OpenEd enables whatever combination serves your child. Virtual doesn't have to be all-or-nothing.

---

**Q: What if my child needs more social interaction?**

Virtual doesn't mean isolated. OpenEd families commonly blend:

- Virtual academics providing curriculum structure + **co-op for labs, discussions, and group projects**
- Online self-paced courses allowing flexible scheduling + **community sports, arts, clubs** for social connection
- Asynchronous learning freeing up daytime hours + **apprenticeships and mentorships** providing real-world interaction
- Virtual instruction + **group project-based learning** with peers

You're not limited to screens. Virtual tools provide access to excellent curriculum and specialized instruction. Real-world experiences provide social connection and hands-on application. Blend both as your child needs.

---

**Q: How do credits and transcripts work?**

This varies by curriculum provider. Many virtual programs (Connections Academy, K12, Oak Meadow) provide official transcripts recognized by colleges. For students using multiple providers or self-directed approaches, OpenEd advisors help document learning and create transcripts for college applications.

High schoolers often combine:
- Virtual courses providing official credits
- Dual enrollment at community college (transferable credits)
- Documented real-world learning (internships, projects, independent study)
- Standardized test scores (SAT, ACT, AP exams)

Colleges increasingly value diverse learning paths. The key is documenting what you've learned, however you've learned it.

---

**Q: What if I'm not in an OpenEd state?**

If you're not in one of our public school partnership states, consider [**OpenEd Academy**](https://openedacademy.com/)—our accredited virtual private school serving students nationwide (K-12). OpenEd Academy provides:

OpenEd Academy combines the flexibility of virtual schooling with the structure and credentials of a school. It's the same open education philosophy—choose your curriculum, blend approaches, adapt as needed—with added teacher guidance and official credentials.

You can also explore virtual school options through our comprehensive guides, read the *Open Education* book, join our newsletter, and connect with families in your area. We're actively working to expand public school partnerships to additional states.

---

**Q: Is virtual school right for my child?**

Virtual school particularly suits students who:

- **Learn well independently** or need self-pacing rather than keeping up with a class
- **Have scheduling challenges** (competitive athletics, health needs, family travel)
- **Need access to advanced or specialized courses** beyond local offerings
- **Prefer working at their own rhythm** rather than fixed schedules
- **Want location independence** for travel, relocation, or flexibility

But remember: With OpenEd, virtual doesn't have to be all-or-nothing. Start with one subject and see how it goes. Use virtual where it serves, supplement with in-person where that works better. The flexibility adapts to your child, not the other way around.
