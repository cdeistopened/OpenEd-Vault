# Classical Education with Open Education

The number of classical schools has doubled in the past decade. Families are rediscovering that teaching children *how to think* matters more than teaching them *what to think*. Latin programs have waitlists. Great Books co-ops are forming in church basements and community centers. Parents are choosing trivium over testing, virtue over vocational prep.

But here's the problem: accessing quality classical education has meant choosing between expensive private schools ($8,000-15,000/year) or going it alone as a homeschooler with limited resources and support.

OpenEd changes this equation. Through partnerships with innovative public schools, we provide the funding, flexibility, and community to make classical education accessible—whether you want full immersion in the Great Tradition or to blend classical elements with other approaches as your child's needs evolve.

## What is Classical Education?

If you're researching classical education, you likely already know the basics: the trivium's three stages (grammar, logic, rhetoric), the emphasis on Western civilization's foundational texts, and the commitment to forming wise humans, not just skilled workers.

But here's what makes classical education distinctive in practice:

**Language as Foundation** — Latin and Greek aren't decorative additions but keys that unlock the Western tradition. When your daughter can read Virgil in the original, she's not just studying literature—she's thinking in the categories that shaped our civilization.

**Integration Over Fragmentation** — History becomes the spine around which everything else wraps. Reading Homer isn't "English class"—it's simultaneously literature, history, philosophy, ethics, and worldview formation.

**The Socratic Method** — Questions lead to discovery. Rather than absorbing pre-digested answers, students learn to think dialectically, defending positions and examining assumptions.

**Virtue Formation** — Education isn't value-neutral. Classical education explicitly aims to form character through exposure to noble examples and timeless wisdom.

**The Trivium's Developmental Wisdom** — Young children memorize (grammar stage), middle schoolers analyze and argue (logic stage), and teenagers synthesize and express (rhetoric stage). This progression matches natural development, not arbitrary grade levels.

What's remarkable isn't just that this approach worked for centuries—it's that it still works. Students trained classically consistently outperform peers in critical thinking, cultural literacy, and the ability to learn independently across disciplines.

## Classical Education with OpenEd

The revival of classical education has created a beautiful problem: families know what they want but can't always access or afford it. Private classical schools have limited enrollment. Complete curricula like Memoria Press or Veritas run hundreds to thousands per year. Quality Latin tutors charge $40-100 per hour. Classical Conversations communities, while more affordable, still require significant investment.

OpenEd solves this through three key elements:

### Complete Funding for Classical Resources

Every secular classical resource is 100% reimbursable through OpenEd. This means:

- **Complete curricula** from providers like Memoria Press, Veritas Press, or Classical Academic Press
- **Latin and Greek programs** from Song School Latin through advanced Lingua Latina
- **Logic and rhetoric materials** including The Art of Argument and formal logic programs  
- **Great Books** from D'Aulaires' mythology through college-level primary sources
- **Classical co-ops** including Classical Conversations enrollment and materials
- **Private tutors** for Latin, Greek, Socratic discussion, or writing instruction
- **Online courses** from Great Hearts Online, either individually or as a full program

You're not limited to one vendor or one approach. If your child thrives with The Well-Trained Mind's structure, fund that. If they need the community of Classical Conversations, fund that. If you want to create your own approach mixing resources, fund that.

### Flexibility to Fully Commit or Freely Blend

Here's what matters: **You don't have to choose between classical purity and practical flexibility.**

Some families are devoted classicists. They want systematic Latin through high school, logic beginning in middle school, and Great Books seminars as the centerpiece of education. OpenEd funds this completely.

Other families take a hybrid approach:
- Classical literature and history + adaptive math software
- Latin study two days per week + project-based science
- Great Books discussions + entrepreneurial mentorship
- Memory work from Classical Conversations + Charlotte Mason nature study

OpenEd funds both paths equally. Your classical identity remains intact whether you're all-in on the Great Tradition or mixing methods as your child's needs dictate.

### Community Without Compromise

One of classical education's strengths—and challenges—is that it's best experienced in community. Socratic discussions require multiple perspectives. Latin is easier to sustain with peer accountability. Rhetoric develops through practice with real audiences.

OpenEd families connect through:
- Local and online co-ops
- Great Books discussion groups
- Latin study circles
- Regional conferences and meetups

You're not isolated. You're joining families who have discovered that open education and classical education aren't opposites—they're natural partners.

## Classical Education for Elementary School: The Grammar Stage

The elementary years (roughly ages 5-12) align with what Dorothy Sayers called the "poll-parrot" stage—when children naturally love to memorize, chant, and absorb facts. Classical education harnesses this developmental window rather than fighting it.

**What This Looks Like**

Children build mental "furniture" through memory work: historical dates, Latin vocabulary, poetry, mathematical facts, geographical features. This isn't rote drudgery when done through songs, chants, and games that match their natural learning style.

Latin begins early—not with translation but with building familiarity. Programs like Song School Latin or Prima Latina make it playful while establishing patterns that will matter later.

History follows a chronological path, often through story-based curricula like Story of the World. Children learn history as humanity's grand narrative, not disconnected facts.

Reading focuses on "living books"—well-written narratives that bring subjects to life rather than dry textbooks. D'Aulaires' mythology, biographies of great figures, and classic children's literature form the core.

**Blending in the Grammar Stage**

Many families find this stage perfect for integration:
- Classical memory work in the morning
- Singapore Math (emphasizing conceptual understanding) 
- Charlotte Mason-style nature study in the afternoon
- Classical read-alouds at bedtime

The grammar stage provides the factual foundation. How you build that foundation can incorporate the best from multiple traditions.

## Classical Education for Middle School: The Logic Stage

Around ages 12-14, a shift occurs. The child who was content to absorb facts now wants to know *why*. They become naturally argumentative—what Sayers called the "pert" stage. Classical education channels this into formal reasoning rather than treating it as a discipline problem.

**What This Looks Like**

Formal logic becomes a central subject. Students learn to identify fallacies, construct valid arguments, and think systematically through programs like The Art of Argument or Traditional Logic.

Latin progresses from vocabulary to actual reading. Programs like Latin for Children or the immersive Lingua Latina move students toward translating real classical texts.

Subject integration deepens. Studying the Middle Ages means reading medieval literature, examining Gothic architecture, exploring scholastic philosophy, and tracing mathematical developments—all illuminating each other.

Writing instruction focuses on the lost tools of rhetoric and persuasion, not just "correct" grammar.

**Blending in the Logic Stage**

This stage particularly suits mixing approaches:
- Classical logic training + modern experimental science
- Latin study + coding (both require systematic thinking)
- Great Books discussions + current events analysis
- Formal rhetoric + entrepreneurial pitch practice

The logic stage builds thinking skills that transfer everywhere. The specific content matters less than mastering the tools of analysis.

---

## Classical Education for High School: The Rhetoric Stage

The rhetoric stage (ages 15-18) represents the culmination. Students move from analyzing others' arguments to constructing their own. They synthesize knowledge and express themselves persuasively, adapting their message to different audiences.

**What This Looks Like**

Original sources replace textbooks entirely. Students read Plato's dialogues, not summaries of Plato. They work through Euclid's proofs, not modern geometry adaptations. They engage directly with the tradition.

Great Books seminars—whether through Great Hearts Online, local co-ops, or family discussions—become the centerpiece. Students wrestle with life's biggest questions through humanity's greatest texts.

Latin study reaches translation of major works: Virgil's *Aeneid*, Caesar's *Gallic Wars*, or Cicero's orations.

Rhetoric and composition programs teach not just writing correctly but writing powerfully, with attention to audience, purpose, and effect.

**Blending in the Rhetoric Stage**

By high school, many students are ready for educational unbundling:
- Classical humanities + dual enrollment for STEM
- Great Books seminars + apprenticeships applying classical reasoning to modern fields
- Latin study + gap year programs like Paideia Institute's Living Latin in Rome
- Rhetoric training + real-world leadership opportunities

The classical foundation—the ability to think clearly, read deeply, and write persuasively—serves students regardless of which modern opportunities they pursue.

## Classical Curriculum and Resources

Classical education isn't a single curriculum but a living tradition you can enter at any point. Here's what families commonly use, all fully fundable through OpenEd:

### Complete Programs
If you want an all-in-one approach:
- **Classical Conversations†** — Weekly community meetings with systematic memory work and discussions
- **Memoria Press†** — Complete grade-by-grade packages with teacher guides
- **Veritas Press†** — Self-paced or live online classical education
- **Great Hearts Online** — Individual courses or full program from a leading classical school
- **The Well-Trained Mind** — Comprehensive homeschool roadmap with optional Academy courses

### Core Classical Studies
For building your own approach:
- **Latin programs** from elementary (Song School Latin, Prima Latina†) through advanced (Lingua Latina, Henle Latin†)
- **Greek resources** including Athenaze, Elementary Greek†, and Greek for Children
- **Logic curricula** including The Art of Argument, Traditional Logic†, and The Fallacy Detective
- **Rhetoric and writing** through Institute for Excellence in Writing or classical rhetoric programs
- **Great Books** from D'Aulaires' mythology through primary philosophical texts

### History and Literature
- Story of the World series (elementary)
- Famous Men series† (Greece, Rome, Middle Ages)
- Cambridge Latin Course (story-based learning)
- Original texts and quality translations (high school)

### Mathematics and Science
Classical education doesn't prescribe specific math curricula. Families successfully use:
- Singapore Math (conceptual depth)
- Saxon Math (traditional spiral approach)
- Euclid's Elements (learning geometry through original proofs)

**† Religious curriculum** — While these are excellent resources, they contain faith-based content and are not reimbursable through OpenEd. Many secular alternatives exist for each category.

This is just a snapshot. For comprehensive resource lists with specific recommendations by age and subject, see our [**Complete Classical Education Guide**](#) (link to deep dive article).

The key insight: You're not locked into one curriculum. You can start with library books and Latin flashcards, add a logic program when your child hits middle school, and gradually incorporate more as interests develop and budgets allow.

## Common Questions About Classical Education with OpenEd

**Can I keep my Classical identity while using OpenEd?**

Absolutely. OpenEd doesn't require you to change your educational philosophy or adopt a different approach. If you're committed to systematic classical education—Latin through high school, logic in middle school, Great Books as the centerpiece—OpenEd provides the funding to do this completely. We support the approach you choose, not vice versa.

**What if I want to blend Classical with other approaches?**

That's the beauty of open education. Many families use classical approaches for literature and history while choosing different methods for math or science. Others attend Classical Conversations twice weekly and homeschool the other days. Others take individual Great Hearts Online courses while maintaining their own program. OpenEd funds whatever combination serves your child.

**What if I'm not in an OpenEd state?**

While our school partnerships currently serve families in specific states, the broader open education movement is growing nationwide. You can still:
- Explore classical resources through our comprehensive guides
- Read the *Open Education* book for framework and inspiration
- Join our newsletter for ongoing support and community
- Connect with other families embracing educational freedom

We're actively working to expand to additional states.

**How do I know if Classical education is right for my child?**

Classical education particularly suits children who:
- Love stories and narrative learning
- Enjoy memorization and pattern recognition (younger children)
- Ask "why?" constantly and love to debate (middle schoolers)
- Want to understand the "big picture" and how ideas connect
- Thrive with structure and clear progression

But here's what matters more: Classical education works *because* it adapts to natural development. The trivium isn't arbitrary—it matches how children actually learn. If your child is curious about the world and you're willing to guide their journey, classical education provides a time-tested roadmap.

**Can we start Classical education at any age?**

Yes. You don't need to start at age 5 with systematic memory work. Many families discover classical education when children are older. You can:
- Begin with great books and family discussions
- Add Latin study when interest emerges
- Introduce logic in middle school even without prior classical training
- Start Great Books seminars in high school

The tradition is robust enough to meet you wherever you are.

## Reclaim the Tools of Learning

For over two thousand years, classical education formed the West's greatest thinkers, leaders, and creators. Dorothy Sayers argued we lost these tools—the ability to think clearly, learn independently, and express ourselves persuasively. But lost tools can be found again.

Through OpenEd, your family can access this tradition without choosing between classical rigor and financial reality, between educational community and family flexibility, between honoring the past and adapting to your child's unique present.

The wisdom that shaped Western civilization isn't trapped in expensive institutions or reserved for the privileged few. It's available to every family willing to pursue it—with the funding, support, and community to make it sustainable.

Whether you want full classical immersion or to blend classical elements with other approaches, OpenEd provides the resources to make it possible.
