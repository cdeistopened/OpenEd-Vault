# Microschooling with OpenEd: A Guide to Small-Scale, Big-Impact Learning

For generations, "school choice" meant choosing between large, established institutions. But a quiet revolution is taking place in church basements, converted yoga studios, and living rooms across the country. As [education opens up](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://opened.co/open-education), families are discovering they don't need a monolithic, one-stop-shop. This is the heart of the open education movement: the freedom to unbundle learning and piece together a customized path.

This shift has created the perfect environment for one of education's most exciting trends: **microschooling**. The movement has seen explosive growth, with estimates suggesting over 1.5 million students now attend tens of thousands of microschools nationwide. Instead of seeking a single school to do everything, families are building an educational week around small, focused learning communities that do one or two things exceptionally well. They might attend a microschool three days a week for project-based learning, then use online resources for math and a private tutor for Spanish on the other days. This is open education in action.

## Defining Microschools

A microschool is an intentionally small, flexible, and community-centric learning environment. Rather than a rigid set of rules, it's a model defined by its philosophy. Most are intentionally small, with fewer than 25 students, fostering a close-knit, family-like atmosphere where every child is truly seen. They often feature mixed-age groups, like a modern one-room schoolhouse, where older students mentor younger ones and children learn based on ability and interest, not just their birthdate. The adult in the room acts as a facilitator or "guide," helping students discover knowledge rather than lecturing from the front. This learner-driven approach is often coupled with a flexible, part-time schedule, allowing families the freedom to pursue other opportunities. The beauty of microschooling is its specificity—you can find a program built around almost any philosophy, from STEM to nature immersion to the arts.

## Benefits of Microschools

Families are drawn to microschools for the powerful benefits that a small-scale model offers. The most significant advantage is **deep personalization**; in a group of 10, a guide can truly know each child's strengths, weaknesses, and passions, tailoring the learning experience accordingly. This intimate setting cultivates a **strong community**, making the school feel like an extension of the family and providing a powerful sense of belonging. Furthermore, many microschools prioritize **real-world learning**, favoring hands-on projects, apprenticeships, and community engagement over worksheets and tests. Finally, the common 2- or 3-day-a-week model provides unparalleled **flexibility**, giving families the freedom to design the rest of their educational week around travel, deep dives into personal interests, or other specialized classes.

## How to Join a Microschool

Finding the right microschool is about finding the right fit for your family's values and your child's learning style. Begin by searching online directories from the [**National Microschooling Center**](https://microschoolingcenter.org/), which is an excellent resource for finding options in your area. When you visit a potential microschool, ask questions that get to the heart of their philosophy: "How are conflicts resolved?" "What does a typical day look like?" and "How do you support a child who is struggling?" Look for a community that feels like a partnership and a place where your child will be inspired to learn.

## How to Start a Microschool

Many of the most successful microschools were started by parents and educators who wanted a different option for their own communities. If you're inspired to start your own, you don't have to do it alone. Networks like [**Acton Academy**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.actonacademy.org/start-a-school) and [**Wildflower Montessori**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://wildflowerschools.org/start/) provide comprehensive frameworks, curricula, and support for parent-entrepreneurs. These organizations help you navigate the process of building a vision, finding families, and launching a thriving learning community.

## Online Microschools

The microschooling concept is also adapting to the virtual world, creating hybrid models that blend the best of online learning with in-person connection. A prominent example is the [**KaiPod Learning**](https://www.kaipodlearning.com/) network. In a KaiPod, a small group of learners gathers in a professional, in-person environment with an experienced "Learning Coach." Students use the online curriculum of their choice for core academics, giving them access to world-class digital tools, while the in-person coach provides support, enrichment activities, and facilitates peer collaboration. It's a brilliant solution for families who want the flexibility of online learning but also desire a structured social environment for their children.

## Microschool Curriculum Ideas

The part-time nature of most microschools means families are the curators of their child's full curriculum. OpenEd provides the funding to supplement a microschool experience with other best-in-class resources. Popular choices include:

- **Math:** An online curriculum like [**Beast Academy**](https://beastacademy.com/) for its comic-based storytelling or [**IXL**](https://www.ixl.com/) for its adaptive skill practice.
- **Writing:** A live, online class from a platform like [**Outschool**](https://outschool.com/) to connect with an expert instructor and a peer group.
- **Languages:** A private language tutor found through a local network or online platform.
- **STEM:** Hands-on subscription kits from a provider like [**KiwiCo**](https://www.kiwico.com/) to bring science and engineering to life on days at home.
