**PROMPT:** I'm not sure that that opening is actually factually correct. Most of them operate like that. If you have research to back that up, then fine. But make sure you include citations for every factual claim you make and hyperlink the link from our research report. We do want to weave in some stories here, right? Actually, we probably don't need to weave in too many stories here. This is the page right?

To be clear, OpenNet is not ESA funding. But it is compatible as long as it's a part-time microschool.

For this page, we can cut out a lot of the stories like Kristin and Peggy Lowe, etc. Although I guess we are trying to do two things:

1. The article
2. The page So why don't you give me a revised artifact for each of those separately? One is the deep dive meant for our newsletter audience which has more of the stories as well as the practical information. We can be a lot more flexible on the headers for that one. But for the page we need to follow the SEO structure a little bit more rigorously and just try to fit in as much of the relevant information as we can. Weaving strategic narrative in with practical information about how you can incorporate micro-schooling into open education. Take note of the attached hub page. What is open education? The micro-schooling with open education or open education with micro-schooling. I forget exactly what we're going to title it. But this is it needs to kind of fit in as a spoke off of the central hub.

## Microschooling with OpenEd: When Educational Choice Means Choosing Everything

**Opening (300 words)**

Start with the three-day reality: Most microschools operate Tuesday-Thursday or Monday-Wednesday-Friday. This isn't compromise—it's the dominant model. Why? Because families discovered they don't need full-time school to get full-time learning.

Pivot to numbers: 1.5 million students, 95,000 schools, 88% average/below-average income. This isn't opting out—it's opting in to something radically specific.

Thesis: Microschools have revealed that "school choice" was always too limited. The real revolution is educational choice—choosing how much, what kind, when, and whether "school" is even the right word anymore.

### Defining Microschools (600 words)

**What they actually are:**

- 5-150 students (median 16), but size is the least important feature
- Mixed-age by design, not convenience
- Facilitators/guides, not teachers (and why this matters)
- Part-time as standard, not exception

**The specificity principle:** Microschools succeed through precision, not scale. Examples:

- Sphinx Academy: 24 twice-exceptional students only
- Scola: Kids who need 3+ hours outside daily
- Connected Teens: Adventure-based learning from a van
- Apogee: Whole family transformation model

**Legal structures that enable choice:** How they operate as homeschool support, enrichment programs, or learning centers to maximize flexibility and minimize regulatory burden. The Nevada workaround as example of entrepreneurial adaptation.

**The relationship revolution:** Deep dive into facilitator vs teacher. At Prenda, 50% of guides are parents. At Scola, 12-year-olds teach 5-year-olds. At Acton, adults explicitly don't provide answers. This isn't educational abdication—it's recognizing that hierarchical knowledge transfer was always inefficient.

### Benefits of Microschools (500 words)

**The outcomes that matter:** Start with Prenda data: 18-point gains, motivation from 27% to 62%, school satisfaction from 36% to 86%. But quickly pivot to what these numbers represent: kids who want to learn.

**The special needs revelation:** 63% serve neurodivergent students not through specialized services but through basic flexibility. The "special" was created by inflexibility. Use Sphinx Academy to show how twice-exceptional kids thrive when education adapts to them.

**The part-time advantage:** Why three days often produces better outcomes than five. Families report:

- Less burnout, more engagement
- Time for deep interests
- Stronger family relationships
- Real-world application opportunities

**Parent satisfaction vs parent participation:** 76% satisfaction rate isn't about parents getting what they want—it's about them seeing their kids get what they need. The participation paradox: less school requires more parental engagement but feels less burdensome.

### How to Join a Microschool (500 words)

**Understanding the landscape:**

Map the major networks by philosophy, not just price:

- **Prenda** ($6,200-7,200/year): Self-paced mastery, parent guides welcome
- **Acton** ($6,000-13,000/year): Entrepreneurial, no grades ever
- **Wildflower** ($0-25,000): Montessori, teacher-led, sliding scale
- **KaiPod** ($551-1,150/month): Hybrid, choose your own curriculum

**The selection criteria that actually matter:**

- Values alignment over test scores
- Schedule flexibility over full programming
- Community fit over prestigious reputation
- Growth mindset over fixed curriculum

**The OpenEd pathway:** How part-time programs qualify for full reimbursement. This isn't a loophole—it's recognition that education happens beyond school walls. Specific steps for families to access funding.

**Questions parents should actually ask:** Not "what's your curriculum?" but "how do you handle kids at different levels?" Not "what's your teacher-student ratio?" but "how do conflicts get resolved?" Not "what are your test scores?" but "what does a typical day look like?"

### How to Start a Microschool (400 words)

**The founder profile:** Almost all tried reform first. Peggy Lowe's 12 years of committees. Ginger's Post-it prophecy. These aren't entrepreneurs—they're exhausted educators and parents who couldn't wait for change anymore.

**The support ecosystem:**

- Prenda: Full curriculum, no education degree needed
- National Microschooling Center: Resources and networking
- State incubators: Mississippi's 15+ new schools model
- KaiPod Catalyst: 2-year post-launch support

**The psychological hurdle:** Kristin's "18-month undoing" isn't just personal—it's what every founder faces. Letting go of what school "should" look like to discover what it could be.

**The practical reality:** Minimum viable microschool: 8 families, $40,000 budget, part-time schedule, shared space. This isn't fantasy—it's happening in church basements and community centers nationwide.

### Online Microschools (300 words)

**The hybrid solution:** KaiPod's model: online curriculum, in-person support. This isn't online school with supervision—it's recognizing that digital tools plus human connection beats either alone.

**The unbundling principle:** Families choosing:

- Math from Khan Academy
- Writing from local teacher
- Science from online program
- Social time from microschool
- PE from community sports

This isn't educational chaos—it's educational curation.

### The Future of Microschooling (400 words)

**The three-phase evolution:**

_Phase 1 (happening now):_ Individual schools serving specific communities _Phase 2 (emerging):_ Networks providing infrastructure while preserving autonomy

_Phase 3 (coming):_ Complete educational unbundling where families compose education from multiple sources

**The resistance points:**

- Quality control without standardization
- Equity without uniformity
- Scale without losing humanity

**The deeper implications:** Microschools aren't alternative education—they're revealing education's future: personalized, flexible, values-explicit, community-embedded. They're proving that the industrial model wasn't inevitable—it was just one option.

### Your Microschool Journey with OpenEd (250 words)

OpenEd enables the educational multiverse. Through ESA funding and support:

- Try a semester, not a decade
- Mix approaches without financial penalty
- Change as your child develops
- Access quality without wealth

The concrete next steps:

1. Identify your non-negotiables (values, schedule, approach)
2. Research local options using provided directories
3. Visit during regular hours
4. Apply for OpenEd funding
5. Start with part-time if unsure

The close: You're not choosing a school. You're choosing how your child will experience learning, community, and growth. For the first time in American history, that choice is actually yours to make.

Final line: The educational future isn't about better schools. It's about better choices. And those choices are here, now, in church basements and converted yoga studios and yes, in vans.

This outline maintains SEO requirements while building the argument that microschools represent fundamental choice architecture change, not just smaller schools. Each section connects to the central thesis while providing practical information parents need.

# Microschools concept overview

Microschools are small, innovative learning environments that blend the personalization of homeschooling with the community aspect of traditional schools. Here's what characterizes them:

## [The US is experiencing a boom in microschools. What are they?](https://www.notion.so/The-US-is-experiencing-a-boom-in-microschools-What-are-they-048523d7b82b494b92ab7117cda6e8de?pvs=21)

![](https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/04/Micro-schools_040624_Photo_Getty.png?w=1280)

## **Story at a glance**

- There has been a surge in new microschools in the U.S. since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- The National Microschooling Network estimates there are about 95,000 microschools in the country. The median microschool serves 16 students.
- There is no regulatory body solely responsible for tracking microschools, so it is difficult to determine just how much their popularity has grown.

Microschools have experienced a boom in popularity since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The tiny schools, which have a median student body size of 16, have been described as a modern reinvention of the one-room school house, where children of varying ages receive personalized instruction from a teacher in the same room.

Supporters view them as liberating. Skeptics, however, worry over their educational quality.

It’s unclear how many microschools existed in the United States before 2020 or just how many more opened during the early days of the pandemic, given that most took the form of informal learning pods, according to National Microschooling Center CEO Dan Soifer.

But the number “definitely jumped” during the 2020-21 academic year, Soifer told The Hill.

Now, about 1.5 million children attend one of the country’s roughly 95,000 microschools, according to Soifer, roughly the same number that study at [Catholic schools.](https://ncea.org/NCEA/NCEA/Who_We_Are/About_Catholic_Schools/Catholic_School_Data/Enrollment_and_Staffing.aspx)

Advocates for microschools say they offer some students — especially those who are gifted or have learning disabilities — a greater chance to thrive academically and socially than traditional schools do.

At Sphinx Academy, a micro-school based in Lexington, Ky., almost all 24 students are “twice exceptional,” meaning they are gifted in one academic area but have one or more learning disabilities like ADHD or dyslexia, according to the school’s director Jennifer Lincoln.

“There’s gifted education and there’s special education, but there are not a lot of resources for students with an overlap in those two,” said Lincoln.

The tiny classroom size and personal instruction at Sphinx allows students with different levels of mastery in different subjects to receive the attention they need, she said.

Microschools can offer some kids dealing with physical or mental health issues an easier way to study than traditional schools.

Sixteen-year-old Layla Robertson, for instance, was homeschooled during grade school and later on during the pandemic because of a health condition before entering Sphinx.

“I got to the point where I wanted to go back to school but I thought big schools would overwhelm me,” Robertson told The Hill. “It wasn’t an environment that I felt like I could be calm and get my work done in.”

Robertson eventually decided to attend Sphinx because of its small size.

Microschools can also appeal to kids who feel like they just don’t fit in at other schools.

This was the case for 15-year-old Madeliene Mischen, who struggled to fit in at her private, religious school in Lexington during the pandemic.

She quickly realized that Sphinx Academy was a place she wanted to attend after shadowing a student for a day.

“I’m queer and I saw a lot of other queer students and I thought ‘oh wow, they’re open and accepting here,’” Mischen said.

Sphinx Academy is a nationally accredited and Kentucky-certified school. But in this regard, it is an exception in the microschooling world.

There is no single regulatory body monitoring microschools, which experts fear means there are no quality backstops to ensure kids are receiving an adequate education.

Most microschools are also not accredited. In a survey of 400 microschools across the country shared with The Hill from the National Microschooling Center, only 16 percent said they were accredited in their state.

This is because many microschools operate as learning centers for homeschooled students and therefore do not need any accreditation.

Others function as private schools, which do not need to be accredited nor have certified teachers in most states.

The world of accreditation among private K-12 schools in the United States is notoriously murky. There is no federal accreditation requirement for K-12 schools “where schools must meet standards for performance,” according to reporting from [Education Next.]([https://www.educationnext.org/k-12-accreditations-next-move-storied-guarantee-looks-to-accountability-2-0/#:~:text=There are no federal accreditation,meet state standards for performance.)](https://www.educationnext.org/k-12-accreditations-next-move-storied-guarantee-looks-to-accountability-2-0/#:~:text=There%20are%20no%20federal%20accreditation,meet%20state%20standards%20for%20performance.\))

At the state level, laws accrediting private schools vary. And accreditation is almost never legally required for private schools and is only required for public schools in about 20 states, according to the outlet.

Florida, for example, a current hotbed for microschools, does not require K-12 schools to be accredited, nor is accreditation or the lack thereof reported to the public.

Nevada, another state with a growing microschool population, also does not require it. And both states, like most others, do not require private school teachers to have [a teaching certificate.](https://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/non-public-education/regulation-map/arizona.html)

This lack of oversight and clarity in what coursework is offered at microschools in part echoes the concerns which drove the U.S. to eventually do away with from the one-room schoolhouse and adopt more organized and unified school systems, according to Jen Jennings, director of Princeton University’s [Education Research Section.](https://ers.princeton.edu/about)

As a result of that shift, states promised kids a certain level of education quality, Jennings added.

“So, the concern with microschools … and any form of state-funded education where there is no quality backstop is that we simply just don’t know what kids are getting,” Jennings said.

Concerns over microschools’ lack of accreditation most often come up in states with Education Savings Accounts or voucher programs, according to Soifer.

Under those programs, the state sets aside funds for students who opt out of the public school system in favor of a private or charter school.

Last year saw a surge in states adopting or expanding school voucher programs, including [Florida, Iowa, Utah and Oklahoma.](https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/the-states-where-school-choice-took-centerstage-and-won-in-2023-iowa-utah-florida-arkansas-idaho-indiana-oklahoma-tennessee-alabama-nebraska-montana-kansas-new-hampshire-wisconsin-louisana-south-carolina-ohio-voucher-private-charter-public-funding)

“The worry with a setup like that is that folks are doing right by the students that they are taking money on behalf of,” said Jennings.

## [Where Seldom is Heard a Discouraging Word: Farm-based Microschools](https://www.notion.so/Where-Seldom-is-Heard-a-Discouraging-Word-Farm-based-Microschools-106e2872df2c42d3bcd3a9786cec2aaf?pvs=21)

![](https://www.gettingsmart.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/vecteezy_holding-milk-cute-little-african-american-boy-with-european_16727801-scaled.jpg)

Fundamentally, a microschool can be located anywhere. These nimble schooling models, while at the forefront of current education innovation, are a return to education at its most elemental. Microschools are a modern iteration of the age-old one-room schoolhouse concept, where small groups of students engage in often personalized and experience-based learning experiences. These schools often cater to mixed-age groups, allowing for flexible curriculum adaptations based on individual student needs, interests, and learning paces. The intimate setting fosters close relationships between students and teachers, creating a supportive and collaborative learning environment.

On top of that, the location can have an outsized effect on connecting learners to place and rich learning opportunities. Farms provide a rich canvas for educational exploration, offering hands-on experiences that cannot be replicated in traditional classroom settings. The farm environment teaches children about biology, ecology, and agriculture through direct interaction with plants and animals. Moreover, it imbues in them a profound respect for nature, an understanding of the food cycle, and the importance of sustainable living practices. These schools can be leveraged, especially effectively in rural communities, to provide accessible options for families.

I’m reminded of _Lessons from a Calf,_ a great documentary where elementary-age students in Japan take care of a cow at a nearby farm and through the process learn valuable skills and lessons in economics and math, caretaking, and life.

[https://www.youtube.com/embed/SBeUhZ0L_b0?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1&origin=https://www.gettingsmart.com](https://www.youtube.com/embed/SBeUhZ0L_b0?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1&origin=https://www.gettingsmart.com)

### The Integration of Curriculum

Like _Lessons from a Calf_, at the heart of the microschool on a farm concept is the seamless integration of traditional academic subjects with farm-based activities. Mathematics can be taught through the measurement of planting beds, calculating the growth rates of crops, or managing the farm’s budget. Science comes alive in the study of plant and animal life cycles, weather patterns, and ecological balance. History and geography lessons can revolve around the origins of farming, the significance of agriculture in civilization development, and the study of landforms and climates in farm management.

Some farm schools are fortunate to have a farm or agriculture-based asset within the district, while not necessarily being a farm-based school. A great example of this is the [Dairy Sheep Project in Weston School District](https://www.weston.k12.wi.us/page/dairy-sheep) where students learn to care for the sheep and lambs, milking the ewes to use in the sheep milk soap and gelato they sell.

While visiting the [STEAD School](https://www.thesteadschool.org/) in Colorado, not a microschool but located on a former farm, I learned that through four agricultural pathways (animal, plant, environmental, food science) they are able to map students to over 3,000 career possibilities. These combinations of community assets (farms) and tailored instruction are capable of meaningfully setting students up for success in what’s next.

### Examples in the Wild

In Northeast Ohio, Kelly Clark runs a democratic, farm-based microschool called [More Than a Farm](https://morethanafarm.org/cvlc-main/). Her multifaceted experience includes years as a STEM teacher at the innovative Hawken School (alma mater for me and my kids), where she worked closely with education luminaries like Scott Looney (of MTC fame); permaculture design and implementation; and leading the nascent local Transition movement.

Also in Northeast Ohio, [Hershey Montessori School](https://hershey-montessori.org/) is an AMI accredited Montessori school with the first farm-based adolescent community. Students from birth through high school learn on two campuses: up to sixth year in a traditional suburban Montessori environment and seventh through twelfth on a working farm. The adolescent boarding option attracts international students and educators from around the world to visit, observe, and attend a unique summer residential certification program for adolescent Montessori practice.

[Farm School KC](https://www.farmschoolkc.org/curriculum) offers a “unique Montessori education for middle and high school students in Kansas City, focusing on the development of self-awareness, community contribution, leadership, empathy, and critical thinking skills. The curriculum includes real-world learning on a 10-acre farm, providing an educational experience that combines academic rigor with practical, hands-on agricultural and environmental studies. Located on the campus of Clay-Platte Montessori School, it provides a serene, natural setting conducive to learning and personal growth.”

[Koshkonong Trails School](https://www.cambridge.k12.wi.us/o/koshkonong) is a “project-based, tuition-free, public charter school within the School District of Cambridge serving 7th – 12th grade students. Located on a working farm in Cambridge, Wisconsin the program orients around place-based projects designed by students to impact the local and regional community. With experiential education at the core, students focus on conservation, stewardship, and agriculture as well as traditional subjects as they work to support the farm.”

[Wild Flower Community School](https://www.facebook.com/WFschoolICT) a microschool in Wichita, Kansas is a public-private partnership with Kansas public schools, allowing students to attend tuition free. This doesn’t cover all microschool costs, however, as they also rely on charitable donations and are a part of the national Prenda microschool network. This school currently serves 35 students, most with specialized learning needs. Thus far, the demand for the environment and personalized components has outpaced the supply.

Co-locating and partnering with a farm can be a great way to build a more sustainable school and concept. In South Florida, [Colossal Academy](https://vela.org/learning-and-growing-with-colossal-academy/), a microschool, is integrating agriculture into its curriculum to nurture future leaders, entrepreneurs, and farmers. The school enrolls 20 students between the ages of 10-14, who dedicate three days each week to farm-based learning. This hands-on experience takes place in a yurt, where they acquire skills in farming, cooking, and technology, alongside their fundamental academic education. The remaining two days are reserved for online learning. Starting from the 2022-23 academic year, the academy will introduce a five-day in-person learning option.

### In Conclusion

The journey through the concept of microschools situated on farms illuminates a promising horizon for education, where learning transcends the confines of traditional classrooms and becomes a dynamic, immersive experience. This model showcases how integrating agriculture into education not only enhances academic learning but also cultivates a generation of learners who are environmentally conscious and equipped with practical skills for sustainable living. As we reflect on the transformative potential of such educational settings, it becomes evident that the fusion of microschools and farm-based learning could redefine the educational landscape, making it more relevant, engaging, and meaningful for students in an ever-evolving world.

### 💡 THOUGHT

## **ORDINARY HEROES**

When you picture a school founder, who comes to mind? A tweed-jacketed professor? A billionaire with a fondness for naming buildings?

Try this instead: the homeschool mom down your street.

Enter Dalena Wallace, Kansas's unofficial Microschool Maven and Queen of Customized Education. A homeschooling mom of six who had an epiphany: "Ten years in, homeschooling my kids, I realized—this is hard. I need community."

So she did what entrepreneurs do. She solved her own problem.

She opened her home. Invited a few friends. They shared teaching duties. Three families became five, became ten, became a 16-family co-op.

No education degree necessary. No million-dollar endowment. No permission slip from the Department of Education.

This isn't isolated. Across America, regular folks—moms, dads, pastors, business owners—are stepping up. They see a need, have a vision, and start building.

The revolution isn't coming from education departments or policy think tanks. It's happening in living rooms and church basements.

Turns out you don't need special credentials to create extraordinary learning environments. You just need to care enough to start.

### 📊 TREND

## **THE GREAT EDUCATION MIGRATION**

National School Choice Awareness Foundation's latest data:

⬇️ Traditional public schools: 22% decrease

⬆️ Private/faith-based schools: 24% increase

⬆️ Homeschooling: 39% increase

⬆️ Microschooling/hybrid learning: 220% increase

No, that's not a typo. 220% jump in families considering microschools.

This isn't a pandemic blip or passing fad. It's education's tectonic plates shifting.

What's driving it? Parents want:

- Schedules that work for actual humans
- Input on what their kids learn
- Community without conformity

As Dalena put it: "We've realized traditional private schools don't have to be so expensive, five days a week, or in traditional buildings."

The freedom is contagious. One family breaks free, others notice. They ask: "Wait, we can do that?"

Yes. Yes you can.

### 🔨 TOOL

## **PRENDA: MICROSCHOOL IN A BOX**

Ever wanted to start a microschool but got stuck on the how? [Prenda](https://prenda.com/) might be your answer.

Dalena Wallace's microschool journey began here: "I opened a Prenda Microschool in my home as part of a Kansas pilot program. It completely turned me on to the idea that anybody can do this."

Think of Prenda as "microschool with training wheels." They provide:

- **Ready-to-use curriculum** (aligned to standards but actually interesting)
- **Guide training** (so you facilitate, not lecture)
- **Administrative backend** (handling paperwork while you handle minds)
- **Community connection** (because pioneers need fellow travelers)
- **Funding pathways** (in states with school choice or ESAs)

The formula is refreshingly simple: 5-10 kids, one adult guide, a learning space. Mix well.

What separates Prenda from DIY? They've battle-tested their model with thousands of students. They've made the mistakes so you don't have to.

It's perfect for homeschool co-ops ready to level up, or educators wanting to build something human-scale. Prenda offers the framework of an established system with the soul of a community effort.

Educators within and outside of the traditional public school system are recognizing the popularity ... More of microschools.

getty

As microschools and similarly personalized educational models spread quickly across the U.S., visionary educators working within traditional public schools are taking notice. These “intrapraneurs” are embracing the spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation that is fueling the growth of new schools and learning spaces in the private sector, and they are bringing that enterprising attitude to their own schools and school districts.

George Philhower is one of them. As Superintendent of the Eastern Hancock public school district in rural Charlottesville, Indiana, Philhower first heard about microschooling during the Covid pandemic, and saw the growing appeal of these smaller, more flexible learning communities that tailor curriculum and instruction to each child’s individual needs. He began to wonder if there was a way to bring the microschooling model into the public school system.

“I’ve spent my entire career trying to figure out how to create school experiences that kids actually love—places where they feel seen, safe, challenged and inspired,” said Philhower, who started out as a public school special education teacher more than two decades ago. “Over time, I’ve become convinced that to truly achieve that, we need a level of personalization that’s hard to accomplish within traditional school structures. That’s where the microschool model comes in.”

PROMOTED

Two years of conversations and planning culminated in the creation of the Indiana Microschooling Collaborative, a nonprofit organization that gained [approval](https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/2025/05/14/philhower-eastern-hancock-take-lead-role-in-indiana-microschool-collaborative/) earlier this month from the Indiana Charter School Board to operate the state’s first network of public charter-microschools. Like all charter schools, these IMC schools will be tuition-free public schools, with the first location set to open within the Eastern Hancock school district this fall. The goal is for these IMC microschools to eventually expand statewide.

Philhower is leading the IMC network and overseeing the launch of the new microschools, while continuing in his role as Eastern Hancock Superintendent. This collaboration is intentional. Philhower says that the IMC network and the school district are fully aligned in their enthusiasm for the microschooling model and are eager to work together to innovate public schooling from within. “If we want to create schools where every kid wakes up excited to attend, it’s going to take both transforming existing systems and building new ones that can serve as models,” said Philhower. “Personally, I also want to break down the walls that separate different types of schools.”

In addition to charter schools and intra-district and cross-district “open enrollment” options that enable students to choose a different public school, Indiana is among the 16 states that have introduced universal private school-choice programs in the past few years. These programs enable all school-age children to be eligible to use a portion of education funding for private educational options, including microschools.

Philhower believes it is good for families to have options when it comes to a child’s education. Currently, 40 percent of the 1,200 students in his Eastern Hancock school district are choosing to attend from other districts. That’s an incentive for Philhower and his colleagues at both Eastern Hancock and IMC to continue to innovate, as they compete with a growing assortment of public and private educational choices. “IMC is designed to offer a free, public option for families who might otherwise choose homeschooling or leave the public system altogether, while still wanting support, structure and a clear path to a diploma,” he said.

Microschools and various homeschooling collaboratives are often able to respond quickly and creatively to the needs and preferences of parents and students, which is why their popularity has grown in both Indiana and across the country. Jill Haskins, a former public school teacher turned Indiana homeschooling mom and microschool founder, has seen this growth firsthand. She created the [Indiana Microschool Network](https://www.facebook.com/p/Indiana-Microschool-Network-61560221624214/) to support microschool founders and families, and also works closely with the National Microschooling Center on outreach efforts in Indiana and beyond. In 2023, Haskins knew of only six microschools in Indiana. Today, she says there are over 130 microschools in the state, with new ones regularly opening.

This microschooling momentum creates an opportunity for education “intrapraneurs” working within the traditional public school system to emulate the innovations occurring around them to attract and retain families. New resources, such as the [Public Microschool Handbook](https://www.gettingsmart.com/whitepaper/public-microschool-playbook/why-and-why-now-the-case-for-public-microschools/), aim to help public school educators to launch and lead new microschools within their school systems. Published this month by Transcend Education, the Getting Smart Collective and Learner-Centered Collaborative, the Handbook is a comprehensive guide for public microschool leaders, offering tips and action items for each stage of the launch process. My [new book](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/kerry-mcdonald/joyful-learning/9781541705524/?lens=publicaffairs) on the proliferation of innovative K-12 learning models also has a chapter dedicated to these "intrapreneurs" and the steps they can take to make change internally.

Educators within and outside of the traditional public school system are recognizing the rising demand for smaller, more personalized, more learner-centered educational models like microschools. In Indiana, Haskins is thrilled that a new charter-microschool network is emerging alongside the state’s robust independent microschooling sector. “I believe that microschooling, in general, is a really great option for families and what better way to create systemic change in the public schools than by having public schools open microschools,” she said, adding that she hopes the rise of public microschooling won’t compromise the originality and autonomy of private microschools. “My one concern about public microschools is that the Indiana Department of Education is going to assume that the public sector is exactly like the private sector and the implications of that could be stifling for the private microschools. Our approaches are very different.”

I reached out to the Indiana Department of Education for comment but did not hear back. The assumption that public microschools and private microschools could be viewed the same by a state education department, whether in Indiana or elsewhere, isn’t a given, but it is something for microschool supporters to be on the lookout for as public microschooling grows.

## [Small Schools, Big Umbrella: Expanding, Defining and Scaling the Microschool Ecosystem](https://www.notion.so/Small-Schools-Big-Umbrella-Expanding-Defining-and-Scaling-the-Microschool-Ecosystem-1282c6c15b3a4349be39648bb3e0f5a6?pvs=21)

### Busting the Myth of Educational Either/Ors

Remember when educational options felt like a multiple-choice test with only two answers? Those days are going away.

As a recent article on Getting Smart points out, the explosion of educational models – from microschools and homeschool co-ops to part-time enrichment programs, from virtual academies to workplace-based learning centers – is revealing a crucial truth: the future of education isn't about choosing sides, it's about personalizing education for each student. But here's where we take it a step further: Open Education isn't just about picking from a wider menu of school types. It's about dismantling the menu altogether and empowering learners to create their own educational recipe from scratch.

This shift isn't just happening in the private sector. Public schools are getting in on the act, launching R&D models and satellite programs that break the mold of traditional education. Even universities and businesses are joining in, creating lab schools and work-based learning models.

The real revolution here isn't any single model – it's the freedom to mix and match. Open Education says you're not limited to what any one school or system offers. Instead, you're the architect of your own learning journey.

So next time someone asks about your educational philosophy, don't feel pressured to pick a team. In the world of Open Education, the only label that matters is "customized."

Microschools, while not a new concept, are currently garnering increasing attention as an educational innovation. Microschools are small learning environments with typically less than 150 students that offer personalized and student-centered learning experiences. Teachers hungry for more autonomy, families seeking personalized learning, and the constraints of education budgets are all fueling the demand for microschools. Last Fall, Getting Smart collaborated with the Walton Family Foundation on the [Big Push for Small Schools](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2023/12/06/ten-innovative-educational-programs-awarded-grants-to-transform-learning/) grant program to foster a network of microschool leaders by offering grants to propel the development of these innovative learning spaces, focusing on operators looking to scale their high-quality models. Yet, the question remains: what does it mean to scale a microschool? And, how broad is the microschool landscape?

### Charting the Microschool Landscape

The microschool landscape has grown tremendously in both public and private sectors. Our early research classified microschools into [four unique categories](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2024/02/26/the-role-of-microschool-incubators-nurturing-the-future-of-education/): operators, intermediaries, schools within schools or programs, and incubators. Through continued efforts within our microschool initiatives, we’ve identified a more complex ecosystem that exists with both the private and public sectors, as well as unique public-private partnerships. Additionally, **homeschools** and **learning pods** (multi-family) fall into the microschool landscape. While we have articulated a number of elements across the landscape, we also acknowledge the overlap in some of these models. By naming the elements within the landscape, all educators and parents can see opportunities for more options across all sectors to better serve their students and children.

### **Growth and Scaling Microschools**

When we hear the term scaling as it relates to growth, we often loosely define it as simply expanding. Harvard’s business school defines scaling as “_a business growing revenue more quickly than its costs”_ and growth as “_the process of increasing revenues and resources at an even rate.”_ But how does that translate to microschools?

Growth in microschools refers to the process of increasing enrollment, resources, and educational offerings – usually at a single site. This might include adding more teachers, expanding facilities, or introducing new programs to meet the needs of a growing student population.

Scaling in microschools involves expanding the reach and impact of the educational model while maintaining or improving the quality of education provided. This expansion might include impacting more students by increasing the number of campuses or developing partnerships with other educational institutions.

As the demand for innovation and personalized learning options grows, so does the need for microschools. This demand can be met by both growth and scaling approaches.

### Scaling Microschools in the Private Sector

A significant number of private microschools have launched over the last four years. Leading the charge in fostering the proliferation of microschools are organizations such as [VELA](https://vela.org/), [National Microschool Center,](https://microschoolingcenter.org/) and [Microschool Solutions](https://www.microschool-solutions.com/), which stand as prominent networks of _edupreneurs_ that offer alternatives to conventional schooling. Some of these microschool leaders want to expand their reach deep and not wide. Private-sector microschools can scale their model through decentralized or centralized networks.

In **decentralized networks**, microschools codify their framework for replication by others. This form of scaling gives the school leader full autonomy of their own site while utilizing an existing framework. Although this type of scaling involves some risk in quality control, it provides leadership with autonomy to tailor a school model to the community it serves–a primary objective for many microschools. This idea of replicating a specific school model is not new ([model-provider networks exist in both private and public sectors](https://www.newschools.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Model-Providers-Pathways-to-Innovation.pdf)). Still, it has been adopted by microschools like [Insight Colearning](https://www.insightcolearning.org/) which joined the One Stone growth network as an entire replication site.

Other private microschools scaled their impact through more **centralized efforts.** This allows them to maintain the quality and assurance of their model by opening and operating multiple sites and building a centralized affiliate network. Notably, private model-provider networks or intermediaries like [Prenda](https://www.prenda.com/), [Acton Academy,](https://www.actonacademy.org/) and [Wildflower Schools](https://www.wildflowerschools.org/) operate in this way through direct operational support and sharing tools or resources. For example, growing networks like [Primer](https://primer.com/) are leveraging technology to share human capital across their network.

Intermediaries can also function as operators. For instance, Kaipod is utilizing a hybrid learning model to grow and scale its model into a centralized network while also growing its network of decentralized affiliated schools and homeschooling cooperatives, referred to as learning partners.

These private, microschool networks primarily utilize a tuition-based model, with some accessing public funds through Educational Savings Accounts (ESAs) or engaging in charter partnerships, like that seen between [Sequoia](https://sequoiacharterschools.com/) and the [Black Mothers Forums](https://blackmothersforums.com/). While much attention has focused on these private-sector solutions, a robust microschool ecosystem has existed and continues to evolve in the public sector as well.

### Scaling Microschools in the Public Sector

Microschools in the public sector are not a new concept. These include the original one-room schoolhouses, existing rural schools, and the school within a school model. However, with the emerging growth of the private microschools sector, new models are surfacing and existing models are rebranding, utilizing microschools as platforms for researching, designing, and scaling equitable practices in the public sector.

We have also found that microschools can exist within a district to provide unique and niche offerings, similar to that of a magnet choice school. These **program-specific models** are designed to support niche offerings in the school that is not intended to scale throughout the district. [EDGE High School](https://www.lps53.org/edge) (Liberty Public Schools, MO) and [Iowa Big](https://iowabig.org/) (Cedar Rapids, IA) both serve as specific programs within or across districts that are distinctly different from the other educational programs.

**R&D models** are designed around a larger district’s intention for a learning model and hope to diffuse ideas through a school district. Issaquah School District (WA), Lamont Elementary School District (CA) and Escondido School District (CA) are all designing and launching microschools. Some districts like Denver Public Schools (partnering with [Launch microschools](https://stedman.dpsk12.org/welcome/academics/launch-microschools/)) or Mesa Public Schools (partnering with [Prenda](https://www.prenda.com/) in Arizona) find that existing intermediaries can facilitate faster launch efforts.

For many years, high schools have built **school within a school models**, sometimes encompassing all learning experiences at the school. [Laguna Creek High School](https://lchs.egusd.net/Programs/CTE-Academies-and-Pathways/index.html) (CA) offers a number of career-related microschool models within the larger comprehensive high school. Especially in high schools, CTE pathway programs are becoming increasingly prevalent to better prepare young people for the world of work.

[ASU Prep Microschools](https://www.asuprepdigital.org/asu-prep-digital-plus/) (now ASU Prep Digital Plus), [Gem Prep Learning Societies](https://gemprep.org/learningsocieties/), and [Purdue Polytech High Schools Lab School](https://www.chalkbeat.org/indiana/2024/04/16/indianapolis-charter-school-creates-microschool-to-customize-education/) are examples of public schools launching **satellite microschools** in multiple sites but using similar learning model structures as their original bricks/mortar sites (these three examples are all charter schools/networks). ASU Prep co-locates within ASU facilities and taps into university expertise while enrolling students in ASU Prep Digital programs. Gem Prep Learning Societies enroll students in Gem Prep Online programs while hosting small groups of students in rural sites around Idaho. Purdue Poly launched its first microschool in 2023-24 to expand access outside of their main campus sites.

**Lab Schools,** while sometimes larger than typical microschools, serve as training and support locations for schools of education. [University of North Carolina](https://www.northcarolina.edu/unc-laboratory-schools/) operates a number of lab schools at university campuses across the state – in partnership with local districts.

Businesses are also catching up to the idea of co-locating microschools as a **work-based learning model**. These models have the potential to provide robust real-world learning experiences while leveraging the microschool as a pipeline for future recruitment. [GPS Education Partners](https://gpsed.org/education-center-youth-apprenticeship/) runs a set of district-supported, business co-located learning centers in Wisconsin for students to gain work-based learning experiences through apprenticeship models.

School districts and universities aren’t the only systems scaling microschools in the public sector.  Public service institutions and organizations such as [libraries](https://www.e3civichigh.com/), [zoos](https://www.gettingsmart.com/podcast/talking-learner-experience-at-the-zoo/), [farms](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2024/05/02/where-seldom-is-heard-a-discouraging-word-farm-based-microschools/) and [museums](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2018/11/20/design-thinking-city-as-classroom-museum-as-homebase/) have the ability to co-locate microschools that are funded through public dollars to the organization.

### Public-Private Partnership Microschools

Although we’ve identified many ways in which microschools can exist both publicly and privately, that is not to say it must be either/or. Microschools are not monolithic. [My Tech High](https://www.mytechhigh.com/) and [Khan World Schoo](https://asuprep.asu.edu/khan-world-school/about-us/)l could be classified as **microschool provider models** that can be adopted by both public and private sectors. Moreover, **informal cooperative structures** that have existed for centuries operate within both sectors–leveraging partnerships with families and even charter school districts to grow and scale. In Snoqualmie Valley, the district runs a part-time 100+ student microschool for homeschooled elementary and middle school students as part of the [Parent Partnership Program](https://ppp.svsd410.org/our-school/our-school/about-parent-partnership-k-10).

### Conclusion

The diversification of school models reflects a broader understanding that one size does not fit all in education. Across public, private and innovative partnerships between public and private sectors, these microschool models represent a big tent of efforts aimed at making education not only more personalized but also more accessible and effective. By embracing these varied educational landscapes across the public and private sectors, communities can better cater to the diverse needs of learners, ensuring that every student has the opportunity to thrive in a changing world.

Microschools. You may have heard of them. But many don’t exactly know what they are. Don’t worry. This article will help fill you in on these amazing schools.

[Microschools](https://libertas.org/education-empowerment/6-benefits-of-microschools/) have become a catch-all term for the variety of school models. Though they have existed for over 20 years, they have rose in popularity due to the Covid 19 shutdowns.

Microschools are typically low-cost private schools. They range in size and feel. Some look similar to homeschool co-ops, operating out of homes. Others look more like a small private school, with enrollment over 100 students.

But all of these schools have one thing in common, they are doing something different from traditional schools. Some focus on keeping student to teacher ratios low. Some only have a student body of ten to fifteen students. Others focus on individualizing education, meeting with students one-on-on to regularly set goals. Students are then free to go as fast or slow as they need.

Some microschools spend most of their time outdoors. While they are teaching in a similar manner to a traditional school. The natural setting helps students to remember what they learned. Some are homeschool supplements meeting twice a week to support families who can’t fully homeschool their children.

Because of their small nature, these schools are flexible. They are able to adjust their curriculum, pacing, or approach quickly. These changes are crucial to helping students accelerate learning.

**Here are some Examples**

[Breakout School](https://www.breakoutschool.org/) is a microschool specifically designed for students with ADHD or Autism. Its founder Dal Richardson believes that both of these diagnoses are his student’s superpowers. Unlike a traditional school, Breakout School spends 80-90% of their day outside. Dr. Richardson reports that most of these students hate school when they come to him. But after experiencing his unique approach, they leave his school with a new found love of learning. His approach allows students to go at their own speed and take breaks as needed. This method allows his students to thrive and when they return to traditional schools they excel academically.

[Family Lyceum](https://www.familylyceum.com/) is a homeschool supplement designed to provide families with the sense of community they may have received from a traditional school. Renae Zentz founded her school to support families similar to hers, those who wanted to individualize their child’s education, while still having a community to work with. Her unique approach allows working families to homeschool, while being supported by Family Lyceum.

![](https://libertas.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-04-at-9.39.14%E2%80%AFAM.png)

[Slope School](https://slope.school/), [Choice Academy](https://choice-education.org/), and [Acton St. George](https://www.actonstgeorge.com/) are all Acton Academies. These schools emphasize individualizing education for students. Students are responsible for their own learning, but use adult guides to set and achieve their goals. Together with their parents, students decide what curriculum they will use and what topics they will study. The mornings are often dedicated to math and reading time, and the afternoons allow students to follow their passions. Students are also responsible for all of the rules. The guides check in with students regularly, but they do not micromanage the child’s learning. Rather, the guides help the student brainstorm ways to learn the information on their own.

Microschools exist [all over the state and nation](https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/education/what-are-microschools/). More parents are choosing them as the main way to educate their children. I personally have a few kids participating in a microschool. In fact, [one in ten parents]([https://www.edchoice.org/engage/poll-suggests-10-of-school-parents-are-microschooling-their-kids/#:~:text=About one in 10 (10,interest in broadly defined microschooling.)](https://www.edchoice.org/engage/poll-suggests-10-of-school-parents-are-microschooling-their-kids/#:~:text=About%20one%20in%2010%20\(10,interest%20in%20broadly%20defined%20microschooling.\)) are choosing microschools across the nation. You should check out the microschool options in your neighborhood. You may find the perfect fit for your child.

## Rough Transcript OUR OWN PODCAST

Isaac (00:01.25) Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm your sometimes host, Isaac Morehouse, CEO of Open Ed, and I'm joined today by a legend. I'm joined by Kerry McDonald, who's a senior fellow at the Foundation for Economic Education. She's the host of the Liberated podcast, the Liberated newsletter, the author of the book Unschooled, and a force to be reckoned with when it comes to opening education. So Kerry, welcome to the Open Ed podcast.

Kerry McDonald (00:30.706) It's such a pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me.

Isaac (00:33.72) Yeah, so I want to start out. You just mentioned something new that you're doing at Fee. So you've got the liberated podcast and newsletter, as I mentioned. What is the Ed Entrepreneurship Lab? Can you tell me about it?

Kerry McDonald (00:47.4) Yeah, it's really exciting. We just launched it this month, the Education Entrepreneurship Lab at Fee. Basically, the idea was, you I came on to add my senior fellow role at Fee in the spring of 2019, talking about innovative education, the entrepreneurs that were creating new schooling models, the growth and diversification of homeschooling and other sort of decentralized education possibilities. And then COVID hit, all the interest in that.

world exploded. And so I continued to do a lot of writing in that space. I launched the podcast in the beginning of 2022, the Liberated podcast to feature the stories of these founders that were creating these new schools and spaces. And we've just realized that as momentum continues to grow, we wanted to have something even bigger. And so the education entrepreneurship lab, which I'm leading, includes Liberated as one

sort of initiative that we're working on, but it also includes some other things as well, including the Cole Summers Fellowship Program, which we launched a pilot of this past year that is a writing fellowship, sort of a platform creation fellowship program for teenagers who learn in unconventional education environments of them to be able to share their experiences.

The lab also includes a new Enterprising Founder Award program that we're just launching again this month that encourages school founders and others running these innovative education programs to apply and talk about how they embrace the freedom philosophy around individual freedom, free markets, entrepreneurship, private property, limited government, and how that's impacted their individual enterprises and their communities.

And then we also have a new entrepreneur in residence program where we're bringing on school founders, people running actual schools, these unconventional schools, and having them talk about their experiences as entrepreneurs running those programs. So it's an exciting time. We feel like there's so much momentum here. We just want to be a part of it.

Isaac (02:54.126) I love it. I love it. So everyone listening, if any of those things that Carrie just described fits you, you know where to go. The Fee and Innovators Lab. So Carrie, I'd love to start with a little bit of your personal story. I mean, I came across you, met you, I don't know, sometime in the 20 teens, just from your writings and very, very in line with my own.

beliefs about education, I was building Praxis or maybe Crash at the time, and so the idea of building private alternatives and giving people different options. But how did you get to this spot? Like, what's your background?

Kerry McDonald (03:32.04) Yeah, well, just to make a point on that, Isaac, you I featured you in my unschooled book. I interviewed you to hear about your story as a homeschooler and then creating Praxis. So that was very much a part of my unschooled book that came out in the spring of 2019. But my story really began back when I was an economics major as an undergrad many years ago. And I just fell in love with economics.

the economic way of thinking, was unlike anything I had encountered before.

Isaac (04:02.808) Wait, where were you going to school here? Because a lot of, I have met people, I remember way back in the day I was doing college campus work in Michigan and I met some people that were majoring in economics that I think it was Michigan State. And they had never heard of F .A. Hayek and I said, well, have you ever heard of the Austrian school? And they're like, what's that? I'm like, have you ever heard of the Chicago school? They're like, what do you mean school? And I'm like, do you know the concept of different schools of economics? And they were like, no. So not all economics majors are the same. Even the economic way of thinking is not always taught. Sometimes economics is more just,

Kerry McDonald (04:05.426) Mm.

Isaac (04:31.886) statistics and econometrics. So I'm curious where you did your undergrad and what type of economics you were learning.

Kerry McDonald (04:38.522) Yeah, my economics was much more of the sort of econometric statistics base. I was at a small liberal arts college, Bowdoin College in Maine. And so, you know, hadn't really discovered the Austrian School of Economics or any of the work that now is sort of pivotal to my writing and my outreach. But I just fell in love with this whole idea of economics and the incentives that

people have to produce, to consume, what is sort guiding human behavior? And I just really loved that. And one of the things that happened as I was studying economics was I started to wonder, why do we have so much choice and variety in so many of the sort of market -based parts of our lives that are operating within a free market, but we don't seem to have that choice and variety when it comes to education.

And then I sort of started going down that rabbit hole of, okay, so most of education is centrally controlled. It's government run in most cases. That's probably why we're not seeing that same level of personalization and variety in education. So then I became increasingly interested in education. I discovered the whole idea of homeschooling and had a chance to connect with a homeschooling family. My senior year of college was totally blown away because I had gone through K to 12 public schools and

never knew a homeschooler, never knew anything about kind of alternatives to school. So my mind was blown. I ended up getting a graduate degree in education policy and became more more interested in creative schooling options, alternative education and innovation. And at the time, if you're interested in any of that, and this was sort of the turn of the millennium, charter schools were where you focused. So I got a little bit more involved in the charter school world.

connected with the Pioneer Institute, a free market think tank in Boston. I was at Harvard at the time and so did some work with Pioneer that was incubating charter schools kind of in their early days. But still felt like that wasn't quite enough, that there has to be even more to education innovation than charter schools, which are typically taxpayer funded, tuition free, but privately run often by nonprofit organizations. So I felt like there still had to be more. And of course, I still was thinking about homeschooling and the

Kerry McDonald (07:00.336) what I had seen with that family that I had met. So just began writing more and more about innovative education models, became a mom myself, chose homeschooling for my children, specifically self -directed education or unschooling. And then, yeah, continued writing and writing and writing about that. And then, of course, COVID hit. And now here we are where more and more families recognize that teaching and learning can and should be different.

Isaac (07:26.328) Well, so you kind of like downplayed it. You know, it's all just these steps in this journey, but I'm guessing, and maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it was just very simple, gradual, and there wasn't really a moment, but there's usually a moment because, correct me if I'm wrong, I'm guessing that you probably did pretty well in the traditional school system. You probably got pretty good grades, seemed like you enjoy learning, you go into economics, you're doing well. Like, you don't strike me as someone who you were like, I always hated the school system, it was always terrible for me.

Kerry McDonald (07:56.516) Yeah, I mean, it really wasn't until that senior year of college when I was doing an independent research project and was able to shadow a homeschooling family and saw just how education could be outside of a conventional classroom, saw this sort of authentic socialization that this child had with the people, places, and things around her, saw her kind of natural curiosity and eagerness to learn and how at ease she was with adults. It was just so different from my experience. And at the same time,

that I was shadowing this homeschooling family, I was doing a student teaching practicum in a local public elementary school with same age students as this homeschooling family. And never before had I sort of seen side by side, you know, this conventional classrooms group of second graders and this homeschooled second grader. And it just couldn't have been more stark, even though of course I had gone through a public school that was almost identical demographically to that public school I was in as a student teaching practicum participant.

Isaac (08:55.66) You saw the, hey, look, these kids over here, they're not socialized and these ones are. And then you were like, well, maybe being socialized isn't what people say it is.

Kerry McDonald (09:00.006) Yeah.

Kerry McDonald (09:05.306) Yeah, was sort of everything that we talk about, Isaac. It's the sort of the age -segregated classroom and the top -down curriculum and the focus on order and compliance and obedience over creativity and curiosity and originality. Yeah.

Isaac (09:22.351) I wanted to pause on that moment though for a second because I think that's, you did something really important that requires some openness and I think like humility. A lot of people when they encounter, if the public school system didn't work for them at all and they really hated it and they didn't really understand why, and then they encounter something like homeschooling, they often have like a, it wasn't just me that was the problem.

But for people who really did well in that system, especially if they go into higher education, they're working on degrees or advanced degrees, having that experience where you're exposed to that, that can be a really hard moment where you're like, wait, so in order to say this maybe is a better way to learn, am I saying that I did things bad and the fact that I accept, like that takes, that's not easy to do, I think, to have that moment to say, there's something here that I might want to look at.

and that I might want to consider because the beliefs around schooling, the policies are obviously driving so much of the incentives as you mentioned. But the beliefs, the social norms and expectations are such a strong part of why people, the status quo bias in education, right? It's really hard to think outside of that status quo because there's a high social cost for doing it. So here you are succeeding within the traditional education environment.

and there's a bit of a social and reputational cost to deviating from that. So I'm curious if you ever faced a moment where you were like, am I gonna be an outcast if I go this route?

Kerry McDonald (10:54.92) I think one of the things I loved college and when I went to college, I think it was really where I rekindled my natural love of learning and reading and all of that. I felt like in the public school system, I was checking boxes. I was doing what I was told. I was doing well, as you said. I was succeeding, but I…

never read for pleasure. I was always just sort of what I needed to do to get the A to move on to the next step. And then I think when I was out of that system and in college, when I started reading for pleasure again and taking command of my own learning, falling in love with economics, which again, kind of blew my mind, I looked back on my education experience and said, wow, I was really well -schooled, but I don't feel well -educated.

And I think that that was a pivotal moment for me and has really guided my work since then.

Isaac (11:52.728) So right now, there's a lot of interesting things happening at once. I think, I know your focus is on sort of alternatives and private educational options and homeschooling, but I think a lot of the things that are happening there are actually a result of something that happens further upstream, which is changes in public schools, or at least changes in people's attitudes about public schools. And so it's kind of like,

You you sort of have your first wave of maybe early adopters with alternatives who are doing it for a positive reason. They're choosing something explicitly that they want. Maybe it's religious instruction or something like that, and they're going to those options. But then there's sort of the next wave, which is negative reasons. Hey, I'm experiencing things I don't want in the public school system. So first choice is I'm leaving. Then the second choice is.

Well, what am I going to do instead? And there's not necessarily a clear vision of what you're going to do instead. And I think, correct me if I'm wrong, but this is what I've kind of seen since COVID and you can see it in public school enrollment. The numbers are declining and a lot of public school administrators are kind of like trying to evade asking the question why and kind of like, it's demographics that we don't really know. but there's a reason when you ask parents, I mean, I'm a part of different homeschool co -ops and tutorials and

they're all getting flooded with new homeschoolers who are exiting the traditional system for specific reasons. They don't like what they're seeing. So I'm curious if you have a pulse on kind of the dissatisfaction. I think the satisfaction numbers, if you believe polls about public schools are the lowest that they've been in 50 years or something like that. I'm curious your take on like what's happening with public schools right now and why are so many people looking to exit?

Kerry McDonald (13:43.93) Yeah, I mean, think dissatisfaction is definitely a part of it. But I think the larger trend is really that we saw over the first couple of decades of the new millennium a rise in alternative education models, a rise in micro schools and micro school networks. Obviously, you were running Praxis, an alternative to college, kind of providing that hands -on apprenticeship opportunity for young people. We saw other kinds of self -directed learning centers for homeschoolers emerging.

There were all of these trends happening before 2020. And then when schools shut down and learning went remote for all of America's school children, all of a sudden parents started to have to be creative. They realized they had to start taking matters into their own hands because schools were in most places staying closed into the fall of 2020. And so you saw in the summer of 2020, this rise of pandemic.

pods, these sort of spontaneous parent -driven learning communities, parents saying, wow, you I have to look at what I need to do for my kids so that they can continue to learn, so they can have safe social interactions. So there was a real sense of parent empowerment. And that was occurring alongside remote learning as parents really for the first time in many cases got an up close view of what was actually happening in their students' classrooms. Some of it was dissatisfaction that they observed with the curriculum or...

the behaviors of teachers or students. But a lot of it from the parents and founders that I've talked to was, hey, I can do this. Like this isn't rocket science. So I think that that also really propelled parents to be empowered to seek or build education solutions for their kids while the kind of default local public school was shut down.

And so what happened was they looked, not only were they creating their own models, but they were also looking around and seeing, know, yeah, I knew about this homeschooling thing, or I knew about micro schooling, but I never really thought it was an option for me. And then they started to see that not only is this an option, it could be a better option. People in their communities are building these options. In many cases, certainly the vast majority of the founders I interviewed, these are former public school teachers who left.

Kerry McDonald (16:05.04) a conventional classroom to build a homeschooling collaborative, a micro school, a learning pod. So they saw that the people running these programs, you know, had a lot of credibility and gee, if they're leaving the system, maybe they're onto something there. And then that's just continued. The momentum continues to grow. You know, I see more and more micro schools emerging over the past couple of years, even then we're being created in kind of the first.

couple of years of school closures and education disruption caused by COVID. So this is not slowing down. And I think we're now seeing these network effects that are really catapulting this movement even further, because now parents know that if they're not satisfied with their child's schooling, they can and should look around. And they'll find that there are actually these

low -cost private schools that maybe they didn't know were that accessible to them, or maybe there are these kind of drop -off homeschooling programs that they can look into that will make homeschooling feasible for them. So there's a lot more, I think, parental awareness of what's available and more demand for unconventional options from parents.

And then of course, in the beauty of the market, more prospective entrepreneurs recognize the demand for these new models and go off and build them. So again, I just think we're at the very beginning of this movement towards much more decentralized, entrepreneur -driven, choice -enabled,

education alternatives, you know, we see the growth of school choice policies that enable education funding to follow families to whichever education setting they prefer, and that is also accelerating this trend.

Isaac (17:51.98) By the way, life hack for anybody, if you are waiting for your lawn guys to show up, start recording a podcast and they will show up and start weed whacking outside your window every time without fail. I just had, hopefully the noise doesn't come through. I really love what you said there because, and this is why you are the legend, because I was getting so hyped and inspired as you were talking there. The...

premise that I laid out that like, hey, maybe it was the dissatisfaction with the status quo that's driven all this innovation is not entirely untrue. But I think what you teased out is you're sharing like what you're hearing from people who are actually starting micro schools or going to micro schools or going pulling out of the traditional approach for some form of alternative was more about what they saw they could do. And so it makes me think, go back to our

Austrian economics, which we've already mentioned on here my favorite economist Ludwig von Mises He talks about three preconditions for humans taking any action you have to have dissatisfaction with the status quo a vision of something better and a belief in your ability to get there and if you don't have all three of those conditions you're not gonna act and so The dissatisfaction maybe that's not so much the new part Maybe that's kind of always been there in the background like yeah, maybe there's things I dislike about this, but it's

If you believe that that's all there is, you don't have a vision of anything better or belief in the ability to get there, you won't act. And then the second part, okay, maybe there's a vision. Maybe I've heard of other schools, private schools, maybe even micro schools or homeschooling, but I don't have a belief in my ability to get there. That seems out of reach for me. I don't think I'm capable of that. And then when the pandemic hit, you suddenly were forced to be the one that tried to help your kids get education in some way.

and you just realized, hey, I can get there. And that third condition was fulfilled. Okay, the dissatisfaction is there and I can see something better. And guess what? I actually can do it. This isn't that hard. It's more of a positive experience of what people are capable of and what kids are capable of. The number of parents I heard say, yeah, my kid kind of just like didn't do anything for the first several weeks when school was canceled. And it didn't really hurt them. They were okay.

Isaac (20:03.8) they're okay, they're not like hopelessly behind, they're not gonna be incapable of navigating life or learning to read or whatever. And that realization that kids are gonna be okay, they can learn with more freedom and less structure and that parents are gonna be okay, the burden is not maybe as heavy as you thought it was to ensure that your kids are gonna have an educational experience. I just think that was such a pivotal moment to put gasoline on a fire of a trend that I think was sort of steady.

homeschooling and increasing in options was steadily upticking, but now it's going crazy. I mean, it's 20 % plus per year. If again, the numbers around things like homeschooling are very dubious, but if you believe them.

Kerry McDonald (20:44.496) Yeah, and I think you make an interesting point about the dissatisfaction. I think for a lot of families, they just swallowed their dissatisfaction prior to COVID and its aftermath because they didn't really have a choice, right? I they were compelled under a legal threat of force to send their children to an assigned district school and or pay.

Isaac (21:03.786) or pay really, really high tuition for a private school that looked basically the same in many cases.

Kerry McDonald (21:09.464) Yeah, or try to homeschool if that was doable for them. there were lots of barriers to those other options. And so they ended up sending their kids to these local schools, even if they weren't the best fit. What you see now, though, is that there are these, there's this tremendous explosion of low cost private schools. And again, with the rise of school choice policies, many of these schools are tuition free or nearly so.

making them much more accessible to more families and homeschooling becomes more accessible because many of these micro schools I talk about are actually collaboratives of homeschoolers where you can attend part -time or full -time as a up to a full -time schooling alternative at a fraction of the cost of a traditional private school. So all of that became much more accessible. I think one of the exciting trends that I'm seeing more recently is that

In micro school founders I've talked to they say that their early classes their kindergarten classes and first grade classes are filling with students Who've never before been in a conventional classroom? So these are parents who are choosing Unconventional education right out of the gate. They're not responding to some dissatisfaction in the traditional system there wasn't some inflection point that happened in second grade and they have to

find another spot for their kid, they're choosing it right away. And I think to your point of sort of the adoption, what is it, the diffusion innovation curve, or it talks about early adopters and then early majority, late majority, I think we're moving along that curve because now you're having families see this as a viable option at the very beginning. Now you certainly still have families who have some struggle point in a traditional school and then look around to see if there's a solution.

But more and more, we're seeing this as a coveted option right from the get -go.

Isaac (23:01.314) Yeah, it's funny. I remember back when I was early on starting Praxis, this college alternative, the types of people that were interested in conversations around, maybe there's something better than college to prepare me for a career, were like two radical ends of the bell curve. It was people who were thinking, I don't know if I can afford college, so I gotta find something that's cheaper, or people who could afford literally anything, but they were like,

hey, I can do anything, can send my kid anywhere. So if I want the very best for them, let me analyze things. And I started to see the same in K through 12, maybe 10, 15 years ago, where you would talk to, let's say, very wealthy entrepreneurs who'd been very successful, or even actors or athletes who would say, I'm doing like unschooling or Waldorf or Acton Academy or something for my kid because I can afford the best and I want the best. And then you'd see people on the far opposite end of the spectrum who were like,

hey, wife is at home, dad is at work, and we have a very tight budget, but we're gonna do a homeschool curriculum, and we never spend more than $20 on a book. And you kinda had like, sort of elites as like a luxury good doing these alternatives, and then all the way on the other end, people who are, and now I think kinda like that middle majority, just sort of the average person in the suburbs, middle class.

Kerry McDonald (24:16.614) Hmm.

Isaac (24:24.174) just starting to break in and realize that this is something that's viable for them as well. And it's been really interesting to watch, even just as an experience. Growing up homeschooled, people would look at you like you had two heads and right to your face be like, well, you're not gonna be able to socialize, know, when I was like 10. And then 10 years ago, 15 years ago, when our kids are very young and we're homeschooling them, people would look at us like, well, I think I have a friend who did that. That kind of worked well for some people. Fast forward to today.

Kerry McDonald (24:24.317) Yeah.

Isaac (24:53.09) The predominant response we get when we tell parents we homeschooled is, I wish I could do that. It's like night and day difference from growing up.

Kerry McDonald (25:03.216) Yeah, I think that's right. And I think more and more parents are realizing that they have these options, that they're accessible, that they're high quality, that they can really find personalization and education the way they have in all other areas of their lives. So think that's a big part of this is parents are just no longer putting up with

sort of an outdated one size fits all mass schooling system. You know, when on their smartphones, they have so much personalization and customization, and yet they don't have that in their children's education, I think they're just not tolerating it anymore.

Isaac (25:40.238) Yep. So here's a part of the, you know, even in our name, Open Ed and the concept of open education or the opening of education. One of the trends that is really interesting to me is that a lot of the even the words that we've been using here, a lot of the definitions and frameworks kind of get fuzzy and blurry and the lines blur. So

you know, even take something that seems as clear cut as public or private. Okay, well public is maybe run by the government and private isn't. Well, then you've got things that are funded by the government like charter schools, but they're privately run. Then the lines blur further. Well, then you have, let's say a micro school completely privately run and paid for by parents, but the parents are receiving dollars from the state through an education savings account. And then there's like, it's kind of...

public -ish because it's being purchased with public dollars, but there's this whole continuum. And then things like homeschool versus like a micro school or a co -op or a learning pod or just school itself. Like if my kids go to a church and meet with 30 other families three days a week, do they go to school or do they homeschool?

And some of these things, and it's really interesting, even online or in person, well, it's kind of a little bit of both. Like my kid does Khan Academy for math, but he goes and does an art class with other kids. And then there's like the unschooled. mean, there's parts, large parts of days or entire days where my kids are much more self -directed or don't have any scheduling or programming. And so some of the...

The breakdown in these walls has been a really interesting thing to observe. It makes it harder to talk about these things, which is inconvenient for people like us who do a lot of talking and writing about them. But as a parent in the trenches, I don't care what you call it. I just need to have all the tools available on the table.

Kerry McDonald (27:31.398) Yeah, and of course, again, even pre -2020, this was happening. But I'll often hear people say, well, what do you mean? You're a homeschooler, but you can go to this school five days a week. And I guess that's a microschool. Some microschools run as programs for students who are legally homeschoolers. Some microschools run as state -recognized private schools. So you're right. There's all of this overlap and muddiness around these definitions.

I will say that some of the reason for that could be state and local regulations. So for example, I talk a lot about entrepreneurial barriers to entry and scale that some of these school founders encounter. And one of the states that's the most difficult to launch, in particular, a secular private school is Nevada because they have occupational licensing requirements. cannot...

Isaac (28:05.08) guess.

Kerry McDonald (28:25.112) open a private school, a secular private school in the state of Nevada unless you have a state teacher or administrator license. One of the only states in which that's the case. Yeah, church -based schools are exempt from this. So I've talked to founders who wanted to open a private school, an unconventional private school, or even more of a traditional private school, but were unable to because they didn't have that state license.

Isaac (28:34.382) So you gotta found a new religion and do it that way as a religion.

Kerry McDonald (28:52.034) So thankfully, Nevada has some of the most flexible homeschooling laws in the country. And so many of these founders have turned around and created microschools for homeschoolers that essentially work as these low cost private schools for homeschoolers. But the parents are ultimately the ones complying with homeschool regulations, reporting, kind of managing, controlling their children's education. But they're outsourcing some of that.

Isaac (29:18.072) Yes.

Kerry McDonald (29:19.336) that instruction to these micro schools. And right now, you know, the latest data that I've gotten from the National Microschooling Center, which is based in Las Vegas, they tell me that there's about 25 or 30 micro schools kind of in the 10 mile radius around the Las Vegas strip serving some 700 students at the moment. So, you know, micro is scalable. It's just that a lot of these programs are scaling small. You know, there's just many of them now.

Isaac (29:48.166) That's the thing that is so exciting to me about just watching and talking to all of these innovators. Like we all know, you and I know anyway, maybe everybody doesn't, but that all of these regulations and hurdles, barriers to entry because of all these different state policies, a confusing web of different policies at the state, local, federal level, they make everything less efficient than it would be if they weren't there. But despite them,

Entrepreneurs always find really creative ways to like figure it out anyway and fill in those gaps. And you have all these bizarre things happening. Like you mentioned in that, or we're like, hey, homeschooling is pretty permissive, but you can't open a private school that's non -religious, which is like a weird gap. You see this with ESAs a lot too, where they will allow parents to use it for a tuition voucher essentially, to pay for tuition at a typical accredited school or to like buy books and supplies themselves directly.

but not to pay for like a micro school or a co -op or something that is unaccredited. And it's kind of like, well, that's weird because letting parents just buy supplies themselves directly seems further on the radical spectrum of like choice and independence than a non -state accredited little micro school might be. But this thing in the middle is prohibited. I mean, policy is always irrational and crazy like that, but innovators keep finding ways to do it anyway.

Kerry McDonald (31:12.4) Yeah. I think it's interesting because I've talked to some of these founders who are running essentially five day a week programs for homeschoolers, including in states where they could run a private school relatively easily. They don't have these occupational licensing requirements that Nevada has. And I'll say to them, have you thought about becoming a recognized private school? You're essentially operating like a private school anyway. Why not just become a private school? It's not that hard.

And they'll say to me inevitably, we don't want a traditional schooling model. We want the parents to be empowered to educate their children how they choose. We want them to be able to have the freedom to travel and not be focused on compulsory school attendance laws. We want parents to be able to choose part -time options if they'd like to do that, pick and choose among different days of the week. So the founders themselves,

want that freedom and flexibility that can be found through homeschooling, again, where parents are legally the ones responsible for their children's education, and they don't, in many cases, have any desire to become a recognized private school.

Isaac (32:22.082) Yeah, you know, what's cool about all this unfolding too is that it forces traditional private schools and public schools to improve and to innovate a little bit. So one example, you know, if a lot of parents will say things like, Hey, I would love to do some kind of homeschooling or micro school or something alternative for my kids, but I want to like still leave open the possibility. Maybe when they're a teenager, they want to go be a part of the public high school.

Kerry McDonald (32:34.674) Hmm.

Isaac (32:51.564) I'm scared that they won't be able to do that if I'm not in the system from the get -go, they're not doing the normal standardized testing, all this stuff. Not only is it absolutely possible, but it's getting easier because public schools realize that they're gonna have to, like, hey, maybe this kid's gonna not be in the system for part of the time, but if we want them in our system at all, we gotta be a little bit more flexible about what we will allow people to come and go, or kids that will just literally take.

one period or one class at a public school that they really like, that has a really good teacher and they want to be a part of it, but they want to do the rest of it on their own, or public school students that their parents travel for work and they'll travel for a month and then come back. And like, that's actually okay. Most people don't know that. They think that they'll get kicked out or something, but you can do it. And the schools are kind of being forced to flex and adapt to these changes as well, which is again, competition makes everyone better.

Kerry McDonald (33:47.206) Yeah, I hope we'll continue to see public schools compete with these alternative models. I hope they will. I think you're right. As public school enrollment declines, they're going to have to figure out ways of attracting and retaining students. I will say that I talked to lot of founders who get students from traditional public schools who will say that they come to them several grade levels behind.

Isaac (33:52.75) I'm being generous, they are sometimes, but not as much as I think they could be.

Kerry McDonald (34:16.804) in many cases. And then they're quickly able, the students are quickly able to catch up to grade level or beyond because of that individualized learning, because of mastery based academics where, you know, you're not just moving along on the fourth grade curriculum because you're in the fourth grade, you are moving along when you reach mastery in certain content areas. That by the time those students maybe decide to go to high school, they'll be in a much better position than they would have been had they been in that conventional system to begin with.

because they've had that individualized care.

Isaac (34:50.638) Yeah, so this is really interesting that you mentioned the sort of the trends of people coming in and out of the system. We just did a survey of open ed families and we had almost a thousand people respond and asking if they had, if their kid had ever been in a traditional school setting. And over 55 % of them,

said yes, their kids had been in a traditional school setting before they did open ed, which is a more customized kind of parent driven, student driven. And then we asked how likely would you be to enroll your child in a traditional school system again in the future? about 80 % said unlikely. So it's really interesting. People come and go, but like once you've kind of seen the flexibility you can get with

all these various permutations of homeschooling, microschooling, et cetera. It is really hard to go back with the exception that oftentimes there's a high school thing where like if the kids really want to go be in the high school, that's kind of a common thing. But it's pretty cool to see. just to see the, know, even on the private school side, just the virtual options and charter schools, they're kind of being forced to offer a lot more asynchronous, a lot more virtual, a lot more where it's like parent driven, student driven.

Kerry McDonald (36:04.946) Yep. Right.

Isaac (36:14.316) So let me ask you, have a few more minutes here. I'm curious, I have kind of two different questions, but maybe these are too much to get into quickly. what are you seeing, you talk with as many people as anyone in terms of the innovators in education, the parents themselves. What are you seeing in terms of technology, the relationship between technology and learning? And let's just say screens in particular. Because this is something that I think every parent is trying to figure out.

What is the way to leverage and utilize the beauty of the internet and videos and all this stuff without turning my kid into a zombie or having them be isolated or addicted? And I'm curious, like if any of the innovators you're talking to, like there's all these different approaches. You can go like Waldorf where it's like kids should only ever play with handmade wooden toys and be out in nature. And you can go like, no, just like straight up Khan Academy all day long, 24 seven. You can learn anything you want from YouTube. What are you seeing and hearing out there?

Kerry McDonald (37:11.548) Yeah, so I sort of have two responses to that. The first is that I think what we're seeing is a much more market -based approach to education. So a founder of a low -cost private school, micro school, homeschool collaborative will have sort of their own vision for education. And maybe that vision will be unlimited screen time, or maybe that vision would be some parameters around screens.

And so what happens is the founders create policies around screens in their programs and then let the market decide, right? If some parents are all in on a school that has unlimited screen time, then they'll enroll their kids there. If they want a school that has no screens, they'll enroll their kids there, right? It's just a part of a way of differentiating different schools. And we see, I see a lot of different founders approaching this in different ways.

That said, I do think it's important to recognize technology as such a key tool to enabling the growth of these unconventional educational models that now we're able to tap into such extraordinary, in some cases, free or low cost software, like you mentioned Khan Academy, entirely free that has a great sort of mastery based approach to learning, particularly in math, but other subjects as well. see other technology tools.

that do similar things. And so that just makes these unconventional spaces able to do what they're going to do in many cases because they don't need to have a calculus teacher and a physics teacher. And they don't have to sort of know all of the content in their one room schoolhouse. They can leverage technology in these really clever ways. So.

So I think that's definitely in the background, but yeah, I've seen founders approach technology in all kinds of different ways and then be responsive to what those families they're serving really want.

Isaac (39:10.968) So I'm going to ask you if you have, I'll let you pick. let you pick. Would you want to give a prediction? And it's got to be something more specific than, the trend of increasing educational choice will continue. Or a favorite story that kind of illustrates what's happening in this space to send us off.

Kerry McDonald (39:35.176) favorite story or a prediction in numbers. man.

Isaac (39:39.244) It doesn't have to be numbers, but just something slightly more specific than, it doesn't have to be numerical, but then like, hey, yeah, more of the same.

Kerry McDonald (39:51.942) Yeah, I mean, I guess I'll go with the numbers because that's the first thing that comes to mind. If we look at data coming out of the Johns Hopkins University homeschool hub and a wonderful new resource that's been created this year that's run by education professor Angela Watson, really trying to get a handle on numbers of homeschoolers, and it's tricky to do because some states don't report, but...

They're reporting up to about 6 % of America's school age population is now homeschooled. About 11 % are in private school and about 7 % are in charter schools. And this is according to the latest Census Bureau data. Those numbers are going to go up. All of those.

Isaac (40:33.838) Yep. And for context, so that would be, cause I think there's about 60 million public school students that might include charter. So that would be about four -ish million homeschoolers maybe. Is that about right? Three and a half million. Okay. Got it. Got it.

Kerry McDonald (40:47.112) About three and a half million, yeah. Yeah, so those numbers are going to go up. Already with school choice policies expanding across the country, 33 states with some version of private school choice enabling families to leave a district school for private education option. Currently, EdChoice estimates about a little over a third, over 20 million students are eligible or will soon be eligible for a

private school choice program. So there's just those trends that are continuing to grow and as more more families expect more options, then I think we're going to see the continued expansion of school choice policies and the continued growth of these new schools and spaces.

Isaac (41:32.814) And those numbers have grown fast. If I recall that homeschooling number of 3 .5 million, it was like 2 .1 million like five years ago. So we're talking some serious, serious growth happening. I love it. Kerry, anywhere besides fee .org where people should look for you.

Kerry McDonald (41:42.299) Yes.

### Final Cold Open: The Undoing Process

**Kristin:** It's going to take for however many years you're in a system, it's going to take that many months to actually shed everything off before you can rebuild it back up, right? So I was coming out with 18 years of teaching. I needed to give myself 18 months.

(Swoosh)

**Kristin:** As a conventional teacher, you are taught to be so like, efficiency drives the system. And play just doesn't—it's not efficient. If I took my kids outside for an extra recess, gosh, I just felt like I'd be judged. Like, my kids are not working enough.

(Swoosh)

**Kristin:** There's such a currency that's required in play. And that's just not honoring that play is actually the heavy hitter when it comes to skills. Play is the job of kids.

The Hardest Part of Leaving Traditional School

After years in conventional classrooms, teachers Kristin and Ginger felt the burnout creeping in. The system's relentless focus on grades, efficiency, and "measuring sticks" was crushing their love for teaching. So they took a leap and built their dream school from scratch.

In this conversation, they share the vulnerable story of starting Scola Microschool—a place built on three pillars: being outside, meeting kids where they are, and fostering deep community. They also reveal their groundbreaking "Four Categories of Play," a framework that turns unstructured time into a powerful tool for understanding child development.

This episode is a must-listen for parents and educators who feel like there has to be a better way. It’s a story about the courage to let go of old systems and the magic that happens when you do.

## Full Transcript

**Ela Richmond (00:00)** Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. I'm your sometimes host, Ela, and today I'm joined by Kristin and Ginger of the Scola Microschool. I'm so excited to have this conversation and shed light on the microschool side of open education—what is happening in this world, how Scola was started, and what it has done for your community. Welcome to the podcast.

**Kristin & Ginger (00:22)** Thanks, Ela, for having us. We appreciate it.

**Ela Richmond (00:26)** Okay, so just dive straight in. What is your story? How did you even get started with microschools? Were you an educator ahead of time? Were you a mom? Where did you start?

**Kristin (00:36)** Yeah, good question. Both Ginger and I are moms. We also were educators, mostly in a private school conventional classroom. We worked together really closely, and I think that matters as part of our story. We knew each other's giftings. We're pretty opposite people who are just really appreciative of the other person's skill set and learned how to work together that way.

When we started Scola in 2022, if I'm being really honest, it's probably a seed that started in my master's program, possibly even a little bit longer than that. I tend to be a creative thinker, engineer, inventor, big-picture type of personality—like, let's blow it up and just see what happens. And Ginger is practical, like, "What's the next step?" and, "Okay, let's just try to get one thing done today." Together, our skill set was really powerful and important in getting Scola started.

I got my master's degree in educational leadership before I had my two kids. I was a middle school teacher. I loved middle school. I loved the creativity I got to have in my classroom. And then I think there were two motivations for me. One was my own children, just seeing how my daughter and my son were different and probably needed different things from schooling. But second was obviously teaching through COVID and just knowing that there were some constraints in the conventional classroom that I had always felt, but those were put under fire. It was a ridiculously hard but also very fruitful time to teach. I was the optimist that was like, "Something good can come out of this." And it was just the right time to let the seed of Scola actually start to take root. So we put legs on it and a framework around it in the fall of 2021 and opened our doors in September of 2022.

**Ela Richmond (03:08)** How many students did you start with?

**Kristin (03:10)** Yeah, that's a good question. When we originally started to shape our school, we wanted 24. We both really wanted to stay teaching, and effective teaching was a common big theme for us. With effective teaching, you always have to talk about student-to-teacher ratios, right? So we thought 24 was the right number. We didn't start with that. We started with 16. It grew to 18, then it grew to 23, and now we have between 30 and 35 students, but with three teachers involved. I think we found a good sweet spot.

**Ela Richmond (04:00)** Wow. Paint the picture of how it started. I mean, it seems easy to teach a lot of kids, especially if you're a teacher, but then you get into the weeds and I bet there were a lot of challenges you didn't expect.

**Ginger (04:18)** Ella, that's a great question. I'm just going to go back a little bit. Kristin and I were teaching together for years, and there was a moment before Scola was a dream that I put on a post-it—I don't even know if Kristin remembers this—I put, "Kristin, you need to start a school and I'll come work for you."

Fast forward years later, post-COVID, and COVID was a catalyst for something different. I am someone who actually does not love change. I really feel comfortable in the knowing, in what to expect. And after COVID, when I went back into a classroom for a few years, there was definitely a shift in me. I was really exhausted. COVID, with the technology and all the things involved, just took a lot out of me. Going back into the classroom, I recognized our students have shifted. They are not the same.

I think there was just some exhaustion and I was close to burnout. I'm like, "Okay, something needs to change," because I still loved teaching. I got my master's in educational leadership and I hit this point of, "Okay, something's gotta change. I wanna stay in education." Kristin and I would meet and go on walks, and that's when she started sharing the idea of Scola with me. And I'm like, "That's a great idea for you. Yes, you could totally do this." And slowly but surely, it just came to be that I would come alongside and help start Scola. It was that exhaustion that led me to the "yes." Like, "Okay, something's gotta change. I think this is it." So I just embraced it.

We were both working full time, so to get Scola off the ground, we would meet on Saturdays and make a checklist. The first question was, "What type of a school are we going to be? Private? Charter? Homeschool?"

**Kristin (06:50)** On our Saturday morning meetings, we had to come up with those big questions. Who do we want to be? What's going to rise to the top? You realize quickly you can't be all the things. In fact, that was part of why we were leaving. The demands of our current situation were just piling up and there wasn't any meaningful subtraction. So we were like, "Okay, let's start with a clean slate."

That was way more vulnerable than it sounds. You're giving up pieces of your identity, pieces of what you prided yourself in. I even tear up just thinking about how much courage it took to be like, "Okay, all the measuring sticks I had about being a good teacher? I'm actually going to lay these down." Now, they might be good, we might pick them back up again, but let's just at least try to start with a clean slate. What's actually important to us?

It was so nice to have space to let the important things rise to the top.

1. We knew that we wanted to be **outside more often**. We wanted movement. And outside is more than just outside; it's kids connected to their space, it's part of teacher health, it's natural, good things happening.
2. We really wanted to **meet students where they were at**. We wanted to take the pace pressure off. We had to take words like "gifted," "talented," "accelerated," "behind," "ahead"... and I still catch myself sometimes, those things are really embedded. But meeting students where they're at, giving them an authentic learning sweet spot.
3. Third, we really wanted a **social-emotional component**. To us, that means community. Friendship, relationship skills. How do we interact with our neighbor? We want to be part of a neighborhood. We want that veil between school and community to mesh a little bit more.

Those were the three things that floated to the top. And then every choice after that... this sounds super clear in retrospect, but in the middle of it, we just had a commitment to let these things be our North Star. That led to how many students we want, what type of organizational structure we'd be. Technically, we are a nonprofit that serves homeschool families. That is satisfying the law in Minnesota right now. It may change, and we'll learn to pivot. So we sound like a school, we breathe like a school, but technically we are a nonprofit that serves homeschool families. All those basic decisions—budget, materials, calendar—we made on these Saturday mornings, but these three things were always leading the way.

**Ela Richmond (11:51)** That makes sense. It's fascinating that it started with the sentiment question: How do we increase and better the sentiment of teachers and students? Were you all ever afraid? You said that you let go of all these measuring sticks you had used for so long. Was it hard in the beginning to be like, "Okay, but what if we let them go outside more often? Are we still serving the purpose that we are hoping to serve?"

**Ginger (12:38)** Absolutely. I think there was some apprehension on my end. Part of it was having each other. I trust that between the two of us, what's going to happen is actually best for students. And research backs that up. Research backs up that play is so important, that kids need to feel safe, seen, and connected in order to learn. So I think there was some fear, but all of those other things outweighed the fear. Also, the first time we got paid, our first paycheck was reassuring to myself and my husband. It's like, "Okay, yes, we are getting paid for this."

This is my 26th year of teaching, so I've had touchpoints with pretty much K through 8th grade. I know where kids need to be when they leave first grade, when they leave eighth grade. I feel confident in knowing where kids need to be and supporting them to get there. So there was a level of confidence and excitement that outweighed the fear.

That first day... part of me wishes we would have recorded it for our sake. We really did start with bare bones. What does it look like to really see kids and build a program around what they need? We started without a lot of the structure we typically have in the classroom. And slowly but surely, we started adding components back. So if you come in on a typical morning, you'll see three different small groups, and you'll see components of a typical classroom, except kids are working independently and you have multi-age students working on different things. You still see that structure.

**Ela Richmond (15:32)** That's so fascinating. Have you seen a sentiment change in your students? What has the reaction been to this more flexible type of learning?

**Kristin (15:49)** Well, we have two types of students. You have students that have been in different institutions that come to Scola, and you have students that have been here since kindergarten, for whom Scola is their only framework for education. For our kids who have been in other institutions, just like there had to be some undoing for us, there is this undoing process for them.

Our admissions process tries to honor that it's going to take some time to shed the old in order to try on the new thing. Early on, we listened to a lot of podcasts, trying to fill our backpack with inspiration. We heard this quote: "For however many years you're in a system, it's going to take that many months to actually shed everything off before you can rebuild." I was coming out with 18 years of teaching, so I needed to give myself 18 months. That's like two years of undoing these things.

Again, the unique group here is the kids who start in Scola and that's all they know. They're going to walk into a traditional school building for a sports practice and _that's_ going to feel weird. Then we have students coming from a homeschool situation, and this is actually _more_ structured than what they're used to, so they have a different learning curve. The hard part is usually the shift in where the pressure points are, or where all the measuring sticks went.

**Ela Richmond (18:51)** Is there a sentiment difference between the students you used to teach and the students at Scola? I'm curious, because all the research says play and flexibility are so important. When you do that, what does it look like in the classroom?

**Ginger (19:18)** Absolutely. As educators, we've always had the philosophy of seeing the whole child. But in typical classical education, academics gets the majority of the focus. In this space, academics is important, but kids are confident because we've shed the old ways. We understand, "Okay, this is important, but who you are as an image-bearer of God is _most_ important." This is how we're going to see each other. When kids learn that, and they start to see each other in their unique giftings, there's a confidence that allows them to be vulnerable and make mistakes in ways that I couldn't tap into when I had 26 students and was being evaluated on getting them from point A to point B.

The pressure for our students is off, and the pressure for us is off to fully see them. We have progress reports, but we don't do letter grades, even in middle school. We look at where students should be for their grade level, and then we have a narrative side that gets into social skills and play. The narrative is most important because we're small. We get to really know students and come alongside them in a way I've never had the ability to do before.

And that correlates with getting to know the families. Families are our number one. Mom and dad are in the driver's seat. It is a partnership. In real-time, if a question comes up, I can give mom and dad a call or a quick text. To have this real-time understanding of what's going on socially and emotionally with a child—I cannot overemphasize the value of that. When it comes to academics, our students will face challenging moments. There is a grit that's required. And I think our students are able to tap into that grit because these other things, which are actually more important, have been checked.

**Ela Richmond (23:38)** Has the way that Scola is structured, versus a traditional approach, changed the way that students and parents think about education? Has it changed their relationship with learning?

**Kristin (24:32)** Yeah, that's really interesting. For so many families, mine included at one point, the relationship with school was actually about the outcome and the grades. That's where everyone—teachers, learners, parents—was prioritizing. Everyone was _trying_ not to. There were huge efforts to say, "It's not about the grade," but the current was so strong that no matter how hard you tried, it still was so much time, so much money, so much emphasis put on the grade.

So I think we're still trying to find the right words for what shifts. Outcomes will happen, but when you put more time and investment in the process, there's just a different posture towards outcomes. And a different posture towards what learning can look like.

**Ela Richmond (25:56)** I find that fascinating because in every other aspect of our lives, we understand that's true. In something as simple as working out or our marital relationships, we understand that everything becomes true in the moment. The habit of choosing your husband, the habit of showing up to the gym—all of that matters so much more than a physique or a weight. It will come. But it's funny because from a school perspective, we all just focus on the outcome as opposed to nurturing the moment. It's unreasonable to assume that if we do that consistently for five-plus years, the outcome won't be good.

**Kristin (26:56)** I mean, Ella, now you're getting into a philosophy podcast here. The _telos_, the main component of why we educate, has shifted. And we all kind of see the historical benefit of that. I don't want to get too deep into that, because I want everyone to have access to this. And that might mean we have to shift some things or create schools that as many people as possible have access to. That's where our dream is. We love Scola, but we do get frustrated. How could every kid have this opportunity? We see the limitations in what we've built.

**Ginger (28:00)** Just tapping a little bit on access. Our heart's desire is that every kid has access to a meaningful education where they are taught by healthy educators, their needs are being met, and they're learning. Thankfully, in the Twin Cities, we have access to lots of different choices. There are thriving public schools, great charter schools, wonderful private schools, and microschools popping up. But again, being a tuition-driven school, not everybody has access. So access is really important. We don't have a solution to that, but we are thankful to live in a place where there are options.

And this ties back to your question of how this changes people's posture. When we speak about teacher health, our families have started really caring about it. We talk about it a lot. Our school is better when we stay healthy and effective. And we encourage people—some of our families have students in more than one school model—how can you help the health of teachers in other schools? Effective, healthy teachers make a significant impact on the education of your neighborhood, of your city. The reach of an effective teacher can go a long, long way. We are pro-education. We don't plan to be in competition with anyone. We want more healthy options, more sustainable schools, more healthy teachers. We're doing our little micro part here, but we want to be in a positive relationship with school districts, learn from them, and help this whole thing grow.

**Ela Richmond (31:22)** I fully agree. That's the whole concept of open education. Every student needs something a little bit different. How do you find exactly what a student needs? And how do we increase options for families? You mentioned some families do lots of different models of education at once. What does that look like? And how would you recommend people find the approach that works for their kids?

**Kristin & Ginger (32:09)** Good question. For parents doing different models, there is a cost. These parents are keeping track of different calendars, different start times, different end times. There is a frazzled approach. We try to support them, but they are leading in the posture of being less concerned with an outcome and more concerned about the wellbeing and growth of their kid. It really is the privilege of being able to see each child as an individual and recognize, "This kid is thriving in this institution, but this kid is not. What are some other options?"

As for how to pick the right model, convenience is a really strong factor. We had some good school years where our top value was just picking the convenient option. My kids were okay, and we supplemented. I do think it's about tapping into your kids' motivation. What gets them motivated? One thing that has been really cool, but has taken time, is that student motivation in my previous classrooms was really dependent on me. In the way we've structured Scola, it has shifted the motivation onto students a lot more. They still need us for an on-ramp, for direct instruction, for feedback. But there are many times, several times a week, where suddenly there are 32 different things going on in this room, and we just stare at each other and go fill up our coffee. We bask in it, because this is the teacher's dream. This is us doing our job in the way we love doing our job. It's this level of student independence, student motivation. They have the right resources and they get to drive it. Now, those moments don't last the whole day, but it's a lot more like gardening. It's a tending job, more than a "drive the train" type of job.

**Ginger (36:00)** Going back to what we'd say to parents trying to pick the right fit... when we meet with parents of kids going into kindergarten, we just try to put them at ease. There's this pressure: "I have to get it right." So, especially for kindergarten parents, just putting that pressure off. We say, "Here's what you can expect at Scola." When you're looking at institutions, try to get physically in the building during a typical school day. You can get a sense of the culture. Can you see your child in the hallways? In this classroom? I recommend parents get in for a tour and trust their gut. When it comes to standardized tests, I recommend looking at that, but it should not be the driving factor. There are so many things behind the scenes. I would put that lower on the list.

**Ela Richmond (38:02)** That makes sense. I wonder about student motivation. There's natural motivation, but then there's motivation by osmosis, where a student is around other students or a family member they look up to. How do you help a kid foster those motivations?

**Kristin (39:00)** I think Ginger's so good at this. I've learned a lot from her about how to ask kids what they're proud of. There is something about specific praise, really helping kids feel internally proud. A lot of this comes from teaching kids about emotions, about the way they feel, even frustration. Having them aware of those things is a huge part of motivation. Students have to recognize what "proud" even feels like—not because someone else told them it was good, but because _they_ feel proud.

**Ginger (40:35)** My mind goes to teaching kids that intrinsic motivation. It's not about them making me proud; it's about them feeling accomplished for the work they've done. In my small group, a kid might finish ten math problems in 20 minutes, and another kid might finish one. We've set up a culture where, whether it's one or ten, you get to feel proud. I'll notice that kiddo who finished one problem, but he focused and stuck with it. I'll say, "Hey, how does that make you feel? Look at what you did on your own."

Working in a multi-age group, they get to bring that out in each other. They're not in a hurry. There isn't one student getting the gold star. They learn to coach each other, not just give an answer. It's really special. I can just picture that kid who comes up to me, so excited because they did X, Y, Z, and just turning that around with a big smile on my face and saying, "How does that make you feel?"

"I feel so excited! Look what I did!"

"Why don't you go share that with your teammate at your table?"

It takes intentional reframing. The teacher is not the center. They're not doing this for me. It's about establishing the habit, the process, the learning, and feeling that feeling so that when they try something new tomorrow, they remember what it felt like.

**Ela Richmond (43:08)** That is huge. It is so easy as a parent or a teacher to be the person they turn to for validation. But it's so important for it not to be the end of it, for it to be, "I am so happy for you, you should also be happy for you." Creating that line between "this is not just about pleasing me" and "this is about doing something inherently good." I've never heard that before, but it's a subtle thing that's so important.

**Kristin (44:11)** Yeah, well, it's the adult paycheck world, too. We do this for the paycheck, but also because of the good work that's done in me and that I can do for other people. There's a lot of research on motivation. We're probably more the labs, hands-on, experiencing these things. We may not have all the scientific words, but you can see that kids go in and out of different types of motivations. When you know a student, when you are known and belong, there's a lot of space to take risks and grow. That's what's so nice about narrative reporting, not just grades. This is the character development people talk about. Motivation is a vulnerable place for students. Many have learned to hide or cope or only be motivated by the prize or the bribe. I have been the prize and bribing teacher, so I'm not exempt. But to start to see that shift is something we love writing about in reports to parents.

**Ela Richmond (47:02)** I absolutely love that. So, a question about play. As adults, we recognize that being in a hurry is not great. When kids play, it feels as an onlooker that they're not being productive. We ask ourselves, "What else could I be doing?" Why do you all say yes to play? What is in play that makes it so useful?

**Kristin (48:31)** Observing play... there's so much research here. Again, we want to honor that there are real scientists who have language around this. We just haven't found their book yet. This was a vulnerable shift for us. As a conventional teacher, you're taught that efficiency drives the system, and play isn't efficient.

**Ginger (49:15)** If I took my kids outside for an extra recess, I felt like I'd be judged. "My kids are not working enough." Just shedding that.

**Kristin (49:25)** Yeah, earning and deserving. There's such a currency required in play, and that's not honoring that play is actually the heavy hitter when it comes to skills. Peter Gray says it: play is the job of children.

On average, we do about three hours outside. We're Minnesotan, so sometimes that's difficult. At different ages, that time looks different. We'll hold classes out there, we'll hike, but we also want to honor that unstructured outside time is important. My job changed when we made this a priority. At recess duty, I know where my eyes are, but this felt different. I'm actually watching students and all these skills emerge. I'm not just managing conflict.

It was in one of my times outside as a researcher. I saw pockets of kids, all 100% engaged. I noticed the projects they were doing and came up with four categories:

1. **Imagination:** They were playing store, playing city, using walnuts as currency. A lot of times, the stories we're reading in books get played out here.
2. **Competitive Structured Games:** Games with rules, like hide-and-seek or football.
3. **Civil Engineering:** Digging holes, gathering branches, making a path for water in a dam. One time, they gathered every dead branch in the entire woods. I had to call the city office like, "I don't know if you wanted this project done, but we gathered all the dead sticks for you."
4. **Social:** Just the hangout. Talking, telling jokes, bantering.

We've used these four categories to help students see their time management, their skill set, their communication. What's interesting is, when we talk about kids... we don't really have staff meetings. Ginger and I are outside, getting fresh air, standing back-to-back, and we have the time and space to name every kid we see and make observations. This is what you dreamt about in teacher meetings. "Okay, I'm a little concerned, it feels like anxiety is present here," or, "They're in conflict a lot with this person." We can also observe what category of play they prefer and which ones are challenging. We have students begging for an organized game—they want the rules, the winner, the loser. Challenging them to join the imaginary group stretches them. This is what we'd write a book about.

**Ginger (57:05)** It also gives students an opportunity to think about what they want to engage in. We might notice a student off by themselves, and we'll go over and say, "Hey, I noticed you're spending time by yourself. Can you tell me about that? Is this a choice? Do you just need some quiet alone time? If so, that's okay. Or is there a game you'd like to join? Would you like some help?" It's about getting to know them as individuals and helping them understand their own wiring. If you want to be by yourself, that's okay. But if there's a conflict, let's talk about it and work through it in real-time. In other settings, after recess, I'd spend half an hour trying to get to the bottom of all the social things. Here, we can help students gain the skills to work through it themselves.

**Ela Richmond (01:03:29)** That's the perfect note to wrap up on. A practical question: most children tend to over-watch screens. It's high dopamine. It's hard to get that 45-plus minutes of, "I'm bored, what do I do?" You're saying you don't discover these things until after that time. How do you recommend a parent instill this as a habit?

**Ginger (01:05:11)** First, as a parent, if you're trying to grow a child's stamina, think about where you're at. You don't go from zero to 50. If you typically get outside 10 minutes a day, make a goal of 20 and build from there. I've gotten comfortable with my son saying, "I'm bored." Actually, that's okay. The best stuff comes from boredom. I'll give him a few ideas, but he has very limited screens during the day. It takes about five, ten minutes, and then he has his Legos out, or he's on his bike, or taking his fishing pole to the lake. I guarantee if screens were an option, he wouldn't be doing those things. So I'm okay with him being bored.

As educators, we didn't start with three hours a day outside. The kids had to grow their stamina. We had to grow our ability to trust the research. And as we walked through it, we're like, "My goodness, the research is right." We have validation that this is really important. We have tech in Scola, too. We'll have math games, even brainless games. We have carved-out times for it. They know when it's coming. Every Thursday, we end the day with laptop time. We put boundaries around it, but we honor that screens are here to stay.

**Kristin (01:08:15)** Also, we had some interesting supplies that are just helpful. But hold off on purchasing stuff right away. See what shapes up. Do you need to buy the nice shovel because digging holes is the thing? All of our jump ropes are rarely used for jump-roping. They're used for slingshots, for measuring. A lot of natural materials. Our kids know how to collect sticks and make things out of them. And some kids will increase their stamina faster if they have people to do it with. So for a family, pair up with another family. Bring them to a creek or a climbing place.

**Ela Richmond (01:09:54)** My last question: you're talking about going over to a student who is alone. It sounds like you've done a very good job of building trust. But a lot of parents wonder, how much should I be stepping in versus giving them space to figure it out? How do you determine when to step in?

**Kristin (01:13:51)** That's such a good question. It really comes from knowing the student and what skills they have. It can be the same age child, but one student understands how to confront another, express their feelings, and come to a compromise, and another needs help. It comes from knowing the student.

And that trust starts with the families. In this style of learning, there has to be a level of trust established with families. It's okay if families aren't feeling that from us or want something different. We're not offended by that. The trust starts with the parents, and then it takes time to build with students. But students can see right past it when you, as a teacher, just want to get onto the next thing and put a band-aid on it. That band-aid doesn't last. It's going to be torn off and show up as a disruptive behavior later.

Teaching is so formational. We use that word, and we are a faith-based school, but even a friend who isn't would probably agree. There's such forming and shaping in a school setting, no matter the model. Formation takes time, care, and seeing. We're going to be shaped whether we're intentional about it or not. That's how powerful classroom settings can be. We take that seriously. And this is why teacher health is so important. When we're healthy, we're going to approach the formation of students as whole people we care about. We have patience and trust for your family.

**Ela Richmond (01:17:58)** This was an incredible episode. I'm so happy for Minnesotan families that they get to go to your school. Is there anything else you want to leave our listeners off with?

**Kristin & Ginger (01:18:26)** I would just say if there are any other educators out there who are getting this idea of, "What if? Could I?" We would love to hear from you. We have a model school, so other educators reach out to us and are curious about how we did this. We would just encourage them to reach out. We'd love to chat with them.

**Ela Richmond (01:18:59)** I love it. Okay, we'll leave all of your links in the description. Thank you all so much for coming on the episode.

**Kristin & Ginger (01:19:15)** Thank you, Ela.

# Scola Microschool: Reimagining Education Through Play and Outdoor Learning

## Open Ed Podcast with Ela Richmond

_Featuring Kristin & Ginger, Co-founders of Scola Microschool_

---

## Introduction and Founding Story

**Ela Richmond:** Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm your sometimes host Ela and today I'm joined by Kristin and Ginger of the Scola Microschool. I'm so excited to have this conversation and kind of shed light on the micro school side of open education. So what is happening in this world, how Scola was started and founded and what it has done for your community. Welcome to the podcast.

**Kristin & Ginger:** Thanks Ela for having us. We appreciate it.

**Ela Richmond:** Okay, so just dive straight in. What is your story? How did you even get started with micro schools? Were you an educator ahead of time? Were you a mom? Where did you start?

**Kristin:** Good question. Both Ginger and I are moms. We also were educators mostly in a private school conventional classroom. We work together really closely and I think that matters as part of our story. We knew each other's giftings. We're pretty opposite people who are just really appreciative of the other person's skill set and learn how to work together that way.

When we started Scola in 2022, if I'm being really honest, it's probably been a seed that started in my master's program, possibly even a little bit longer than that. I tend to be a creative thinker, engineer, inventor, big picture type of person—let's blow it up and just see what happens type of personality. And Ginger is practical and focused on what's the next step and okay, let's just try to get one thing done today. Together our skill set was really powerful and important in getting school started.

I got my master's degree in educational leadership before I had my two kids. I was a middle school teacher. I loved middle school. I loved the creativity I got to have in my classroom at my school at the time. And then I think there were kind of two motivations for me. One was my own children—just seeing how my daughter and my son both were different and probably needed different things from schooling. But then second was teaching through COVID and just knowing that there were some constraints in the conventional classroom that I had always felt, but those were obviously put under fire in COVID.

It was a ridiculously hard, but also very fruitful time to teach. I was the optimist that was like something good can come out of this. And it was just the right time to let the seed of Scola actually start to take root. So we put legs on it and kind of a framework around it in the fall of 2021 and opened our doors September of 2022.

## The Starting Process and Early Challenges

**Ela Richmond:** How many students did you start with?

**Ginger:** When we originally started to shape our school, we wanted 24. And that was kind of a big picture question for the two of us. We both really wanted to stay teaching. And so effective teaching was kind of a common big theme for the two of us. And with effective teaching, you always have to talk about student to teacher ratios, right? That's a big part of the conversation.

So we thought 24 was the right number to have. We didn't start with that. We started with 16. It grew to 18, then it grew to 23, and now we have, I think we found a good sweet spot. We have between 30 and 35 students, but now there's three teachers involved.

**Ela Richmond:** Wow. And what was that like? Paint the picture of how it started and I don't know what challenges y'all had to go through. I mean, it seems easy to teach a lot of kids, especially if you're a teacher, but then you get into the weeds of it and I bet there were a lot of challenges that you didn't expect.

**Ginger:** That's a great question. I'm just going to go back a little bit. You know, Kristin and I teaching together for years, there was a moment before SCOLA was a dream and started in the institution we're at together that I put on a post-it. And I don't even know if Kristin remembers this, I put, Kristin, you need to start a school and I'll come work for you. And so fast forward years later, post COVID.

I am someone who actually does not love change. I really feel comfortable in the knowing, comfortable in what to expect. And after COVID, when I went back into a classroom setting for a few years, there was definitely a shift in me. I think I was really exhausted. I think COVID with the technology and all the things that were involved just took a lot out of me. Going back into the classroom and recognizing our students have shifted. Our students are not the same when we left to when we're coming back in the classroom.

I think there was just some exhaustion that I experienced and I'm like, okay, something needs to change because I still loved teaching. I still loved being in education. I got my master's in educational leadership and I think I hit this point of like, okay, something's gotta change. I wanna stay in education. And Kristin and I were working at different institutions, but we would meet and we'd go on walks. And that's when Kristin started sharing the idea of Scola with me. And I'm like, that's a great idea for you. Yes, you could totally do this. And slowly but surely it just came to be that I would come alongside and help start SCOLA.

It was that exhaustion that led me to the yes. Something's gotta change. I think this is it. So I just embraced it. We would meet, we were both working full time. So to get SCOLA off the ground, this was probably in February before SCOLA started, we would meet on Saturdays and we would make a checklist.

## Core Values and Philosophy Development

**Kristin:** At the beginning on our Saturday morning meetings, while working full-time as teachers, we just had to come up with those big questions, right? Like, who do we want to be? What's going to rise to the top? You realize quickly you can't be all the things. And in fact, that was actually part of why we were leaving, right? The demands of our current situation was just piling up and there wasn't any meaningful subtraction.

So we were like, okay, let's start really with a clean slate. That was way more vulnerable than what it sounds like. When you say out loud, let's start with a clean slate, you're giving up pieces of your identity. You're giving up pieces of what you prided yourself in. I even tear up just thinking about how much courage it took just to be like, okay, all the things, all the measuring sticks I had about being a good teacher. I'm actually going to lay these down. Now they might be good. We might be willing to pick them back up again, but let's just try to start with a clean slate, like what's actually important to us.

And so it was so nice to have space to let the important things rise to the top. And we knew that we wanted to be outside more often. We wanted movement and outside is more than just outside. There's actually a lot of sub points to that, right? It's kids really connected to their space. It's also part of teacher health, a lot of movement, just natural, really good things that happen and a human connection point that just felt like we were losing.

We really wanted to meet students where they were at. We wanted to take the pace pressure off of students. Some students could fly ahead. We knew that we had to be able, if we were really gonna make that the value, we had to take words like gifted, talented, accelerated, behind, ahead—and I still catch myself sometimes, those things are really embedded—but meeting students where they're at, giving them an authentic learning sweet spot.

Third, I think we really wanted a social emotional component. And to us, that means community. There is community, friendship, relationship skills. How do we interact with our neighbor? We actually wanna be part of a neighborhood. We want to be out in the community. We want that veil between school and community to mesh a little bit more. We want students to see themselves as part of a community, but that also meant how do we take care of ourselves when we're dysregulated or how do we act as part of a group? How do we take care of our relationships?

Outside, meeting students where they're at, relationships—those were the three things that floated to the top when we first started. And then every choice after that, we had a commitment to let these things be our North Star and make every decision based on that.

## Organizational Structure and Legal Framework

**Kristin:** So that led to how many students do we want? That led to what type of organizational structure are we gonna be? So technically we are a nonprofit that serves homeschool families. And right now that is satisfying the law in Minnesota and it may change and we'll learn how to pivot and adjust to that if needed.

So we sound like a school, we breathe like a school, have blood and veins like a school, we talk like a school, but technically we are a nonprofit that serves homeschool families. So those basic decisions—what will our budget look like? What materials will we buy? What will our calendar, daily calendar, daily schedule look like? A lot of those decisions we made on these Saturday mornings, but these three things were always leading the way.

## Fear and Trust in Educational Change

**Ela Richmond:** That makes sense and it's really fascinating that it started with this sentiment question, right? How do we increase and better the sentiment of teachers and students? Were you all ever afraid? You said that you let go of all these measuring sticks that you had learned and that you had used as a teacher for so long in traditional school. Was it really hard in the beginning to let go of those measuring sticks and be like, okay, but what if we let them go outside more often? What if we structure things differently? Are we still serving the purpose that we are hoping to serve?

**Ginger:** Absolutely, I think there was some apprehension on my end. I think part of it, when I think about my apprehension, was having each other. I actually trust between the two of us that what's going to end up happening is actually best for students. And because we've had a friendship, but also research, right? Research backs up that play is so important. Research backs up the social emotional regulation in kids that they need to feel safe. They need to be seen. They need to feel connection in order to learn, in order for their giftings and their strengths to actually come to the top, in order to have confidence to be willing to be vulnerable and make mistakes. So I think there was some fear, but all of those other things outweighed the fear.

And also, I think the first time we got paid, our first paycheck was just reassuring both to myself and my husband. It's like, okay, yes, we are getting paid for this also. So that helped. In the first day, I think there was just so much excitement and knowing that we were stepping into something new for this area that we were creating. And because I have, this is my 26th year of teaching.

So I think going into it, knowing that I've had touch points with pretty much K through eighth grade. I know where kids need to be. When they leave eighth grade, when they leave first grade, kind of the skill academic check, I feel confident in knowing where kids need to be and supporting them wherever they're at to get to where they need to be. So there was this level of confidence and excitement that outweighed the fear.

## Starting With Bare Bones and Building Up

**Ginger:** And that first day, part of me wishes we would have just recorded just for our sake because we really did start with just bare bones, bare bones. What does it look like to really see students and see kids and build a program around where students are at and what they need?

So we stripped a lot of the structure we typically have in the classroom. We're like, OK, let's start without it. And slowly but surely we started adding components of a typical classroom. So if you come in, you know, a typical day at school or morning, you'll have three different small groups. And within those small groups, you'll see components of a typical classroom, except kids are working independently and you have multi age working on all different things. But you still see that structure that typical classrooms have.

## Student Transformation and Sentiment Changes

**Ela Richmond:** That's so fascinating. Have you also seen a sentiment change in your students? What is the reaction been by students going through this new type of learning or this more flexible type of learning?

**Kristin:** Well, I think we have two types of students. You have students that have been in different institutions that come to Scola, and you have students that have been here since kindergarten that actually Scola is their only framework for education. So I think there's definitely our kids who have been in other institutions. Just like there had to be some undoing for us, there is this undoing process.

And it's interesting, I think our admissions process really just tries to honor that it's going to take some time. It's going to take some time to shed the old in order to try on and see the values of the new thing. I gave myself some time. I probably should have given myself some more time.

Both of us listened to a lot of podcasts. We were trying to fill our backpack with all this inspiration to get the courage to do this and just try. And like what Ginger said, the research and people cheering us on, just the personal investments we had from friends and colleagues. And anytime we would share what we were doing, I don't think there was a single person that was like, well that's weird. Everyone was like, yeah.

But I think what was interesting is when we were starting to get students, we were giving ourselves time. We heard this quote of, it's going to take for however many years you're in a system, it's going to take that many months to actually shed everything off before you can rebuild it back up, right? So I was coming out with 16 years or 18 years of teaching. So I needed to give myself 18 months. So that's like two years of school of really undoing these things.

And then just knowing when we go through admissions, the unique group here is people who start in Scola and that's all they know. This is what they know of school. So they're gonna walk into a school building, maybe to go visit a play or a band concert and that's going to feel weird. But then we have students coming from more of a homeschool situation and this is actually more structured than what they're used to, so they have a different learning curve than students coming from a conventional classroom.

## Whole Child Approach vs Academic Focus

**Ginger:** Absolutely. And I think when it comes to that measuring stick, I think as educators, we've always had the philosophy of seeing the whole child and valuing academics as part of that. But there's also athletic ability, social, emotional, being good at relationships, all of these things that make us humans. But in typical classical education institutions, it really is academics that gets the majority of focus and you know that's what you're seeing as a classroom teacher.

So I think in this space, yes obviously we are a school and academics is important, but kids are confident because when they come into this space, because we've shed, which has taken some time, we've understood okay this is important but actually who you are as an image bearer of God is actually most important. And this is how we're gonna see each other. And I think that when kids learn that and they start to see each other in their giftings and the way that they're wired and unique, there's just this confidence that they're able to come into a space and learn and be vulnerable and be able to make mistakes in ways that I don't feel like as an educator I could tap into to quite the same degree when I have 26 students in one classroom that I have these measuring sticks that I'm being evaluated on if I don't get them from point A to point B.

So the pressure for our students is off, hopefully, and it takes some time for them to get there. And also the pressure for us is off to fully see students. And I think something that looks a little different, we have progress reports, but we don't do letter grades. So even in middle school, there's not letter grades. Now there is, we are looking at grade level, where should students be at, where they fall for their grade level. And then we have a narrative side. And the narrative side gets into social, gets into play. And the narrative I would say is most important because we're small.

We get to really see students and really know students and come alongside students in a way that I just, I've never had the ability to do in a typical classroom setting. And that correlates then with getting to know the families. Families are our number one, especially as homeschool families, mom and dad, they're actually in the driver's seat. So we partner with families. It is a partnership.

And in real time, because we're small, in real time, if there's a question or if there's something that comes up, I can give mom and dad a call or a quick text, hey, this is happening. How was your morning? So in real time, to have this understanding of exactly what's going on socially, emotionally with a child, the value, I cannot overemphasize the value of that component.

When it comes to actually then going into academics, academics is not always easy. Our students will face some challenging moments when it comes to that threshold of learning something new, right? There is this grit that's required when learning something new. And I think our students are able to tap into that grit because these other things have been checked that are actually more important. And I think in a classroom, typical classroom, yes, those boxes are being checked for some students, but not all. And students, they have a good way of hiding that sometimes where they look like they have it all together. And then you are looking at work or you're doing some assessment and you recognize that the connections are not being made.

So being able to meet those needs in real time has just been amazing.

## Education Philosophy: Process Over Outcome

**Ela Richmond:** Before we get into play, I kind of want to dive into just the education piece. Has the way that Scola is structured—the structure versus non-structure comparatively to a traditional education approach—has that changed the way that students and parents think about education too in your school? Have you had those conversations with families that came from a traditional school—has it changed their relationship with education and learning?

**Kristin:** Yeah, that's really interesting. So many families, mine included at one point, the relationship with school was actually about the outcome and the grades. Right, that's actually where most everyone—teachers, learners, parents—everyone was prioritizing that. Everyone was trying not to. I think there were huge efforts to say it's not about the grade, but the constraints were so strong, the current was so strong that no matter how hard you tried, it still was so much time, so much money, so much emphasis put on the grade.

So I think we're still probably trying to find the right words of what shifts and how we can describe families' relationships to education when that's actually not the main point, right? So outcomes will happen, but when you put more time and more investment in the process and in the learning, there's just a different posture towards outcomes. And there's just a different posture towards what learning can look like, right?

**Ela Richmond:** I find that fascinating because in every aspect of our lives, we understand that that's true, right? In something as simple as working out, in something as simple as our marital relationships and our love relationships. We understand that everything hits the road and everything becomes true in a moment. Right? So the habit of choosing your husband, the habit of showing up to the gym—all of that matters so much more than let's say a physique or a weight or whatever it is. It will come. But it's funny because from a school perspective, we all just focus on the outcome as opposed to how can we nurture the moment? How can we put into the moment as much as possible? Because it is unreasonable to assume that if we put all of this into the moment and we do that consistently for say five plus years that the outcome won't be good.

**Kristin:** Now you're getting into a philosophy podcast here, right? The telos or the main component of why we educate has shifted. Right. And we all kind of see the historical benefit of that. And now I don't want to get too deep into that because I want everyone to have access to that, right? And that might mean that we have to shift some things or create schools so that as many people as possible can have access. And I think that's where our dream is too, right? We love Scola, we love what's being created. And we do get frustrated with, but how could every kid have opportunity to this, right? We also see some of the limitations in what we've built that we care about our kids in the Twin Cities. We care about our kids in our city. So we get frustrated sometimes even with the limitations of that.

## Access and Educational Equity

**Ginger:** Just tapping on access. I think our heart, our desire is that every kid has access to a meaningful education where they are taught by healthy educators and they themselves, their needs are being met and they're learning, right? And thankfully in the Twin Cities, we have access to lots of different choices. There are thriving public schools. There are great charter schools that have been well established. There are wonderful private schools. There are micro schools that are popping up. But again, it is limited as far as being a tuition driven school that not everybody has access to it.

So I think that access is really important. We do not have a solution to that at all, but we are thankful to live in the Twin Cities where there are options as far as open enrollment and even online options for families. And I think one thing that's so important to us, and even it ties back into your previous question of how does this change people's posture, how does this change actually parents' approach to education? I think when we speak about teacher health, our families have started really caring about teacher health. We talk about that a lot. So we talk about our school is better when we stay healthy and when we stay effective. And here's actually practically what we mean by that.

And then encouraging people, some of our families have students in more than one school. They actually have the opportunity to pick the school model that fits their kid and they might be at a couple different ones. And so helping them even—how can you help the health of teachers in other schools? It really comes down to that effective teaching. Effective, healthy teachers really do make a significant impact in the education of your neighborhood, of your city. Effective teachers are really amazing. And the reach of an effective teacher can go a long way, farther than just the classroom that they work in.

So even shifting some of the posture of we are pro education, so we are not—we actually do not plan to be in competition with anyone in our city. We want more healthy options. We want more sustainable schools. We want more healthy teachers and we're doing our little micro part here, but as much as we can be in relationship with school districts and keep that a positive relationship, learn from them, connect with them, how can we help with resources, how can we help actually this whole thing to grow, not just us be in this competitive market. That doesn't actually make any sense on our part.

## Finding the Right Educational Fit

**Ela Richmond:** I fully agree. How would you, as both parents and teachers, recommend that people find the thing or the school model or the approach that works for their kids specifically?

**Ginger:** There's so many things that add up to that. Convenience is a really strong factor. And we had even some really good school years, even though that was our top value for a year—we just needed to pick the convenient option. My kids were okay. And there were things that we supplemented or did different because of that.

I do think, and again, I think this ties into a previous question, your kids' motivation, your students really tapping into how are they motivated? What gets them motivated? And again, we have a variety of students here. One thing that has been really cool and very beneficial, but has taken time is student motivation. In my previous classrooms, student motivation was really dependent on me in the way that we have structured school.

And also letting some of these priorities rise to the top, it has shifted the motivation onto students a lot more. Students still need us, they need an on-ramp, they need us to do the direct instruction for new things, the check-ins, the feedback. But there are many times, Ginger and I, it happens several times a week where our students—all of sudden, there's 32 different things going on in this room. And we just kind of stare at each other. And we go fill up our coffee. And you can just feel—we bask in it actually is what happens. Cause this is the teacher's dream. This is where we're actually being needed at the right amount. This is us doing our job in the way we love doing our job.

And it's this level of student independence, student motivation, student—they have the right resources, the tools, and they get to drive it, right? Now those moments don't last the whole day. So please know that we can go fill up our cup of coffee before we have to attend to something. But it really is a lot more like gardening in a way. It's a lot more a tending job, more than kind of push through or drive the train type of job.

**Ginger:** And going back to what would we say to parents who are trying to pick the right fit space for their child and their learning? When you first start that process, when we meet kindergarten, going into kindergarten with parents, I think we like to please just put them at ease. I think sometimes there's this pressure like I have to get it right. If I don't get it right it's gonna throw the whole sequence. So especially for kindergarten parents just putting that pressure off and saying okay, here's what you can expect at Scola.

If you're looking when you're looking at institutions, trying to talk to administrators, trying to get physically in the building and I would suggest if you can make it happen during a typical school day, you really can get a sense of what's the culture, right? What are you seeing? What are you feeling as a parent? Can you see your child in the hallways? Can you see your child in this classroom? So I recommend parents if they can get in during the school day for a tour and really trusting their gut and what they're feeling and what they're seeing.

When it comes to standardized tests and you see these schools ranked by test, I recommend looking at that but that should not be the driving factor for deciding on a school. There's so many things behind the scene that goes on when these tests are given to measure a particular student at a particular time in the day at a particular time when they're going through their curriculum. So again, if you want to look at that, use that, you can, but I would put that lower on the list when it comes to looking at possible schools.

## Understanding Student Motivation

**Ela Richmond:** There's natural student motivation—some students are just naturally gifted and they naturally gravitate toward certain topics. But then there's motivation by osmosis almost where a student is around other students who care about X or a student is around a family member that they really look up to who cares about X or Y. How do you, especially early on from a teaching perspective and a parent perspective, help your kid to foster those motivations?

**Kristin:** I think Ginger's so good at this, so I've learned a lot from her, just even about how to ask kids questions of what they're proud of, right? And so, I love telling kids I'm proud of them. And so I still do, it's not like I cut that out of my life. But there is something about specific praise, really helping kids feel internally proud. A lot of this honestly comes underneath teaching kids about emotions, teaching kids about their own, the way that they feel, even feeling frustrated, going through some of the more difficult feelings and having them aware and acknowledging those things actually is all a part of this, right?

So that social emotional piece actually plays a huge part in motivation because students have to recognize what proud even feels like and not proud because someone else told me that this was good, but I feel proud. I feel really good about this, right? Even though there might not be a grade attached, there's not any type of recognition that I'm not relying on those types of things, right? And so I even think what types of questions to ask kids, guiding them in some of their freedom.

**Ginger:** My mind goes to teaching kids that intrinsic motivation, right? And I think it's not about them making me proud. It's actually about them feeling accomplished and proud for the work that they've done. So I think in thinking about my small group as kids are working, maybe they're working on math. And within 20 minutes, there might be a kid that finishes 10 problems, right? And there might be a kid that finishes one. And really setting up a culture where, whether it's one or 10, you get to feel proud of your accomplishments.

So recognizing in that moment that kiddo who might've just finished one problem, but he focused, he stuck with it. And just recognizing, noticing that, hey, such and such, how does that make you feel? Look at what you just did on your own. And I think there's also this piece of working in multi age, where they get to work with one another, they get to bring it out in each other and recognize, again, it takes some time, but recognize we're not in a hurry. There actually isn't one student that is getting the gold star today because we all are working at different levels.

And I think working in multi-age, they get to come alongside of each other, really learn how to coach, not just give an answer, but what does it look like to share how you got the answer? What are some strategies you used? It's really, really special. And I can just picture that kid that comes up to me. They're so excited because they did X, Y, Z and just turning that around with a big smile on my face. How does that make you feel? I feel so excited. Look what I did. Why don't you go share that with your teammate at your table.

And it does take some intentional reframing of it. The teacher is not the center. They're not doing this for me, but what does it look like to do it for establishing the habit, for the process, for the learning, for reaching that goal, feeling that feeling. So that once again, when they try something new tomorrow, they kind of remember what that felt like and they're able to gain the confidence and have that when they feel like quitting, okay, you got to that yesterday, let's keep on going.

**Ela Richmond:** That is huge. I just want to shed light on that for a second and highlight. It is so easy as both a parent and a homeschool parent and also a teacher and also anybody that is really excited and really cares about the success of a child to be the person that they turn to and show their success. And they're like, mom, be so happy. But it is really, really important for that not to be the end of it, for it to be, I am so happy for you, you should also be happy for you. And creating that line between this is not just about pleasing me, this is about doing something that is just inherently really good. You just did something that was awesome. And reminding them that it is not just about the pat on the back that you're getting, but it is also about the result that they are getting for themselves. I've never heard that one before, but I think it's a subtle thing, but it is so important.

**Kristin:** Yeah, well, it's the adult paycheck world too, right? We do this for the paycheck and we also do this because of the good work that's done in me and also that I can do for other people. There's actually a lot of research on motivation. There is a book out there, I think it's called The Disengaged Teen, and they actually have really good words on the different motivations that each person taps into.

And to be honest, I'm still so new. We're probably more the labs. We're actually hands-on, experiencing all these things. We may not have all the scientific words on what we're seeing, but you really can start to see that kids go in and out of different types of motivations too, right? And when you know a student, when you are known and when you belong and when you have a teacher or a guide or a person who's tending your environment to help you, there's just a lot of space. There's a lot of chances to take risks and grow.

And I think that's what's so nice about having some narrative reporting, not just grades or numbers attached to things is this is the character development that people talk about, right? Is how I use my motivation, how I use my passion to accomplish some things and not everything I like, right? There are just some things that these are really good skills to learn. This is also just good for my brain. I'm experiencing brain health and brain growth from doing some of these things.

I think motivation is one of those topics where it is a vulnerable place for students. Many of them have learned how to hide or to cope or to only be motivated by the thing, right? The prize or the bribe. And I have been the prize and bribing teacher, so I'm not exempt from that in any way. But to start to see that shift is something that I think we love writing about in these reports out to parents, because that's the type of character and really helpful knowledge that parents want as they try to help guide their kid in passions and in some places of growth.

## The Four Categories of Play

**Ela Richmond:** I wanted to ask you a question about play, right? As adults, we all recognize that being in a hurry is not great, right? And we've talked about the focus on outcome, especially in a normal school setting. When kids play and when they are outside and when they're doing all of these things, it feels as an onlooker, they're not being productive. How could they be filling their time differently, right? As adults, we even ask ourselves that question. Why do y'all say yes to play for kids? What is in play that actually makes it—well, it's not quote unquote productive—actually is very, very useful for children?

**Ginger:** I would love for you to start because observing play, again, both of us have our masters and maybe someday we'll go on because there's so much research here. And in the observation of play, there's actually some categories that come up.

**Kristin:** OK. So again, we just want to honor that there's real scientists and researchers who probably have language around this. And we just haven't found their book yet. So we don't claim to have all of this data and observations from students and don't quite know all of the language. But again, this was a vulnerable shift for both Ginger and I, because as a conventional teacher, you are taught to be so—efficiency drives the system and play just doesn't, it's not efficient.

**Ginger:** And you also in—again, the shedding off is like if I took my kids outside for an extra recess, I just felt like I'd be judged. Like my kids are not working enough. Even just the shedding of earning and deserving. There's such a currency that's required in play. And that's just not honoring that play's actually the heavy hitter when it comes to skills, right?

And I think Peter Gray says it—this is the job of children. Play is the job of kids. OK, so we are, on average, we do about three hours outside. Now we're also Minnesotan. And so there's, we have four distinct seasons. And so sometimes three hours is really difficult. The weather doesn't shape up to that. But and then probably at different ages, that three hours outside just looks different.

So we will hold classes. I take on our fifth through eighth grade-ish students, 10 through 12 year olds, 10 through 14 year olds. So we do classes out there. We will hike. So there will be different seasons where we will structure some of that outside time, but then also we wanna honor that unstructured outside is important. We also care about safety. We care about liability and these types of things. So we spend a lot of time at the beginning of school just addressing and giving kids freedom, but also them knowing their risks and that type of stuff.

Anyway, we were sitting outside and our job changed when we made this a priority because recess duty, I've done recess duty and I know where my eyes are, I know what my job is, but this just felt different. It probably was subtle enough where I actually am watching students and all of these skills emerge. I'm actually not checking out or thinking about my next lesson or just trying to manage conflict all the time. My job opens up a little bit more to really watching students, listening to them talk, not jumping into conflict right away, but seeing when to get involved in those types of things.

Anyway, it was in one of my times outside as a researcher. And I remember there were pockets of groups of kids around different things and they were all fully engaged, 100% engagement. And I just kind of noticed the projects they were doing. So I came up in four different categories.

So there definitely was the **imagination group** where they would use the—they would be playing store. They would be playing city. They would have these walnuts to use as their currency and their economy. There was a realtor and there was a—but this could also get into a lot of times the stories that we're reading, the books, it's the book report getting played out in these types of settings too. So there's the first category is just imagination.

And then the second category is just the **competitive structured games**. Usually the games that have rules attached to it. This would be the hide and seek, the football, the bat, and those types of things. And they just feel more organized, right? They feel not as loose ended.

The third one, which is so interesting is like **civil engineering**—digging the holes, gathering the branches. Making a path of water in a dam and using rocks and sticks and seeing which way the water is going to go. There was one time we have a couple of great wooded areas and before we knew it, every dead branch, and we're not even on our property, we're in a city park. And so every dead branch in the entire woods was collected and gathered in a place. And so I had to call the city office being like, okay, I don't even know if you wanted this project done, but we gathered all the dead sticks for you if you wanted to come pick—someone has to come pick these up because now they're in the way of the playground. So we called it civil work and engineering.

And then the fourth one is simply just **social**. There is just the hangout, the talking, the telling jokes, the bantering back and forth.

So we actually have really used these four categories to be helpful in helping students see where their time management is, where their skill set is, where their communication, some of those executive functioning. And then also what's interesting is when we talk about kids, and this is now part of our—we don't really have staff meetings. What happens is Ginger and I are outside, we're getting the fresh air that we need. We stand almost back to back. And so one teacher is facing one way and one is facing the other way. And we have the time, we have the space to actually name every kid we see and just make observations about them.

And again, just what you were saying about habits building over time, this has been, this is what you dreamt about in teacher meetings where you could actually talk about students. You could actually talk about how you see them growing, what you see them doing. Okay, I'm a little concerned. It feels like maybe anxiety is really present here or they're just in conflict a lot with this type of person. But also we could make observations of what category of play do they like to go in the most, which ones actually feel the most challenging.

We have some students, they are just begging that people play an organized game with them. And they beg us sometimes, could you just start a capture the flag or a kickball game? They want the rules, they want the teams, they want a winner, they want a loser. And that's actually where they feel comfortable. But challenging them to join the imaginary group and like, well, there's this really cool walnut currency game going on in the woods. And seeing how that stretches them and grows them a little bit.

So I think that's where these four categories have been really helpful to us because they really help us see where students prefer and also just some of the skills that are needed in a few of these categories to play. So we actually present this to our parents. We talk about it. We post this on Instagram, just this is what, if we were to write a book, this would probably be an easy topic for us to just get started of just the categories of play that we have seen shape up here. And then also the skills that come from it.

And I think it also gives an opportunity for students to think about, okay, what do I want to engage in? What do I want to do during this time? And as we're out there, as we're watching, we notice, we might notice a student off by themselves. We'll give it a little time to see if they join, but after a while, we might just go over there and say, hey, I noticed that you're spending time by yourself. Can you tell me about that? Is this a choice? Do you just need some quiet alone time? If that's the case, that is okay. Or is there something that you would like to join? Is there a game that you see going on that you would like to join? Would you like some help in joining that game?

So I think a piece that happens in small, again, is really getting to know students as individuals and getting to know them and how they're wired and helping them start to understand their natural tendencies and how they're wired. That is actually completely okay if you want to be by yourself right now and just spend some time alone. But if you'd like some help in joining a group or if there's some sort of personal or relationship conflict that is—you don't feel invited, let's go ahead and talk about that. And let's go ahead and work through that in real time.

Versus in other settings after recess, some days would probably take a half an hour as a classroom teacher trying to get to the bottom of all the social things that happened during that time. In real time we're able to help students gain the skills so that they're able to work through it and sometimes they need help from an adult and sometimes they don't. Sometimes they're like I think that I can—I would like to do this on my own. Great. I'm gonna walk with you but why don't you go ahead and talk with that other student. Again it's that real time as I'm going into year four that I really think has made so much difference.

And I know we talk about play, but that being outside, being outside the benefit to me personally, to get outside in nature, no matter the weather, even on a cloudy day, to be able to get outside, to breathe in some fresh air for our students and for us as educators, has just been amazing on my own mental, emotional health. I just feel just more at peace when I have touch points where I'm outside to be able to give our students that. And I think this setting, they probably won't recognize the benefits, whether they spend a year here, or all nine years, I don't think they'll recognize the benefits that they're receiving in this place until they're older.

## The Science Behind Extended Play Time

**Ela Richmond:** Those are y'all's categories of play, right? How do you actively use that to shape the way that you approach students? Now that you all have this framework and this ability to categorize the way that students naturally just lean towards certain roles and opportunities, what do you do with that?

**Kristin:** Yeah, I mean, I think we talk about it a lot. So just even in our outside staff meeting, right? Some I really like to take video and snapshots and part of it, obviously putting it as a marketing tool, just even getting other people to have an expanded view of what school could look like, a reimagined school day. We do post a lot of this stuff and actually we use these categories as kind of a teaching moment for parents and other people.

But I think internally it really has helped us know how can we help a student grow or know a student better. And going back to your original question, doesn't this sound really productive, right? Play and this amount of time outside. And again, we kind of have, I think we came down to most of our old recess times in our former workplaces were 15 to 20 minutes. Honestly, some of these categories don't even show up until you're outside for 40 minutes. And so there's even kind of a timing science behind this. If we want these four categories to show up, at minimum an hour. And then what's even better is if you can add another hour, then you get to help kids and watch kids through the transition out of one thing and into another thing. And so that's usually at an hour and a half or two hours.

And so part of this Ela maybe is our, we built this so that we could feel productive. We could check the productive question. I don't think that's all of it. I mean, this is fascinating and this is what we'd sit through professional developments about how important this is for the brain and just neurologically what's happening here. But I think we use those four categories to help us build our schedule, keep track of our community, really help know where kids can grow and also where they feel the most comfortable, where we can celebrate them.

At the end of each day we do an I appreciate session. And just giving kids enough time for some leaders to pop up and then another idea pop—idea generation and kids moving from one element of play into another. It gives them a chance to actually see the giftings in other people. And now it brings up plenty of conflict too, so please don't think that we're conflict free. But even that, that amount of time helps us in real time, just like what Ginger said, it hits part of our relationship goal because we can really teach kids what it is to manage conflict and go through those types of things.

## Practical Implementation for Parents

**Ela Richmond:** This is so fascinating. Most children have a slight tendency to over-watch screens, right? Because screens are high dopamine and because, as a kid, you don't necessarily have the ability to regulate yourself and it's fun. But because kids are trapped in their screens, it's really, really hard to get that 45 plus minutes of, okay, I'm bored. I'm bored. I'm bored. What do I do? That time is so good for a kid to really figure it out, but here y'all are saying that you don't really get to the point where you're discovering these things about your kid until it's quite a bit after that time. How do you practically, how would you recommend to a parent or a family to even instill this as a habit? How would you recommend 45 plus minutes, an hour and a half of just—we're going outside. Did you, whenever y'all started Scola, have any pushback from kids?

**Ginger:** Yeah, I think first I'll just take the question on as a parent. I think if you're trying to grow a child's stamina, think about where you're at. You don't go from zero to 50, right? So think about where you're at and just make a goal of all right, typically we get outside 10 minutes a day. Let's make a goal today of 20 and then build from there. So just building on where you're already at.

I also think both as parents and educators, I've gotten really comfortable even this summer with my son, I've gotten comfortable with I'm bored. Actually, that's okay. The best stuff comes from boredom. Here's a few ideas, coming up with a list of ideas, helping them out. But at the same time, it probably is—now my son's 15—very limited screens. He's not on screens during the day at all. Probably takes about five, 10 minutes. And then what does he have out? He has his Legos out and he's building something. He has this super creative car that he came up with on his own or he's out on his bike or he's taking his fishing pole to the lake, which I guarantee you if screens were an option for him, he probably wouldn't be doing those things.

So I've been okay. And I, as a parent, I do not have it all figured out, but I've been okay. He'll tell me he's bored. I'm like, okay. Yeah, I can be validating your feeling. That can be a real feeling. And then setting up, as an educator, we didn't start out with three hours a day outside. Kids came in, they had to grow their stamina. We had to grow our ability to feel comfortable and trust the research and that this actually is really good for kids. And then as we walked through it, as we observed. Now we're like, my goodness, the research is right. We have validation as educators that this is really important to our students and our students are growing and becoming more confident as a direct result of this play.

We have tech even in Scola too, right? We will have math games, we'll have some brainless games too. So it's not even that they all have to be academic. And we have some carved out times. I think that's what's helpful is actually having some time carved out. They know when it's coming, they know that even when they're in there, they're going to enjoy it. There's a start, there's a stop. So we even do stuff where every Thursday, this is how we end the day is laptop time, and we'll put some boundaries around what that happens. But I think honoring that screens are here probably to stay. And also there's some skills to get in that too.

Yeah, building up the stamina. And then also we had some interesting supplies that are just helpful. I think, getting some of those supplies, if you wanted to do some more outside time, you don't have to get stuff right away because I think if we were to purchase stuff right away before really experiencing this, we wouldn't have gotten the right stuff. So hold off just a little bit and just see when this play comes up. Do you need to buy the nice shovel? Cause maybe digging holes really is the thing. Or all of our jump ropes. We buy jump ropes and then they're rarely used for jump roping. They're used for slingshots. They're used for measuring.

And so just even interesting, a lot of natural materials. Man, do our kids know how to collect sticks and make things out of sticks. And so just even as an adult being aware if you want to increase the outside time, knowing that there are some materials that really do aid and help with play, but being willing to wait and see what shapes up. And then there are just some kids that will, they will increase their stamina faster if they just have people to do it with, right? There are some of our kids who could play alone outdoors just fine, but for a family who we want to encourage, pair up with another family and just bring them to a creek, bring them to a climbing place or something and get those kids some time outside.

## Student Development and Gifting Recognition

**Ela Richmond:** Do students shift between different types of play? And when it comes to aligning the types of play with also the next thing that they could be interested in, are you all putting things in front of them too or telling parents, hey, your kid has this natural tendency to do this really cool thing. You should introduce them to one, two, three, four, five, whatever. Do you all do that?

**Kristin:** Yeah, I think many times we do that. This is kind of the good starting point of talking about the whole child is we're really trying to tell parents and most of them already know this, but a lot of times I think they want to know what sticks in a group of people. What sticks without them? A lot of leadership conversations come out or there are just some students where they would rather have something planned for them and they just follow along and that's okay too, right? And so, talking to parents just about how we see the growth in that, right? A strong leader, maybe taking a side job and not sabotaging or taking over the project is real growth. That's actually a really important life skill that we wanted to communicate to the parents.

We also end the year and we call them huddle awards. So we've just created this list of different characteristics that we see in kiddos. So a huddle award might be project manager. So we think about the kiddo that this has come to the surface. So each year we end the year and play is a huge place where we get the data and obviously letting families and kids know. This is not all we see, but this year and here specifically how we've seen it throughout the school day.

**Ela Richmond:** That's so cool. Y'all are so fascinating, by the way, and I absolutely love your approach to educating. I think it is so rare to find teachers that are coming up with theories while they're on the job. You're here, you're watching students, you're learning from them, you're like, okay, hold on a second, that's really interesting that this is happening. And then you're extrapolating all of these ideas and thoughts. You're trying to become better teachers by it. And I absolutely love that approach. I also think it's so cool that through your micro school, because it is yours, you get to take this and create the structure around it. So you get to say, okay, here are the things that we're witnessing. Here's the pattern that we've seen. We're actually gonna take this and implement it and see if this actually sticks. I think that's so awesome.

## Knowing When to Intervene

**Ela Richmond:** The last question that I'll share with you is when it comes to gaps. Ginger, you're talking about the fact that when it comes to a student who is alone for a second, sometimes y'all will go over to them and say, hey, do you actually want to be alone? Do you want to play with anybody? What is actually happening here? It sounds like y'all have done a very good job of building trust. So your students seem to, because you come to them and you ask and you actually care, it seems like they're more likely to tell you things pretty quickly. But a lot of parents have wondered the question of, okay, well, how much should I be stepping in as opposed to just giving them the space to figure it out? How do y'all determine when to step in and when to give them the space to figure it out?

**Ginger:** That's such a good question, and it really comes from knowing the student and knowing what skills they have and what skills are growing, right? So it can be the same age child, but there's one student that just understands how to confront another, how to acknowledge and express their feelings, but also then give the other student a chance to say their feelings and come up with a compromise. And there are other students that just need some help. And it really, I don't know how else to explain it Ela, but it comes from knowing the student.

And then also that trust starts with the families, right? I think when we interview families about the possibility of enrollment in admissions, we understand there has to, in this style of learning, there has to be a level of trust that's established with families. And it's okay if families aren't feeling that from us or want something different. We actually aren't offended by that. We wanna honor that in that family.

So I think that trust that you're talking about is the foundation and it starts with our families being able to trust us, to trust our opinion. That doesn't mean that they're going to agree with everything we say or we see, but we have this relationship where we can report what we're seeing and they get to speak into it too. So the trust starts with the parents, with the families, and then it takes time to build it with students.

But students can see past when you want, as a teacher, when you want to just get onto the next thing that you're asking to put a bandaid on it, students see right past that. And guess what? That bandaid doesn't last. That bandaid is going to be torn off and show up as maybe a behavior that's disruptive when it comes time to more of an academic setting. So I think because we know that, because of our experience, and because we understand nothing happens that's going to be sustainable and lasting and worthwhile without that trust.

And I think we're coming, teaching is so formation. So I think we use that word and we are a faith-based school, but I think even a friend who might be not coming from the same posture would probably agree with us that there's such forming and shaping in a school setting, no matter what the model. And so formation takes time, formation takes a lot of care, formation takes seeing. We're going to be shaped and formed whether we're intentional about it or not. And that's just how powerful classroom settings can be. And so I think we take that seriously and we make sure we tell parents this is what parents are feeling too, right? Their kid will go through formation and shaping in this school experience. So just telling them what's important to us.

I think also just being veteran teachers, right? And that we are healthy. This is why I think teacher health is so important is because when we're healthy, we're actually gonna approach the formation of students and we're gonna see them as people. We're gonna see them as whole people, people we care about. We have patience and care and trust for your family and good communication around that.

I just, that formation word is important to us and is the foundation. We want to be really honest with parents and let them know that they can be honest with us too. And so that's why I think we put out there in front of everybody, these are the things that are gonna be really important to us. We're not gonna be good at all of the things, but these are the things that are gonna be really intentional.

## Closing and Contact Information

**Ela Richmond:** This was an incredible episode. I'm beyond fascinated by your approach to play. I'm so happy for Minnesotan families that they get to go to your school. And for those that have just found it to be amazing, so happy for them. If any of our listeners are from Minnesota, they can check you out. We'll leave all of your description links and everything below. Is there anything else that you want to leave our listeners off with?

**Kristin:** I would just say if there's any other educators out there that as we're talking or as you've listened to podcasts, you're starting to get just this idea of, well, what if, could I? We would love to hear from you. We actually have just a model school. So other educators reach out to us and just are curious about how we did this and what maybe they could do. So I would just encourage them to reach out to us. We'd love to chat with them.

**Ela Richmond:** I love it. Okay, we'll leave all of your links in the description. If anybody wants to reach out, they definitely can. If anybody wants to look into your school, they definitely can. This was, again, beyond fascinating. And yeah, I hope to hear from you all soon. Thank you all so much for coming on the episode.

**Kristin & Ginger:** Thank you, Ela.

## Rough Transcript

Ela Richmond (00:00.982) Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm Ella, your Sometimes host, and today I'm joined by Peggy. Thank you so much for being here, Peggy.

Peggy (00:09.705) Thank you, Ella, for having me. I'm looking forward to this conversation.

Ela Richmond (00:13.012) Yeah, so you are a mom of two and you recently opened Apogee, a program in Utah, right in September. So we're going to get into all of that and kind of how you have been running it and kind of like what the program even is about. But before we do that, I want I want to kind of like hear your story. So you were a public school teacher for 12 years.

Peggy (00:22.685) Yes, ma'am.

Ela Richmond (00:40.512) which is very, very unique in the sense that you got to experience the inside of the education system. You got to experience, you know, the ways that things are being taught and all the things that you had to do. But eventually you left it. And I'm curious to hear why, because, I mean, I would imagine that that's a pretty difficult decision to say, you know, I put my life into this. Now I'm going to leave it.

Peggy (01:09.791) Yep, absolutely. It wasn't a lighthearted decision, that's for sure, because I went and got my college degree in human development and then I went and got my master's degree in early education, early elementary education. And so I was committed. I was in it, you know, and I started out in a Title I school and I was a first grade teacher. So excited to go and change the world.

what I thought I was gonna do. And then I was in there and you know, and I became a part of every different committee you could be a part of. I was a part of the PTA. I was a part of, you know, all those different subcommittees that they have to make you feel as I like to think, like I was important. Like I had input on what was happening in the education system. And as I was a part of all these pieces, I wasn't seeing the changes and I wasn't seeing what I went.

Ela Richmond (01:37.654) Yeah.

Peggy (02:06.911) to college for actually implemented in the public school system. So I really struggled with it because I put so much time and effort into it. I wasn't seeing anything change and I knew what was best for the kids, especially being having the human development background. I knew that they needed to be outside playing. I knew that testing wasn't appropriate for them. So I was, you know, I was up on, I was up at the district office as often as possible telling, you know, the people that be.

Ela Richmond (02:08.694) Mm.

Ela Richmond (02:12.578) Hmm.

Peggy (02:36.607) You know, can we do something else? there any way we can avoid testing? You know, because I would spend a month of each year teaching the kids how to test, then giving the test, then, you know, just wasting such valuable time for these little people. And it just broke my heart. And then I had two babies of my own. One of them was born in 2020. And then my next one was born in 2021. And

Ela Richmond (02:47.19) Hmm.

Peggy (03:05.317) I went back to teach a little bit after I had my first baby. And it was this perspective that I had of being a mom that I just, couldn't support this thing that I was trying to change anymore because I knew it wouldn't be good for my kids, especially having a little boy in 2021. I knew that sitting behind desks and I knew that being...

tested and being told you're not good enough, you're failing here, here, and here over and over again was not developmentally appropriate. So I had to step back from that. It didn't match who I knew I was. It just didn't match my soul.

Ela Richmond (03:49.28) Wow. How long did that take for, so it was 12 years, but like, was it, you know, making its way into your head and just like your heart over that period of time or like, what was the experience of that? I mean, in the beginning you go in and you're like, I'm gonna change things, I'm gonna help, and then you're fighting this battle relentlessly. Did it ever get to you?

Peggy (04:15.659) It got to me but I always just thought that maybe we could change it at this little tiny level, right? And then it would impact everything else. But what I didn't realize was that we didn't have control. Like it didn't matter if I went to all the curriculum meetings and looked through the curriculum and documented you know how inappropriate something was curriculum wise. It wasn't... It was just going into like a box somewhere.

Right? Just someone wanted to say, okay, thank you for your complaint. We're not really going to do anything about it. And we know it's not right, but there's people with more money that have their hands in the game and it's not going to make a difference. So it just slowly tore away. Like I became a part of the union. I was a piece of that. was the, I was our school rep for the union and it was just, I tried every different avenue.

Ela Richmond (05:00.214) No.

Peggy (05:15.355) And the changes weren't happening. And I knew that it wasn't right for kids. I knew it wasn't developmentally appropriate. And I talked to people and they'd say, yep, you're right. It's not developmentally appropriate. And it wouldn't change anything. And so I just kind of, you know, you eventually go, all right, I can't change it from here. I have to do something better. And when you have those little babies that are then yours, right? And my friends started having babies and

These lives are not just kids walking through the door. They are the lives that you know will shape the future, right? You know you have to make a change. And I knew we could make that change and we had to make that change. We owe that to our kids.

Ela Richmond (06:06.198) Wow. You have said it's not developmentally appropriate. So what's an example of that? What is something that like, I mean doubly, what is an example of something where people agreed with you? It's like, yes, no, you're right. That is not the best way for us to do it, but for some reason we can't change.

Peggy (06:24.735) Well, the biggest ones that I fought for were like recess time, right? Or sitting at their desks for, we would do blocks of like an hour and a half and the kids would sit at their desks and they wouldn't get the opportunity to move. And, you know, we would have them walk down the hallway in their little lines instead of like moving, just walking like you do in a regular environment. That's not developmentally appropriate. And kids want to...

They want to move. They want to play. They want to talk to people walking down a hallway like, come on, you don't have to be single file walking down a hallway like you can teach them how to be respectful and they can understand that they can be they can empathize with someone and go, OK, that, you know, that makes sense. But just having them walk down the hallway in a single file line that, you know, that's something that I've shifted my perspective on. But then the 15 minutes of recess, the 20 minutes of

lunch and recess combined, you know, where the kids are rushing to eat their lunch and then they're rushing outside because they want to be outside because their bodies crave that. It's just giving them that time is so much more appropriate than what we were allowed in the system. And then also the testing that we would give them. my gosh, it took so much time to teach those little ones how to fill in a bubble and how to.

like show that they knew something and maybe they just got distracted and they knew the information but they didn't show it. And then we would pull their parents in and show their parents these test scores of things that we know the kids know or maybe it's not appropriate for them at their developmental level. And we would tell the parents over and over again all year. yep. You know, red was one of the colors that we didn't that was a negative color. Right. So it would think we'd give them their their paper and

it would be red in all areas. it's like seeing that as a parent would be defeating, but then seeing it as a kid, you can't quite comprehend what's going on, why you're getting these red scores, why you're getting all this negative feedback, right? And you can't really fix it. And it's like, well, if you give them a little recess time or give them something that is more appropriate for them or something they're really interested in, they're going to do much better. And you can build their confidence, which is something

Ela Richmond (08:35.927) Yes.

Peggy (08:49.343) that you kind of take away when you remove or when you're testing them and showing them that they can't do, you know, they can't sit there for an hour to do a test. Weird. They're five, six and seven year old. can't sit for longer than 20 minutes. So that all those pieces are just not developmentally appropriate. And looking back and the Apogee Utah that we are running now and looking back at the kids that I taught for 12 years.

I feel such guilt because I kept those kids in those seats, you know, and I've seen how much the kids can do now that they get to move and we get to play. And it just it breaks my heart that I did that to so many kids, but I'm going to fix it now. This is my opportunity.

Ela Richmond (09:40.834) Wow, that's powerful. And I definitely want to come back to that in a second, which you said that it breaks your heart. But before we go there, I want to touch back on the question of like, like whenever people are looking at the different components of the school system, or like a different components of educating your child, right, and everybody's education is going to look entirely unique because every child is entirely unique. But like the thing to think about is, OK, what are we actually trying to do here? What are we actually trying to teach? So you're talking about

know, single file lines and

And you briefly said, but I think it's actually a really interesting point, like we can teach self-respect, we can teach respect to others differently. Or like, what are the things that we're actually trying to teach and are there other ways that we can teach them? One of the things that you were also talking about is like failing, right? And like the association with failure that young people are making. And it reminded me of a post that Matt Bowman, who is our founder at OpenEd recently made. And he was basically like, we've failed to value

failing. We've made failing the worst thing that a young person can do. We've told them that their value comes from their scores and in doing so we've made a stressed and anxious generation so afraid of failing and trying anything out and I feel like that's very very accurate to what you're saying and like just reflecting on the question of what are we actually trying to teach here. Okay so like it was interesting I was at a friend's house and they have a young son and he came home one day and he was just crying and she's telling me this story.

Peggy (10:46.111) you

Ela Richmond (11:14.356) She was like, he was absolutely in tears because he didn't get to finish his lunch because it's 15 minutes. And she was like, administrators and the people, I went to talk them because I was like, OK, why is it 15 minutes? He doesn't have any time. They're like, well, he's gotten into kindergarten. He needs to learn that he can't just talk. He needs to eat. And so we've cut their time so that they can learn that they need to spend it correctly. to a degree, I understand. But then like,

The question is, OK, what are the underlying fundamental skills that they're learning there? And like, is that actually necessary? And is that important? And just being able to ask those questions is really, really, really valuable. So I want to go and now hit on what you were saying about it breaking your heart and the fact that you've been able to see what kids can do whenever they're given more freedom. How is the Apogee program structured and like, what have you seen inside of kids?

Peggy (12:10.553) So there's we've got a few kids that came from like your typical public school system. And then we've got a few kids that haven't ever been in the public school system. So they're just little kids, right? They're kids coming into someplace to be educated, to learn. Right. So we've been the first like eight weeks we went through kind of unschooling ourselves for those older kids. Right. Of like, guys, we don't

Ela Richmond (12:24.033) Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (12:34.295) Mmm.

Peggy (12:38.803) We don't need to ask to go to the restroom. If you need to go to the restroom, please go to the restroom. Be respectful, right? If we are having a conversation, you're not just gonna stand up and walk away and go to the restroom, right? Powerful skill, but it gives them this sense of like, hey, I own my body, right? And I am in charge of what's happening. Just like when you are in a corporate environment or when you get outside of that.

realm of 18 years old, right? You get to make decisions for yourself. Why we make kids wait till they're 18 to all of a sudden get all the decisions in the world doesn't make sense to me. But that's what we're working on, So we're working with these kids that came from public school and unschooling themselves. If you're thirsty, go get a drink, fill up your water bottle, just be respectful. know, learning these skills that are really important in life that

we just remove in the traditional system, right? And like even with lunch, you and eating food, we don't always get hungry at the same time every day. Right. Some days like you eat something and we're and you're really full that morning or you're not you don't wake up and you're super hungry. So we're trying to teach them to listen to their bodies as well so that they know when they're hungry. OK, we eat. We also give them an hour.

Ela Richmond (13:37.28) Mm-hmm.

Peggy (14:02.367) to eat their lunch and play. So they can even like eat a little bit of their lunch, go play, come back eat. And that's what a lot of our little ones try to end up doing. And it's really fun to watch just that dynamic of not like scarfing, scarfing, scarfing their food and then running and playing, right? Because all kids, it's just they're in their hearts to go and play. They love to play, they love to be outside. So we've been really working with them. But then like we've got this younger group of kids.

that are brand new to the schooling system or to like not being just at their mom with their mom or their dad all day, right? So they're coming in and they're trying to learn how to do things on their own and they're, you know, trying to find like that boundary. So we have that opportunity to show them like, okay, you need to listen to yourself, listen to your body, but you know, you don't get up, you don't.

Ela Richmond (14:48.972) Mm-hmm.

Peggy (14:58.259) walk away from somebody when you're speaking to them to go get a drink or go to the bathroom, right? So we have this really great dynamic that is teaching the big kids like this responsibility of themselves that they haven't had before. And also these little ones are learning responsibility for their bodies as well, but in a completely different way. So, you know, we don't want to make little lemmings for lack of a better word, but just follow what everybody else does. We want them to have their own

Ela Richmond (15:10.389) Hmm.

Peggy (15:27.485) mind and be able to think about, okay, think about the next step, right? If I get up and I walk away, I might miss something that the teacher, that the guide saying, or I might miss something that's happening in this lesson, you know? And those little risks that they start to take are really powerful because they, they learn so quickly from them. They learned from the failure of, I walked away during that, you know,

Ela Richmond (15:39.287) Mm-hmm.

Peggy (15:56.543) piece of the lesson and I missed it and or I walked away from something, you know, and they learn, next time I should go to the restroom during this time or, you know, but giving them that autonomy is so powerful to see. And like I said, it's just something I'm trying to make up for because I wasn't, I didn't do it when I was a public school educator.

Ela Richmond (16:06.676) Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (16:21.13) You mentioned a guide. I'm pretty familiar with the actin model. Is that very similar to actin?

Peggy (16:28.799) So we are, so our founder, Matt Boudreaux, he opened up a few Actons around the nation and he absolutely has nothing but great things to say about Actons. And from what I know, Actons are incredible schools. Matt just wanted to add a few pieces to that model. So we use guides or coaches. It just kind of depends on the location.

But Matt wanted to make it so that the parents, do whole family education. So the parents with the tuition get mentorship from the Apogee Network. And it's a 12 month mentorship program where you get different challenges each month that you get to complete if you choose. And if it's not for you, then you choose not to do it. It's not homework by any means, but it's just a way to kind of.

Ela Richmond (17:03.394) That's cool.

Peggy (17:27.699) grow as a family. So you get that piece and then Matt also really focuses, he knows the power of physical education, of moving your body, understanding the physiology of your mind and your body. And so he wanted to open up something that incorporated those two major pieces. So that's why.

Ela Richmond (17:31.374) huh.

Ela Richmond (17:52.15) That makes sense.

Peggy (17:53.545) So that's why there's a bit of that like act in language in there, but Matt wanted to add those additional pieces, which I think are really powerful and something that attracted both my husband and I to this particular model.

Ela Richmond (18:09.088) Yeah, I love that. wanted to dive a little deeper on the idea of a guide because I feel like lot of parents are wondering, what does it look like for me to be a good parent? What does it look like for me to be a good educator and home educator? Because a lot of them are doing the job on their own. I bet that there are insights that you can pull from being a guide. What does a good guide look like? What do they do? How do they engage with kids?

Peggy (18:33.407) sure.

I think the best piece of advice I could give, and this is just being like a parent and then also a guide at my apigee.

You've got to give kids more credit than you think they deserve. They're so capable that you just need to kind of remove yourself from that role of knowing everything, if that makes sense. Like, they can do it. They are capable. You've just got to step back and let them show you what they can do. So don't interject as much as you think you should.

Ela Richmond (19:11.884) Mm.

Peggy (19:16.411) I, you know, there were a lot of times in that first session that my other guide and I would look at each other and just be like, shh, just don't say anything. Like let them figure it out, you know? They can ask questions if they really get stuck, but then if they ask those questions, don't just give them the answer, you know? Ask them more questions. Guide them to what you think might be the right answer and they maybe will.

follow that route or maybe they're gonna come up with something better because they know some more information. So I would say just pull back more than you think you necessarily need to. Don't control so much.

Ela Richmond (19:57.418) Yeah, this makes me want to ask you more about the way that you educate. So like a lot of our listeners and a lot of the families inside of OpenEd are crafting their own education, you know, and they're trying to figure out what is the best way for me to do things. And some of them are encountering challenges like my kid doesn't want to read or my kid really has struggles with math. What have you found that's really helpful and or useful?

as tip and or to help kids just continue moving forward even when there are stuck points. Because like, let's be real, know, sometimes kids are not motivated. Sometimes they really don't want to do it. Yeah. So how do y'all, how do y'all deal with that?

Peggy (20:43.379) back to what you said earlier, you've got to let them fail. And through them failing, I think that they then, they fail forward, right? We just had our first showcase with our kids and we had to let a few of them fail. And through them failing us as guides, we also kind of felt like we were failing, right? Because they weren't.

Ela Richmond (20:57.25) Hmm.

Peggy (21:12.031) they weren't holding up to their standards, but with saying that and then failing, think, I don't think, I know they failed forward and then next time it's going to be even better for them and they learned, I think, a better way to approach our sessions and I really think that sometimes you have to let them fail. And also,

Ela Richmond (21:34.337) Mmm.

Peggy (21:41.641) help them find their passion. Through any passion that a kid finds, know, with what you were saying about reading, they find a passion. If they want to really learn a lot about something that they're passionate about, they're going to learn how to read. You know, they're going to learn how to do the math that might be associated with it. So I think you have to let the kids fail. And in that, you might feel like you're failing, but...

Ela Richmond (21:43.446) Mmm.

Ela Richmond (22:00.567) Yeah.

Peggy (22:11.581) I think it will be a huge accomplishment for the kids and you've got to find what they're passionate about. And I think they'll just soar based off of that.

Ela Richmond (22:23.434) Yeah, I would agree. I was listening to Isaac Morehouse. He was talking about his son and he was like every night that his son comes into

their room to like, you know, read a bedtime story. He's like, hey, he's like, how about you read to me tonight? And the kids like, I don't know how to read. And it's hilarious because he's like, literally, you know, a day that will go by and like, I'll see him reading his baseball cards. he's like, he sees them as two entirely different things. He's told himself that he doesn't know how to read, but he can read. But he reads the things that he wants to. And like that that's fascinating that like

Peggy (22:53.619) Sure.

Ela Richmond (23:06.144) I think the motivation piece, like why am I learning this, is such an important thing for kids. Growing up, there were definitely things that I just learned because I was told to, but the things that really stick and the things that I feel like enhance my life are the things that I have.

Peggy (23:19.743) Bye.

Peggy (23:26.559) it.

Ela Richmond (23:28.258) integrated into the things that I enjoy or like integrated into my passions. Like the things that really enhance my life. Like, I mean, I can recount, you know, the alphabet and like I can recount, you know, certain, certain like little quips from, from school and yes, I still remember them, but it doesn't enhance my life. And like finding the intersection between where the things that you're learning and, you know, your unique interests and passion can.

Peggy (23:40.969) Sure.

Ela Richmond (23:55.916) come together and enhance each other. That's where it's really cool.

Peggy (24:00.997) Absolutely. Yep. And you'll I mean, and even like in our studio spaces, right, we have four through 12 year olds, four year olds can't necessarily read. There's there are a few that can, sure, you know, but then we have the 12 year olds, right. And those four year olds look up to those 12 year olds and they're like, wow, look at that. Like he's reading something really interesting right now and something that really excites him and he can read it to me. I want to be able to do that one day. Right. So

Ela Richmond (24:29.878) Mm-hmm.

Peggy (24:30.831) That's another piece of that motivation, right? It maybe might not be a passion right now, but they see, like they think that other kid or, you know, they kind of have that interest of being in alignment with these other kids in the studio space, right? They want to be able to do what that other kid can do. It's a cool, unique little thing that that 12 year old can do, right? And it's just, I think the motivation can come from that piece too, but.

Yes, you make such good points. Just that intersection is really powerful.

Ela Richmond (25:00.822) Yeah.

Ela Richmond (25:06.702) So are all of your students together no matter what age?

Peggy (25:10.761) So we have two different studios. We have a four through six group of kids and then we have seven through 12 year olds in the other studio that is, we're spaced out at different points in the day, but there's quite a few times where we come together. Like we do our physiology first workout first thing in the morning. We do that all together. And then we do our lunchtime together and we have a Socratic discussion every day and we do that together.

gets a little wild. get a lot of differences between the four and 12 year olds. But I can't tell you, it is so fun to see like the 12 year olds interact with these four and five year olds and you know, the five year olds. We've got some of them that are the five year olds that are pretty shy. But man, these older kids, just the way they speak to these little ones, it just brings a whole different perspective to the education world of that, you know, everybody has to be.

Ela Richmond (25:41.896) Yeah, I can imagine.

Peggy (26:08.701) in the first grade on the same level all the time. They just learn and ebb and flow from each other so wonderfully. during like our work cycle where we're into like our more academic pieces, are in like this, we're more separate, but a lot of the day we integrate together, so.

Ela Richmond (26:11.233) Yeah.

Ela Richmond (26:29.37) that's awesome. And how would you explain the day in the life of an Apogee student? What does that look like?

Peggy (26:36.069) Okay, so we begin the day where we come into the studio and some of the kids are working on different pieces that they're interested in, you know, finding those, the things that they're passionate about. We have one kid that really likes RC cars. He's brought a few of his RC cars and he's been working on those, getting them back to working shape. We have some of the kids that really love to come in and breed.

Ela Richmond (26:38.39) Mm-hmm.

Peggy (27:02.089) Then we have those little ones, right, that want to come in and build something with the magnetiles. So we kind of come in and just work creating, you know, just kind of waking our bodies up, getting going, getting interested in the environment that we're in. And then we go outside and we do our physiology first workout and we then come back inside, do our work cycle. And we're all working on different areas, different pieces.

One of my favorite parts of this year is that we assessed, sorry, this is a random side note. But do you want me to finish a day in the life of it and then I can come back to that? Okay. One of my favorite parts was we were trying to figure out where each kid was in like this math book, you know, because we want math to be hands-on and so we assessed all the kids and we got them in these books and.

Ela Richmond (27:38.102) No, go for it.

Ela Richmond (27:42.89) No, no, keep on going, because I'm also intrigued.

Ela Richmond (27:50.53) Mmm.

Peggy (27:59.071) one or two of the kids we were watching struggle through these books and it was just like that frustration level was too much and it wasn't creating this space where we knew we wanted the kids to come to every day. So we pulled them back and we said, okay, we know this is what everybody says you should be on. Like this is your age and this is the grade you should be in. But we want to pull you back just like.

just a little bit, just one book, right? And we wanna see how this feels. And so we did that. And it took a few conversations of us explaining to them, listen, when you get outside of like your schooling years, nobody's gonna ask you what level you are. So please forget about the number on the front of this book. We want you to feel confident in your math skills. So please just, it took a lot of those conversations, but.

You know, after we pulled them back a level, we then had them start working through these books and these foundational skills that they were just they were just getting passed on in the traditional system, you know, that they just missed. We're building on those and we're making those solid and concrete, which I just love. So we're that's what's happening during this work cycle. It's that math and reading, writing, language arts piece. So that's.

Ela Richmond (29:18.751) Yeah.

Peggy (29:26.311) our work cycle, but I just really love that part where we're building these kids confidence and it's so great to see because they feel better about the knowledge they're gaining and it just is the confidence they're gaining in this one little aspect is translating to a lot of other pieces in the day, right? And confidence can take you so far in your life. And so we were really excited about that. But

Then after that, we do our lunch and our outdoor time, go just play, enjoy ourselves. And then in the afternoons, we do project-based learning, where we have a theme for a couple of weeks, and we focus on a project, and we dive into different pieces of the project and integrate all the core academics into that, but in a trickier way, I like to say, the kids.

get to it's that intersection you were talking about earlier, right? We're trying to find their passions and then integrate them into these projects so that then they're reading a little more. They're doing a little more math. They're learning about history, you know? And then we end the day with what we call character call outs where we let the kids call somebody out, say something that, you know, the other kids could have done to help them or just make them feel special. And our gratitude.

We do meditation, we read, and then we, it is our studio space. So we get to take responsibility and clean it up. We get to do the vacuuming, the wiping down, all this stuff that, you know, those magical custodians do when the lights go out at night in your traditional system. So we get to learn some life skills there of like cleaning, and this is our space. So it feels pretty magical to me when, when I came from the system that I did.

into this piece. It feels magical and just what it's what I want my kids to be in. I hope we can expand to a lot more kids in the future.

Ela Richmond (31:31.682) Why magical, specifically?

Peggy (31:35.891) Just because like I was saying, it feels developmentally what the kids should be doing. Kids should be playing. Kids should be kids. They have 18 short years of what we've told them they have to have before they move on to the real world. so I just love that we can put them where they need to be so that they can grow and they can experience the.

real world, but in an environment that's appropriate for them. And so I just, and the, you know, the play pieces for the kids, like my fourth or sixth year old studio, those little ones grow up so fast. The playing is so important and they love to play and they learn so many things through that. And I even have some of the older kids in the other studio come in and play sometimes. And it's like, you just, you don't get it for long.

Like me as a mom, sometimes I struggle to play, right? Because that's just something that's not a part of me anymore. And you only get so long to be a little kid. So why not let them enjoy that? And then, you know, throw in a few academics here and there for them to really pick up and find a passion towards something. And then really they just do it on their own. We're just there to guide them.

Ela Richmond (32:58.05) Yeah, I love that. The last thing I wanted to ask before I hit you with a couple of rapid fire questions was about trying to figure out, so well, I have two questions actually. I was going to pick one, but you know what? I have two. One of them was trying to figure out where each kid was, right? Like, I feel like that's really difficult for parents. They.

Peggy (33:14.416) Okay.

Ela Richmond (33:26.752) you know, don't want to measure their kids. They don't know how to figure out where their kids are. Maybe they pulled them out of a system and are like, OK, how do I even figure out what level you're at so I know where to start? How did you all do that inside of inside of Apogee?

Peggy (33:40.223) I'm gonna go get them.

Peggy (33:44.809) So this was really unique because this was our first year opening our campus, right? So we pulled the kids in and we're not in the system. So requesting transcripts, requesting test scores, any of that kind of stuff wasn't something that we did. And both myself and my other guide, we didn't really want to know, right? We both have the educational background, so we can kind of, we can talk to our kids, we can watch them, we can see what they can do.

Ela Richmond (33:49.862) huh.

Peggy (34:13.735) And we can quickly interpret that information and kind of go from there. But I could see like how a parent, right? They see other kids or they're wondering where their kids are, they're pulling them in to do the homeschooling aspect of life. I would say to watch the kids frustration level, right? Give them something, start someplace, and then if it's too easy, you're gonna know really quickly, right? Because they're just gonna go through it.

Ela Richmond (34:24.598) Yeah.

Peggy (34:42.377) But if they get to someplace where the frustration level is just too much and you know your kids, you know where that frustration is just at the, it's too much where they're not, where they're just gonna shut down, right? You don't want that to happen. So I would say it's just in the frustration level of that piece. And then there's a lot of online like pieces that you can go to these days. COVID really did show us that is that you can do a lot through.

online, you know, based off of like Khan Academy was one that we really leaned on and we said, okay, we'll go there. But then we also just my guide and I kind of went off of what we knew and watching the kids takes a couple of weeks and you can really learn where a kid is. And it's not just, you know, language arts, they're not in first grade level and math, they're at first grade level.

know, math they could be here and reading they could be here, but you know, then social skills and just, you know, the emotional skills and all of that. So just looking at all those pieces, but I am so grateful that we can do that at this campus and really provide the kids with what they deserve.

Ela Richmond (35:58.568) yeah. And the last question that I'm going to ask you before I hit you with a rapid fire, but technically this is kind of rapid fire. Can you give me a couple of examples of great Socratic discussion questions that you all have used? Because I feel like that is so impactful, that has been so impactful. for context, my littlest brother is the only one of my family that had an alternative education of any type. And he went to Acton. And Socratic discussions actually have

increased his confidence in just having a point of view and also being able to argue it or being able to explain it and share it. And also on the other side, being able to humble himself when he's wrong. what are some of your favorite Socratic discussion questions that you all have used so far?

Peggy (36:49.841) I love your question. I am going to. That's a hard one, though. So what we've been doing, because like I told you, a lot of our kids are coming from another system and we're trying to build confidence in the kids and we're trying to build that community through the first session. So most of our Socratic discussions were would you rather and why? And they have to pick a side. Right. That was our biggest challenge was.

Ela Richmond (37:03.03) Mm-hmm.

Ela Richmond (37:13.634) Mmm.

Peggy (37:19.368) we were telling the kids like, okay, would you rather be this or this? And they would have to pick one side. And that was really hard for a lot of them. And it was really hard for them to stand up and say, no, this is what I would actually do. And it doesn't matter that my friend is on the other side, right? So we were really trying to find that middle ground for them of it's okay to disagree. Back up your point, right?

Listen to everybody else and you can change your point of view, but stick solid with what you know in this moment, right? And so that's what we did a lot of building on this first session was would you rather, you know, would you rather live in a castle back in medieval times or in a cottage in medieval times, right? And then you'd have to tell why and kind of stick with that. And you could change.

your point of view, but you really had to stay solid on it. And I think that was really hard for a lot of our kids because it's hard to not, not necessarily not be liked, but it's hard to stand strong in an opinion that you have, right?

Ela Richmond (38:26.37) Yes.

Ela Richmond (38:36.052) Yeah, exactly.

Or mean even like granted like I even suffer from this sometimes where somebody will give me two options and I'm like, well, I could make an argument for both, you know, like I could choose both. It's just like, no, just pick a side, like pick one, go deep into it. And then like you can, you know, what's it called? Steel man argument and like the other side like that. But but having the confidence and the ability to just be like, OK, this is what I'm choosing.

Peggy (38:48.639) Exactly.

Peggy (38:58.623) Steel Man, Yep.

Ela Richmond (39:08.133) I think is really really important. I've put pressure on myself because for some reason I went through this period where my decision-making was so low just because I like I wanted to weigh every single potential variable and I think just having that confidence to be like look I'm not gonna know everything because that's life right it's like I'm not gonna know everything I can't know everything I can't weigh everything I'm just gonna pick something and it's gonna be good about I'm good enough so

Peggy (39:35.433) Yep.

Ela Richmond (39:36.33) I love that rapid fire questions very quickly. Did you always know that you wanted to work in education or was that something that came up eventually, something that you stumbled into?

Peggy (39:39.775) Okay.

Peggy (39:49.199) I knew from a very young age that I wanted to be an educator. So I was the little kid that would set up the classroom in her bedroom with all her stuffed animals. So I knew from a young age.

Ela Richmond (39:56.962) So cute.

Ela Richmond (40:01.024) I love that. What is the greatest thing that you've learned about parenting from Apogee and doing education and open education?

Peggy (40:11.967) growth is important no matter what way it comes and that you should always be growing. I was at a very stagnant point in my life. I had my kids, I'd gotten my degrees, I had, you know, I did all the check boxes, right? And I was, I then learned about Apogee and was hesitant to jump into it. And I learned that

If you're not growing, it's, it's, mean, what's the point really? Right? You should be growing in some way, shape or form. It shouldn't just be your little ones that are having to grow. But if you and your little ones are both growing, things are going to get better for everyone around you. So just that growth mindset, I'd really lost it. And the Apogee program just brought it right to my front door. And I am just.

excited with where I've gone just in the 11 months that I've been a part of the Apogee program, even outside of the Apogee campus. I'm just thrilled with where I am and how excited I am about the rest of my life that I'm not just checking off boxes anymore, that I'm growing and we're doing better things. so that's, I can't thank it enough.

Ela Richmond (41:30.38) I love that. What advice would you give?

yeah, mean like that's so impactful. What advice and or like what have you seen is valuable? like, there you're obviously not the only one that's experienced, you know, feeling stuck or feeling comfortable or feeling like, you know what, I don't feel the growth in myself as much as I used to. Where would you recommend somebody start if they're also feeling like, okay, maybe that's something that I'm willing to take on because you're right. Like being a parent that emulates the things that you want your kids to have. So it's like if I

want my kids to grow, I should be the one emulating growth. like, you if I want my kids to be excited about learning, I should be the one emulating, you know, that excitement. Things like that.

Peggy (42:10.855) Exactly. Yep, exactly. I mean...

Peggy (42:19.295) I just have to do like the shameless plug of the Apogee program. It's changed my life in ways I couldn't imagine. I'm healthier than I've ever been. I'm growing, I'm reading books like I've never read books before. And I just feel like my family is getting better. And I just think that what our nation needs is that growth mindset and we need strong families.

Ela Richmond (42:23.84) Mm-hmm.

Peggy (42:47.487) And I think that's what the Apogee program promotes. And they've allowed me that gift and I will keep telling and sharing that gift with anybody that will listen.

Ela Richmond (43:00.928) I love that. OK, and the last question that I have for you. What is a story of something that really has worked to help your kids learn something, either a kid inside of your program or a kid, one of your actual kids? What is something that has really helped them that you love?

Peggy (43:22.175) We need to go back to that same thing of failure. I, okay, I was, so my, what's that?

Ela Richmond (43:29.398) Or like a resource, potentially. Or like a resource, potentially. Like something that's really helped somebody learn maybe a resource, maybe a curriculum, maybe like a tactic. Something that people could use,

Peggy (43:44.187) Okay, explaining the why I think is really important. I think that we don't give our kids enough credit to understand why sometimes. And even if it's a really big concept, I think if you can teach them the why, they'll appreciate it so much more. Like we've been doing with our workouts with our kids. We've been telling them, you know, this is why we're doing this. This is how it helps you and how it will help you in your future.

Ela Richmond (44:01.516) Mm-hmm.

Peggy (44:13.531) Even though there's some days we get the, we got to do the workout. We got to run. We got to do the burpees or the pushups. They still, there's way more days that they just jump into it and they're so excited because they know the why. And so, and I think that applies for everything, you know, from potty training all the way up to learning all the rules of driving a car, right? If they know the why, it will be so much more powerful for them.

Ela Richmond (44:43.554) That's incredible. Thank you so much for coming on the podcast today. This has been so, so amazing to hear about you and your experience and especially the Apogee Network because we did have Matt Moudreaux on the podcast a little while ago and he shared some awesome things. He's great. He has an immense well of experience in this space. He knows what he believes and why he believes it I think that is one of the most important things, especially today. So thank

Peggy (44:58.376) He's incredible.

Peggy (45:13.383) Absolutely. Thank you, Ella. I appreciate it so much. It was nice talking with you and getting to know you a little bit.

Ela Richmond (45:13.508) Thank you so much.

Ela Richmond (45:18.114) Yeah. my gosh, yes. I'm going to leave probably some links in the description so that if anybody wants to check out Apogee, I do know that our open ed program does work with Apogee Utah. Is that correct? Do you have a couple students in there? Very cool. Well, yeah, if anybody wants to learn more, then they can go and find you. And I'm so glad that we got to do this.

Peggy (45:31.519) Yep. Yes ma'am.

Peggy (45:43.679) Thank you, Emma. I appreciate it.

- Why Should We Learn This?
    
    ✏️ **"Kids don’t hate writing. They hate writing about things they don’t care about."**
    
    I’ve seen it over and over—students groaning about math and writing because it feels **boring** and **pointless**.
    
    But the moment they start using these skills for **something real**, their attitude shifts.
    
    💡 When we build projects, they see why **math matters**—because they need it to **get measurements right or budget their ideas.**
    
    💡 When they explore careers, they suddenly ask, **“How do I use math for this?”**
    
    💡 And when it comes to writing? It’s all about **making it personal.**
    
    The key is **letting them write about something they love.** Their own stories. A mystery to solve. Something funny. **Humor is a huge way to get through to teens.**
    
    🚀 When learning is **relevant, personal, and engaging**, kids don’t just tolerate it—they **own it.**
    
    # Potential Twitter Thread
    
    1/7 Ever wonder why so many kids hate math and writing?
    
    It's not the subjects - it's how we teach them.
    
    The secret to effective learning isn't more worksheets or stricter methods.
    
    It's about making it REAL.
    
    2/7 Here's what's broken in our education system (public AND charter):
    
    We teach subjects in isolation
    
    Kids can't see the practical application
    
    Students keep asking "When will I ever use this?"
    
    Result? Completely disengaged learners
    
    3/7 The solution is stupidly simple:
    
    Connect learning to real life.
    
    Show practical applications.
    
    Let students drive their interests.
    
    Make it fun (yes, learning can be fun!)
    
    4/7 Real example:
    
    Building garden beds teaches:
    
    - Measurement
    - Basic geometry
    - Problem solving
    - Project planning
    
    No textbooks needed. Just real-world application.
    
    5/7 Writing? Same thing.
    
    Instead of forcing boring essays:
    
    - Let them tell their stories
    - Encourage investigations
    - Write about their passions
    - Use humor (teens love this!)
    
    6/7 The magic happens when students:
    
    1. See immediate value
    2. Connect skills to their interests
    3. Apply knowledge in real-time
    4. Have fun while learning
    
    This isn't rocket science. It's just common sense.
    
    7/7 Stop making kids hate learning.
    
    Start showing them why these skills matter.
    
    Education should open doors, not close minds.
    
    When you make it real, they'll want to learn.
    
    That's the secret.
    
    # Linkedin
    
    Want to know the secret to effective learning? Stop teaching subjects in isolation.
    
    A major problem in our education system is that we teach subjects without context. Students constantly ask "When will I ever use this?"
    
    And they're right to ask.
    
    When math is just numbers on a page, it creates stress and resistance. But when those same numbers help build a garden bed or solve a real problem, students engage naturally.
    
    The same goes for writing. Students reject traditional essays but light up when writing about their passions or crafting humor pieces.
    
    This is why career exploration is so powerful in education. When students see how professionals use math, writing, and other skills in careers they're interested in, the learning becomes meaningful.
    
    The key isn't teaching the subject - it's showing its application in the real world.
    
    Think about it: A teenager measuring and building a garden bed will learn more about geometry than from memorizing formulas.
    
    A student investigating a topic they're passionate about will develop better writing skills than through assigned book reports.
    
    The solution is simple but profound:
    
    Make it relevant. Make it practical. Make it personal.
    
    Because when learning connects to real life, you don't have to force it - it happens naturally.
    
    The question isn't whether students can learn. The question is: are we teaching in a way that makes them want to?

    # Unlocking Effective Learning: The Secret to Engaging Education
    
    Eleyah: ~~~Those who are like, I'm looking at numbers and I'm stressed out.~~~
    
    ```Like,
    
    Otherwise, they're going to be like, what is the point? And that's what I hear the most out of my kids or, you know, other kids in general, is that like, I don't want to learn about this because I'm not going to use this. However, when we're able to apply real math skills to what we're doing, like for example, we're building our own garden beds right now, we have to understand some basic concepts of math for measurements.
    
    Um, and then for, in order to like make sure that they're set up correctly, we're going to have to apply these, these like very simple, but very practical math skills. And then, you know, when [00:01:00] it comes to like, again, the career exploration aspect, when they're like interested in something, you know, that we see people doing, um, then they, then that's when we can bring up, okay, well, How are we going to use math for this?
    
    Or how are we going to use writing for this? Writing is another thing that I've noticed a lot of my students just like, don't want to be into. They're just like, oh, this is boring, this is boring, I don't want to, you know, write. But when they get to deliver their own story, or when they get to do an investigation, when they get to write about something that they're passionate about or that they think is funny, like, humor is a huge way to get through to teens.
    
    ~~~I had them write letters the other day for this, um, project that this, um, that the library had posted out about, um, what kind of organ do you envision or what kind of organ do you want to see?~~~

    ### 📊 TREND
    
    ### The School Bus That Actually Goes Places
    
    While some dream of disrupting education with AI and virtual reality, Eleyah had a simpler idea: a 14-passenger van.
    
    Her "adventure school" is redefining what a classroom looks like. The weekly schedule reads like a choose-your-own-adventure book:
    
    **Mondays:** Cooking, nutrition, and natural medicine (plus PE)
    **Tuesdays:** Coding and theater
    **Fridays:** Guest workshops and field trips based on student interests
    
    But here's what makes this more than just a cool story – it's part of a growing movement. Across the country, educators are breaking free from traditional classroom walls:
    
    - Forest schools are popping up in public parks
    - Sailing families are "worldschooling" their kids
    - Micro-schools are operating out of community centers
    - Adventure learning programs are turning national parks into classrooms
    
    The message? You can cover every subject in the standard curriculum while making it relevant to the modern world. As Eleyah puts it: "The sky's the limit."
    
    The most powerful part? Students aren't just passengers on this educational journey – they're co-pilots, making real contributions to their own learning experience.

    # Turning a 14-Passenger Van into an Adventure School
    
    Eleyah: [00:00:00] I decided I'm going to buy a van that fits up to 14 passengers and I'm going to make this like an adventure school. I'm going to make this a real life skill building opportunity. for teens between the ages of 12 and 18, um, a way that they can get out in the community and learn what's going on, see different career options, as well as, um, participate in what I'm best at, which is natural medicine and natural health.
    
    And so on Mondays we do cooking and we learn about nutrition and sometimes we'll make natural medicine and we do PE as well. Um, And then our, our Tuesday classes are based around, um, we have a coding teacher that comes out, so they are on the computer a little bit for that. We also do theater and sometimes we'll throw in science and other activities in there.
    
    Our Tuesdays are pretty flexible. We always have some sort of a lesson. Typically this year it's been theater. Last year it was more science based. And then on Fridays we [00:01:00] do guest teacher workshops or field trips, and those can be very diverse. There, a lot of them are based on the kid's interests or what, um, what we have available in our community or anything that I feel could really help them in their development.
    
    And so like the sky's the limit. So basically you can cover every subject that they cover in public school, but do it in your own unique way and with the resources available to you and with what's relevant in the modern world that you live in.~ And so that's what's most empowering is that the kids feel like they can do it.~
    
    ~actually make changes and contributions to their own education and their own experience.~
    
    ```
    
- A van school routine
    
    🚐 **"I bought a 14-passenger van… and turned it into a school."**
    
    Traditional education wasn’t working for my kids—or for so many teens who needed something different. So I decided to build my own solution:
    
    ✅ **A real-life, skill-building adventure school for teens (12-18)**
    
    ✅ **Hands-on learning through community exploration & career exposure**
    
    ✅ **A focus on natural medicine, nutrition, and practical skills**
    
    📚 **Our week looks nothing like a standard school schedule:**
    
    🔥 **Mondays** → Cooking, nutrition, natural medicine & PE
    
    💻 **Tuesdays** → Coding, theater, science, and flexible lessons
    
    🎒 **Fridays** → Guest teacher workshops & field trips
    
    The best part? **We cover everything public school does—but in a way that’s relevant to real life.**
    
    No rigid classrooms. No one-size-fits-all learning. Just **engaging, hands-on education that prepares teens for the world.**
    
    🚀 **The future of education isn’t standardized—it’s personalized.**
    
- Let kids be kids for a while
    
    💡 **"The real measure of success isn’t grades or career paths—it’s well-being."**
    
    We push kids to perform, achieve, and plan for the future—but how often do we ask the most important questions?
    
    ✅ **Are they happy?**
    
    ✅ **Are they healthy?**
    
    ✅ **Are they provided for?**
    
    ✅ **Can they take care of themselves?**
    
    ✅ **Do they feel fulfilled?**
    
    If we focus on **holistic health** while kids are young, we set them up for lifelong success—not just academically, but emotionally and physically too.
    
    Too many adults hit their 30s wondering: _What happened to my childhood?_ _Why am I so burned out?_ _Did I rush into a life I don’t actually want?_
    
    🚀 The goal of education isn’t just to produce workers—it’s to raise **self-sufficient, thriving humans.**
    
    Let’s start focusing on **what really matters.**

### A Natural Parent's Rebellion Against Traditional School [00:00]

**Ela Richmond:** Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm Ela Richmond and today I have on Aleya Knight. Thank you for being here.

**Aleya:** Thank you for having me.

**Ela:** You're a mom of two who's recently started a microschool. Today we'll be exploring your journey through open education, your beliefs about it, and this microschool you've started as a concerned and interested parent. I'd love to give everyone some context into what you've discovered. Where did your educational journey with your kids begin? Did they start in public school, and what does a day in their life look like now?

**Aleya:** I was a new single mom when they were very young. My son started kindergarten in public school, while my daughter began with homeschooling. This was because in California, Senate Bill 277 was being implemented, requiring mandatory vaccinations. As a natural parent who specifically went to Chinese medicine school to be more of a natural doctor for my kids, I chose not to vaccinate.

I decided to homeschool them during my final year of grad school since there weren't other options. Fortunately, I found a program that funded excellent nature-based classes in our community. Santa Cruz was wonderful for that, offering many options at the time.

Years later, when lockdown hit and the only schooling option was online learning, I knew that wouldn't work for us, like many parents realized. We joined local homeschool groups, but none quite fit long-term. There was often disorganization, confusion, and unfortunately, even instances of bullying that weren't properly addressed.

When my son was approaching high school age, I felt increasing pressure to take action. I asked myself what I could do as a single mom with limited resources to create options not just for my own kids, but for others in similar situations. Since I run my own private practice with flexible hours, I realized I could make this work.

This led me to an important decision in September 2023: I purchased a 14-passenger van to create what I envisioned as an adventure school. I wanted to build a real-life skill-building program for teens between 12 and 18, where they could engage with their community, explore different career options, and learn about natural medicine and health – my area of expertise.

### How a 14-Passenger Van Revolutionized Teen Education [02:57]

**Aleya:** On Mondays, we focus on cooking, nutrition, natural medicine, and physical education. Tuesdays incorporate coding with a specialized teacher, along with theater and various supplementary activities - it's our flexible day. We had more science-based activities last year, but this year we're emphasizing theater. Fridays are dedicated to guest teacher workshops or field trips, which we design around the students' interests and what our community offers.

The beauty is that we cover every traditional subject you'd find in public school, but we do it in ways that are relevant to modern life and use the resources available to us. What's most empowering is that the students actively participate in shaping their educational experience.

I've seen this approach help them develop a strong sense of identity and confidence naturally, without the overwhelming influence of media, political agendas, or the intense peer pressure you find in traditional schools with hundreds or thousands of students.

### "I've Bred Some Rebels" - When Kids Question Everything [06:19]

**Aleya:** I can definitely say I've bred some rebels! My kids question everything, including authority - and yes, that includes questioning me, which is great. They've become powerful critical thinkers.

Of course, being 13 and 15, they still face typical teenage challenges with ethics, respect, and learning to communicate with adults. My daughter, in particular, has always struggled in traditional school settings because of her critical thinking mindset. If a teacher tells her to do something that doesn't feel right to her, she won't do it.

What's been remarkable is watching the growth in confidence among all our students over the past year and a half. Some students started out uncertain about their abilities, but by the end of last year, they were diving into activities wholeheartedly, without that initial hesitation of "I don't know if I can do this."

The small group setting has been transformative - it becomes like a family and builds deep trust. We establish clear class agreements at the beginning of the year and before new units, setting explicit expectations for each other. If issues arise, we have the framework to communicate clearly and ensure everyone feels comfortable and heard.

This is radically different from an authoritative system that rigidly dictates "this is how it's done." In our environment, students can say, "I want to do things this way," and if they express it reasonably and respectfully, we can make it happen. Of course, if someone acts disrespectfully, they experience natural consequences, but that's part of the learning process too.

### The Magic of Micro-Communities in Learning [07:59]

**Aleya:** Overall, what I've noticed is that they work together remarkably well. When someone's not comfortable with an activity, we find ways to adapt it so they can participate in their own way. This is completely different from an institutionalized system where there's only one way to do things.

Each student has different abilities and needs, different talents they want to explore. I believe one of the best things we can do as teachers - and this comes from a book we're reading called "My Ishmael" - is to be what's called a maieutic teacher. This is someone who inspires children to want to learn for themselves and helps bring out their natural talents, rather than forcing them to believe specific things.

While it's important to show children how things work in the world and in nature, it's equally crucial to keep them open to asking questions and exploring new possibilities. That's what we're here for as human beings - to evolve, to explore possibilities, and to understand that we don't have all the answers. A huge part of teaching is learning alongside these kids.

The more we can bring out the truths naturally within everybody, the more we can find solutions to problems that keep repeating throughout history. The school system and the medical system, two of our biggest overarching systems in this country and the world, are falling apart. They're not serving humanity the way they should. Finding balance starts with new generations - they'll be the ones to make changes once these systems are too far out of balance to repair.

### Making Learning Relevant [14:39]

**Aleya:** My greatest challenge, not surprisingly, has been working with my own kids and their resistance. This led me to realize the fundamental reason why kids struggle with learning: disinterest. If they're bored, they won't engage or try.

I had this re-epiphany recently during our coding class when we were working with math concepts. Those who are interested in math succeed in math. Those who look at numbers and feel stressed obviously struggle to learn. The key to any learning is making it more interesting and applicable.

What drives me crazy about public schools - and honestly, many charter schools too - is their rigid approach to subjects. Students need to see how they'll use what they're learning. Otherwise, the most common response is, "What's the point?"

However, when we apply real math skills to practical projects - like building our garden beds right now - they need to understand basic math concepts for measurements and setup. These are simple but practical math skills. Similarly, with career exploration, when they're interested in something they see people doing, that's when we can discuss how math or writing applies to that field.

Writing is another area where I've noticed resistance. But when students get to tell their own stories, conduct investigations, or write about something they're passionate about or find funny - humor is a huge motivator - they engage differently. Some prefer drawing to writing, so we find middle ground. They can draw pictures to express their ideas, but they also need to complement that with some writing. It's about finding that balance because that's just life - you'll have to learn some things you might not love, but if you know it'll get you where you want to go, you'll be motivated to do it.

### The Truth About Teens Who "Don't Know What They Want" [18:07]

**Ela:** How do your kids figure out where they want to go though?

**Aleya:** That's another tricky thing - many teens don't know, and I've been learning that's completely okay. My own kids often say, "I just want to be a kid. I don't want to grow up. Being an adult looks scary."

Instead of pushing them to choose a career - which is something that really turns me off about public schools, asking sophomores about college plans - we take a different approach. We look at the world around us: What are people doing? What interests you right now? What do you see people doing - maybe your parents' friends, your uncle, your aunt - that they really enjoy?

Our coding teacher shared something powerful with us: if you're doing something you're truly passionate about and find a way to make money with it, you'll never work a day in your life. So we focus on getting them excited about the possibility of running their own business doing what they love, or perhaps joining a group of entrepreneurs to create something together.

While they're young and want to stay young and aren't sure what they want to do, we focus on building those foundational concepts they'll need to function healthily in society. That way, when they're 18 or whenever they're ready to enter the workforce, they already know what they like, what they're good at, and what they want to do - for now. Because in today's world, you can change your career path whenever you want.

There's no need to push kids toward college or into a career just because "we need to make money right now" or "you need something to do with your life." For instance, my kids started volunteering one day a week at the library this year. Even though it might seem routine or boring, they get different tasks each time and work with other kids their age. It builds that work ethic and discipline without being overwhelming. They've stopped complaining about it - it's just become part of their routine.

### Structure with Flexibility [20:40]

**Aleya:** It's crucial to provide structure - which I obviously do with our school - so they know what to expect. But equally important is flexibility. You need both: structure so they know what's coming, but also the ability to adapt when things change. Guest teachers might cancel last minute, weather could suddenly shift, someone might get sick.

The key is learning how to respond to change while still respecting the structure. How can you be flexible while maintaining consistency? These are fundamental skills they'll need as adults.

### Honoring Natural Development [23:00]

**Ela:** What would you say to parents who struggle with being flexible about their kids' outcomes? Whether you're a longtime open educator or new to the movement, it's difficult to accept if your child doesn't become that lawyer or surgeon you imagined. How do you come to terms with that?

**Aleya:** From what I've seen in my own experience and in my family and friends, when a child becomes a young adult and is given options within structure - discipline with choices - they have time to fully bloom.

Sure, we occasionally see young geniuses who start businesses right out of high school or go to Harvard. Of course we all want our kids to be like that - who wouldn't? But what really matters in the long run? Maybe your kid is 18, 19, 20, working at Pizza Hut, renting a room with another teen. It's not the dream you had for them.

But the most important questions we should ask are: Are they happy? Are they healthy? Are they provided for? Can they take care of themselves? Are they self-sufficient? If you address holistic health while they're young, they won't end up in their 30s with chronic diseases, wondering what happened to their childhood because they were so busy trying to be an adult.

I think that's why we're in this health crisis in our country - many adults never honored their childhood dreams and wishes. You might not know your dream right away. You might not even have one. But those who do should hold onto it and pursue it. That responsibility can take half a lifetime, but having that dream propels people forward. And a dream could be as simple as wanting a comfortable life or just wanting to be loved and supported.

My kids are very simple in that sense. I'm super ambitious with huge, insane dreams that I wholeheartedly believe in and am excited to pursue. But my kids just want to feel loved and supported, and that's perfect for their age. Though my son will tell you it's been really hard for me to let go of saying things like, "But you're 15 - don't you want to do something? Don't you want to take some classes? Don't you want to get a job?" And he just says, "I'm really comfortable where I'm at. I like what we're doing." Why fight that? Who am I to say he needs more?

### The Connected Teens Experience [28:49]

**Aleya:** First of all, my micro school is called Connected Teens, though Elated Family is my business name - I know it can be confusing. One of the highlights of our year together was our last day of school. We went to a lake and had this honoring ceremony where the kids got to share their favorite teachers and experiences.

What made it really special was that everyone came together with their families. You can choose how many days a week you attend our school, so not every kid comes every day. But when they all gathered, we got to hear what meant the most to them about the school. Across the board, they loved anything that made them feel free and truly engaged in learning something interesting.

I think what I loved most was watching their confidence grow and seeing them participate in things they normally wouldn't have done, encouraged by the camaraderie of the group.

**Ela:** What resources or tools do you use frequently with your students that they really enjoy?

**Aleya:** Our van! We go to lots of places. But for learning resources, YouTube actually has some amazing short documentaries. I don't like having the kids in front of screens for long periods, so I won't show full movies, but there are great 15-20 minute historical and relevant films that are free. I preview them to ensure they're appropriate.

One channel in particular that's absolutely beautiful is The Modern Intuitionist. He analyzes famous historical texts, connects them to historical events, and focuses on raising consciousness and understanding human nature. He helps us along our path to evolution through different aspects of our history - it's just absolutely amazing. We need to have more faith in everyday people coming together, learning things, and having these epiphanies. It's not necessarily coming straight from a university - we're all evolving together, like a hundredth monkey effect. Once one side of the world learns something, the other side naturally learns it too without direct exposure.

### A Vision for the Future [32:53]

**Ela:** Did you always know you wanted to personalize your kids' education? And what makes you excited for the future of education?

**Aleya:** Yes, I've always been very... you can say controlling, that's okay... about what my kids are exposed to and what they learn. At the same time, I don't want to be over-sheltering. I definitely make sure they're exposed to what's going on in the world and I don't hide things from them.

What I'm excited about is honestly how this is rippling out. I'm excited about the effect that the Connected Teens movement is going to have on the world. I'm in the process of several huge projects that are all feeding into each other, and one of my greatest intentions - what I think will be my greatest accomplishment in life - is inspiring more nature-based teen schools all around the world.

I have this vision that's going to become reality soon enough: sailing around the world with teens on a ship where we grow food below deck and raise animals, starting up farm schools in every country we visit. I just finished writing a novel about this, and once it gets out to the world, people are undoubtedly going to love the idea.

These farm schools will address food sustainability, preserve cultural heritage, and most importantly, create healthy young people who are stewards of the land. That's what I'm looking forward to - seeing more down-to-earth, grassroots movements around education for teens. Like I said, there's too much imbalance in this world. It's time for change, and I'm instigating that change with every effort I have.

**Ela:** You're incredible, and I really appreciate how much passion you have for this. I have so many more questions, but maybe we'll do a part two at some point. This has been awesome. I'll leave the links below so people can find you and your school.

**Aleya:** Thank you so much, Ela. So nice to talk to you.

First for the thought segment make this the promotion for the podcast episode and give it some kind of a clickbaity hook so that people are actually inclined to watch or listen

## Prenda transforms neighborhood learning with proven results

### Pricing and Financial Model

Prenda operates as the nation's largest microschool network, serving **over 2,500 students across 300+ microschools** in six states. [Workee](https://workee.net/blog/micro-schools-in-the-us)[1819 News](https://1819news.com/news/item/jennifer-wolverton-how-microschool-franchises-offer-new-paths-for-teachers-and-parents) The pricing structure accommodates both ESA-funded and direct-pay families.

For ESA states (Arizona, Florida, Utah, Arkansas), families typically pay **$6,200-$7,200 annually**, combining the Prenda platform fee ($2,199/year) with guide fees ($4,000-$5,000/year). [Prenda](https://www.prenda.com/post/starting-a-microschool) Many families pay **$0 out-of-pocket** when ESA funds cover the full amount. [Prenda](https://www.prenda.com/states/florida)[Prenda](https://www.prenda.com/post/funding-the-microschool-experience-) Direct-pay families in all states pay $219.90 monthly per student plus guide fees. Kindergarten students receive reduced platform fees of $1,499 annually. [Prenda](https://www.prenda.com/states/arizona)[Prenda](https://www.prenda.com/states/new-york)

### Curriculum and Daily Operations

Prenda's four-mode learning model structures each day around **Connect** (relationship building), **Conquer** (individual mastery), **Collaborate** (project work), and **Create** (passion projects). [Prenda +3](https://www.prenda.com/) Students attend 16-20 hours weekly in K-8 mixed-age groups, with no homework requirements. [Prenda](https://www.prenda.com/states/arizona)[Prenda](https://www.prenda.com/states/new-york)

The curriculum includes pre-built content covering all core subjects through adaptive digital tools with real-time feedback. [Prenda](https://www.prenda.com/become-a-guide)[Prenda](https://www.prenda.com/) **75% of students** work at or above grade level in math by year-end, compared to just 18% at enrollment. [prenda](https://www.prenda.com/post/persist-progress-prenda-the-results-of-a-research-aligned-learning-model-and-culture) The mastery-based progression ensures no learning gaps, with **47% of students exceeding normal growth expectations** in reading. [prenda](https://www.prenda.com/post/persist-progress-prenda-the-results-of-a-research-aligned-learning-model-and-culture)

Guides receive comprehensive support including personal coaching, year-round academic assistance, and a plug-and-play software platform. No education background is required—**50% of guides are parents or community members** rather than certified teachers. [Prenda +2](https://www.prenda.com/) Prenda handles all payment processing, provides marketing tools, and covers background check costs. [Prenda](https://www.prenda.com/become-a-guide)

## Alpha School accelerates learning through controversial AI model

### The Reality Behind "2 Hour Learning"

Alpha School claims students complete core academics in just 2 hours daily, achieving **2.6x faster learning** than traditional schools. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_School)[Substack](https://futureiq.substack.com/p/understanding-alpha-school-can-we) However, the actual technology is described by reviewers as a "turbocharged spreadsheet checklist" rather than advanced AI, relying primarily on existing platforms like iXL for 80% of academic work.

Tuition varies dramatically by location: **$40,000 annually in Austin**, **$75,000 in San Francisco**, and **$10,000 in Brownsville** (SpaceX community). [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_School) Despite high tuition, the schools likely operate at a loss given their 5:1 student-teacher ratios and guide salaries ranging from $60,000-$150,000. [astralcodexten](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/your-review-alpha-school)

### Academic Model and Limitations

Students work through 8-12 personalized daily lessons with immediate feedback and mastery requirements of 80% before advancing. The morning focuses on screen-based learning (actually 2-3.5 hours), while afternoons feature hands-on workshops and life skills.

Critical parent feedback reveals significant limitations: the school "either works for your child, or it doesn't," with limited support for struggling students. [medium](https://medium.com/chalkdust-silicon/alpha-schools-other-story-wasn-t-in-the-times-2d9701dea44e) The heavy focus on MAP test performance raises concerns about teaching to the test, while essay writing and critical thinking receive inadequate attention.

## Waldorf and Wildflower networks emphasize pedagogical tradition

### Waldorf-Inspired Microschools Adapt Philosophy

Waldorf microschools like **Fáilte Waldorf Microschool** (Pennsylvania) and **School on the Rise** (Austin) maintain core Waldorf principles while adapting to smaller settings of 10-25 students. These schools preserve arts integration, nature connection, and developmentally appropriate learning phases while operating on reduced schedules and budgets. [waldorfmicroschool +2](https://www.waldorfmicroschool.com/)

Tuition typically ranges **$15,000-$26,000 annually**, with California hosting the highest concentration (24+ public Waldorf schools). [Homes.com](https://www.homes.com/school/austin-tx/austin-waldorf-school/3w1e8dfpqj5lv/)[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldorf_education) Many operate as parent cooperatives or charter schools to reduce costs. [publicwaldorf](https://www.publicwaldorf.org/member-schools) The mixed-age groupings and shorter schedules (often 4-day weeks) help maintain affordability while preserving Waldorf's educational philosophy. [waldorfmicroschool](https://www.waldorfmicroschool.com/)[meadowlarkmicroschool](https://www.meadowlarkmicroschool.org/)

### Wildflower Montessori's Teacher-Led Success

The Wildflower network has grown to **72+ schools serving 1,600 students** [wildflowerschools](https://www.wildflowerschools.org/) across 20 states, [Wildflower Schools](https://www.wildflowerschools.org/) with plans to reach 200 schools by 2029. [Workee +2](https://workee.net/blog/micro-schools-in-the-us) Their teacher-led model achieves **94% annual teacher retention** [Imaginable Futures](https://imaginablefutures.com/partners/wildflower-schools/) by giving educator pairs complete autonomy in running their schools. [Workee](https://workee.net/blog/micro-schools-in-the-us)[Substack](https://michaelbhorn.substack.com/p/10-years-of-wildflower-microschool)

Operating costs run $250,000-$300,000 annually for a 25-student school, [EdWeek](https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/opinion-can-a-network-of-tiny-teacher-led-montessoris-spread-like-wildflowers/2023/11) with tuition ranging from **free at charter locations** to **$25,000 at private schools**.

## KaiPod and Acton offer contrasting innovative approaches

### KaiPod Learning's Flexible Hybrid Model

KaiPod combines online curricula with in-person learning coach support, operating 8:00 AM-3:30 PM with maximum flexibility. [KaiPod Learning Pods](https://pods.kaipodlearning.com/) Families choose between 2-5 day schedules, paying **$551-$1,150 monthly** depending on attendance. [kaipodlearning](https://pods.kaipodlearning.com/kaipod-scottsdale)[ERIC](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED622313.pdf) The model maintains a 12:1 student-coach ratio with pods of 12 students each. [PaFEC +7](https://paedchoice.org/microschool-toolkit/)

Coaches (typically former teachers earning $45,000 annually) provide academic support, teach executive functioning skills, and facilitate social learning without lesson planning or grading responsibilities. [Salary.com +2](https://www.salary.com/research/company/kaipod-learning-llc-salary) KaiPod partners with accredited online schools including Stride K12, Sora Schools, and Prisma, allowing families to choose their preferred curriculum while receiving consistent in-person support. [KaiPod Learning Pods +2](https://pods.kaipodlearning.com/our-partners)

### Acton Academy's Comprehensive Philosophy

With **300+ affiliated academies globally**, Acton operates as the world's largest microschool community. [Tejactonacademy +5](https://www.tejactonacademy.org/) Tuition varies by location, typically ranging **$6,000-$13,000 annually**, with most schools offering sibling discounts and payment plans. [Actonmarietta +3](https://www.actonmarietta.org/tuition-calendars--faqs.html)

The learner-driven model eliminates grades and tests, instead using badges, portfolios, and public exhibitions to demonstrate mastery. [Actonmarietta +2](https://www.actonmarietta.org/tuition-calendars--faqs.html) Students progress through mixed-age studios (Spark 4-7, Elementary 6-11, Middle School 11-14, Launchpad 14-18) following the "Hero's Journey" curriculum emphasizing character development alongside academics.

## Academic outcomes show promise despite limited data

### Measurable Success Metrics

Available data from specific networks shows encouraging results. Prenda students demonstrate **18 percentage point increases** in grade-level proficiency for both math and reading. Their empowerment metrics reveal dramatic improvements: intrinsic motivation increases from 27% to 62%, and positive feelings about school jump from 36% to 86%. [prenda](https://www.prenda.com/post/persist-progress-prenda-the-results-of-a-research-aligned-learning-model-and-culture)

Parent satisfaction rates across microschools are exceptionally high, with **76% "very satisfied"** and only **5% expressing dissatisfaction** according to EdChoice/KaiPod surveys. **86% of parents** report curricula meet or exceed expectations, while **73% agree** their child is appropriately challenged. [EdChoice +4](https://www.edchoice.org/2024-edchoice-share-exploring-where-americas-students-are-educated/)

### Special Needs Success

**63% of microschools serve neurodivergent students**, with **50% stating their primary objective** is serving systemically underserved populations. [SpecialNeedsAnswers +2](https://specialneedsanswers.com/microschools-as-an-option-for-students-with-disabilities-20580) The personalized, mastery-based approach allows students to progress at individual paces, with many parents reporting reduced anxiety and increased engagement for children who previously struggled in traditional settings. [waldorfmicroschool](https://www.waldorfmicroschool.com/)

However, the RAND Corporation's 2025 study notes significant data limitations: "Data on microschool students' backgrounds, proficiency, and academic growth are often unavailable, inconsistent, or unrepresentative," [Rand](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA3698-1.html) highlighting the need for more rigorous evaluation as the sector matures. [Rand](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA3698-1.html)

## Emerging networks drive innovation and accessibility

### New Models Address Diverse Needs

The 2024 Yass Prize winner **Primer Microschools** expanded from 5 to 23 schools using AI-powered "Prism" technology that groups students across campuses by specific skills. [Yass Prize](https://yassprize.org/updates/primer-microschools-is-named-2024-yass-prize-winner/) The **National Microschooling Center**, founded in 2022, now supports the entire sector with training, resources, and community building. [Stand Together](https://standtogether.org/stories/education/what-is-a-microschool-and-starting-your-own-microschool)[microschoolingcenter](https://microschoolingcenter.org/)

Faith-based microschools represent **25% of all microschools**, [Christianity Today](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2025/09/homeschooling-back-to-school-microschools-choice-churches/) with organizations like Christian Leaders Institute offering free Christ-centered courses. Culturally-specific models like **Black Mothers Forum Microschools** in Phoenix provide culturally responsive education while benefiting from Arizona's ESA program. [The 74 Million](https://www.the74million.org/article/leaders-should-learn-from-black-and-latinx-parents-who-shaped-education-during-the-pandemic/)

### Support Infrastructure Expands

Multiple organizations now help educators launch microschools. **KaiPod's Catalyst Program** provides 2-year post-launch support for founders, [KaiPod Learning](https://www.kaipodlearning.com/start-a-microschool/) while **Microschool Revolution** connects founders to impact investors. [EdChoice +2](https://www.edchoice.org/2025-diving-into-the-survey-of-microschooling-parents-a-qa-with-kaipod-learning-founder-and-ceo-amar-kumar/) States like Mississippi have launched incubator programs supporting 15+ new founders, following successful models that helped launch the charter school movement decades earlier. [State Policy Network](https://spn.org/articles/how-embark-is-incubating-microschools/)

Corporate sponsorship models are emerging, with companies providing space and resources while networks deliver educational services. [Foundation for Economic Education](https://fee.org/articles/could-employer-based-microschooling-be-the-newest-workplace-perk/) Parent cooperatives reduce costs through shared teaching duties, making progressive education accessible to more families.

## Conclusion

The microschool sector has evolved from a pandemic response into a permanent educational alternative serving 1.5 million students. [The Hill +3](https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/education/4574859-the-us-is-experiencing-a-boom-in-microschools-what-are-they/) While comprehensive outcome data remains limited, available evidence shows high parent satisfaction, promising academic results for many students, and particular success serving neurodivergent learners.

For parents evaluating options, key considerations include matching your child's learning style to the specific model, understanding total costs including hidden fees, verifying actual (not advertised) student-teacher ratios, and recognizing that success often depends on finding the right fit rather than assuming any model works for all children. The rapid expansion of support networks, funding options through ESAs, and diverse pedagogical approaches means more families can access microschooling, [1819 News](https://1819news.com/news/item/jennifer-wolverton-how-microschool-franchises-offer-new-paths-for-teachers-and-parents) though significant barriers around affordability and awareness remain.
