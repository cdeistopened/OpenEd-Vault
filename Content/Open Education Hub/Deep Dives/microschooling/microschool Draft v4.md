# A Parent's Guide to Microschools: What They Are and How They Work

So you want more control over your child's education, but you also have a job. Or aging parents. Or twins who need different things. You've considered homeschooling, but the thought of doing it alone five days a week feels overwhelming.

What if you could have the personalization of homeschooling with the community and structure of a school? What if you could send your kids to learn three days a week and homeschool the other two? Or use one approach for elementary years and switch to something else for middle school?

That's exactly what more families are discovering through microschools. Over the past four years, microschools have grown from a niche option to [a movement serving 1.5 million students across roughly 95,000 schools nationwide](https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/education/4574859-the-us-is-experiencing-a-boom-in-microschools-what-are-they/).

Some families join existing microschools. Others start their own with three or four like-minded families. Some use microschools as their primary education. Others blend them with homeschooling, online courses, or other approaches.

Whether you're looking to join one, start one, or just understand what they are, here's what you need to know.

## What Is a Microschool?

{Let's brainstorm a better hook and opening section. I feel like this right now is just a little bit weak. Maybe we can take something from Kerry Owen MacDonald. Or we could open up with a joke about Zoolander and, "What is this, a school for ants?"}

At its most basic, a microschool is a small, intentionally designed learning environment—typically serving between 5 and 150 students, with a [median of 16 students](https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/education/4574859-the-us-is-experiencing-a-boom-in-microschools-what-are-they/). But size is actually the least important defining feature.

What really sets microschools apart:

**Part-time schedules are standard.** Most microschools meet 2-3 days per week—typically Tuesday through Thursday or Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. This isn't a "partial" education. It's intentional design based on the recognition that learning happens everywhere, not just during designated school hours in a school building. This makes microschools a natural complement to homeschooling, working parent schedules, or families who want to mix different educational approaches.

**Mixed-age groupings are by design.** A typical microschool might have 4-year-olds learning alongside 12-year-olds, or a middle school program that keeps 11-14 year olds together. The age mixing creates natural mentorship opportunities and removes the artificial pressure to keep everyone moving at the same pace.

**Facilitators or guides instead of traditional teachers.** The terminology signals a different philosophy. Rather than a teacher standing at the front delivering lessons, microschools typically use adult guides who facilitate learning, ask questions, and help students find their own answers. At Prenda, the nation's largest microschool network, about half of their guides are parents without teaching credentials.

**Each microschool serves a specific community or philosophy.** Rather than trying to be all things to all people, microschools typically have a clear identity—nature-based learning, classical education, project-based learning, serving twice-exceptional students, or emphasizing a particular faith tradition.

Legally, most microschools operate as homeschool support programs, learning centers, or enrichment programs rather than as traditional schools. This allows them to serve families with more flexibility and less regulatory burden than traditional private schools face.

## How Microschools Fit with Homeschooling

Many microschools legally operate as homeschool support programs, which creates a natural partnership between microschooling and homeschooling families.

Here's how families often use them together: microschool two or three days per week for community, structure, and socialization, then homeschool the other days for personalized academics, deep project work, or family learning. This gives parents control over curriculum while providing the community and structure that can be hard to create on your own.

The part-time model also works for working parents. A parent who works part-time can align microschool days with work days. A parent working from home can use microschool days for focused work time.

Some families "microschool hop"—using different microschools for different seasons or ages. A nature-based microschool might work beautifully for your elementary-age child, but you might choose something different for middle school. Unlike committing to a K-12 school, you're making a choice for right now, not for the next decade.

Dalena Wallace is a homeschooling mom in Kansas who started with exactly this model. She had been homeschooling her six kids but realized, as she puts it, "Ten years in, homeschooling my kids, I realized—this is hard. I need community." She opened a Prenda microschool in her home with three families. Within months, she had 16.

At Connected Teens in California, Eleyah Knight's van-based microschool for teenagers, families choose how many days per week to attend. Some come all three days. Others come one or two, homeschooling the rest of the week.

This flexibility is part of why microschools are growing so rapidly.

## Why Microschools Are Growing Now

The numbers tell a dramatic story. Four years ago, microschools were rare enough that most parents had never heard the term. Today, [88% of microschool families have average or below-average incomes](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-importance-of-holding-microschools-accountable/)—meaning this isn't a luxury option for wealthy families but an accessible alternative that regular families are choosing.

Kerry McDonald, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Economic Education who has researched education choice extensively, has noticed something interesting about who's starting these schools: "The vast majority of founders I interview are former public school teachers who left the system. When parents saw that the people running these programs had credibility—actual teachers with years of experience—they thought, 'If they're leaving, maybe they're onto something.'"

Peggy Lowe is one of those teachers. She spent 12 years in public education as a first-grade teacher, earning a master's degree in early elementary education, joining every possible committee focused on school reform, and making research-backed proposals for change. She knew from her human development background that young children needed more outdoor time, less testing, and more developmentally appropriate practices.

Administrators consistently agreed with her. "You're right," they would say. "It's not developmentally appropriate." Then nothing would change. Her proposals would go "into like a box somewhere," she recalls.

When her own son was born in 2021, she realized she couldn't send him into the system she'd spent a decade trying to fix. She left teaching and eventually opened Apogee Utah, a microschool. The guilt still affects her: "Looking back at the kids that I taught for 12 years, it breaks my heart that I kept those kids in those seats."

In Minnesota, two longtime educators named Kristin and Ginger had a similar realization. Both had been having conversations for years about starting something different—Ginger had written Kristin expressing the vision years earlier, almost like a prophecy that eventually came true.

But it took until 2022 for them to actually launch Scola Microschool. Before they could start, though, Kristin had to go through what she calls an "18-month undoing process." She'd taught in traditional schools for 18 years. "For however many years you're in a system, it's going to take that many months to shed everything," she explains. "You're giving up pieces of your identity, pieces of what you prided yourself in. All the measuring sticks I had about being a good teacher? I actually had to lay those down."

The courage that took surprised her. "You're like, 'Oh my gosh, what if I fail?' Everyone's going to know."

Nevada has become a particular microschool hub, partly due to relatively lenient homeschool regulations that make it easier for families to move between traditional schooling and alternatives. Ashley and Don Soifer founded the National Microschooling Center in Las Vegas in 2020, initially as a collaboration with North Las Vegas city leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic. What started as a one-off project quickly revealed much deeper demand.

"We started hearing from different folks in Nevada, saying, 'Hey, I'd really like to start a microschool. Can you help me?'" Ashley recalls. Their work quickly grew to support over 20 different microschools across Nevada—educators like Pilita Simpson who founded Positively Arts, James Lomax who runs Life Skills Academy, and Felicia Wright who started The Learning Outpost.

Soon they were receiving calls from educators in West Virginia, Mississippi, Idaho and other states wanting help. Grant Hewitt of Stand Together, which supports the National Microschooling Center, calls Las Vegas "the perfect storm"—families needing change plus innovative educators plus a regulatory environment that makes it possible.

## The Diversity of Microschool Models

Ask nine microschool founders what their school looks like and you might get eleven different answers. That's not a bug—it's a feature. Unlike traditional schools trying to serve everyone, microschools succeed by serving specific niches. Here are some of the models you'll find:

**Nature-based microschools** like Scola in Minnesota and Wild Flower Community School keep kids outside 3+ hours daily, emphasizing outdoor play and exploration through all seasons. At Scola, Kristin and Ginger discovered that "nothing interesting happens in the first 40 minutes" of outdoor play—the complex social negotiations, engineering projects, and deep imaginative play don't emerge until hour two.

**Mobile/Van-based microschools** like Connected Teens use vehicles as rolling classrooms. Think Magic School Bus, but with real teenagers learning real skills in real community settings. Field trips aren't supplements to the curriculum—they are the curriculum.

**Project-based learning microschools** like Acton Academy (300+ schools globally) use student-driven projects with no grades ever. They call it the "Hero's Journey," emphasizing that students are protagonists of their own educational story, not test scores on someone else's spreadsheet.

**Montessori microschools** like Wildflower Schools (72 schools serving 1,600 students) bring the Montessori philosophy—child-led learning, hands-on materials, mixed-age classrooms—to small, community-based settings.

**Sudbury/Democratic schools** let students vote on rules and policies, with completely self-directed learning and emphasis on autonomy. Adults are resources, not directors.

**Special needs/Twice-exceptional microschools** like Sphinx Academy in Kentucky serve the 24 students who are simultaneously gifted and learning disabled. Founder Jennifer Lincoln notes, "There's gifted education and there's special education, but there are not a lot of resources for students with an overlap."

**Life skills focused microschools** like Life Skills Academy in Las Vegas emphasize practical skills, career exploration, and real-world application over traditional academics.

**Arts-integrated microschools** like Positively Arts in Las Vegas use performing arts to build independence, confidence, and self-expression as the foundation for all learning.

**Faith-based microschools** make up about 25% of all microschools, integrating religious instruction and values into daily learning.

**Classical education microschools** teach traditional liberal arts curriculum—Latin, Greek, great books—in small settings with Socratic discussion.

**Hybrid/Tech-enabled microschools** like KaiPod and Prenda combine online curriculum with in-person facilitation and community. Families get the best of digital tools plus human connection.

**Farm-based microschools** use agriculture, animal care, and sustainability as the context for all learning—math through garden planning, science through soil health, economics through farm sales.

The common thread? Each serves a specific community with a specific philosophy. Rather than trying to be all things to all people, they're laser-focused on what they do best.

## What Learning Actually Looks Like

One of the first questions parents ask is: what does a day actually look like? The answer depends entirely on which model you choose.

Connected Teens, Eleyah Knight's van-based microschool for teenagers, runs a schedule that would confuse any traditional school administrator:

- **Monday:** Cooking, nutrition, natural medicine, and PE
- **Tuesday:** Coding and theater
- **Friday:** Guest teacher workshops or field trips based on whatever the students are curious about that week

"We cover every subject public school does," Knight explains, "but in ways that are relevant to the modern world." The 14-passenger van isn't just transportation—it's the classroom. Think Magic School Bus, but with real teenagers learning real skills in real community settings.

At Scola in Minnesota, their discovery about outdoor play has shaped everything. Kristin and Ginger found that the really valuable stuff—the complex social negotiations, the engineering projects, the deep imaginative play—doesn't emerge until after the first 40 minutes outside. So they keep kids outside for three hours daily, even through Minnesota winters.

Their "staff meetings" happen outdoors too—two teachers standing back-to-back, watching in different directions while discussing each student by name. "This is what we dreamed about in education school," Ginger notes. (In one memorable incident, students gathered every dead branch in an entire city park to build something. Kristin had to call the municipal government to explain why their park suddenly looked suspiciously tidy.)

At Apogee Utah, Peggy Lowe made a discovery about math anxiety that changed how she teaches. She pulled some struggling students back just one level in their math workbooks—not because they couldn't do the work, but because the stress of trying to keep up was preventing them from learning.

"Nobody outside school will ask what level you're at," she told them. "We want you to feel confident in your math skills."

Once the pressure lifted, the kids who "couldn't do math" suddenly could. They'd just been too anxious about the comparison to actually see the numbers.

## Do Kids Actually Learn?

For parents considering microschools, the obvious question is: but do kids actually learn?

The data is limited—when you're not standardizing education, you're not standardizing testing either. But the numbers that do exist are encouraging. [Prenda students show 18 percentage point increases in grade-level proficiency](https://www.prenda.com/post/persist-progress-prenda-the-results-of-a-research-aligned-learning-model-and-culture) in both math and reading.

Perhaps more significantly, the emotional and motivational metrics show dramatic changes. In Prenda schools, students' intrinsic motivation jumps from 27% to 62%. Positive feelings about school leap from 36% to 86%.

Across microschools more generally, [76% of parents report being "very satisfied"](https://www.edchoice.org/2024-edchoice-share-exploring-where-americas-students-are-educated/), compared to [just 42% satisfaction with traditional schools](https://news.gallup.com/poll/394784/satisfaction-k-12-education-low-second-straight-year.aspx) (a 25-year low).

Interestingly, many microschools emphasize non-academic development—play, social-emotional learning, autonomy, life skills—and counterintuitively, this often leads to stronger academic performance later. At Scola, kids spend three hours outside daily. At Connected Teens, they're cooking and building and exploring careers. At Apogee, Peggy focuses on confidence first, academics second.

When the pressure to perform lifts, kids who "couldn't do math" often discover they can.

At Scola, Ginger and Kristin made an intentional shift away from external validation. They stopped saying "I'm proud of you" and started asking "How does that make you feel?"

"The teacher is not the center," Ginger explains. "They're not doing this for me." In an education system that typically runs on gold stars, letter grades, and teacher approval, this represents a fundamental shift in how children relate to their own learning.

**What about flexibility versus structure?** Some critics worry that flexibility means lack of rigor or discipline. In practice, microschools have structure—it's just individualized structure. A ten-year-old ready for calculus but struggling with writing gets calculus. A child who needs to move gets to move. The flexibility is in matching structure to the child, not removing structure entirely.

This individualized approach particularly benefits students with special needs. [63% of microschools serve neurodivergent students](https://specialneedsanswers.com/microschools-as-an-option-for-students-with-disabilities-20580), with half stating this as their primary mission. The solution isn't specialized services or additional therapeutic interventions—it's flexibility.

At Sphinx Academy in Kentucky, when a kid needs to move, they move. When a ten-year-old is ready for calculus but can't write a paragraph, that's fine. Learning happens at each child's pace.

Layla Robertson, 16, struggled with health conditions that made large schools overwhelming. At Sphinx, she found breathing room. Madeliene Mischen, 15, found a place where being different wasn't just tolerated but normal.

The "special" in special needs often came from inflexibility, not from the child. When schools are small enough and flexible enough to actually adapt to individual kids, the accommodations stop feeling like accommodations.

**What does success actually mean?** "Maybe your kid is 19, working at Pizza Hut," Eleyah Knight says, addressing the anxiety many parents feel about their children's futures. "But are they happy? Are they healthy? Can they take care of themselves? Are they self-sufficient?"

This isn't about lowering expectations. It's about questioning which expectations actually matter.

Knight's own teenage kids tell her they "just want to be kids" and don't want to think about career paths yet. Traditional schools would push them toward college planning and career decisions. Knight takes a different approach: "If you address holistic health while they're young, they won't end up in their 30s with chronic diseases, wondering what happened to their childhood because they were so busy trying to be an adult."

## Finding and Joining a Microschool

Finding a microschool isn't like finding a traditional school—there's no district boundary or central directory. But the search is more accessible than ever, especially in states with Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) and programs like OpenEd.

### How to Search

**Start local and specific.** Search "[your city] microschool" and "[your city] learning pod." Check the National Microschooling Center's directory online. Join your state and local homeschool Facebook groups—since many microschools serve homeschool families, they often market in these spaces.

**Ask the right questions.** Instead of "What's your curriculum?" ask "How do you handle kids who are at different levels?" Instead of "What's your teacher-student ratio?" ask "How do you handle conflicts between students?" Instead of "What are your test scores?" ask "What does a typical day look like?"

Ginger from Scola Microschool recommends visiting during regular school hours, not just during a polished open house. "You'll see what it's really like. Trust your gut."

**Focus on values alignment.** Think about what matters most to your family: Do you want a religious or secular approach? Nature-based learning or more academic focus? Structured environment or child-led learning? Two days a week or four?

### Understanding Costs and Accessibility

In ESA states (Arizona, Florida, Utah, Arkansas, and expanding to more states), many microschools cost families little to nothing out-of-pocket because ESA funds cover tuition. Through OpenEd in Utah, part-time programs—not accredited full-time private schools, but programs meeting 2-3 days per week—qualify for full funding. This recognizes that education happens beyond school walls.

In states without ESA programs, expect to pay $6,000-15,000 annually for most microschools, though this is typically less than traditional private schools. Many offer sliding scale pricing. Wildflower Schools, for example, use a model where one-third of families pay full tuition while another third pay little to nothing.

While [88% of current microschool families have average or below-average incomes](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-importance-of-holding-microschools-accountable/), accessibility varies significantly by state. The growth of ESA programs and organizations like OpenEd is making microschools financially possible for more families than ever before.

### Starting Your Own Microschool

Dalena Wallace started with three families in her Kansas living room. Within months, she had 16 families. "I opened a Prenda Microschool in my home as part of a Kansas pilot program," Wallace says. "It completely turned me on to the idea that anybody can do this."

The support infrastructure for starting a microschool has grown significantly:

- **Prenda** provides complete curriculum, training, and ongoing support. No education degree required.
- **National Microschooling Center** offers resources, networking, and community connections.
- **State incubators** in Mississippi, Indiana, and other states provide startup support and coaching.
- **KaiPod Catalyst** offers 2-year post-launch coaching for new founders.

A minimum viable microschool typically needs: 8-12 families committed to your vision, a budget of around $40,000 annually (though this varies significantly by location and model), and a part-time schedule of 2-3 days per week which helps keep costs down. Most start in shared spaces like churches, community centers, or homes rather than permanent facilities.

**The psychological hurdle is often bigger than the logistical one.** As Kristin discovered with her "18-month undoing," letting go of what school "should" look like to discover what it could be takes courage. The permission you're really seeking isn't from the state—it's from yourself.

**A word about sustainability:** One challenge for new founders is making it economically sustainable. Education researcher Michael Horn cautions: "I don't want you to volunteer for a year. I want you to make a living doing this." Many microschools operate as passion projects with educators earning far less than they could elsewhere. Building in sustainable educator compensation from the start matters for long-term viability. Consider how guides will be paid, what makes the model work financially, and whether it can sustain beyond the founding year.

## The Real Challenges

The RAND Corporation's 2025 study notes that data on microschool outcomes remains ["unavailable, inconsistent, or unrepresentative."](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA3698-1.html) When you're not standardizing education, you're not standardizing measurement either. This makes it harder to know what's actually working across the board.

Quality varies dramatically. Some microschools are run by experienced educators with clear philosophies and strong support systems. Others are more experimental and less stable. Without traditional oversight mechanisms, it can be hard for families to assess quality before enrolling.

These are real concerns worth considering. The question for families isn't whether microschools are perfect—it's whether a particular microschool might serve your child better than the available alternatives. That's a question only you can answer.

## What This Means for Your Family

If you're considering a microschool for your child, here are practical next steps:

1. **Identify your non-negotiables** - What values, schedule requirements, and learning approaches matter most to your family?

2. **Research local options** - Use the search strategies above to find microschools in your area. Make a list of 3-5 worth exploring.

3. **Visit during regular hours** - Schedule visits when school is actually in session, not just during open houses. Observe how adults interact with kids and whether the environment feels right.

4. **Talk to current families** - Ask founders for contact information for 2-3 current families and learn about their real experience, including challenges.

5. **Understand your funding options** - If you're in Utah, explore OpenEd funding for part-time programs. If you're in another ESA state, learn how those funds work for microschools. In states without ESAs, understand full costs and sliding scale options.

6. **Consider starting part-time** - Many microschools offer flexible schedules. Starting with one or two days a week can help you and your child determine fit.

The microschool landscape is diverse, growing, and increasingly accessible. Whether you're drawn to nature-based learning, classical academics, faith-integrated education, project-based learning, or something else entirely, there's likely a model that aligns with your family's values and needs.

The question is finding it—or creating it yourself.
