# How 1.5 Million American Kids Found a Different Kind of School

*Clear, conversational reporting on the microschool movement—serious but not stuffy, substantive but readable.*

---

{We need a little more context early on about did everything right for what? What was her goal? Why do we care? As a teacher or something like that.}
Peggy Lowe spent 12 years doing everything right. A master's degree in early education. Committee membership on every possible school reform initiative. Research-backed proposals for more outdoor time, less testing, developmentally appropriate practices for young children.

The response from administrators was always the same: "You're right. It's not developmentally appropriate." Then nothing would change.

The breaking point came when her own son was born in 2021. She looked at the system she'd spent over a decade trying to reform and realized: 

"I knew that sitting behind desks and being told you're not good enough, you're failing here, here, and here over and over again was not developmentally appropriate for a five-year-old."

She left. And the guilt still haunts her: "Looking back at the kids that I taught for 12 years, it breaks my heart that I kept those kids in those seats."

Meanwhile in Minnesota, a Post-it note had been stuck to a teacher's desk for years. {This is not quite accurate. It's a nice literary flourish, but it doesn't conform to the actual facts of the case.} Written by one educator to another, it read: "Kristin, you need to start a school and I'll come work for you."

In California, a single mom named Eleyah Knight bought a 14-passenger van to create what she called an "adventure school" for teenagers.

And in Kansas, a homeschooling mom named Dalena Wallace opened her living room to three families who wanted something different.

These aren't isolated stories. Across America, [1.5 million students now attend roughly 95,000 microschools](https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/education/4574859-the-us-is-experiencing-a-boom-in-microschools-what-are-they/)—a phenomenon that barely existed four years ago. 

{This is a little bit of a clunky transition.}
These aren't wealthy families hiring private tutors. [88% of microschool families have average or below-average incomes](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-importance-of-holding-microschools-accountable/). They're regular people who looked at traditional education and decided to build something different.

## Why Teachers Keep Leaving to Start Schools

Kerry McDonald has interviewed hundreds of microschool founders for her podcast and research at the Foundation for Economic Education. The pattern is unmistakable: 

"The vast majority of founders I interview are former public school teachers who left the system," she says. "When parents saw that the people running these programs had credibility—actual teachers with years of experience—they thought, 'If they're leaving, maybe they're onto something.'"

Kristin and Ginger launched Scola Microschool in 2022, but not before what Kristin calls an "18-month undoing process."

"For however many years you're in a system, it's going to take that many months to shed everything," Kristin explains. She had taught for 18 years. "You're giving up pieces of your identity, pieces of what you prided yourself in. All the measuring sticks I had about being a good teacher? I actually had to lay those down."

The courage required surprised even her. The stakes felt enormous—not just leaving a career, but potentially getting it wrong in front of her entire community. "You're like, 'Oh my gosh, what if I fail?' Everyone's going to know."

Peggy Lowe joined every committee possible, spent years documenting problems, knew exactly what research said kids needed. None of it mattered. "It was just going into like a box somewhere," she recalls. "Someone wanted to say, okay, thank you for your complaint. We're not really going to do anything about it."

When she finally opened Apogee Utah, the contrast overwhelmed her. "I feel such guilt because I kept those kids in those seats... But I'm going to fix it now. This is my opportunity."

## What Actually Makes a Microschool Different

Size matters, but it's not what matters most. The [median microschool has 16 students](https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/education/4574859-the-us-is-experiencing-a-boom-in-microschools-what-are-they/). Some serve as few as 5, others up to 150. But the defining characteristics go deeper:

**Part-time is the dominant model, not the exception.** Most microschools operate 2-3 days per week—typically Tuesday-Thursday or Monday-Wednesday-Friday. This isn't a compromise or a "partial" education. It's an intentional design that recognizes learning happens everywhere, not just in designated school buildings during designated school hours.

**Mixed ages are the point, not a logistical convenience.** At Scola, four-year-olds learn alongside twelve-year-olds. At Apogee Utah, Peggy Lowe watches older kids naturally mentor younger ones, creating dynamics impossible in age-segregated classrooms. "The way the older kids speak to the little ones brings a whole different perspective," she says. "You don't get that when everybody has to be in first grade on the same level all the time."

**Guides and facilitators replace teachers.** The terminology shift signals a philosophical one. At Prenda, the nation's largest microschool network, 50% of "guides" are parents without teaching credentials. "You've got to give kids more credit than you think they deserve," Peggy explains. "They're so capable. You just need to step back and let them show you what they can do."

**Radical specificity trumps trying to serve everyone.** Jennifer Lincoln's Sphinx Academy in Kentucky serves exactly 24 twice-exceptional students—kids who are simultaneously gifted and learning disabled. "There's gifted education and there's special education, but there are not a lot of resources for students with an overlap," Lincoln notes. The solution wasn't more specialists. It was fewer students and more flexibility.

Legal structures reveal entrepreneurial creativity. Most microschools operate as nonprofits serving homeschoolers, learning centers, or "enrichment programs"—anything but "schools" in the regulatory sense. In Nevada, where secular private schools require state-certified administrators, founders simply pivot to serving homeschool families instead. The bureaucratic constraint becomes a design feature.

## What Three Days a Week Actually Looks Like

Connected Teens, Eleyah Knight's van-based microschool for teenagers, runs a schedule that would make any traditional school administrator reach for their calendar in confusion:

- **Monday:** Cooking, nutrition, natural medicine, and PE
- **Tuesday:** Coding and theater (because separating left-brain and right-brain activities never made sense anyway)
- **Friday:** Guest teacher workshops or field trips based on whatever the students are curious about that week

"We cover every subject public school does," Knight insists, "but in ways that are relevant to the modern world."

At Scola in Minnesota, they discovered something that should worry anyone designing education policy: "Nothing interesting happens in the first 40 minutes" of outdoor free play.

"The really good stuff—the complex social negotiations, the engineering projects, the deep imaginative play—that doesn't emerge until hour two," Kristin explains. So they stay outside for three hours. Daily. Through Minnesota winters.

Their "staff meetings" consist of two teachers standing back-to-back outside, watching different directions while discussing every single student by name. "This is what we dreamed about in education school," Ginger notes.

(In one memorable incident, students gathered every dead branch in an entire city park to build something. Kristin had to call the municipal government to explain why their park suddenly looked suspiciously tidy.)

At Apogee Utah, Peggy pulled some struggling students back one level in their math books—just one. The students resisted at first, worried about falling behind. "Nobody outside school will ask what level you're at," she told them. "We want you to feel confident in your math skills."

Once the pressure lifted, everything changed. The kids who "couldn't do math" suddenly could. They'd just been too stressed by the comparison to see the numbers.

## The Numbers Say Something's Working

[Prenda students show 18 percentage point increases in grade-level proficiency](https://www.prenda.com/post/persist-progress-prenda-the-results-of-a-research-aligned-learning-model-and-culture) in both math and reading. But the emotional metrics matter more: intrinsic motivation jumps from 27% to 62%. Positive feelings about school leap from 36% to 86%.

Across microschools generally, [76% of parents report being "very satisfied"](https://www.edchoice.org/2024-edchoice-share-exploring-where-americas-students-are-educated/) compared to a [25-year low of 42% satisfaction with traditional schools](https://news.gallup.com/poll/394784/satisfaction-k-12-education-low-second-straight-year.aspx).

But here's the real revolution: the shift from external to internal validation. At Scola, guides stopped saying "I'm proud of you" and started asking "How does that make you feel?"

"The teacher is not the center," Ginger explains. "They're not doing this for me." In an education system built on gold stars and letter grades, this is quietly radical.

## The Special Needs Discovery: Maybe They Weren't That Special

[63% of microschools serve neurodivergent students](https://specialneedsanswers.com/microschools-as-an-option-for-students-with-disabilities-20580), with half stating this as their primary mission. The solution isn't specialized services or therapeutic interventions. It's basic flexibility.

At Sphinx Academy, when a kid needs to move, they move. When a ten-year-old is ready for calculus but can't write a paragraph, that's okay. Learning happens at the child's pace, not the curriculum guide's timeline.

Layla Robertson, 16, struggled with health conditions that made large schools overwhelming. At Sphinx, she found breathing room. Madeliene Mischen, 15, found a place where being different wasn't just tolerated but normal.

The "special" in special needs, it turns out, was often just inflexibility dressed up as diagnosis. When schools are small enough and flexible enough, the accommodations don't feel like accommodations at all.

## Redefining What Success Actually Means

"Maybe your kid is 19, working at Pizza Hut," Eleyah Knight says, addressing every parent's 3 AM anxiety about their child's future. "But are they happy? Are they healthy? Can they take care of themselves? Are they self-sufficient?"

This isn't lowered expectations. It's recalibrated priorities.

Knight's own kids tell her they "just want to be kids" and don't want to think about careers yet. Traditional schools would push them toward college decisions and career paths. Knight takes a different approach: "If you address holistic health while they're young, they won't end up in their 30s with chronic diseases, wondering what happened to their childhood because they were so busy trying to be an adult."

Her son volunteers at the library one day a week. It might seem routine, even boring. But he's building work ethic without overwhelm. "Why fight that?" Knight asks. "Who am I to say he needs more?"

"I've bred some rebels," Knight admits. "They question everything, including authority—and yes, that includes questioning me, which is great."

One suspects this wasn't in the parenting books.

## The Major Networks (And What Makes Them Different)

The landscape of microschool networks reveals different philosophies, not just different price points:

**[Prenda](https://www.prenda.com/)** serves 2,500+ students across 300+ microschools in six states. Annual cost: $6,200-7,200 (or $0 out-of-pocket with ESA funding in Arizona, Florida, Utah, Arkansas). Their model: self-paced mastery learning with guides who don't need education degrees. Half their guides are just parents who decided they could do this.

**[Acton Academy](https://www.actonacademy.org/)** operates 300+ schools globally with a no-grades-ever philosophy. Cost: $6,000-13,000 annually depending on location. They call it the "Hero's Journey," which sounds precious until you meet kids who've internalized that they're protagonists of their own story, not test scores on someone else's spreadsheet.

**[Wildflower Schools](https://www.wildflowerschools.org/)** run 72 Montessori-based microschools serving 1,600 students. Cost: $0-25,000 on a sliding scale (one-third pay full tuition, one-third pay little to nothing). Their teacher retention rate: 94%. The secret? Actually letting teachers teach.

**[KaiPod Learning](https://www.kaipodlearning.com/)** connects kids to online curricula with in-person learning coach support. Cost: $551-1,150 monthly depending on days attended. Think of it as unbundled education—you choose the curriculum, they provide the community and support.

But as Kerry McDonald points out, "Micro is scalable. It's just scaling small." Instead of one school with 1,000 students, imagine 50 schools with 20 students each. Same number of kids, fundamentally different experience.

## How to Actually Find and Join a Microschool

The search process isn't like finding a traditional school. There's no central directory, no GreatSchools ratings, no district boundaries. Here's what actually works:

**Start local and specific.** Search "[your city] microschool" and "[your city] learning pod." Check the National Microschooling Center's directory. Join state and local homeschool Facebook groups—microschools often market there since they serve homeschool families.

**Ask different questions.** Not "What's your curriculum?" but "How do you handle kids at different levels?" Not "What's your teacher-student ratio?" but "How do conflicts get resolved?" Not "What are your test scores?" but "What does a typical day look like?"

Ginger's advice: Visit during regular school hours, not during a polished open house. "You'll see what it's really like. Trust your gut."

**Match values, not prestige.** Look for alignment on what matters to your family: Religious values or secular approach? Nature-based or academic-focused? Structured or child-led? Two days a week or four?

**Understand the financial landscape.** In ESA states (Arizona, Florida, Utah, Arkansas, and expanding), many microschools cost little to nothing out-of-pocket. In other states, expect $6,000-15,000 annually, though some offer sliding scale pricing. Through OpenEd, part-time programs qualify for full funding—recognition that education happens beyond school walls.

## How to Start Your Own Microschool

Dalena Wallace started with three families in her Kansas living room. Within months, she had 16 families. "I opened a Prenda Microschool in my home as part of a Kansas pilot program," Wallace recalls. "It completely turned me on to the idea that anybody can do this."

The founder profile is remarkably consistent: people who tried to reform the system first, couldn't wait any longer, and decided to build their own solution.

**The support infrastructure is real:**

- **Prenda** provides full curriculum, training, and ongoing support. No education degree required.
- **National Microschooling Center** offers resources, networking, and community.
- **State incubators** in Mississippi, Indiana, and other states provide startup support.
- **KaiPod Catalyst** offers 2-year post-launch coaching.

**The minimum viable microschool:** 8-12 families committed to your vision. $40,000 annual budget (varies by location and model). A part-time schedule (2-3 days) reduces costs dramatically. Shared space—a church, community center, someone's home—not a permanent facility.

**The psychological hurdle is bigger than the logistical one.** Kristin's 18-month "undoing" wasn't unique. Every founder faces it: letting go of what school "should" look like to discover what it could be. The permission you're really seeking isn't from the state—it's from yourself.

## The Hybrid Future: Online Meets In-Person

KaiPod's model reveals something important: online curriculum plus in-person support beats either one alone. This isn't "online school with babysitting." It's recognition that digital tools are excellent for some things (adaptive math practice, video lectures you can pause) and terrible for others (motivation, social connection, accountability).

Kerry McDonald calls it educational unbundling:
- Math from Khan Academy
- Writing from a local teacher
- Science from an online program
- Social time from microschool
- PE from community sports

"This isn't educational chaos," McDonald insists. "It's educational curation."

The part-time model makes this possible. Three days at a microschool leaves two days for deep project work, family learning, online courses, apprenticeships, or just being a kid.

## The Honest Challenges and Open Questions

The RAND Corporation's 2025 study notes that data on microschool outcomes remains ["unavailable, inconsistent, or unrepresentative."](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA3698-1.html) That's a fair critique. When you're not standardizing, you're not easily measuring.

Quality varies dramatically. Some microschools are genuinely transformative. Others are, generously, "experimental in concerning ways." Without oversight mechanisms, how do families know what they're getting?

The equity question is real. In states without ESA programs, microschools can increase educational inequality. Of course, the current system already segregates by zip code—we've just normalized that form of inequity.

And there's Michael Horn's concern about sustainability. Horn, education innovation researcher and author, worries about the long-term viability: "I don't want you to volunteer for a year. I want you to make a living doing this." Too many microschools feel like passion projects subsidized by teacher martyrdom. The market infrastructure isn't mature enough yet to consistently support educator wages while keeping tuition accessible.

But here's what critics often miss: microschools aren't trying to win at traditional education. They're playing a different game entirely. The question isn't "Are microschools better?" It's "Better for whom, for what purpose, in what context?"

## What This Means for Your Family

OpenEd changes the financial equation. Part-time microschools—those operating 2-3 days per week—qualify for funding through OpenEd's partnerships in Utah and expanding states. This isn't a loophole. It's recognition that education happens beyond school walls.

You're not choosing between educational quality and financial reality. You're acknowledging that three exceptional days might serve your child better than five mediocre ones. That mixing approaches—microschool Tuesdays, home learning Wednesdays, nature programs Fridays—might work better than any single system.

**The practical next steps:**

1. Identify your non-negotiables: values, schedule needs, learning approach
2. Research local options and visit during regular hours
3. Talk to current families, not just the founders
4. Apply for OpenEd funding if you're in Utah (or watch for expansion)
5. Start with one or two days if you're unsure—many programs offer flexible schedules

The revolution isn't coming from policymakers or tech billionaires or education schools. It's coming from people like Peggy, Kristin, Ginger, Eleyah, and Dalena who looked at what their kids needed, looked at what existed, and decided to build the difference.

"We're doing our little micro part here," Ginger says modestly.

Little, perhaps. Micro, certainly. But multiplied by 95,000 schools serving 1.5 million students? That's not a trend. That's a movement.

The future of education isn't about better schools. It's about better choices. And those choices are proliferating in church basements, living rooms, converted yoga studios, and yes, in 14-passenger vans rolling through communities across America.

Sometimes the best classroom has wheels. Sometimes it has a backyard. Sometimes it's just eight families who decided they could do better—and then did.
