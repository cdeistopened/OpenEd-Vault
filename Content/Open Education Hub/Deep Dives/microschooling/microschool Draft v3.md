# A Parent's Guide to Microschools: What They Are and How They Work

If you're hearing more about microschools and wondering whether one might work for your family, you're not alone. Over the past four years, microschools have grown from a niche option to [a movement serving 1.5 million students across roughly 95,000 schools nationwide](https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/education/4574859-the-us-is-experiencing-a-boom-in-microschools-what-are-they/).

But what exactly is a microschool? How is it different from homeschooling or a small private school? And more importantly—could it be the right fit for your child?

## What Is a Microschool?

{Again, here it kind of feels like we're just rattling off facts a little bit. I think we should talk a little bit more about how this sort of fits in with homeschooling. How it can be a good adjunct for a parent who has some responsibilities but still wants to have more control over their kids' education. It's like a mix-and-match à la carte kind of thing. And you're not necessarily locked into the same one for K-12. You might find that one is good for a particular season. Or you might even consider starting one yourself. If you've got a small co-op or a learning pod, read on to find out how you might do that.}

At its most basic, a microschool is a small, intentionally designed learning environment—typically serving between 5 and 150 students, with a [median of 16 students](https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/education/4574859-the-us-is-experiencing-a-boom-in-microschools-what-are-they/). But size is actually the least important defining feature.

What really sets microschools apart:

**Part-time schedules are standard, not unusual.** Most microschools meet 2-3 days per week—typically Tuesday through Thursday or Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. This isn't because they're offering a "partial" education. It's intentional design based on the recognition that learning happens everywhere, not just during designated school hours in a school building.

**Mixed-age groupings are by design.** A typical microschool might have 4-year-olds learning alongside 12-year-olds, or a middle school program that keeps 11-14 year olds together. The age mixing creates natural mentorship opportunities and removes the artificial pressure to keep everyone moving at the same pace.

**Facilitators or guides instead of traditional teachers.** The terminology signals a different philosophy. Rather than a teacher standing at the front delivering lessons, microschools typically use adult guides who facilitate learning, ask questions, and help students find their own answers. At Prenda, the nation's largest microschool network, about half of their guides are parents without teaching credentials.

**Each microschool serves a specific community or philosophy.** Rather than trying to be all things to all people, microschools typically have a clear identity—nature-based learning, classical education, project-based learning, serving twice-exceptional students, or emphasizing a particular faith tradition.

Legally, most microschools operate as homeschool support programs, learning centers, or enrichment programs rather than as traditional schools. This allows them to serve families with more flexibility and less regulatory burden than traditional private schools face.

## Why Microschools Are Growing Now

The numbers tell a dramatic story. Four years ago, microschools were rare enough that most parents had never heard the term. Today, [88% of microschool families have average or below-average incomes](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-importance-of-holding-microschools-accountable/)—meaning this isn't a luxury option for wealthy families but an accessible alternative that regular families are choosing.

Kerry McDonald, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Economic Education who has researched education choice extensively, has noticed something interesting about who's starting these schools: "The vast majority of founders I interview are former public school teachers who left the system. When parents saw that the people running these programs had credibility—actual teachers with years of experience—they thought, 'If they're leaving, maybe they're onto something.'"

Peggy Lowe is one of those teachers. She spent 12 years in public education as a first-grade teacher, earning a master's degree in early elementary education, joining every possible committee focused on school reform, and making research-backed proposals for change. She knew from her human development background that young children needed more outdoor time, less testing, and more developmentally appropriate practices.

Administrators consistently agreed with her. "You're right," they would say. "It's not developmentally appropriate." Then nothing would change. Her proposals would go "into like a box somewhere," she recalls.

When her own son was born in 2021, she realized she couldn't send him into the system she'd spent a decade trying to fix. She left teaching and eventually opened Apogee Utah, a microschool. The guilt still affects her: "Looking back at the kids that I taught for 12 years, it breaks my heart that I kept those kids in those seats."

In Minnesota, two longtime educators named Kristin and Ginger had a similar realization. Both had been having conversations for years about starting something different—Ginger even wrote Kristin a note years earlier expressing the vision. But it took until 2022 for them to actually launch Scola Microschool.

Before they could start, though, Kristin had to go through what she calls an "18-month undoing process." She'd taught in traditional schools for 18 years. "For however many years you're in a system, it's going to take that many months to shed everything," she explains. "You're giving up pieces of your identity, pieces of what you prided yourself in. All the measuring sticks I had about being a good teacher? I actually had to lay those down."

The courage that took surprised her. "You're like, 'Oh my gosh, what if I fail?' Everyone's going to know."

## What a Microschool Week Actually Looks Like

One of the biggest adjustments for parents considering microschools is wrapping their heads around the part-time schedule {I don't know if this is quite right. It's more than just the part-time schedule}. What does learning actually look like in a microschool? Here, if you ask 9 microschool founders, you might get 11 different answers.

Eleyah Knight, a single mom and Chinese medicine practitioner in California, runs Connected Teens, a microschool for teenagers that meets three days. Her "adventure school" is the prototypical example of how eclectic microschools can be—even in terms of their individual offerings.

For starters, there is no classroom. The closest thing to a permanent learning space is a 14-passenger van as their mobile classroom. Her weekly schedule:

- **Monday:** Cooking, nutrition, natural medicine, and physical education
- **Tuesday:** Coding with a specialized teacher, along with theater and other flexible activities
- **Friday:** Guest teacher workshops or field trips designed around student interests
{Let's make a joke about the Magic School Bus here.}

"We cover every subject public school does," Knight explains, "but in ways that are relevant to the modern world." The students help shape their own educational experience, which Knight believes helps them develop confidence and critical thinking without the overwhelming peer pressure of schools with hundreds or thousands of students.

At Scola Microschool in Minnesota, Kristin and Ginger discovered something important about outdoor play: nothing particularly interesting happens in the first 40 minutes. "The really good stuff—the complex social negotiations, the engineering projects, the deep imaginative play—that doesn't emerge until hour two," Kristin says. So they keep kids outside for three hours daily, even through Minnesota winters.

Their "staff meetings" happen outdoors too—two teachers standing back-to-back, watching in different directions while discussing each student by name. "This is what we dreamed about in education school," Ginger notes.

{Here, I feel like we could probably benefit from some mentions of the fact that there are other Sudbury schools that have a democratic model. Maybe this is where we could actually move the content on the major microschool franchises.}

At Apogee Utah, Peggy Lowe made a discovery about math anxiety. She pulled some struggling students back just one level in their math workbooks—not because they couldn't do the work, but because the stress of trying to keep up was preventing them from learning. "Nobody outside school will ask what level you're at," she told them. "We want you to feel confident in your math skills."

Once the pressure lifted, the kids who "couldn't do math" suddenly could. They'd just been too anxious about the comparison to actually see the numbers.

## But Do Kids Learn?

{Let's make more clear here from the earlier section. We're kind of talking about flexibility, which some people might sound like it, lack of structure and standardization could be a problem.}
For parents considering microschools, the obvious question is: but do kids actually learn?

The data is limited—when you're not standardizing education, you're not standardizing testing either. But the numbers that do exist are encouraging. [Prenda students show 18 percentage point increases in grade-level proficiency](https://www.prenda.com/post/persist-progress-prenda-the-results-of-a-research-aligned-learning-model-and-culture) in both math and reading.

Perhaps more significantly, the emotional and motivational metrics show dramatic changes. In Prenda schools, students' intrinsic motivation jumps from 27% to 62%. Positive feelings about school leap from 36% to 86%.

Across microschools more generally, [76% of parents report being "very satisfied"](https://www.edchoice.org/2024-edchoice-share-exploring-where-americas-students-are-educated/), compared to [just 42% satisfaction with traditional schools](https://news.gallup.com/poll/394784/satisfaction-k-12-education-low-second-straight-year.aspx) (a 25-year low).

At Scola, Ginger and Kristin made an intentional shift away from external validation. They stopped saying "I'm proud of you" and started asking "How does that make you feel?"

"The teacher is not the center," Ginger explains. "They're not doing this for me." In an education system that typically runs on gold stars, letter grades, and teacher approval, this represents a fundamental shift in how children relate to their own learning.

## Microschools and Students with Special Needs
{this is part of a broader theme that microschools are able to serve more specific niches that public schools aren't serving... }

One of the more surprising statistics about microschools: [63% serve neurodivergent students](https://specialneedsanswers.com/microschools-as-an-option-for-students-with-disabilities-20580), with half stating this as their primary mission.

The solution these schools offer isn't specialized services or additional therapeutic interventions. It's flexibility.

Take Sphinx Academy in Kentucky, for example. Founded by Jennifer Lincoln, it serves 24 "twice-exceptional" students—kids who are simultaneously gifted and learning disabled. "There's gifted education and there's special education," Lincoln explains, "but there are not a lot of resources for students with an overlap."

At Sphinx, when a kid needs to move, they move. When a ten-year-old is ready for calculus but can't write a paragraph, that's fine. Learning happens at each child's pace, not according to a curriculum pacing guide.

Layla Robertson, 16, struggled with health conditions that made large schools overwhelming. At Sphinx, she found an environment where she could actually breathe. Madeliene Mischen, 15, found a place where being different wasn't just tolerated but normal.

The insight here is important: the "special" in special needs was often created by inflexibility in the first place. When schools are small enough and flexible enough to actually adapt to individual kids, the accommodations stop feeling like accommodations.

## Rethinking What Educational Success Means

{this is fluff - condense and move into the section on "do kids learn" - note that it's common to have a greater emphasis on things other than pure academics, and yet counterintutiotively this ofetne results in better academic performance later on}

"Maybe your kid is 19, working at Pizza Hut," Eleyah Knight says, addressing the anxiety many parents feel about their children's futures. "But are they happy? Are they healthy? Can they take care of themselves? Are they self-sufficient?"

This isn't about lowering expectations. It's about questioning which expectations actually matter.

Knight's own teenage kids tell her they "just want to be kids" and don't want to think about career paths yet. Traditional schools would push them toward college planning and career decisions. Knight takes a different approach: "If you address holistic health while they're young, they won't end up in their 30s with chronic diseases, wondering what happened to their childhood because they were so busy trying to be an adult."

Her son volunteers at the library one day a week. It might seem routine, but he's building work ethic and responsibility without overwhelm. "Why fight that?" Knight asks. "Who am I to say he needs more?"

Peggy Lowe has seen similar patterns at Apogee. When she removed the pressure to perform at a certain level, kids gained confidence that translated to other areas. "You've got to give kids more credit than you think they deserve," she says. "They're so capable. You just need to step back and let them show you what they can do."

## The Major Microschool Networks

If you're interested in exploring microschools, it helps to understand the major national networks and what makes each one different:

**[Prenda](https://www.prenda.com/)** is the largest network, serving 2,500+ students across 300+ locations in six states. Cost is $6,200-7,200 annually, or $0 out-of-pocket if you're in an ESA state (Arizona, Florida, Utah, Arkansas) where funding covers the full amount. Prenda uses self-paced mastery learning and provides the full curriculum, training, and support for guides—half of whom are parents without education degrees.

**[Acton Academy](https://www.actonacademy.org/)** operates 300+ schools globally with a philosophy they call the "Hero's Journey." Cost ranges from $6,000-13,000 annually depending on location. Acton schools never use grades, instead relying on badges, portfolios, and exhibitions to demonstrate learning. The approach emphasizes treating students as the protagonists of their own educational story.

**[Wildflower Schools](https://www.wildflowerschools.org/)** run 72 Montessori-based microschools serving 1,600 students. They use a sliding scale model where tuition ranges from $0-25,000—about one-third of families pay full tuition, another third pay little to nothing. Their teacher retention rate is 94%, largely because they give educator pairs complete autonomy in running their schools.

**[KaiPod Learning](https://www.kaipodlearning.com/)** offers a hybrid model connecting kids to online curricula while providing in-person learning coach support. Cost is $551-1,150 monthly depending on how many days your child attends. Families choose their own online curriculum from KaiPod's partner schools, and the in-person coach provides structure, accountability, and social connection.

As Kerry McDonald points out, the microschool model is "scaling small"—instead of one school with 1,000 students, you have 50 schools with 20 students each. Same number of kids, fundamentally different experience.

## How to Find a Microschool Near You

{condense this- keep the Ginger quote.. Note that OpenEd supports families enrolled in part-time programs not accredited full time private schools though}

Unlike traditional schools, there's no central directory or district boundaries for microschools. Here's how to actually find options in your area:

**Start with online searches and local groups.** Try searching "[your city] microschool" and "[your city] learning pod." Check the National Microschooling Center's directory online. Join your state and local homeschool Facebook groups—since many microschools serve homeschool families, they often market in these spaces.

**Ask the right questions when you find options.** Instead of "What's your curriculum?" ask "How do you handle kids who are at different levels?" Instead of "What's your teacher-student ratio?" ask "How do you handle conflicts between students?" Instead of "What are your test scores?" ask "What does a typical day look like?"

Ginger from Scola Microschool recommends visiting during regular school hours, not just during a polished open house. "You'll see what it's really like. Trust your gut."

**Focus on values alignment, not prestige.** Think about what matters most to your family: Do you want a religious or secular approach? Nature-based learning or more academic focus? Structured environment or child-led learning? Two days a week or four?

**Understand the financial picture.** In ESA states (Arizona, Florida, Utah, Arkansas, with more states expanding these programs), many microschools cost little to nothing out-of-pocket because funding covers tuition. In states without ESA programs, expect to pay $6,000-15,000 annually, though some schools offer sliding scale pricing. Through OpenEd in Utah, part-time programs qualify for full funding.

## Starting Your Own Microschool

{Maybe make this a subsection of finding a microschool.}

Dalena Wallace is a homeschooling mom in Kansas who started with three families meeting in her living room. Within months, she had 16 families. "I opened a Prenda Microschool in my home as part of a Kansas pilot program," Wallace says. "It completely turned me on to the idea that anybody can do this."

The support infrastructure for starting a microschool has grown significantly:

- **Prenda** provides complete curriculum, training, and ongoing support. No education degree required.
- **National Microschooling Center** offers resources, networking, and community connections.
- **State incubators** in Mississippi, Indiana, and other states provide startup support and coaching.
- **KaiPod Catalyst** offers 2-year post-launch coaching for new founders.

A minimum viable microschool typically needs: 8-12 families committed to your vision, a budget of around $40,000 annually (though this varies significantly by location and model), and a part-time schedule of 2-3 days per week which helps keep costs down. Most start in shared spaces like churches, community centers, or homes rather than permanent facilities.

The psychological hurdle is often bigger than the logistical one. As Kristin discovered with her "18-month undoing," letting go of what school "should" look like to discover what it could be takes courage. The permission you're really seeking isn't from the state—it's from yourself.

## The Hybrid Model: Mixing Microschools with Other Approaches

{This is good, but it might be good content for the top part. Kind of the introduction and telling the sort of better together story. Also, where did you find that thing from Kerry McDonald talking about the unbundling? Let's check that.}

One of the advantages of the part-time microschool model is that it makes mixing different educational approaches much more practical.

Kerry McDonald calls this "educational unbundling"—putting together the pieces that work best for your child:
- Math from Khan Academy or another online program
- Writing instruction from a local teacher or co-op
- Science from a different online program
- Social time and community from microschool
- PE from community sports or activities

"This isn't educational chaos," McDonald says. "It's educational curation."

The part-time schedule makes this mixing possible. If your child attends a microschool three days a week, that leaves two days for project-based work at home, online courses, apprenticeships, or simply having time to be a kid.

This is actually one of the key differences between microschools and traditional school choice: you're not just choosing one school over another. You're choosing how to compose your child's entire educational experience.

## The Real Challenges and Honest Questions

{I think we can shorten this up a little bit and maybe put the thing about Michael Horn's stuff in the section about how to start one. The stuff about it being a little bit less accessible, you could put that in the section on how to find one and note that in states with programs like OpenEd and ESAs, it's never been more accessible. And that most of the time the tuition is lower than a traditional private school.}

It's worth being clear-eyed about the limitations and concerns with microschools.

Data on outcomes is limited. As a 2025 RAND Corporation study notes, information on microschool students' ["backgrounds, proficiency, and academic growth are often unavailable, inconsistent, or unrepresentative."](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA3698-1.html) When you're not standardizing education, you're not standardizing measurement either. This makes it harder to know what's actually working.

Quality varies significantly. Some microschools are run by experienced educators with clear philosophies and strong support systems. Others are more experimental and less stable. Without traditional oversight mechanisms, it can be hard for families to assess quality before enrolling.

The equity concern is real. In states without ESA or voucher programs, microschools can be financially out of reach for many families. While 88% of current microschool families have average or below-average incomes, this is partly because many are in states with ESA funding. Without that funding mechanism, access becomes much more limited.

Michael Horn, an education innovation researcher, raises concerns about long-term sustainability. "I don't want you to volunteer for a year," he says about microschool founders. "I want you to make a living doing this." Too many microschools operate as passion projects with educators earning far less than they could elsewhere. The market infrastructure isn't mature enough yet to consistently support reasonable educator wages while keeping tuition accessible.

These are legitimate concerns. The microschool movement is still young, and not every microschool will succeed. The question for families isn't whether microschools are perfect—it's whether a particular microschool might serve your child better than the available alternatives.

## What This Could Mean for Your Family

{this is total fluff"}

If you're considering a microschool for your child, here are some practical next steps:

**Identify your non-negotiables first.** What are the values, schedule requirements, and learning approaches that matter most to your family? This will help you narrow down which microschools to explore.

**Research what's available locally.** Use the search strategies mentioned earlier to find microschools in your area. Make a list of 3-5 that seem potentially worth exploring.

**Visit during regular school hours.** Schedule visits when school is actually in session, not just during open houses. Observe how adults interact with kids, how conflicts get handled, and whether the environment feels like what your child needs.

**Talk to current families.** Ask the founders for contact information for 2-3 current families and talk to them about their real experience—not just the highlights but also the challenges.

**Understand your funding options.** If you're in Utah, apply for OpenEd funding which covers part-time microschool programs. If you're in another ESA state, explore how those funds can be used for microschools. If you're in a state without ESA funding, understand the full cost and whether sliding scale options exist.

**Consider starting part-time.** Many microschools offer flexible schedules. You don't have to jump to full participation immediately. Starting with one or two days a week can help you and your child determine if it's the right fit.

The growth of microschools represents a broader shift in how families think about education. It's not just about choosing between traditional public school and traditional private school. It's about recognizing that you can compose an educational experience from multiple sources—and that three really good days at a microschool combined with two days of other learning might serve your child better than any single five-day program.

As Ginger from Scola says, "We're doing our little micro part here." Multiply that by 95,000 schools and 1.5 million students, and "little" starts to look like a movement.

For your family, the question isn't whether microschools are revolutionizing American education. It's much simpler: Is there a microschool near you that could help your child thrive?
