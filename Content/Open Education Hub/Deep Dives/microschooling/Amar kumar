I am thrilled to welcome back on the podcast Amar Kumar founder of Kai pod
0:08
learning and Ben Ashfield founder of the village electric a micro school and
0:13
microscope incubator in New Jersey what's particularly special about today's episode is that Ben and Amar
0:19
actually met through this podcast Ben heard Mar on the podcast and reached out
0:25
and now the two of them are collaborating on some exciting projects that we'll hear more about today it's
0:31
just great to hear that the podcast is becoming a connector for all kinds of people
0:37
so Amar joined me on the podcast back in May to talk about his Pathway to launching Kai pod learning in 2021 after
0:45
working for years in education including most recently as Chief product officer
0:50
for Pearson online's K-12 division highpod is one of my favorite education
0:56
startups in that it allows parents maximum autonomy to choose whatever curriculum they want for their child
1:02
from unschooling and unstructured approaches to more conventional curriculum Frameworks and incorporating
1:09
any manner of secular or faith-based curriculum options students then gather
1:15
in small mixed age learning pods typically in local commercial spaces and
1:20
led by experienced Educators who are available to help with any curricular questions or issues and who facilitate
1:26
social and enrichment activities for the Learners iPod really Blends the best of
1:33
both personalized online curriculum tied to a family's preferences with in-person
1:38
educator facilitated social learning communities Amar recently introduced a new program
1:44
through Kai pod called Catalyst which helps entrepreneurial parents and Educators to launch a microscope in
1:50
their own local community one of the entrepreneurial parents who has teamed up with Kai pod is Ben
1:57
Ashfield Ben and his wife Tammy were on the podcast in September talking about
2:02
how they created The Village electric to provide a microscope environment for their children and others while also
2:08
enabling more education entrepreneurs the opportunity to incubate their microscope idea at the Village electric
2:15
space so in this episode Ben will update us on the village electric talk to us
2:22
about his collaboration with Amar and what came from that initial conversation
2:27
from this podcast and then Amar will update us on Kai pod Catalyst and the
2:33
vision for that exciting new program so Ben Ashfield and Amar Kumar welcome
2:38
again to the liberated podcast thank you very much for Social Security
2:45
it's great to have you both back I think you're my first repeat uh guest on this
2:51
podcast which is quite special kind of about to head into our second year in production so I'm thrilled to have the
2:56
two of you here and Ben maybe we could start with you you know you listened to the podcast thank you very much for
3:03
doing that and you uh heard the episode in May with Amar and then you reached
3:09
out to him I'd love to hear a little bit more about what prompted you to do that and then how that conversation evolved
3:14
over time uh to ultimately have you become a collaborator with Amar and Kai
3:20
pod on this new Catalyst program yeah so we started our micro School a
3:25
couple of years ago and um you know I think Cara you were my first Mentor because we've we listened
3:32
to your podcast religiously um you know just to connect with others who were doing similar
3:40
things even just you know connecting with ideas and people that were talking about things that we were thinking about
3:47
um and that's when I heard the episode about Kai pop that's sounded like
3:54
um exactly the same things that we were thinking about you know flexible learning in-person learning how Amar
4:01
really valued that um you know like like we did when we were starting our micro school and so I
4:07
reached out just to start a conversation with someone who was doing something similar to what I was doing and actually
4:14
I was very impressed to see the kai pod website and the extent of what they had
4:20
created because I think some of you know um trying to start a microscope
4:26
is feeling kind of alone in doing this and not really knowing where to start
4:31
um and who can help you so um each time you find somebody uh or you
4:37
find another organization that's doing something similar it's it's so thrilling and it's like a light bulb goes off so I
4:45
reached out right away not knowing what to expect but really just wanting to connect
4:51
that's great and I think it speaks to the power of connection and and building relationships especially with people who
4:57
have a shared Vision in this case of education and what education could be and then and then seeing where that
5:03
connection ultimately leads which was to ultimately become a collaborator with
5:08
Amar on Kai pod catalyst so Amar maybe you could talk a little bit about Kai
5:13
pod Catalyst where that idea came from and then how you're working with Ben and
5:20
the village electric sure I'd be happy to um so you know we look at the the vision
5:27
of Education being much more personal much more flexible and individualized
5:33
for every family and every parent we know that one-size-fitsologist doesn't work for most people so our vision is to
5:39
bring education down into smaller and smaller communities and often when you're thinking about a vision like that
5:45
you have to think about it as a market there's a supply and there's a demand and when those two meet you get the
5:50
market what do you think about the demand first that's demand for parents and we know that it's not just the listeners of your
5:57
podcast but there are millions of parents who are craving more flexible smaller learning environments for their
6:04
children so the demand is there more states are now allowing funding to
6:09
follow the students so the demand can now be fulfilled with funding but the supply is still a challenge there just
6:15
aren't enough high quality small learning spaces in this country and so
6:21
there are networks like iPod who open our own company posters and others acting there's a lot of companies who
6:26
are opening these really high quality spaces but again there aren't enough then there is a segment of independent
6:33
micro schools like fans who are opening their own they take their vision and bring it to life we want to find a way
6:40
to support them and then the third which I find is the biggest untapped potential in this
6:45
country is all of these Educators who have a lot of entrepreneurial energy and
6:51
they want to serve their community and their communities Learners in a new way and so our strategy is really about
6:58
these three things growing our company pods our Network supporting independent micro schools
7:04
like Ben's through our partnership and then third the Catalyst program which is
7:09
to reach as many Educators as we can in as many communities as we can to say if
7:16
you want to start a micro school but you're sort of worried or anxious about what that might mean let us go on that
7:23
Journey with you so the Catalyst program is an 18-week part-time cohort it is
7:29
completely free of cost where we bring together folks who are Educators or passionate parents who know that they
7:37
want to start a microscope and just like any accelerator we want to take something that could take years and do
7:43
it in months so our vision is you'll start in February and you'll have a school live by this fall and through the
7:49
program you're going to get a lot of coaching from our team a lot of expert interviews and time with industry
7:56
experts you'll get templates you'll get processes you'll get connections to funders and really the idea is that all
8:03
of the things that you probably would take years to figure out we can compress that so that you have the highest likelihood
8:10
of success of launching a school this fall I just love it because you know I
8:15
hear all the time from people who say I want to start a micro school I don't know how to begin and there's certainly
8:21
all kinds of strategies you can go it alone you can team up with these other networks that you mentioned such as
8:27
Acton Academy or prenda or liberated Learners and that would those would also be great options but here's another
8:34
option and that is that you can collaborate with Kai pod to get this boot camp to get going and then be
8:41
supported all along the way uh through Kai pod in the back end too and so then
8:47
maybe you could talk a little bit more about that about how you're using Kai pod as an existing microscope founder
8:52
and then maybe what you think about this vision of Kai pod Catalyst for new
8:57
Founders including perhaps some of the ones who you are helping to incubate programs at the Village Electric
9:06
uh so you know I think when we started our first year it kind of felt a little
9:13
bit more like a whirlwind you know trial and error was was it okay
9:18
um and we were just trying to kind of keep the wheels from falling off the bus but as we went into our second year
9:26
um you know Tammy and I really had more aspirations and and higher expectations for what we wanted to do
9:34
um but you know that didn't mean we were necessarily we necessarily had the time where we're so equipped to be able to do
9:40
that and I think that's where Kai pods like really came in and helped us like
9:46
they helped us [Music] um uh with marketing with enrollment and
9:52
operations with you know improving our academic programs and just lending us a
9:57
lot of expertise uh so that we felt like the the micro school you know could
10:04
could continue could develop could kind of like grow and expand but Tammy and I as the founders could focus on what is
10:12
important to us which is really you know being there for the students and you
10:17
know forming relationships with the families um you know and being there for the parents
10:23
so tell me a little bit more about that Ben because I can understand you know obviously the need for more
10:28
administrative support more marketing support that kind of thing but you also mentioned that you that this was helpful
10:34
in terms of elevating your academic content how does that work
10:39
uh well we work with um a curriculum advisor at Kai pods uh his name is Ryan
10:45
and you know I think it was it was really great to have sort of an objective observation of what
10:52
was happening like in our classrooms so someone to come in and you know sort of give us the
11:01
appraisal of what's going on in the classroom where we can improve um and and also you know Ryan was very
11:08
knowledgeable about all the different types of curriculums and the things that
11:14
we might be able to bring in the classroom to just sort of improve what we're doing
11:19
um on an you know from an academic perspective so
11:24
um I think just having someone to talk to you know knowing um that someone is there that wants you
11:31
to succeed uh that that's kind of behind you I think when you're starting a micro school just that like emotional benefit
11:37
is like huge it's a game changer um but also being able to talk to
11:43
knowledgeable people that understand where you are and what you're going through and and can help you
11:50
uh you know from where you are right at that moment valuable to have that other set of eyes
11:57
that uh sounding board someone to um share ideas with and also to get
12:04
feedback on what you're doing and maybe some tips for doing it differently or better so great to hear that type has
12:10
been helpful for you as you really now become more of an established microscope
12:16
uh in in your second year so Amar if if I am listening if I'm someone listening
12:23
to this podcast and I'm thinking wow this is exactly what I'm looking for I know I want to start a microschool in
12:28
September this is perfect timing I'm going to sign up for Catalyst what
12:34
happens then sure so we have a four-step process the first is you obviously apply
12:40
where there's an online application where we ask you some questions about yourself your background your
12:45
motivations and then the vision for your program and we we you'll be asked for an interview with a member of our team
12:52
then the second part of the process is you're accepted into the Catalyst cohort is it's an 18-week accelerator which
12:58
means for the next 18 weeks we'll have weekly sessions which are combinations of coaching calls expert presentations
13:07
homework that you're doing in between the sessions uh you're building your community with your cohort it's 18 weeks
13:14
it's part time and it's designed for someone who may still be teaching right they're finishing out a school year or
13:19
it's designed for someone who may have another job but who wants to move into starting a microscope so as an 18-week
13:25
program that has the modules effectively that you will need to understand to
13:31
launch your own microscope that's phase two phase three is then in the summer after the Catalyst program ends is you are
13:38
very busy preparing for launch and to be clear these are independent micro schools these are not going to be Kai
13:44
pods you don't even have to follow the kai pod model we're truly here to enable a lot of Bottoms Up Innovation so we
13:52
have just seen some incredible ideas including a microscope founder who wants to have a microscope on a traveling
13:58
School Bus including some who want to do forest-based micro schools or very traditional
14:04
secular micro schools so there's a huge variety of ideas that we're supporting as part of catalyst and so phase three
14:11
is launch preparation and so our entire team is going to be swarming to help you
14:16
find families find a location get licensure if you need it figure out your
14:22
business model build your business plan get your academics in order get your software ready to go so all of the
14:29
things that you need the Nitty Gritty that's phase three and then finally phase four is what we call our
14:34
affiliation period which is for the next three years we're there with you every step of the way so we're not just going
14:40
to say all right good luck you know go fly a little bird we know that the first two to three years of starting a micro
14:46
School are some of the hardest and most challenging and where unfortunately most microscores fail so we want to be there
14:53
for every step of the way again supporting you with marketing getting leads in the door we have lots of email
14:59
campaigns that help you convert interested parents again providing all the software that we operate to to help
15:07
you run your own centers academic coaching and professional development like Ben was saying to help you and show
15:13
you're improving learning outcomes for your kids so if you're interested and you're a little bit scared to start just
15:18
do the first step today which is just fill out the application that's all you have to do today and then the next step
15:23
will be tomorrow that's such great advice and so for the initial training period this initial I
15:30
think you said 18 weeks um you said that that is no cost to the
15:37
entrepreneur in uh in training um so what is the financial model then
15:42
of catalyst yeah the financial model is the 18 weeks is free of cost and we're
15:47
investing our resources into running that entire program and then after that period if you choose to launch your own
15:54
microscope and you say yes I want to do this then we want to enter into a revenue share agreement with you so as
16:00
you grow we benefit and so we are there to help you grow help you sustain and
16:05
help you retain your families because they're doing so well that's great well hopefully people will be so satisfied
16:11
with the initial training that they'd want to sign up but they could also just part ways at that point and do their own
16:16
thing perfect um and so what do you see Umar as some
16:24
of the the challenges for these entrepreneurs who are looking to create a microscope what are some of the major
16:30
roadblocks that you found yeah the biggest one is um how do I get enough interest to
16:38
sustain my micro school um often I'll meet entrepreneurs who say I absolutely want to build something
16:44
that's accessible to my community it's completely affordable so I'm not going to charge any money like okay well but
16:50
you do need to be able to pay rent you need to be able to pay staff or pay yourself so then they start thinking
16:57
about charging uh some sort of a membership fee or a tuition and then all of a sudden it gets really hard to
17:03
convert parents because now there's a cost associated with it and so the hardest thing that we see is
17:09
entrepreneurs will say I got five or six families but I can't run a microscope with only
17:15
five or six families I need more in order to at least break even and so the
17:20
thing that we focus a lot of our efforts on is helping you Market your microscope
17:25
helping you build the awareness in your community so people know there is now a
17:31
high quality learning option a new high quality learning option in their community so that's the biggest place
17:36
where we can help entrepreneurs immediately and then the second place is operations
17:42
which is a general term but it's you know the best picture in your mind is the founder running around with their
17:48
hair on fire there are a million things to do there are a million problems to solve
17:54
um software that doesn't talk to other software or expenses like you don't really want to be spending we can
17:59
streamline a lot of that and I'd love Ben to talk about how we've tried to help them doing that at the Village
18:04
electric but really we're hoping that the processes that we built running our
18:10
own learning pods can now be applied to help others so that you as a Founder you
18:16
focus on what you really want to do which is being with families being students yeah and Ben you said that earlier that
18:22
this partnership with Kai pod has really enabled you and Tammy to do what it is you love to do which is working with the
18:29
students in your program but one of the other motivators for you in creating the village electric was also helping other
18:36
aspiring microscope Founders and education entrepreneurs to incubate their programs and I I recall you saying
18:44
in our conversation in September that uh space is an issue for people who want to
18:50
create one of these programs and that's where you felt like having this established space with the village electric could be one way to remove that
18:58
hurdle so I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about some of the challenges that you find aspiring
19:03
education entrepreneurs encounter perhaps related to space and other startup uh concerns and how you uh seek
19:10
High pod and and other kinds of resources helping that I think you know one of the challenges
19:17
is definitely space like where are you gonna host your micro school do you you
19:22
know and there's a a million things to do just around that how do you negotiate a lease how do you find the right place
19:30
with the right indoor space that you need uh so we've
19:36
and this is where I think we had a similar Vision to Kai pods is you know we we would like to see more
19:42
personalization and more flexibility in education like across you know the
19:48
Spectrum and we'd like to be a part of supporting that so if we can do that by
19:54
providing space and at least making that part of starting a micro School easier
19:59
then you know that takes I think a huge burden off of people wanting to do this
20:05
I think one of the other barriers is just Community you know so a lot of times micro schools are small
20:12
and that I think the scale hurts attracting new families
20:19
um because one of the things that people are looking for is a place for their kids to socialize you know and then
20:24
there's sort of the lure of you know a bigger private school or a public school where there's a lot more families and
20:32
kids their age so I think the other you know barrier we can remove is and and continue on this
20:39
course of flexibility and personalization is by hanging together kind of banding together as different
20:45
micro schools then we'll have that scale we'll have that community but we don't all
20:51
have to be insane so Ben um how what is the status then of
20:57
that vision for the village electric you know the first year that you were running uh your microscope there it was
21:02
really serving the needs of the families in your learning community and then the second year you said let's give back and
21:08
and try to accelerate more of these kinds of programs uh has there been interest from others in the community
21:14
have you been able to support other aspiring entrepreneurs near you
21:20
we have not found any interest right now so um you know I think that it's
21:28
there's the Dual perv there's the Dual sort of like task of running our micro school and also trying to create a
21:34
bigger Community I think the ways that we're doing that is by bringing in other Educators so we haven't brought in like
21:41
other micro schools but we have brought in um someone that will teach dance after
21:48
school or someone that will teach Spanish um and grow the community that way so we
21:54
do have um now offering drama uh dance Spanish
22:00
and acquire so we're building a community
22:06
that way but we're still looking you know for others that want to start their own you know micro school or own program
22:13
and that that can kind of be with us yeah and that's a smart incremental way
22:19
for some um prospective education entrepreneurs to get going you know I hear from a lot of micro School Founders
22:26
who say they started with running an after-school program or a tutoring program or some extracurriculars or a
22:33
summer camp and they kind of built up their confidence and their reputation with that and then ultimately LED that
22:40
led to creating a full-time microscope so it's great that you're being able to support those individual Educators who
22:46
have certain talents that are in demand for your community and then hopefully that leads somewhere for them and so
22:52
Amar maybe that's a good place for you to step in and say you know how do we help get the word out more about the
23:00
possibility of microscopes because I you know sometimes I feel like I'm in my little bubble I think everybody knows
23:05
about microsculles um and and then I'll be surprised with even people who are well versed in
23:11
education and education policy might be unfamiliar with this this whole notion
23:17
of microscope so maybe you could talk a little bit about you know where do you see the momentum for micro schooling
23:23
going and how can we support that more effectively yeah happy too I mean I
23:28
often think about school choice as a concept and how school choice 1.0 was
23:33
you know do you want your public school your private school or maybe even a charter school the unit was the school
23:38
the school scores 2.0 is where you get to choose a lot more pieces of the school experience you can
23:45
choose your curriculum you can choose which days you go you can choose where you go what philosophy you follow
23:51
and so I think when I talk to people who don't understand what a micro school is except small school
23:57
um I say to them you know wouldn't you want to be able to choose more aspects of the learning experience this school
24:04
choice 2.0 concept and the typical say yes and then I say to them but look what's happening in most Traditional
24:10
School environments we're moving towards bigger more centralized buildings where
24:17
there are fewer learning Pathways fewer teachers and just less optionality and
24:23
so it's it's a it's a given that the system that controls too much is going
24:29
to eventually end up losing control and the system that gives Freedom back is the system that's eventually going to
24:35
win so I am grateful to be in this little bubble I am grateful to give families lots of options give them lots
24:41
of choices and enable inspiring entrepreneurs like Ben to create a lot
24:47
more of these options across the country and I think the power will be in our example the power will be in people like
24:53
this who just have dozens of families who Rave about them and so if you're a
24:58
parent of a later school student go Rave about it go tell everyone about the the wonderful experience your child has had
25:07
and how that has transformed their life so Amar you and I both commented
25:13
recently on a new Wall Street Journal article that was out that talked about 1
25:19
million students have left the public schools since the start of the pandemic many not going back and then in that
25:26
article um the reporter talked about how in in many districts this Exodus from district
25:33
schools which has something to do with the pandemic response also demographic changes declining birth rates and so on
25:41
um but that this is leading to consolidation of public schools into larger Public Schools sort of the
25:49
opposite trend of the microscope movement where families are are generally demanding smaller more
25:55
personalized learning environments you know I wonder your thoughts on on where that's headed you know if we're kind of
26:00
heading in these two opposite directions what parents want versus what the the public schools are are doing in response
26:07
to them leaving you know how is that going to play out there's a really good lesson from Jeff Bezos here where in one
26:13
of his first letters about Amazon people were asking him how can you
26:19
predict the future what's going to happen with internet or e-shopping and
26:24
he said something to the effective I cannot predict the future but I do know whatever it is people are going to want
26:31
it faster and cheaper and so he invested a lot of Amazon's
26:36
time on making things faster and cheaper I think a similar principle applies in education we don't know what's going to
26:43
happen with technology with culture wars or whatever else but we do know people are going to want
26:51
things that are more flexible smaller more convenient no one's going to want a
26:56
bigger School building that's farther from their house I'm sorry this is not going to happen so why invest in that
27:02
system let's focus on investing in a system that we do know people are going to want and make that system better
27:09
so true and Ben you're really on The Cutting Edge of creating that with the village electric that you created really
27:16
in response to your own children's needs you wanted to provide them with a really
27:21
highly personalized education environment I wonder if you can talk about where the village electric is now into your second year
27:29
roughly six months since we last spoke how is the program doing that you've
27:34
built what is the response that you are getting from the families in your community
27:41
well we are focusing on very you know personalized and flexible education
27:48
so um and you know taking into account um
27:54
every child and and each child like loving learning and you know growing up
28:00
and being ready to engage with the world and sort of make their own unique contribution so that really drives
28:07
everything that we do at the Village electric starting from you know three years old up to 12 and hopefully soon
28:15
Beyond into middle school and in even height
28:21
um so we're focusing on that on our curriculum and and making that
28:27
that experience the best for for each child
28:33
um and you know I think that that's where uh Kai pods is helping us
28:40
so where is this all annoying do you think uh been in New Jersey and then Omar kind of nationally as you think
28:47
about Catalyst and Kai pod across the U.S you know Ben what are you seeing in New Jersey New Jersey does not have uh
28:55
school choice policies but it does have among uh the easiest homeschooling
29:00
regulations in the country so a lot of innovation coming out of homeschoolers gathering together to create learning
29:06
pods that often turn into micro schools but where do you see education going especially alternative models in your
29:13
state uh I agree with Amar on that I mean I
29:19
think you know this trend of wanting more flexible more personalized learning is gonna continue I think we're seeing
29:27
that in the way that people work that the types of jobs they have and how they're
29:32
working more from home they're demanding more flexible um work environments where they can work
29:38
some days from home and some days in the office I I think that trend is going to
29:44
accelerate and parents so from what I've seen
29:50
um there are a lot of differences in what parents are looking for having met many parents and talked to to many
29:56
parents they each come from a unique perspective unique background of what
30:04
they're looking for what they're what they they feel is best for their child the type of education that they sort of
30:10
Imagine or want from their child there is a lot of variation and
30:17
in a school like ours um or you know a Learning Center like ours we're able to offer that and so we see
30:25
that actually there's there's like an ex an explosion of interest in those
30:30
different options and choice in a public school and even a private
30:35
school I don't think you get to exercise that at all as a parent you're basically
30:41
required to kind of conform to whatever the curriculum and the standards happen to be at that place
30:49
so when people really wake up to that I think that's like an eye-opening moment you know wow there is a lot of of ways
30:57
that education can happen and I can be very involved in that as a parent and
31:02
um I can kind of personalize to the type the education to the type of child that I have and how they learn
31:09
so I think that's going to happen more and more I mean I think there's a lot of disappointment you know now with sort of
31:17
traditional schooling methods um whether it be
31:23
um the the children are frustrated or their children are struggling or the children are not loving learning
31:29
um and I think there's going to continue to be a shift to sort of recognizing that it doesn't have to be that way
31:36
um and like I said we're seeing that in kind of other areas of our life even from you know companies like Amazon
31:42
where you can get what you want like the next day or the same day um I
31:48
think we're going to start to expect that uh more from our education system
31:53
um and and that's where um it's happening sort of at different rates in different places around the
31:59
country um but I just feel like that's a trend that's going to accelerate and um people
32:06
are going to um be looking for more options and also
32:11
be open to even knowing that there are other options you know and and yeah and
32:19
that they can build the options if they're not there right so if they can't find what they're looking for they can
32:24
uh go ahead and create it I like your point around it sort of responsive education right that we have
32:31
um in other areas of our lives so much consumer choice so much responsiveness to our demands and wants and we don't
32:39
have that right now in conventional education Mass education so that these more Nimble more agile more creative
32:45
models can help to provide that for families and once families realize that's a possibility uh my suspicion is
32:52
that more and more of them will choose that and then thanks to programs like Catalyst Amar they'll have a place to go
32:58
when they ultimately discover that there are so many of these options I wonder if you can talk a little bit about what you
33:04
see as the future of Education in this country and then how do you see Catalyst and Kai pod uh helping to bring in that
33:11
future absolutely yeah I think you know without predicting the feature as Jack Bezos caution does not to do
33:17
um I think the the some of the forecasts in this space are that 5 million
33:22
families are going to be interested in Alternatives like micro schooling online learning homeschooling in the next five
33:29
years and if we hit that number that means there will be more people interested in these Alternatives than
33:34
there are in charter schools or there are in private schools that is a massive Groundswell of Interest
33:41
however that is it's a lot scarier to homeschool your child than it is to maybe send them to a local reps right
33:47
assuming you can afford it so there's a an effort that's required that a lot of parents can be turned off by or scared
33:55
of and so what we're trying to do is make it easier to opt into these Alternatives we want to make it easier
34:01
for you to find the village electric where your child can be homeschooled but have community in person in their
34:07
Learning Center and what we often find is that when we're entering communities or even in our first year of operations
34:14
the first segment of families we talk to are existing homeschoolers or existing
34:21
online because they've already sort of made that decision and now that physical space becomes an add-on
34:28
but then in our second year we've noticed there are now more and more families who are saying I think I'm done
34:34
with my Traditional School I think I want to build something on my own and that's that 5 million that's that
34:40
segment of all of these wonderful new entrants who who want to be part of the
34:45
creation of education and so the more of those that happen then you start to see pressure on States and pressure on
34:51
districts to sort of loosen that grip to allow these families to choose what is right for them and support them in that
34:58
Journey that's when this whole sector just Escape gets escape velocity and it
35:04
really becomes what it's aspiring to be well I'll take that non-prediction I
35:10
like that 5 million number I uh I I think you know right now we already have
35:15
parity in the U.S between the number of uh homeschooled students and number
35:20
charter school students so we already see that and then if we can add to that over the next several years several more
35:27
million students who are choosing a microschooling environment specifically um you're right I think that is escape
35:33
velocity and and then it really is this Tipping Point where we're families mostly are aware at that point of
35:40
various options um Beyond an assigned District school we already see some of that happening in
35:46
states that have long had robust school choice policies that enable education dollars to follow students instead of
35:53
going to school systems especially in Arizona that's had a long history of that there is a culture of Education
36:00
Choice there that parents know that they do have options Beyond an assigned District school and Kai pod is one of
36:07
them you're now in Arizona with some pods there so being really a part of that Marketplace of opportunities for
36:14
families so Amar if my listeners and viewers are interested in what you've
