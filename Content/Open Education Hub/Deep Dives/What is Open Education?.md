# The End of All-or-Nothing: Why You Don't Have to Choose Between Public, Private, or Homeschool Anymore

For the past several weeks, our deep dives have been exploring some of the most popular .

We've explored the structured wisdom of [Classical education](https://opened.co/open-education/classical-education), the child-led wonder of [Montessori](https://opened.co/open-education/montessori), and the boundless potential of [virtual learning](https://opened.co/open-education/virtual-school).

And we’ve only scratched the surface! In the coming months, we’ll look at Charlotte Mason, Waldorf, Unschooling, Wild+Free, and others.

Why explore all these different educational philosophies and approaches?

We think that each one has something to offer. Fortunately, you don't have to pick just one anymore. Embracing an open education allows you to reject all-or-nothing choices and take what works.

If you’ve read Matt & Isaac’s book, Open Education, this week’s deep dive may already be familiar.

But as I’ve been exploring the diverse modalities over the past few months (and also started homeschooling my oldest, who’s five), it’s occurred to me that <something about how it’s not just about rejecting old labels, but actually understanding why those labels existed, and what we can learn from them, so we can appreciate the best that each one has to offer our kids at different stages>

## The Binary That Trapped Us

For generations, families faced an impossible choice: traditional school or homeschool. Public or private. All in or all out.

Each option came with trade-offs:

Choose private school, and pay handsomely in tuition.

Choose traditional school and sacrifice flexibility, personalization, and family time.

Choose homeschool and sacrifice peer interaction, specialized instruction, and career flexibility.

The binary (trinary?) forced impossible compromises.

A mother in our community described it this way: "For three years, I agonized. My daughter was miserable at school—the pace was wrong, the environment was overwhelming, she was losing her love of learning. But I worked full-time. How could I homeschool? Finally, I quit my job and brought her home. It was better, but now I was overwhelmed and isolated. Why did it have to be all or nothing?"

She asked the question we should have been asking all along: Why does it have to be all or nothing?

The answer, increasingly, is that it doesn't.

The same binary plays out within homeschooling families. Once you chose to educate at home, you’re faced with yet another (false) choice: Which curriculum or philosophy should I adopt? Classical or Charlotte Mason? Montessori or unschooling?

On the one hand, these methods function as mental shortcuts. Once you find the system <or something a trusted influencer> that aligns with your values, you don’t have to agonize over every decision. <I want to emphasize that there's something to be said for this approach. It’s a bit like copying your sports-obsessed co-worker’s NCAA bracket… You’re probably going to do better than average>

But unlike the office betting pool, where you might have no special expertise, as a parent you do have something that no educaitonal guru or expert or influencer has. You know your kids better than anyone, and you care most.

You might be committed to Classical education, but find that your child has a gift for <some technical subject or something outside of classical education>.

You could be convinced of the Montessori method on most things, but adopt a structured phonics approach <if your kid fails to learn to read using their methods.. something liek this.>

The point is this: you shouldn’t feel pressured to do anything for the sake of internal consistency.

## The Great Unbundling is Here <let’s use different language and title - instead talk about the 200 year trap>

<shorten>

So why is this changing now?

We are living through what Matt Bowman and Isaac Morehouse call, in their book [_Open Education_](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Education-Matt-Bowman-ebook/dp/B0CK24823J), the "Great Unbundling" of education. For a century, school was a monolithic bundle. It was where you learned, where you socialized, where you played sports, where you got childcare. It was a one-stop-shop designed for industrial-age efficiency.

The pandemic didn't start the unbundling, but it accelerated it dramatically. For the first time, millions of parents saw the component parts of education up close. They realized they could get better math instruction from Khan Academy, more engaging history lessons from an Outschool specialist, richer social interaction from a local sports team, and individualized support through tutoring.

The components could be separated. The bundle could be customized.

This shift goes beyond logistics—it represents a fundamental change in how we think about education itself. The conversation has moved from "school choice" to what Bowman and Morehouse call "experience choice." The question is no longer which single institution you will enroll in, but how you will compose a life of learning from a universe of options.

As Bowman and Morehouse write in _Open Education_:

> "We raised our children in the same home with the same routines and same expectations... yet it was clear that each child had their own unique set of needs and wants. If two parents raising five children in the same way resulted in very different pathways for each child, how could a standardized public education system offer a personalized learning journey for millions of children? Spoiler alert: It can't, at least not alone."

The same logic applies whether you're in public school, private school, or homeschooling. No single system can perfectly serve every child, or even the same child at every stage of development.

Isaac Morehouse shares his own family's journey in the book—a story that illustrates this perfectly:

> "Over the years, we had them in homeschool tutorials and co-ops, various at-home and online curricula, a twice-a-week microschool, a part-time Waldorf school, and every variation in between. Our oldest wanted to go to a public high school one year, so we let him. He decided not to go back the next year and instead to work full time, so we let him... The real lesson is that it's not about us, the parents. It's not about what I think sounds good or makes me look good. It's about what best helps my kids."

This is the heart of the matter. Adaptation isn't failure. Changing approaches isn't weakness. Mixing systems and philosophies isn't confusion. The goal is to build the right combination for your family, right now, with the courage to change it when it stops working.

## You Can Keep Your Identity <

<merge with next section under one hueader>

Her transcript shows community college courses, but her education is happening everywhere.

Identifying with open education doesn't mean abandoning any educational philosophies you love. If you're a committed Classical family, you can stay a Classical family. If Montessori principles guide your choices, keep them. If Charlotte Mason's approach resonates deeply, follow it.

<However, instead of rigid formulas, treat them as flexible templates>

You have permission to take what works from anywhere. You have permission to change your approach when circumstances change. You have permission to combine the seemingly incompatible. You have permission to enroll in the public school for band and athletics while homeschooling academics. You have permission to love Classical education while using adaptive math software.

<dramatically shorten> - 3 quick profiles, in paragraph format

A Classical education family can:

- Use Classical Conversations for community and memory work
- Hire a Latin tutor for specialized instruction
- Take science classes at the public school
- Join a homeschool co-op for history discussions
- Use adaptive software for math when needed

They remain Classical in philosophy while drawing resources from multiple systems.

A Charlotte Mason family can:

- Follow living books and nature study principles
- Enroll children in public school for arts or athletics
- Use online platforms for subjects they're less comfortable teaching
- Join nature study groups with other families
- Maintain short lessons and narration at home

The philosophy guides their choices. But the philosophy doesn't limit them to one system.

Let me show you what this unbundling means in practice with real examples:

**The student who:**

- Takes advanced math at the local public school (free, excellent teacher)
- Learns Latin through Classical Conversations (community + rigor)
- Does science experiments at a maker space (hands-on learning)
- Plays volleyball on the school team (athletics + friendships)
- Studies literature at home with beautiful living books

Is this public school? Homeschool? Classical education? The answer: it's all of them. And it works.

**The family who:**

- Enrolls in a Montessori microschool three days a week
- Uses Charlotte Mason nature study methods on Thursdays
- Takes online coding classes on Fridays
- Participates in public school music programs
- Maintains a clear Montessori identity while mixing freely

They haven't abandoned Montessori—they love Montessori. They've simply stopped viewing it as all-or-nothing.

**The high schooler who:**

- Takes dual enrollment classes at community college
- Participates in weekly Great Books seminars (classical approach)
- Apprentices with a local business three afternoons a week
- Works with a hired writing tutor
- Builds a real portfolio while preparing for college

You have permission to trust what you see working with your actual child more than what any single system says _should_ work.

## The Role of the Educational Architect

<shorten dramatically>

If we are no longer forced into all-or-nothing choices, what are we?

We are curators. Architects. Designers.

This role is infinitely more creative and, in many ways, less burdensome. The pressure to be the teacher of every subject—to be an expert in Latin, calculus, and chemistry—is lifted. Instead, your job is to be the chief curator of your child's educational life. You are the one who knows them best. Your expertise isn't in every academic subject; it's in your child.

What does Tuesday actually look like?

- Morning at the kitchen table with Montessori Golden Beads for math
- Mid-morning at the local public school for band practice
- Lunch at home, then outside for a Charlotte Mason-style nature walk
- Afternoon online class with other students for literature discussion
- Evening working on a passion project (completely child-led)

Is this Montessori? Charlotte Mason? Public school? Unschooling?

Yes. All of them. None of them exclusively. And that's exactly the point.

Being an educational architect requires three things:

**First, knowledge.** You can't curate what you don't know exists. You need to understand the landscape—what Classical education offers, what Montessori provides, what makes Charlotte Mason unique, what virtual schools can deliver, how microschools work, what public schools provide.

This is why we've been writing this series. This is why we built the [Open Education hub](https://opened.co/open-education) with deep dives into each approach. We're mapping the territory so you can navigate it confidently.

**Second, resources.** Customization can feel expensive.

This is precisely why educational freedom has traditionally been a privilege of the wealthy. Most families are forced back into the free option (traditional school only) or the economical option (complete homeschool curriculum only), neither of which may serve their child optimally.

**Third, community.** When you're mixing approaches, who do you talk to? If you're not exclusively "a Classical family" or "a public school family," where do you belong? How do you know if you're making the right choices?

These three barriers—knowledge, resources, and community—are what stand between the philosophy of open education and its practical reality for most families.

<combine with the previous section>

Now comes the practical part: designing your child's education.

Start by visiting the [Open Education hub](https://opened.co/open-education). Explore each approach. Notice what resonates. Imagine what you might build.

If you're in one of our partner states (Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Oregon, or Utah), [apply to OpenEd](https://opened.co/apply) and let us help you fund the approach you design.

If you're not in a partner state yet, check out the OpenEd Academy.

The era of all-or-nothing is ending. The era of the educational architect is beginning.

Your child's education is waiting to be designed. And you're exactly the right person to design it.

<figure out where to insert a short version of this… And add that the OpenEd Daily is your guide>

## Why OpenEd Exists

If "open education" is the philosophy, then **OpenEd is the infrastructure that makes it accessible to everyone.**

**We solve the knowledge problem** through resources like the [OpenEd Marketplace](https://opened.co/marketplace)—a curated collection of vetted curricula and educational resources. We're not showing you everything that exists (that would be paralyzing). We're showing you the best options within each category.

This deep-dive series extends that mission. We're mapping the landscape so you can confidently borrow from any tradition. Take Classical logic training, Montessori math materials, Charlotte Mason nature study, and modern adaptive technology. Build something unique that serves your actual child.

**We solve the resources problem** through partnerships with public charter schools. OpenEd provides funding for curriculum, classes, tutors, materials, and programs. That Montessori microschool you've been eyeing? The Classical Conversations enrollment? The online coding courses? The private Latin tutor? With OpenEd, they're covered.

This isn't a luxury service for the wealthy. We make educational freedom accessible to families regardless of income. The right to customize your child's education shouldn't depend on your bank account.

**We solve the community problem** by connecting families on similar journeys. When you're mixing approaches, you need other parents who understand you haven't lost your mind—you've found a better way. When you're navigating multiple schedules across different programs, you need people who've been there.

OpenEd families aren't isolated. They're part of a network of educational architects, all building unique experiences for their children, all supporting each other.

For the past several weeks, we’ve been taking you on a journey. We’ve explored the structured wisdom of [Classical education](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://opened.co/open-education/classical-education), the child-led wonder of [Montessori](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://opened.co/open-education/montessori), the bespoke communities of [microschooling](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://opened.co/open-education/microschools), and the boundless potential of [virtual learning](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://opened.co/open-education/virtual-school).

But it’s time to step back and ask a fundamental question: Why?

Why explore all these different, seemingly competing educational philosophies?

The answer is simple: we believe the time for choosing a single, rigid educational identity is over. The future of education doesn't belong to the purists. It belongs to the mixers, the blenders, the curators. It belongs to the families who have the courage to say, "My child is not a label."

### The Great Sorting Hat of Homeschooling

For years, the world of alternative education has operated a bit like the Hogwarts Sorting Hat. Upon entering, you were expected to declare your allegiance. "I'm a Charlotte Mason homeschooler," one parent would say at the park. "We're unschoolers," another would declare at the co-op. Each label came with a set of sacred texts, approved curricula, and unwritten rules.

You used "living books," but did you also enforce short lessons? You valued child-led learning, but were you dogmatic about eschewing a math curriculum? A strange kind of pressure mounted—not from the outside world, but from within these well-meaning communities. The message, however subtle, was clear: pick a team and be loyal. To deviate was to fail.

A friend recently recounted a story. She was part of a beautiful, nature-based Charlotte Mason co-op. Her family spent mornings on nature walks and afternoons reading classic literature aloud. But her son was struggling with math. After months of trying to make a "living math" approach work, she quietly bought a subscription to a straightforward, drill-based online math program. And it worked. Her son, finally getting the structure he needed, began to thrive. But for weeks, she felt a pang of guilt, as if she had betrayed her chosen philosophy.

This quiet guilt is a story we’ve heard countless times. It’s the product of a world that forced parents into a false choice: ideological purity or your child’s actual needs.

As Matt Bowman and Isaac Morehouse write in their book, [_Open Education_](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.amazon.com/Open-Education-Matt-Bowman-ebook/dp/B0CK24823J), this model was built on a flawed premise. They observe:

> "We raised our children in the same home with the same routines and same expectations... yet it was clear that each child had their own unique set of needs and wants. If two parents raising five children in the same way resulted in very different pathways for each child, how could a standardized public education system offer a personalized learning journey for millions of children? Spoiler alert: It can’t, at least not alone."

The same logic applies to any single educational philosophy. No matter how brilliant, no single "ism" can perfectly serve every child, or even the same child, at every stage of their development. The pressure to conform wasn't just stressful; it was fundamentally at odds with the very reason many of us chose this path: to honor the uniqueness of our kids.

### The Great Unbundling is Here

So why is this changing _now_? We are living through what Bowman and Morehouse call the "Great Unbundling" of education. For a century, school was a monolithic bundle. It was where you learned, where you socialized, where you played sports, where you got childcare. It was a one-stop-shop.

The pandemic didn't start the unbundling, but it accelerated it at warp speed. For the first time, millions of parents saw the component parts of education up close, and they began to question the package deal. They realized they could get a better math education from [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), a more engaging history lesson from an [Outschool](https://outschool.com/) class, and a richer social life from a local microschool.

The conversation has shifted from "school choice" to what the _Open Education_ book calls "experience choice." The question is no longer which single institution you will enroll in, but how you will compose a life of learning from a universe of options.

This requires a radical shift in mindset, one that embraces adaptation as the ultimate goal. Isaac Morehouse shares his own family's journey in the book, a story that should be required reading for any parent who has ever felt like they were "doing it wrong":

> "Over the years, we had them in homeschool tutorials and co-ops, various at-home and online curricula, a twice-a-week microschool, a part-time Waldorf school, and every variation in between. Our oldest wanted to go to a public high school one year, so we let him. He decided not to go back the next year and instead to work full time, so we let him... The real lesson is that it’s not about us, the parents. It’s not about what I think sounds good or makes me look good. It’s about what best helps my kids."

This is the heart of the matter. Adaptation isn't failure. It's the entire point. The goal is not to find the perfect philosophy and stick to it forever. The goal is to build the right combination for your family, right now, with the courage to change it when it stops working.

### The Rise of the Educational Architect

If we are no longer rigid followers of a single dogma, what are we?

We are curators. Architects. Designers.

This new role is infinitely more creative and, in many ways, less burdensome. The pressure to _be_ the teacher of every subject—to be an expert in Latin, calculus, and grammar—is lifted. Instead, your job is to be the chief curator of your child's educational life. You are the one who knows them best. Your expertise is not in pedagogy; it is in your child.

What does this look like on a Tuesday morning?

- It looks like using beautiful Montessori Golden Beads for math on the living room floor, then heading outside for a Charlotte Mason-style nature walk.
- It looks like joining a Classical Conversations community for memory work and accountability, then coming home to work on a passion-led, unschooling-style project.
- It looks like enrolling in a three-day-a-week microschool for its strong community, then using the other two days for virtual classes and deep dives into personal interests.

There is a name for this mindset. It’s **Open Education**. It’s not another "ism" to be sorted into. It is a philosophy of freedom, built on a few foundational principles: that parents know their children best, that education should adapt to the child, that learning is naturally joyful, and that real preparation for life beats test preparation every time.

### The Engine for the Philosophy

This all sounds wonderful. Inspiring, even. But for most families, it also sounds expensive and overwhelming. A bespoke education seems like a luxury reserved for the wealthy. And how does one even begin to navigate the "paradox of choice" in a world with infinite options?

This is why we are publishing this series. And it is, frankly, why OpenEd exists.

If "open education" is the philosophy, then **OpenEd is the engine that makes it practical for everyone.** We solve the two biggest problems that stand in the way of true educational freedom: funding and overwhelm.

**First, we provide the funding.** Through our partnerships with public schools, we make it possible for families to access the best educational resources, regardless of their income. That online math curriculum that finally made sense for your son? The beautiful Montessori materials you’ve been eyeing? The tuition for that amazing local microschool? With OpenEd, they are covered. We believe educational freedom shouldn't be a privilege.

**Second, we help you navigate the choices.** The sheer number of options can be paralyzing. That's why we built the [**OpenEd Marketplace**](https://opened.co/marketplace)—a curated collection of the best curricula and resources, vetted and reviewed by our community. It’s not about showing you everything; it’s about showing you the best things.

This series of deep dives is an extension of that mission. We are mapping the landscape for you. We are exploring the great traditions of learning not so you will pick one, but so you will feel empowered to borrow from them all. You can take the classical model’s rigor in logic, Montessori’s genius in early math, Charlotte Mason’s love of nature, and the unschooling movement’s profound trust in the child. You can build something new, something unique, something that is perfectly tailored to the human being in front of you.

The goal, in the end, is not to raise a perfect "classical student" or a perfect "Montessori child." The goal is to raise a child who loves to learn, who knows how to think, and who has the confidence and agency to build a meaningful life.

That is the promise of an open education. And it is a promise that is, for the first time, available to us all.
