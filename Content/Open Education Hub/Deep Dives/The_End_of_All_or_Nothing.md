#### Option 1: Category Creation Frame (RECOMMENDED)

```
For 200 years, education was a binary choice:

Traditional school or homeschool.
Public or private. 
All in or all out.

But something shifted.

Just as Netflix unbundled cable and let you choose what to watch when you wanted...

And Spotify unbundled albums and let you create your own playlists...

Families are now unbundling education and rebuilding it around their children.

Here's what's actually happening on the ground:

A student takes advanced math at the public school (excellent teacher, free access), learns Latin through an online academy, does science experiments at a maker space, plays volleyball on the school team, and studies literature at home.

Is this public school? Homeschool? Classical education? Online learning?

The answer: it's all of them.

The question changed from "Which institution should I choose?" to "What does my child need right now, and where can I find it?"

This isn't about rejecting any approach. It's about permission to take what works.

Your child struggling with reading using one method? That's not failure of commitment. It's information. Add what works while keeping everything else you love.

The goal was never ideological purity. The goal is raising humans who love learning, think clearly, and can build meaningful lives.

We're living through category creation in real time. Not because of top-down policy changes, but because parents are discovering they can architect something better than any single institution offers.

The era of all-or-nothing is ending.
The era of the educational architect is beginning.

#### Option 2: The 35/65 Math Frame

```
Here's the math everyone ignores:

Your child spends roughly 1,260 hours per year in school.

That's 35% of their potential learning time.

The other 2,390 hours—65%—happen under your supervision, whether you planned for it or not.

Yet we act like that 35% defines everything.

We agonize over which box to check. We feel trapped by the choice. And once we make it, changing course feels like failure.

But what if the binary choice was the problem all along?

What if you could take advanced math from the public school (excellent teacher, free access), Latin from an online academy, science from a maker space, athletics from the school team, and literature from home?

What if "educational architect" was a more accurate description of your role than "homeschool parent" or "public school parent"?

As Matt Bowman and Isaac Morehouse write in Open Education:

"If two parents raising five children in the same way resulted in very different pathways for each child, how could a standardized public education system offer a personalized learning journey for millions of children?"

The infrastructure for personalized learning is here.
The permission to use it is spreading.

Your child's education is waiting to be designed.
And you're exactly the right person to design it.

#### Option 3: Permission Frame

```
The permission you're looking for:

You can trust what you see working with your actual child more than what any system says *should* work.

Your child struggling with reading using the Montessori approach? That's not a failure of your commitment to Montessori. It's information. You can add structured phonics while keeping everything else you love.

Your classically-educated daughter showing zero interest in Latin but deep fascination with coding? That's not a problem to fix. It's a signal to follow.

For generations, we forced families into impossible binaries:
- Traditional school or homeschool
- Public or private
- All in or all out

But something shifted. Parents stopped asking "Which institution should I choose?" and started asking "What does my child need right now, and where can I find it?"

Real examples of what this looks like:

→ A family enrolls in a Montessori microschool three mornings a week, uses Charlotte Mason nature study on Thursdays, takes online coding classes on Fridays, and participates in public school music programs. They haven't abandoned Montessori—they've stopped viewing it as all-or-nothing.

→ A high schooler takes dual enrollment at community college, participates in weekly Great Books seminars, apprentices with a local architecture firm three afternoons a week, and works with a writing tutor for college prep. Her transcript shows community college courses, but her education is happening everywhere.

This is category creation in real time.

Just as Netflix unbundled cable and Spotify unbundled albums, families are unbundling education and rebuilding it around their children.

The era of all-or-nothing is ending.
The era of the educational architect is beginning.

For three years, I agonized.

My daughter was miserable at school—the pace was wrong, the environment was overwhelming, she was losing her love of learning.

But I worked full-time. How could I homeschool?

Finally, I quit my job and brought her home. It was better, but now I was overwhelmed and isolated.

Why did it have to be all or nothing?

Turns out... it doesn't. 🤯

What if you could mix public school math, online Latin classes, a microschool for science, homeschool for literature, and the school volleyball team—all in one week?

The era of the educational architect is here.

#### Option 2: Heavy-Hitting Stat

```
Your child spends 35% of their time in school.

The other 65% happens under your supervision—whether you planned for it or not.

Yet we act like that 35% defines everything.

What if the binary choice (public vs. private vs. homeschool) was the problem all along?

What if you could be the architect instead of just picking a box?

#### Option 3: Direct Hook

```
The time for choosing a single, rigid educational identity is over.

You don't have to be "a homeschool family" or "a public school family" or "a Classical family."

You can take what works from everywhere and build something unique for your child.

Isaac Morehouse once described his family's educational journey this way: "Over the years, we had them in homeschool tutorials and co-ops, various at-home and online curricula, a twice-a-week microschool, a part-time Waldorf school, and every variation in between. Our oldest wanted to go to a public high school one year, so we let him. He decided not to go back the next year and instead to work full time, so we let him."

Now imagine someone at a dinner party asks Isaac the standard question: "So, what kind of education do your kids do?"

What's the one-word answer? Homeschool? No, there was public high school in there. And Waldorf. Public school? No, mostly home-based. Waldorf? Only part-time. Unschooling? There were structured curricula too.

There isn't a word for what Isaac's family did. And that's not because they were confused or uncommitted or doing it wrong. It's because we're trying to compress something multidimensional into a single-choice question.

The compression is the problem.

We've been asking the wrong question for 200 years. "Which institution?" "Which philosophy?" "Which method?" As if education is a multiple-choice test where you pick A, B, C, or D and live with everything that comes with that letter.

But education isn't a single choice. It's a design problem. And most families—especially families with multiple kids, or kids with special needs, or kids who don't fit neatly into institutional boxes—are already designing. They're already mixing and matching. They're already pulling from multiple sources.

They just don't have language for it. Or infrastructure supporting it. Or permission to admit it without sounding like they're making excuses.

Matt Bowman, who co-founded OpenEd and wrote the book *Open Education*, describes it this way: "We raised our children in the same home with the same routines and same expectations... yet it was clear that each child had their own unique set of needs and wants. If two parents raising five children in the same way resulted in very different pathways for each child, how could a standardized public education system offer a personalized learning journey for millions of children?"

Spoiler alert: It can't. Not alone, anyway.

But here's where it gets interesting: The same logic applies to *any* single approach. Traditional public school can't serve every child. Neither can private school. Neither can any single homeschool philosophy, no matter how brilliant or time-tested.

No single system can perfectly serve every child, or even the same child at every stage of their development. This isn't a controversial claim. Every parent knows it's true. We see it with our own eyes. Our kids are different from each other. They're different year to year. Sometimes they need structure. Sometimes they need space. Sometimes they thrive in groups. Sometimes they need to be alone.

Yet we keep pretending the answer is to find the One Right Institution or the One Right Method and stick with it. We compress reality into a single choice, then beat ourselves up when it doesn't quite fit.

Here's the math that makes this compression even more absurd: Your child spends roughly 1,260 hours per year in school. That's 35% of their waking time. The other 65%—2,390 hours—happens under your supervision, whether you planned for it or not.

Yet we treat that 35% like it's the whole game. We agonize over which institution to choose, which box to check, as if that one decision determines the entire shape of their intellectual and emotional development. And once we make the choice? Changing course feels like failure. Like we got it wrong. Like we're failing our kids by not figuring out how to make it work.

But what if the failure isn't yours? What if the failure is the compression itself? What if the failure is asking a multidimensional design question and only accepting single-choice answers?

## The False Solutions (Pick Your Sacrifice)

For generations, families faced impossible trade-offs:

**Choose traditional school →** Structure and social connection, but sacrifice flexibility when your child's needs don't match the pace or approach.

**Choose private school →** Better philosophy, stronger community, but $8,000-15,000 annually for one approach that still might not fit.

**Choose full homeschool →** Complete control over curriculum and pace, but sacrifice career flexibility, expertise in all subjects, and often do it completely alone.

Each option worked beautifully for *some* families. But you couldn't take the best of one and blend it with the strengths of another.

**You picked your box and lived with everything that came with it.**

As Matt Bowman and Isaac Morehouse write in [*Open Education*](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Education-Matt-Bowman-ebook/dp/B0CK24823J):

> "We raised our children in the same home with the same routines and same expectations... yet it was clear that each child had their own unique set of needs and wants. If two parents raising five children in the same way resulted in very different pathways for each child, how could a standardized public education system offer a personalized learning journey for millions of children? Spoiler alert: It can't, at least not alone."

The same logic applies to any single educational approach. No matter how brilliant, **no single system can perfectly serve every child, or even the same child at every stage of development.**

## What Actually Changed

Why is this shifting now after 200 years of the same model?

Education innovation expert Michael Horn explains: "You're not just throwing over your own family's decision, which is fraught with emotion and social pressure, but also the expectations of your family members—grandparents, cousins—what are you doing? Neighbors. But also employers, colleges. Schools sit in this very complicated ecosystem."

**Systems disrupt systems.** Major transformation happens when a whole new system replaces the existing one, not when individuals slowly change their minds one at a time.

COVID broke something open.

For the first time, millions of parents saw the component parts of education up close. They realized they could get better math instruction from [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), more engaging history from [Outschool](https://outschool.com/), social connection from local co-ops, athletics from the public school.

**The components could be separated. The bundle could be customized.**

The question changed:
- **Old:** "Which institution should I choose?"
- **New:** "What does my child need right now, and where can I find it?"

Just as Netflix unbundled cable and Spotify unbundled albums, families started unbundling education.

But there was still a problem: **Customization felt expensive and overwhelming.**

How do you afford tutors, programs, curricula, and specialized classes while keeping your job? How do you know what to choose? How do you avoid drowning in decision paralysis?

Three barriers remained: **Knowledge. Resources. Community.**

---

## The First System Built for Flexibility

What if an education system was designed for infinite variety from the ground up?

Not "pick your track" flexibility. True flexibility:

**For the working parent who wants to personalize but can't quit their job →** Access quality resources without sacrificing career

**For the child who's ahead →** Move forward without being held back by age-based grouping

**For the child who needs more time →** Get what they need without the shame of "falling behind"

**For special needs →** Adapt everything to medical realities, sensory needs, learning differences

**For the multi-child household →** Different approaches for different kids, all supported

**For families who love Classical education... mostly →** Keep the Great Books and Latin, add adaptive math when needed, join volleyball at school

This is why OpenEd became the **#1 most loved homeschool program in America.**

Not by being slightly better at one thing. But by solving for **infinite variety.**

## What This Actually Looks Like

Real families, real examples:

**The 2e student (gifted + ADHD):**
*"My son had a very rough time in public school. He's 2e: gifted and ADHD. OpenEd is perfect for him. He can craft his own curriculum under parental supervision and the contact with his teacher is a no-pressure situation. While public school is good for the average child, this is perfect for those who have different needs."*

**The autism family:**
*"My child is on the autism spectrum—she's unable to go to a full day of school due to sensory processing disorder and anxiety. OpenEd enabled her to learn at home with reimbursed materials while still taking two classes at the high school. She's a contributing member of the orchestra."*

**The working parents:**
*"My husband and I work from home. Teaching our children at home allows us to have flexible schedules where we can work around other hobbies and desires."*

**The child who moved from behind to ahead:**
*"Since we pulled her out, she's gotten ahead in subjects she's interested in, even with less handholding from me. They're not being held back anymore."*

**The medical needs family:**
*"My daughter was diagnosed with a life-threatening chronic health condition at age 3. This disease requires us to wake up multiple times in the night, leaving us exhausted. Thanks to OpenEd we could start school later in the day. At 16, she's completed 98 college credits through early college options."*

What do these families have in common?

**Radically different needs. Same solution. Because the system bends to them, not vice versa.**

---

## How It Actually Works

**The Three Barriers, Solved:**

**Barrier 1: Knowledge**
*"What curricula exist? What works for kids like mine?"*

→ **Solved** through curated resources, homeroom teacher guidance, and a thriving community of parents sharing what works.

One parent: *"I love having access to a certified teacher who's always willing to help, support, and give suggestions. And I actually love having someone to be accountable to."*

**Barrier 2: Resources**  
*"I can't afford to quit my job AND pay for quality curriculum, tutors, and programs."*

→ **Solved** through partnerships with innovative public schools that fund your choices.

Parent testimonial: *"Without the funding provided by OpenEd, we would not be able to give our children the quality of education we deserve and desire for them."*

Another: *"OpenEd has made it possible for us to homeschool and apply the funds to things that are required AND things my children enjoy."*

**Barrier 3: Community**
*"I'm doing this alone. Who do I talk to? How do I know I'm making good choices?"*

→ **Solved** through teacher support, parent community, and accountability without judgment.

A parent describes the shift: *"We've seen a huge increase in curriculum and classes over the four years we've been here. OpenEd is genuinely invested in finding great curriculum. They recognize different kids need different things. I love the diversity."*

---

## The New Role: Educational Architect

You're no longer the overwhelmed teacher trying to master every subject. You're the architect of your child's learning.

**Your expertise isn't in Latin, calculus, and chemistry. Your expertise is in your child.**

You know what lights them up and what shuts them down. You see when they're thriving and when they're just going through the motions.

One parent put it perfectly: *"As long as they're making steady progress, it's okay if they're in one grade in one subject and different in another. It's about where they're at and catering to their needs in each individual subject."*

Another: *"I can customize each child's education to their needs. I have no doubt my children will go on to successful post-high-school endeavors."*

**The permission you're looking for:** You can trust what you see working with your actual child more than what any system says *should* work.

Your child struggling with one method? That's not failure—it's information. Add what works while keeping what you love.

The goal was never ideological purity. **The goal is raising humans who love learning, think clearly, and can build meaningful lives.**

---

## Why #1 Most Loved

OpenEd didn't become the most loved homeschool program in America by accident.

It happened because it's the first education system that doesn't force you to compromise.

**It's not either/or on any dimension:**
- Public funding + Private choice
- Professional support + Parental control
- Community + Flexibility  
- Accountability + Freedom

A parent describes the transformation: *"My son used to get in trouble because he'd finish early and entertain other children. Public school didn't work. Homeschooling was challenging with multiple kids. With OpenEd's help I could afford it and felt like I had support."*

Another: *"My child had a very rough time in public school—unable to be still and quiet for the required time, losing his passion for learning. With OpenEd, we personalized his education with hands-on curriculum and activities. He went from being behind in math to about one grade level ahead. He recovered his joy for learning."*

**The pattern:** When education adapts to the child instead of forcing the child to adapt, everything changes.
