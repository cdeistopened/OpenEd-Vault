# ==Richard Feynman was one of the great teachers of the 20th century — he was not only a leading physicist, but a public intellectual who was known for his straightforward, impassioned lectures. When asked about the BEST way to teach, though, Feynman has no answer. “After all these years of trying to teach, I really don’t know how to do it.” That’s because there is no one way of teaching that’s going to work for EVERY child. We need different ways into the material, we need storytelling and compelling visuals and we need to understand the relevance of the thing. We need helpful heuristics and practice and projects. We need all of these and more to try to get the learning to stick. There is no one way of teaching that works best because there is no one way of learning that works best — we have to be able to teach using a wide array of styles and examples.==
