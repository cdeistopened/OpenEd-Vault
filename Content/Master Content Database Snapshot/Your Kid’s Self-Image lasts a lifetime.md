Text: Parents should ensure that their children do not internalize negative beliefs about their intelligence or behavior from school, as these perceptions can impact their self-image for a lifetime. School expectations often prioritize convenience over the truth of a child's abilities and character.

Don't ever, ever, ever let your kid's school make them believe they're not smart.

Or to slow, or too restless, or too creative, or too disruptive, or too much.

So many of school's expectations are built around convenience, not truth.

But your kid's self-image lasts a lifetime.
