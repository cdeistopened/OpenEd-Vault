_==As of June 2, over 9,900 Iowa students have applied for the state's inaugural Students First Education Savings Account Program==_

==, /PRNewswire/ -- The application window for Iowa's new Students First Education Savings Account (ESA) program opened Wednesday. As of Friday, June 2, at 11 a.m. (Central), 9,907 students applied to the Students First ESA program through== ==[Odyssey](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3883269-1&h=2087842114&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwithodyssey.com%2F&a=Odyssey)====, a turnkey technology platform designed exclusively to support the administration of these types of state programs.==

==On average, one application was submitted every 12 seconds in the first 24 hours.

"We are committed to working closely with the Governor's office, Iowa Department of Education, Iowa Department of Revenue, and Iowa Office of the Chief Information Officer to ensure the quick and accurate distribution of funds to families, and real-time insight into the program's effectiveness to ensure it continues to deliver on behalf of Iowans.  We were excited that our first in the nation automated approval gave near real-time results to Iowa families."==
