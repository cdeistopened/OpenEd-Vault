Text: A 14-year-old self-learner from Taiwan has created the subreddit r/SelfLearners to build a community for sharing self-learning experiences, discussing challenges, and showcasing projects. The aim is to connect with others interested in self-learning, whether they are homeschooled or pursuing additional studies independently.

==Hi everyone! 👋==

==I’m a 14-year-old self-learner from Taiwan. I’ve been teaching myself subjects like math, physics, and even thermodynamics. Sometimes people around me don’t really understand why I choose this path, but I believe self-learning can be just as powerful (and even more fun) than traditional schooling.==

==That’s why I just created a new subreddit:== ==[r/SelfLearners](https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfLearners/)====. It’s meant to be a friendly community where:==

==🌱 We share our self-learning experiences and methods==

==📚 We discuss challenges and how to overcome them==

==🚀 We showcase projects and inspire each other==

==I’d love to connect with other self-learners around the world—whether you’re homeschooled, in school but learning extra on your own, or just curious about starting.==

==👉 Feel free to join== ==[r/SelfLearners](https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfLearners/)== ==and introduce yourself! Let’s prove together that self-learning is not only possible, but exciting.==
