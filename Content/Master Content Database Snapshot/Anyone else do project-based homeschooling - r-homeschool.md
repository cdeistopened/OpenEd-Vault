Text: Project-based homeschooling involves creating engaging tasks based on children's interests, such as designing their own "brain rot" memes. The project includes multiple tasks like analyzing favorite and boring memes, designing a new one, using AI for feedback, and creating a cartoon strip, culminating in a presentation to pitch the merchandise. ChatGPT assists in making the project fun and age-appropriate, adding activities to ensure each task is engaging and educational.

==I come up with my own. Their current interest is ‘Italian brain rot memes’ so project is- design your own brain rot. Term long project, I task each week, 10-20 minutes per task each day, so each tasks takes about an hour. Example Steps as follow-==

==Task 1 Write about your top 5 favourite brain rots- list what makes them good, name good design features, what they have in common, etc==

==Task 2 Write about the most boring brain rots, why are they boring? How could they be improved, what do they have in common==

==Task 3 Design your own brain rot. Use your list from good and bad to improve your design, etc==

==Task 4 Part 1 Explain your brain rot to chat gpt and get it to design it- how accurate is it to your design. Part 2 Take a photo of your grainy rot and put it into chat gpt and ask it to turn it into a brain rot character. How are both ai images different? Which do you prefer. How could you change your instructions in part 1 to get closer to part 2?==

==Task 5 Design a 10 cell cartoon strip for your brain rot- write story line, script, etc==

==Etc, the last task in this project is to pretend I’m Worlds greatest toy shop owner and do a presentation on why I should stock your brain rot merchandise.==

==I get chat gpt to rewrite the project in a fun and engaging way for kids my son’s age, including definition terms and extra credit opportunities. Chat gpt is also able to add activities to each task so it adds up to an hours work. It’s been really helpful in turning my project ideas into term long projects==
