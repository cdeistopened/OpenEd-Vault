==Just wanted to start a thread for anyone who has experience with Scholé or is interested in their classes.==

==This is our third year taking classes through them. We currently have a 7th and 5th grader enrolled in a few classes. We originally started with Scholé for their Latin classes. We were pretty impressed by that and this year branched out with a history and literature bundle for my oldest.==

==I’ve been really impressed with the quality of the teachers. They are dynamic and engaging. The course load is extremely rigorous and a very needed kick in the pants so to speak. In regard to the American History and Literature combo class my oldest is taking. Wow. He has been pushed so hard to read and write at a much different level than we had done before at home.==

==Anyway, this was not a paid advertisement 🤣 but I really just wondered if others have used Scholé and what their experiences are?==
