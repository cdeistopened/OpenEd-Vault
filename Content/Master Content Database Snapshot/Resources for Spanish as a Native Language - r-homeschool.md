Text: Looking for Spanish-language learning apps like ABC Mouse or Khan Academy Kids, the author found that ABC Mouse only changed text, not audio. They seek resources for their bilingual child to improve Spanish reading skills, suggesting apps like ANTON, Math Mammoth (Spanish version), and Spanish-language podcasts for kids, along with free Mexican school textbooks available as PDFs.

==TLDR: looking for learning apps like ABC Mouse or Khan Academy Kids that are Spanish language based. I tried ABC Mouse's Spanish option and all it did was change the text, not the audio.==

==My kiddo is attending a private school where we live in Costa Rica, and right now, on our summer break, we're homeschooling to give them the same level of English education that they'd be getting if they were in an English speaking school.==

==Kiddo is heading into 2nd grade and is bilingual Spanish/English, with English being my native language, and their strongest one currently.==

==When they first started reading, it was far easier for them to read in Spanish than in English, because Spanish has much more consistent phonetics. I gave them a quick evaluation this past week because their English reading ability was far above what I expected, and now it seems the Spanish reading has fallen behind, which could make next year difficult, as they will be expected to read a lot more in school.==

==I feel very confident reading to them in Spanish and having them work through age appropriate books (The Wild Robot/Robot Salvaje is a current favorite), but== ==_I would love to supplement with educational video games that are intended for native Spanish speakers._== ==The majority of Spanish as a foreign language that I've found available at this grade level is either too easy or leans on English explanations, which we don't need.==

==I know it's a long shot, as this is a primarily English speaking sub, but I figured it would be worth a shot!==

  

  

### AI Summary:

Some good Spanish-language learning apps and resources include ANTON, Math Mammoth (Spanish version), and Spanish-language podcasts for kids, along with Mexican school textbooks available as free PDFs.

Question:

looking for learning apps like ABC Mouse or Khan Academy Kids that are Spanish language based. I tried ABC Mouse's Spanish option and all it did was change the text, not the audio.

  

Answers:

- I will say that there are a number of Spanish-language podcasts for kids that are targeted at native speakers rather than learners, which I had to rule out from my list of possible resources for now. If you'd like to add more listening time for Spanish, that might be a fairly straightforward way to do it.  
    Also, even if the audio is in English, I probably would switch the text to Spanish in any games where that's an option.
- ANTON is a homeschooling app that I've been using to practice my French, and it's also got Spanish available. I've been really liking it. I've set the app language to French and it's been giving me courses designed for native French speaking elementary students, so I assume the same is true if you set the app to Spanish.  
    There's also a bunch of Mexican school textbooks available as free PDFs from here:

- Math mammoth has a Spanish version of its math curriculum
