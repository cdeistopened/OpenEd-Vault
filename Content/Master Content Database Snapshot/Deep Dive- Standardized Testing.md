Text: Standardized testing negatively impacts student well-being, increasing stress and leading to significant drops in performance. Critics argue that it reflects socioeconomic status rather than true academic ability, advocating for mastery-based grading as a more effective and less stressful alternative that promotes a love of learning.

Student potential ≠ Test score. It's time to rethink how we measure academic success.

Edutopia reports that as high-stakes tests approach, students' cortisol levels spike by an average of 15% (up to 35% for disadvantaged students). This stress is linked to an 80-point drop in SAT scores.

The same study found that students who unexpectedly fail standardized tests often experience an identity crisis: questioning their abilities, losing confidence in subjects they once enjoyed, and even dropping out of advanced courses.

College students lose sleep, overuse caffeine, and <third point>. Is it worth it? Are we measuring knowledge, or just how well students handle pressure?

    “While I generally support the public education system, I ABSOLUTELY think the system's obsession with standardized testing is destroying young people and must be halted immediately if we want a happy, stable, productive next generation of adults.  So
    
    ..You are free to heavily rail against the excessive culture of anyone who places ANY value in rigid, non-transparent state testing.  ;)One reason is that it will ALWAYS simply show the socioeconomic status of the school.  Why? Because access to OUTSIDE of school learning experiences is what truly matters the most for a child's development.  That's a key message for MTH (as it's what we do quite well) -- if you want better learning overall to happen, invest time/money in more fun, engaging, interest-driven outside of school experiences for kids vs doubling down on test prep and having students just "do more core".”
