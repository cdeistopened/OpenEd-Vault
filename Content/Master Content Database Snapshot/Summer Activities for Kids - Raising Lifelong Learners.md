==Summer is a wonderful time for everyone in the family to unwind and relax. It doesn’t take long, though, before you begin to hear your kids grumbling about being bored — even if they’re homeschooled. Summer boredom claims are universal…==

==The good news is there are so many things you can do to keep kids entertained. Whether it’s going on a nature walk or seeing a free movie, these summer activities for kids are fun for children of all ages.==

## ==Free Movies==

==Theaters across the country offer free kids’ movies in the summer. This is a great way for kids to go to the movies without you spending a fortune. These movies are movies that have been in the theater previously and there are usually movies for little kids and older kids. Some theaters even offer free popcorn. Check with your local theaters to see what summer programs are available.==

==With four kids at home, this is the only time we all go to the movies — except in rare instances. Free or inexpensive movies (our local theater offers their summer movies for $1.00 at the door, or $0.50 each ticket if you pre-buy for the season) are the only way this big family can afford the treat.==

## ==Scavenger Hunt==

==A  scavenger hunt can be so much fun. It doesn’t have to be complicated either. You can make one in your own backyard. Hide a container filled with candy, small toys, or other treasures, and then write some fun clues that lead your kids to the prize.==

==This is a great way to spend a lazy at-home afternoon. You can make up your clues based on the age of your kiddos so that the activity is challenging, but not too hard.==

## ==Nature Walk==

==A nature walk not only gets kids away from video games and TV, but it’s a great form of exercise as well. Choose a local park and have the kids take pictures of all the plants and animals they find interesting. When you get home, do research online about all the cool things they saw. You may even spark an interest your children didn’t know they had. For example, your daughter may want to learn more about butterflies while your son wants to know more about lizards.==

## ==Museums==

==If you want your kids to learn something new this summer, museums are a great option. There are kids’ museums all over the country that have fun, interactive exhibits. Museums teach kids in fun, hands-on ways, without it feeling like a learning experience. Some museums also offer free days. If you have a children’s museum in your area, check to see what exhibits are available and if they’re a good fit for your kids.==

## ==Library Programs==

==It can be easy to pick up a tablet and let your kids read a book. However, there’s something wonderful about going to the library. Many libraries have summer programs for kids of all ages. It might be story time or a program that encourages children to read more books to win prizes… Even if you just take your kids to the library once a week, it can be a fun activity that helps kids discover new authors.==

==And, I don’t know about you, but as homeschoolers we already love our library. The summer programs and extra kids around in th e children’s section make it a super fun experience on hot summer days.==

## ==Community Events==

==Many cities offer community events throughout the summer months that can be fun for the whole family. You might catch an outdoor concert or even a fair (or festival, as we call them). Check with your local chamber of commerce to see what’s coming up so that you can schedule these fun events into your calendar.==

==Summer doesn’t have to be boring. There are so many fun activities that your kids will love. Whether it’s an interactive museum or a community event, you can find things to keep your kids busy throughout the summer months.==
