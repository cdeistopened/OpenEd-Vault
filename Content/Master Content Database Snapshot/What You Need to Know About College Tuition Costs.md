Text: College tuition costs have risen significantly, with average tuition and fees for private colleges at $44,961 and $25,415 for out-of-state public universities for the 2025-2026 school year. Students should focus on net price rather than sticker price, as financial aid can lower actual costs. Some colleges offer free tuition in exchange for service, and various states have promise programs to cover tuition costs. It's important for families to consider total expenses, including fees and living costs, when planning for college.

### ==**Key Takeaways:**==

- ==The biggest chunk of college costs is usually tuition.==
- ==Students should pay attention to net price more than sticker price.==
- ==A handful of colleges and universities don't charge tuition.==

==Many families have felt the pinch of rising college tuition costs over time. Those prices are a lot higher today compared with two decades ago.==

==For instance, the average cost for tuition and fees among ranked private== ==[National Universities](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities)== ==– schools that are often research-oriented and offer bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees – has== ==[risen](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/see-20-years-of-tuition-growth-at-national-universities)== ==by about 32% since 2006 when accounting for inflation, according to data reported to U.S. News in an annual survey.==

==Comparing the 2024-2025 school year to 2025-2026, the average price at all ranked private colleges increased by about 3.3%, per U.S. News data. Meanwhile, tuition hikes for both in-state and out-of-state students at ranked public schools rose about 3.3% and about 3.7%, respectively, from the prior year.==

=="The  cost of doing business, delivering the education, has== ==[risen exponentially](https://www.usnews.com/education/articles/one-culprit-in-rising-college-costs)====," says Raul Fonts, senior associate vice president of enrollment management at== ==[Providence College](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/providence-college-3406)== ==in Rhode Island. "Colleges and universities – publics and privates – are just trying to keep up. Everything is rising: faculty salaries; the increase in benefits; the increase in facilities. There's an arms race to have the best facilities possible for students but also to attract students. Facilities are playing a big part in these rising costs."==

==Those costs include keeping up with changing technology, he adds.==

==The year-over-year numbers look a little different when inflation is factored in. Tuition and fees at private ranked colleges increased 0.6%, while at public ranked schools, they increased about 0.5% for in-state students and about 0.9% for out-of-staters.==

==Many higher education experts recommend that prospective students look beyond published prices, since the tuition listed may not be the actual amount they'll pay after institutional grants and other financial aid.==

==For college hopefuls and their families, here's what to know about tuition costs.==

## ==How Much Is College Tuition?==

==In looking at schools ranked by U.S. News, the== ==[average cost of tuition](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/paying-for-college-infographic)== ==and fees for the 2025-2026 school year is $44,961 at private colleges, $25,415 for out-of-state students at public universities and $11,371 for in-state residents at public schools.==

==At public two-year institutions, tuition and fees cost $4,050 on average for in-district students in 2024-2025, according to data collected in the College Board's annual== ==[survey](https://research.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/Trends-in-College-Pricing-and-Student-Aid-2024-ADA.pdf)====, Trends in College Pricing and Student Aid 2024.==

## ==What Are the Differences Between Tuition and Fees?==

==The biggest chunk of college costs is usually tuition – the amount of money required for instruction. Especially at the undergraduate level, students are often required to== ==[pay fees](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/college-fees-that-may-surprise-you)====, and these additional costs usually need to be paid to enroll in and attend class.==

==Fees vary per college, but are  "generally for services or resources, and they're not necessarily applicable to every student," says Kevin Dyerly, vice president for enrollment at the== ==[University of Redlands](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/university-of-redlands-1322)== ==in California. Those can include lab fees, parking fees, activity fees, technology fees, health fees and others.==

=="We historically have tried to really moderate fees so that when students look at the tuition, it's pretty close to what they're going to expect as far as that total sticker price," he says. "You see other institutions where maybe the tuition looks lower, but it's a bit deceptive because there's just thousands of dollars of fees stacked on top of that. So I think it's important for students and families to make sure that they have a comprehensive sense of what the total cost is going to be and that includes both tuition and fees."==

## ==How Do I Use a Tuition Calculator?==

==The cost of attendance isn't always clear, since many families don't pay the sticker price once== ==[financial aid](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/an-ultimate-guide-to-understanding-college-financial-aid)== ==and institutional grants are factored into the bill. So experts advise families to fill out the net price calculator, which is available on each college's website – a federal requirement.==

==Net price is the amount students pay to attend an institution for an academic year after subtracting scholarships and grants. In essence, net price is the final out-of-pocket price a family can expect to pay, and it's often lower than the published price.==

==The Department of Education's== ==[College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/)== ==includes links to schools' net price calculators. These calculators – furnished with first-time, full-time undergraduate students in mind – produce estimated values based on the information the student or parent provides.==

==Families need to start having "realistic affordability conversations" by a student's sophomore or junior year in high school, Fonts says.==

=="You don't want to set expectations that you can't meet," he says. "You don't want to set the student up to say, 'You can do something' when in actuality you can't afford something. Sometimes that's hard to manage because you don't know where the student might receive a scholarship, where they might not receive a scholarship. How much aid they might get or not get. But they should have some understanding. The net price calculator can help in planning."==

## ==Which Colleges Are Least Expensive?==

==When it comes to published prices, attending a state school as an in-state student might be the least expensive option among four-year colleges.==

==However, a few regions and states have== ==[tuition reciprocity programs](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/how-to-get-in-state-tuition-at-out-of-state-colleges)====. For example, under the New England Board of Higher Education's Tuition Break program, residents of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont may be eligible to receive discounted tuition at out-of-state public colleges and universities within New England.==

==Prices among public schools across the country vary. State schools in Florida, followed by Wyoming, charged in-state, full-time students the least on average in 2024-2025 among four-year public colleges, per the College Board report. New Hampshire and Vermont had the most expensive published tuition and fees, on average, for full-time, in-state students at four-year public colleges.==

==Tuition and fees at flagship universities for in-state students often cost more compared with other colleges and universities in the state. For example, the== ==[University of Virginia](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/uva-6968)===='s in-state published price for the 2025-2026 year – $23,897 – is about two-thirds more than the in-state sticker price of $14,250 at== ==[James Madison University](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/james-madison-university-3721)== ==in Virginia.==

==Higher education experts say students shouldn't rule out private schools, which often offer tuition discounts that may make them competitive with state school prices. This practice among private institutions of offering grants, scholarships and fellowships to offset the sticker price is known as tuition discounting.==

==According to a== ==[report](https://www.nacubo.org/Press-Releases/2025/NACUBO-Study-Finds-Private-Colleges-and-Universities-Are-Offering-Record-Financial-Aid-to-Students)== ==from the National Association of College and University Business Officers, 286 private nonprofit institutions discounted their tuition by an average of 56.3% for first-time, full-time undergraduate students and by 51.4% for all undergrads in 2024-2025 – an estimated record high for both.==

## ==Which Colleges Are Most Expensive?==

==Per U.S. News data, the colleges with the highest published prices are the== ==[University of Southern California](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/university-of-southern-california-1328)== ==and== ==[Brown University](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/brown-university-3401)== ==in Rhode Island. These universities charge $75,162 and $74,550 respectively, for their 2025-2026 tuition and fees. But many students pay less than the published amount to attend====[.](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-liberal-arts-colleges)==

==Some schools with expensive published prices offer substantial financial aid packages.== ==[Dartmouth College](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/dartmouth-college-2573)== ==in New Hampshire – which charged $68,019 in the 2024-2025 school year – for example, provided need-based grants to about 71% of full-time undergraduates. The average cost of attendance that year after receiving grants was $21,826.==

==That's why students should pay attention to net price and not just sticker price, experts say. While some schools may look more costly based on sticker price, they actually may cost less on average based on net price.==

## ==Which Schools Offer Free Tuition?==

==A handful of colleges and universities are== ==[tuition-free](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/slideshows/tuition-free-colleges)====, and these institutions usually require work or service in exchange.==

==Students at the== ==[United States Naval Academy](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/united-states-naval-academy-2101)== ==in Maryland and== ==[United States Military Academy at West Point](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/west-point-2893)== ==in New York are required to serve in those respective branches of the military after graduation. In return, tuition, housing and food are free. Three other service academies have similar arrangements: the== ==[United States Air Force Academy](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/united-states-air-force-academy-1369)== ==in Colorado, the== ==[United States Coast Guard Academy](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/united-states-coast-guard-academy-1415)== ==in Connecticut and the== ==[United States Merchant Marine Academy](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/united-states-merchant-marine-academy-2892)== ==in New York.==

==[Paying for Scholarship Help: Pros and Cons](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/paying-for-scholarship-help-pros-and-cons)==

==Other institutions that offer tuition-free education stipulate certain requirements, such as in-school employment.== ==[Alice Lloyd College](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/alice-lloyd-college-1951)== ==in Kentucky and== ==[Warren Wilson College](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/warren-wilson-2979)== ==in North Carolina require full-time undergraduates to work a set number of hours at on-campus jobs.==

==However, tuition-free doesn't necessarily mean completely free, given the full cost of attending college. Families must also pay attention to related educational costs like housing, food, books, supplies and transportation, experts say.==

## ==Are There States With Tuition-Free College Programs?==

==Of the more than 400 college "promise" programs, which offer scholarships to eligible students to cover up to 100% of their tuition and fees, about 130 are statewide, according to the nonprofit College Promise== ==[website](https://www.mypromisetool.org/?source=college-promise-web)====. Most of these statewide programs are at the two-year institution level, but New York, for example, offers its Excelsior Scholarship at two- and four-year degree levels.==

==Statewide programs typically have certain guidelines for students to qualify, such as residency, household income, a high school diploma and/or a minimum GPA.==

==While cost is a key part of the college decision-making process, it shouldn't be the only driving factor, experts say. Some other== ==[factors to consider](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/applying/articles/nonacademic-factors-to-consider-when-choosing-a-college)== ==include academic programs, class sizes, campus resources, and opportunities for research,== ==[internships and co-ops](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/co-op-vs-internship)====, and== ==[study abroad](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/steps-to-take-before-studying-abroad)====.==

=="While cost is a huge factor, some of these other things are equally as important," says Erica Harrison-Jones, director of scholarships in the== ==[College of Charleston's](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/college-of-charleston-3428)== ==Office of Financial Assistance and Veterans Affairs in South Carolina. "The goal is for students to pursue that postsecondary credential, but we also want to see them graduate with that credential. So just look at what those resources are that are available on your campus."==
