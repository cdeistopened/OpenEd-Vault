==We love our homeschool room, but as I am sure you all know, homeschooling is rarely contained to one space. So, today I thought it’d be fun to take you on a tour of some of the spaces where our homeschool life takes place. I’ll also highlight a few of our favorite items in each space!==

### ==**School Room**==

==This is our main hub and my favorite room in the house! It’s where I usually work one-on-one with each of my kids and where we come together for family studies. Sometimes we do art projects in here, but we also do them in our kitchen. This room houses all of our curriculum and a handful of supplies.==

==**School Room Favs:**==

- ==**[Metal Art Display Board](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/soesdala-memo-board-with-clips-black-80423388/)**====: This is easily the #1 link I get asked for. It’s from IKEA and called a Memo Board. Don’t have an Ikea nearby?== ==**[Here is a similar set you can get Amazon](https://rivr.link/c18-wWXcqB)**====. I also bought these== ==**[extra clips](https://rivr.link/c18-JH8n_5)**== ==for when our board is extra full of art.==
- ==**[School Room Table](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-Iok6zx91X/?igsh=MTU2ejh2Z3ZoaGYyNQ==)**====: And, the 2nd most popular question I get asked about all the time is our school table! I have lots of the details saved on this== ==**[IG post](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-Iok6zx91X/?igsh=MTU2ejh2Z3ZoaGYyNQ==)**====. Since our kids are getting bigger last January we just rose the adjustable legs, added a second table, and got== ==**[new chairs](https://rivr.link/c18-lm_biN)**====.==
- ==**[Book Stand](https://rivr.link/c18-xeUkh4)**====: I have two of these because we use them so much! One usually stays in our schoolroom and the other pops back and forth between here and the kitchen.==
- ==**[Wooden Calendar](https://tidd.ly/3AfXxMw)**====: I’m linking a whole blog post on this calendar because it’s another favorite and one I get asked a lot about:== ==**[Calendar Time](https://www.homecenteredlearning.com/blog/calendars)**====.==
- ==**[Maps](https://rivr.link/c18-jcM7zj)**====: The best part about these is they’re laminated so you can write on them with a dry erase marker! Unfortunately the exact maps I have aren’t available anymore, but I am linking a very similar set.==

==My desk space is also in this room. My husband custom built it using IKEA kitchen cabinets (and shelves) and our leftover walnut flooring. The cupboards hold curriculum and basic office, school, and prep supplies.==

==**In My Desk Favs**====:==

- ==**[Printer](https://rivr.link/c18-JJQEkT)**====: A few years ago I wrote a great blog post on our colored printer and it went viral probably because I shared that we’d printed over 9,000 color pages and it had only cost us about $60. You can read all about the pros/cons of it here on the original post:== ==**[Our Printer](https://www.homecenteredlearning.com/blog/our-printer)**====. Since, I have printed A LOT, like probably tens of thousands of more pages, and I guess we over did it because one day it broke and we had to upgrade it, ha! So, now I have the ET-3850 model and it works just as great and I’d say has the exact same pros/cons that I originally wrote about.==
- ==**[Memory Books & Organization Templates](https://www.homecenteredlearning.com/shop/p/kids-memory-book-templates-1)**====: I keep these on the top shelf of one of my cupboards and once the art comes off the wall or if I want to save any of my kid’s bookwork it goes right into these books. I have an IG story highlight you can watch all about managing these here:== ==**[Memories](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE4MDY4OTAxNDkwNTU5NzU3?story_media_id=3426179460304974461&igsh=MTFuMjkyeHNrcWp2MA==)**====.==
- ==**[Spiral Binding Set-Up](https://rivr.link/c18-2WqQ2-)**====: If you’re looking into doing your own spiral binding I’ve rounded up exactly what I use here:== ==**[Binding Prep](https://rivr.link/c18-2WqQ2-)**====. This has been so great for prepping our own curriculum and materials at home.==

### ==**Twin Desks**==

==My twin girls have a double desk in their bedroom and this is where they will sometimes do their independent work. It also isn’t uncommon for their desks to be overflowing with their latest lego creations, stop motion projects, pretend play scenes, crafts and sewing materials…or just whatever they’re into at the moment. We store all of those things and more in the drawers!==

[![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/62a49b29caffde16259a72b1/8ce7f1d3-25d7-4991-b40b-51f987df3529/03.JPG)](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/62a49b29caffde16259a72b1/8ce7f1d3-25d7-4991-b40b-51f987df3529/03.JPG)

==**Twin Desk Favs**==

- ==**[Custom Desks](https://www.homecenteredlearning.com/blog/childrens-desks-and-homeschool-tables)**====: My husband built these desks for the girls a few years ago and I have all the details saved about them on this post:== ==**[Children’s Desks & Homeschool Tables](https://www.homecenteredlearning.com/blog/childrens-desks-and-homeschool-tables)**====.==
- ==**[Stop Motion Setup](https://rivr.link/c18-lRH8YK)**====: This last Christmas we invested in a little stop motion setup for the kids and they have made some of the best little videos! They just use their iPads with an app called Stop Motion Studio. We have this== ==**[backdrop & hanger kit](https://rivr.link/c18-lRH8YK)**== ==and these== ==**[stop motion lights](https://rivr.link/c18-DveKaQ)**== ==that make it so much easier to use.==
- ==**[Peg Boards](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/skadis-pegboard-combination-s89406365/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=surfaces&utm_campaign=shopping_feed&utm_content=free_google_shopping_clicks_Home_organisation&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=10678486260&gbraid=0AAAAAD27g7ycg3VtRpEmXFYXSKMzVNU6y&gclid=CjwKCAjw4K3DBhBqEiwAYtG_9DVoIYKfM4aZqfGYzULqav5kN5r9RDPmGbY8FwQNV6B57K41pYqNqBoCcZ0QAvD_BwE)**====: The girls love to hang some of their favorite pics on these and I think they’re so cute!==

### ==**Living Room & Kitchen Learning**==

==When my three oldest are doing independent work, they tend to spread out all over the house (including their rooms), but it isn’t unusual to find them working at the kitchen counter, our dining room table, or the couch. It just depends on their mood. We also do our devotional and morning time about half the time in our living room area.==

==**Living Room/Kitchen Favs**====:==

- ==**[Seasonal & Morning Basket](https://rivr.link/c18-YRG6cH)**====: Right now we keep a simple book basket usually on the hearth of our fireplace. It holds our rotating seasonal and holiday books and also any themed books we need for our unit studies or other morning time materials. I got this basket a long time ago from my mom, but I have seen very similar ones at places like Hobby Lobby and Target. A good book basket is not hard to find, but I have a compilation a few similar items linked on my== ==**[Basket & Caddy](https://rivr.link/c18-YRG6cH)**== ==page just in case. I also love to use caddies all around this part of the home to set up little learning stations for the kids!==
- ==**[Blankets](https://www.softminkyblankets.com/products/sorbet-vanilla)**====: I’m adding this on here because a good blanket always goes a long way for a cozy learning space and especially in the winter this area of our home has lots of blankets. We’re big== ==**[Minky Couture](https://www.softminkyblankets.com/products/sorbet-vanilla)**== ==fans and have multiple sorbet-style blankets.==
- ==**[Skylight](https://rivr.link/c18-faA0Vp)**====: I recently switched over to an all digital chore chart and meal planning system with Skylight. I spent hours putting all my kid’s jobs in and using the AI feature to transfer all our recipes over. It took a lot of time, but was SO worth it and the kid’s use it all the time for their daily chores and when they want to cook or bake. (Check Costco if you can - we got ours there for cheaper!)==

### ==**Piano & Keyboard Practice**==

==Our upright piano is in our main living room and the girls also have a keyboard in their bedroom. Mornings used to be tricky because the girls would need to practice piano, but I’d be doing school work with my younger boys and it’d just be too loud. So, we added a keyboard in their room and that has worked out really well. It has headphones so we can all study in peace. Just depending on the day, sometimes they can also double up and practice at the same time now which has also been really helpful.==

==**Piano Favs**====:==

- ==**[Keyboard](https://rivr.link/c18-9omuIB)**====: We also got our keyboard at Costco so it was cheaper, but== ==**[this](https://rivr.link/c18-9omuIB)**== ==is very similar to the one we have.==
- ==**[Metronome](https://rivr.link/c18-KFcPb2)**====: Super simple, but it’s a must!==

### ==**Supply Stash**==

==We keep most of our art, craft, and science supplies in our laundry room which is right off our kitchen. For years, I have kept everything up high and out of reach from little hands. Now that we’re past this stage, I tried keeping some more rotating supplies lower on an open bookshelf to make them more accessible. That worked for awhile, but eventually, the girls asked to move the shelf into their room for their books. So, everything went back to the laundry room, ha! Now, I’m back to the drawing board trying to rethink how to make supplies easy to access again. (Sigh) It’s a work in progress!==

==**Supply Favs**====:==

- ==**[Arts & Craft Supplies](https://rivr.link/c18-art-craft-sensory-supply-list)**====: I have basically everything on our shelves linked here and also talk more about how it’s all organized on this post:== ==**[Supply Organization](https://www.homecenteredlearning.com/blog/supply-organization)**====.==
- ==**[Basic Homeschool Supply List](https://rivr.link/c18-general-supply-list)**====: I have a whole bunch of our favorites on this list too! A lot of these things are also in our school room.==

### ==**Bookshelves**==

==Right now we have our homeschool bookshelves in two main areas: my bedroom and the girl’s room. We read a lot on my bed and in a chair in my room, but the girls also really wanted a reading nook in their room so we recently rearranged some shelves to create a little reading space of their own. (We also have a little bookshelf in our basement that houses some of mine and my husband’s books.)==

==**Bookshelf Favs**==

- ==**[Billy Bookcases](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/billy-bookcase-white-s59182201/)**====: All of our shelving in pretty much all of these spaces is from IKEA and the seven shelf and three shelf bookcases here are no exception! Want to see how we keep everything organized? This post will get you started:== ==**[Homeschool Book Organization](https://www.homecenteredlearning.com/blog/homeschool-book-organization)**====.==
- ==**[100+ Beloved Books to Read with Your Pre-K/Kindergartner](https://www.homecenteredlearning.com/blog/100-beloved-picture-books)**====: Last year I compiled a huge list of our favorites for the younger years. We still love reading so many of these even with my older kids.==
- ==**[Homeschool Books for Mom](https://rivr.link/c18-_0n12F)**====: I don’t necessarily agree with all the books on this list, but I love reading about different philosophies and thoughts on education and you can’t go wrong exploring any of these. My very favorite would be== ==**[Teaching From Rest](https://rivr.link/c18-Gbngig)**== ==though!==

==Homeschooling definitely doesn’t require all of this and all the spaces I showed, but I hope this little tour inspired you or gave you some new ideas for your home.==
