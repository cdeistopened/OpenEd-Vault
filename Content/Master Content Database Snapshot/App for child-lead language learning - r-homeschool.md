Text: A user seeks recommendations for a language learning app or program suitable for multiple children without requiring individual lifetime memberships. Suggestions include Rosetta Stone for a one-time purchase, creating a classroom in Duolingo for free access, and Reading Eggs, although the latter may require a yearly subscription.

==So I've found some good programs but I'm looking for something the kids can do on their own. I'm looking for an app like DuoLingo or Babble but with multiple kids the memberships aren't worth it. I'm looking for either an app or computer program (Like the old Rosetta Stone) that all the kids can use without buying a bunch of lifetime memberships.==

==Does anyone have something they use like this?==

==Edit: I'm looking for a good, one time purchase, multiple users/profile program or app==

==Rosetta Stone has a one-time purchase price (lifetime subscription) of $200 with all languages included. Is there a reason you don't just do that?==

==You can make a classroom in Duolingo to get most of the benefits of a paid subscription for free. You could put all your kids in the classroom.==

==I'm not sure how old your children are but we love Reading Eggs! We do it on computer although I believe there is also an app. There is a 30 day trial to see if you like it. I believe a membership is for 4 kids but don't quote me on it. It's very popular right now in our homeschool community.==
