==Hi everyone! I’m a middle school English teacher and a parent who’s also been experimenting with tools that help students focus and stay calm while working - especially for independent or quiet time.==

==I started making timer and ambience videos because I was spending way too much time searching for ones that fit what I wanted: simple visuals, clear countdowns, pleasant (not jarring) alarms, and music without lyrics. I've found that showing the visual countdown helps students manage their time. Also, the right background soundtrack can make a big difference; I’ve seen students who used to fidget or lose focus settle into their work more easily.==

==For homeschoolers, these videos could work well for journaling time, reading, silent work blocks, or even transitions between subjects. They add structure but also a sense of calm.==

==[Here’s the document with my current and upcoming videos](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pYQ6gpCkGioTP530uFMjgXMe4W09L46tCQ5UZ8VXX7w/edit?usp=sharing)====.==

==I’d love feedback or requests if there are specific styles or time lengths that might help in a home learning setup!==
