==At a time when school choice is expanding rapidly and public interest is high, the need for trusted, accessible information has never been greater. That’s why we’re proud to release the 2025== _==EdChoice Bundle==_==, a curated collection of five resources designed to give policymakers, advocates, journalists, and families a full picture of educational choice in America today.==

==This year’s Bundle includes updated and renamed publications, new insights from our ongoing polling and research efforts, and, for the first time, a resource entirely focused on K–12 education funding. Together, these five guides form a comprehensive, plain-language foundation for anyone seeking to better understand the programs, policies, perceptions, legal context, and fiscal impact of educational choice.==

==The Bundle begins with== _==**[Legal Landscape](https://www.edchoice.org/research/2025-legal-landscape/)**==_==, formerly== _==Legal Basics==_==, which offers a concise overview of school choice litigation across the country. It walks readers through constitutional arguments commonly raised in court, maps the legal status of school choice in each state, and tracks active and historic cases. Written for non-lawyers, this guide explains complex legal issues in everyday language—making it an indispensable reference for those designing or defending choice programs.==

==From there,== _==**[School Choice Snapshot](https://www.edchoice.org/research/2025-school-choice-snapshot/)**==_ ==(formerly== _==EdChoice 101==_==) provides a national overview of how these programs work on the ground. With state-by-state maps, updated participation data, and clear definitions of program types—including ESAs, vouchers, tax-credit scholarships, and newer innovations like refundable tax credits—this guide helps demystify the landscape of school choice and clarifies which programs offer true universality in eligibility, usage, and funding.==

==As the conversation around educational choice continues to evolve, so does the need to ground that conversation in evidence. That’s where the== _==**[Research Review](https://www.edchoice.org/research/2025-research-review/)**==_ ==comes in. Formerly the== _==EdChoice Study Guide,==_ ==this publication distills more than 200 empirical studies on the outcomes of school choice programs, including their academic effects, fiscal impacts, and influence on civic values, parental satisfaction, and integration. Categorized and cited for transparency, these findings help separate fact from fiction, providing a research-driven foundation for evaluating policy effectiveness.==

==Of course, understanding policy also means understanding public opinion. That’s the role of our== _==**[Polling Primer](https://www.edchoice.org/research/2025-polling-primer/)**==_==, now in its second year. Drawing from EdChoice’s== _==Schooling in America==_ ==survey and monthly== _==Public Opinion Tracker==_==, this resource sheds light on how Americans are feeling about K–12 education. It captures growing frustration with the direction of the public school system, rising demand for flexibility, and consistently strong support for school choice across demographics.==

==Finally, new to this year’s Bundle is the== _==**[Fiscal Factbook](https://www.edchoice.org/research/2025-fiscal-factbook/)**==_==, a data-rich, accessible guide to how education funding works in the United States. School finance is often one of the most misunderstood aspects of K–12 policy. This publication walks readers through how money flows through the system, what it actually costs to educate students in traditional and choice programs, and how funding formulas cushion district budgets when students leave. With charts, comparisons, and key takeaways, the== _==Fiscal Factbook==_ ==equips readers to engage in more informed conversations about education spending, and how school choice fits into the broader picture.==

==Together, these five publications are designed to serve a wide range of audiences. Whether you’re a policymaker drafting legislation, a journalist reporting on new programs, an advocate making the case for reform, or a parent navigating your child’s options, the== _==EdChoice Bundle==_ ==brings clarity to a fast-changing and often misunderstood policy space.==

==This is more than a collection of reports. It’s a toolkit for understanding and shaping the future of educational freedom in America.==
