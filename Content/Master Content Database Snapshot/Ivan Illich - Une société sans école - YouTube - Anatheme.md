Text: Ivan Illich critique l'éducation institutionnelle, affirmant qu'elle limite le potentiel humain et reproduit des inégalités sociales. Il souligne que l'apprentissage respecté par la société est perçu comme le produit d'institutions établies, et que l'éducation obligatoire transforme la croissance et le développement personnel en produits d'institutions internationales. Il met en garde contre la marchandisation du savoir et ses conséquences sur les privilèges économiques et sociaux.

## Montage Quotes (Translated and separated by ellipses)

"Before discussing a society without school, understand this was the society of all historical epochs and still is for three-quarters of humanity." ... "We must understand the harm that school does." ... "School teaches the child that he needs an institution to learn." ... "School inevitably teaches the child that learning respected by society is only produced by an established institution and by experts." ... "School inevitably introduces the capitalism of knowledge, because it's the capitalist of knowledge who can demonstrate with certificates what he has accumulated." ... "School has been established as the reproductive organ of society." ... "School is at the root of a spiritualization of capitalism." ... "There is no possibility of an alternative to capitalism as long as we continue to capitalize people through knowledge." ... "Through compulsory schooling, we have transformed growth, learning, and personal development into the product of a large international institution." ... "Knowledge becomes scarce the moment it becomes a commodity." ... "Some will be selected to have much more than others and will justify their economic, social, and political privilege by the fact they've spiritually accumulated an intangible commodity called knowledge."

These quotes capture Illich's critique of institutionalized education while maintaining his original ideas, translated from the French transcript.
