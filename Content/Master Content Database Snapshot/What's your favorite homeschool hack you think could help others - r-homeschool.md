Text: Sharing effective homeschool hacks can enhance learning experiences. Suggestions include using learning posters during meals for spontaneous lessons, skip counting strips on doorways for memorization, and utilizing maps to explore geography interactively by identifying items together.

==Please share your best homeschool hacks: from room setup, to planning, to lessons, to organization, to attitude, etc. . More ideas always help!==

==My three:==

1. ==Kindergarten: Learning posters covering the wall next to where my kid eats his meals. I did short lessons on each one a few times each, but eventually my kid would spend mealtimes staring at them while I watched the wheels turn in his head. Tons of great questions and spontaneous lessons followed.==
2. ==Skip counting vertical strips written in big numbers taped to the doorways. We asked my kid to read them off as he would go in/out of rooms, and he had them mostly memorized in less than two weeks.==
3. ==Big maps: World, country, State/province, region, city, neighborhood. Each day we pick a map and ask him to find ten things and count them down with our fingers. As he gets stuff down pat, we add one or two more. In a few mins a day we are covering SO much geography, and getting tons of amazing questions from him.==

==What's yours?==
