> 
> ==“Now that we've established that education is just daycare, let's discuss why.==
> 
> ==Over 30 years ago a group of parents decided to start a public school in my area. I thought they were mad. I already knew that public school admin were a bunch of power-hungry sociopaths and were not going to cede an iota of power, money, or control over their fiefdom to any unwashed parent. But the main guy, whose brain child this endeavor was, was an extrovert. And a very smart man. And a believer in the natural goodness and reasonableness of mankind. So he wheedled his way into the good graces of a few, and then got the power of a republican legislator on the education committee at his state capitol to pull a very powerful funding equation string, and we got our school. It's way more complicated than that but you had to be there.==
> 
> ==After that came many huge jobs but the most difficult one was hiring teachers. After many years of being on the committee that weeded through over a thousand+ applications over the years, my conclusion is that the 'problem' of education cannot be fixed given the current system. Teachers are not capable of being educated.==
> 
> ==Our application process was clearly detailed on our website. About 7/8 of teachers (even the good ones) would not send us all the documents we required to process their application without being prompted multiple times in most cases. (1)They couldn't follow simple instructions that mattered for their career.==
> 
> ==Once they got an interview, we found that (2) most of the people who made it through our very rigorous application process had not even bothered to look over the website and see what our school was about.  
> Our interviews were usually about two hours long. During them we asked a wide variety of questions, many of which were pertinent to the subject matter the teacher was going to teach (some esoteric but most basic). (3) Very few teachers whose applications were good enough for us to waste 120 + minutes of our time arranging an interview for understood their basic subject matter.==
> 
> ==Regarding the esoteric questions (4) we found that very few applicants (of any age) who had a semi-basic understanding of their content area had any kind of nuanced understanding.==
> 
> ==Some of our interview questions were designed to see if this person, this *teacher*, was a person of intellectual curiosity. (5) Very seldom. VERY seldom.==
> 
> ==Some of our questions were designed to see how a person would react in a situation where the school was actually run by a board of parents who hired and fired them. Were they amenable to correction and to shifting how they did things if we were displeased? (6) Many were honest. They said no. They were the professionals (even though some of them were right out of school with zero experience outside of 'student teaching').==
> 
> ==We asked them their leisure reading habits. (7) Many did not read and the ones that did read often read frivolous, non-intellectual material.  
> We asked them to list the last ten books they had read and (8) there were many oprah book club fans, but most could not complete a list of ten books they had remembered reading that weren't 'educationist' garbage.  
> We asked them their hobbies, their passions, their beliefs about education, their motivations, and the purpose of educating a child. (9) A few were passionate about some hobby, most of their beliefs were the current marxist educrat garbage they had been taught in school and never questioned for a second, and their motivations were sometimes that it was an easy job to know more than a kid did, but often it was that a relative was a teacher, or they had had a good teacher once. It was almost never that the knowledge they had was important, interesting, essential, and needed to be passed on to the next generation. This was usually because they had almost no actual knowledge, so that is understandable.” 1/2==

> ==“Generally speaking, people who go into education are some of the most ignorant, lazy, easily propagandized, and sometimes lying strata of the population. Even some of the good ones go south once they are in a group. I used to joke that when you passed through the portals of a public school (even a parent-run one like ours) it pithed your prefrontal cortex.==
> 
> ==Anyway, as I told people who would mistakenly admire me for homeschooling my kids in the early years, "I am not a patient person but you can't do a worse job than your neighborhood school. It's impossible because you love your kids. Even if your kids are just beating each other up in the backyard, they are still better off at home."==
> 
> ==The American public school system is worse than daycare. It is evil. It crushes the life and creativity and natural intelligence out of children. It places them in the hands of ignoramuses, fools, and demons. It cannot be reformed and it MUST be abolished.” 2/2==
