==I’m not a teacher or a parent (I’m a nanny and end up in a lot of groups related to children), but I agree. I see a lot of posts complaining about parents, students, administrators, and children’s behaviors. I also see teachers complaining about homeschoolers.==

==The funny thing is that a lot of parents seem to really prefer a school/daycare life for their young child compared to being with a nanny (I’m not talking about financially). I’ve had multiple parents ask if I would go back to teaching preschool/working in a daycare. I think I love nannying for similar reasons to why I’d like homeschooling - the freedom. I like being able to take a nanny kid outside for five hours one day or not at all another day - depending on our moods, interests, the weather, etc. I like being able to do art and play in the woods and encourage kids to climb etc.==

==THIS. The entitlement they feel to treat parents as nuisances/get between parental rights is honestly shocking.  The posts they make also expose how bad it is with other kids and how most of their time is class room management and test taking prep.==

==Get between parental rights in what way?==

==I can see that parents could be nuisances if they’re constantly interrupting or expecting their child to get far more attention than the others, but I can also see that teachers can be nuisances too.==

==My niece (2nd grade) is in the really fancy nice local school. Gorgeous building, gorgeous playground, great teachers. It’s where we considered sending my son when we were still wrestling with the choice. She gets 20 minutes of recess per WEEK and only if the class earns it. My brother inquired if this was accurate and the teacher said “Yes, unfortunately that class has 2-3 kids that ruin it for everyone”. She hasn’t had recess once this year. I look at my bright, wiggle worm of a son and know he’d be thrown into the group labeled the “bad/hyperactive” ones. So that, plus the idea of no outdoor anything in a 7 hour day, 5 days a week is just not what coincides with my belief of a healthy lifestyle or childhood.==

==Ya. It’s WILD to me. I’m of the mind you should never use restricting recess as a punishment or do class wide punishments, especially at that age. However, they don’t care. My brother did reach out to the assistant principal (couldn’t get with the principal) and they said the teachers are responsible for their own classrooms.==

==It’s just stupidly counterproductive. As a rare consequence for extremes, maybe. But doing it all the time is just going to have them accustomed to not going outside and neuter the threat. Secondly, the kids acting out are probably the ones that need to blow off steam the most.==

==Yeah, some states have laws that recess cannot be taken away for punishment. And some have laws surrounding how much recess kids are entitled at school. I’d guess your laws don’t protect this given they only have 20 minutes of recess a week, but worth looking into. And I’d still spam any admin whose email address I could find with studies citing the benefits of recess and encourage other community members to do the same (local parent Facebook groups are a good way to rally the troops).==

==When my older kids were in public school they always got recess because they followed the rules, but the kids who were labeled as rule breakers most often had to sit in the lunch room during lunch recess for talking during lunch. I volunteered for lunch duty twice a week and they wanted me to hand out “quiet cards” which meant they had to stay and I refused to.==

==I think the problem was they had no time to eat. By the time they got their food it was about 10-15 minutes before they’d start lining everyone up. I know they were really trying to get everyone to actually eat their lunch. But the poor kids were so excited to finally get to sit by their friends that they just wanted to chat. And so many of them threw most of their lunch away still. I think a longer lunch and recess would help but they had to filter three different grades through the same cafeteria in order to fit everyone. So there were definitely a lot of nuances to the problem.==

I have also found that changing up the environment can help too so when weather permits we will go outside and do schoolwork on the trampoline. I also enjoy the freedom to say, “you know what, we’re obviously struggling today for numerous reasons. Instead of forcing/fighting it, let’s walk away from it and come back to it at another time/day”==

==My daughter is 3, but this is why I want to homeschool when she starts school. I think their entire day is devoted to school from the moment they wake up to get ready for school in a rush until they come home to do homework. I went to private school and often had extracurriculars or sports after school and I was always so tired. I started drinking small amounts of coffee at 14….that is too young, but I was so exhausted after school and wanted good grades. I also did not like school at any point until I went to grad school because the decision was my own and I took classes I liked/in my career path. I don’t want my kids to be so exhausted and loathe learning because of the pressure the current system puts on them. So this is why I’m strongly considering it, in addition to other reasons like needing more time outdoors learning that my school rarely did.==

==There was an article in a local newspaper this morning about reading achievements. The governor wants more money invested in retraining teachers in phonics. In the comments, teachers were saying they don't need training because ultimately it's the parents responsibility to teach their children to read. I commented that I agree so let's start a reimbursement for the cost of homeschooling resources program like Florida has. Crickets, absolute crickets.==

==Sadly, for me, it wasn't a beautiful aha moment this week that made me grateful for home ed. We live in a building where there are four boys aged 9 and 10, and my kid who's 8. These 4 all go to public school and one on one, two of them are great (the other two, not so much) but in a group even the nicer two are just horrible and they all gang up on my kid while pretending to be including him. They say rude things and act in mean ways. They barely see their families and learn their life and social skills from other kids their age. While this isn't THE reason we homeschool, this week there have definitely been a lot of 'aren't we lucky to be able to fo this' conversations between me and my husband.==

All the reasons we homeschooled him back in the day are now far worse.==

==He went on to community college and a university for his undergrad, got his master's, then on to get a PhD which he dropped out of after a yr because there were no jobs with it. He taught community college for 11 yrs and is now on a semi permanent leave of absence because he taught American Government and well, you can probably see why. He said he won't be teaching again. Today's students are the reason not to teach as well as the present political environment. Won't be long before AI teaches his class totally online.==

==Texas being full of nonsense like posting the 10 commandments on the wall doesn’t help. Technically I don’t have a problem with teaching religion in public schools. It’s a relevant part of history and culture and Western law and you’re flatly not going to grasp half of the references of literature or be able to critically understand bupkiss in history without some knowledge of what a pope is. That being said, teaching a== _==class==_ ==for the purpose of cultural literacy is very different from the implied demand of posting the rules of a specific religion on the wall of== _==every==_ ==classroom without actually giving the context of teaching it outright. It’s just spineless.==

==I agree with this wholeheartedly. If its brought up at all it should be for the sake of teaching the children what religions and practices exist and not because they are pushing one religion on them. I am shocked what schools are getting away with these days. I have no issues with freedom of religion but one should not be upheld and talked about more than another. I believe it should be something families do at home and not when children should be learning things that will further them in life.==

==This week, I taught the boys a unit reviewing figurative language to prepare for our current chapter of The Hobbit ( Inside Information), and my autistic son who has always historically struggled with these units said, in the middle of the read aloud about Smaug the Dragon, "Oh! It's like painting but with words! Wow!"==

==Well we're almost done homeschooling as all mine are in high school now. But I've been substitute teaching this year occasionally for extra money and seeing the state of schools these days is my most recent why. And I'm at a really good school. But there are still so many bad behaviors, so much time wasting, so much pointless lessons, long days, little breaks, etc etc etc==

==I'm still in contact with the counselor at my daughter's former school. She was the one person there who cared and fought for my daughter to get the accomodations she needed (and unfortunately her efforts weren't rewarded). She messaged me recently saying she's now serving 3 schools instead of just one, and the special education resources have been cut drastically by the school district.==

==This is why we homeschool. My special needs child wouldn't stand a chance otherwise.==

==Not homeschooling yet since my daughter is only 7.5 months old. But last time I was sure about my decision was when I heard that a catholic school had an active shooter and a 10 and 8 year old were shot dead WHILE they were praying on the FIRST week of school. Yeah nope. I want my daughter home where she is safe. Such a freaking sad world. I hate it and I pray for the babies who thought school was safe and it turned out not to be==

==On Monday, my 5 year old and I were having a snack at the playground. We had been there for over an hour. I overheard a teacher leading a group of kindergartners to the playground as we sat down. "Because you guys were not good listeners, the class only gets 7 min instead of 10 min at the playground today. Next time it may only be 5 min. And on Friday, Emilio gets no time at the playground. He will sit in the office." It made me so incredibly sad for those children.==

==We are about to go on vacation while everyone else is in school.  After completing units on weather/seasons and towards the end on plants, my kindergartener and prek kids are so excited to be traveling to a place where the leafs are changing and the crops are being harvested.  We don’t have season where we live so the opportunity to see it in real life and pick our own apples and pumpkins is exciting.==

==Yesterday we had a pretty relaxing day overall, to balance for the chaos of the day before yesterday- and I was able to spend quality time with my oldest one. As we were going to bed I was explaining the definition of an older, not so much used anymore word. I gave him a few examples of how to use the word and asked him to give me an example too. He referenced a conversation we had earlier in the day and in response I made a joke referencing a story we read that morning. We both genuinely laughed and it made me thankful to have this time with my kids. If they were schooling elsewhere, those things wouldn’t have come together like they do so often.==

==I realized today that we’re going to be finishing our math curriculum halfway through the year and moving on to the next level. Not because I push my kid at all, but because she loves math and always asks to do more. I love how much she loves to learn and that there’s absolutely nothing holding her back.==
