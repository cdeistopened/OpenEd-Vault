Text: A parent discusses their 7-year-old child with ADHD, who has been pulled from first grade for a repeat year. While the child shows progress, the parent is concerned about their inability to listen or retain information deemed unimportant. Comments from others suggest that some behaviors are developmentally normal, emphasize the importance of supervised handwriting practice, and highlight that improvement takes time. Balancing handwriting with technology use is also recommended, as persistence can lead to significant improvements over the years.

### AI Summary

Here's a summary of the ADHD first grader situation and the comments:

- A parent pulled their 7-year-old with ADHD out of first grade for a repeat year, noticing progress but concerned about the child's inability to listen to or retain information they find unimportant.
- The parent asks if this behavior will be outgrown or if they're overreacting.

Comments from others suggest:

- Supervised, consistent handwriting practice to build correct muscle memory.
- Some behaviors are developmentally normal, even without ADHD. Pushing too hard can be counterproductive.
- Improvement takes time and constant supervision. Focus on correct movements rather than perfect results.
- Long-term persistence with handwriting practice can lead to significant improvements, even into high school years.
- Balancing handwriting practice with technology use (typing) can be beneficial.

==My seven year old was diagnosed with ADHD last year in 1st grade and we ended up pulling him out this year and doing a grade repeat. I have seen him progress in many ways but I cannot get over the fact that he just doesn’t listen or retain things that he finds unimportant.==

==Is this something he will outgrow? Am I making too big of a deal out of it?==

### Comments:

1. In our household, the young ones write under supervision until letter formation is done correctly. I don't let them write by themselves and, yes, it's annoying so we only do a little bit each day. Any wrong stroke is immediately erased and redone correctly. It's a muscle memory, so the longer you let it go, the harder it will be to correct. Handwriting takes only a few minutes each day. We teach with oral exercises, drawing or making things otherwise.
2. A lot of this sounds developmentally normal, even _without_ ADHD in the mix. And yes, kids do tend to outgrow developmental stuff. Pushing hard in the meantime can be counterproductive, even harmful, to a kid's desire to write and be creative. As a teacher, I have learned to always think about what the primary purpose of an exercise is before I jump in with the corrections. For writing in a journal, the primary purpose is typically learning to express his own thoughts in words, and trying to simultaneously remember all the spelling, capitalization, and handwriting rules is likely to be too much for a kid this age to juggle. Cracking down is more likely to produce reluctance and even avoidance.
3. He will certainly do better, but it takes a lot of time, and a constant supervision. Any wrong start needs to be corrected immediately. I don't care about the final result (too but/little, a bit sloppy...) but the overall movement needs to be the correct one every time, so he builds a good muscle memory. Bad habits die hard unfortunately.
4. We had major concerns with handwriting and kept up with the handwriting without tears and working on it daily. Through the school system, a lot was also done on computers so my child had experience with typing too but we definitely did not rely on accommodations or the thought that they’ll never need to know how to develop handwriting strength. By fifth grade we finally started seeing a major change and by middle school there was a lot of improvement but still behind. Suddenly in high school there was another leap in improvement and my child can do well in classes. Because of challenges with the handwriting my child has really become a strong listener but I am very glad I never gave up with teaching handwriting because in the upper grades, many of our teachers did not offer computer based assignments and I worry that they would have just modified the work and insisted on other accommodations rather than provide an electronic version for a student who types better than they write. We worked on handwriting for years and years and years.
