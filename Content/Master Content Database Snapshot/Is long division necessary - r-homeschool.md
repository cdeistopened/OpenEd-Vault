Text: A parent questions the necessity of teaching long division to their child, given the prevalence of calculators. They reflect on their own education and the potential obsolescence of certain subjects, wondering if skipping long division might be beneficial or regrettable.

==I learned long division in elementary school from teachers who swore that we wouldn't always have a calculator in our pockets when we grew up. Turns out, we pretty much do. My kid is 9 and in 4th grade and we use Khan for math. Her father and I are questioning the actual value of learning long division. I'm not sure she will ever need it. I can't remember ever needing it, neither can my husband. I'm not sure it does anything to increase her conceptual understanding of what is going on with division.==

==I never learned slide rule or abacus. I did learn cursive but many are not teaching that anymore. Certain subjects become antiquated and obsolete for the ordinary learner over time with the changing of the world. I'm wondering if long division might be one of them.==

==Anyone decide to skip it? Anyone think about it and decide that it was important to include? Benefits or regrets either way?==
