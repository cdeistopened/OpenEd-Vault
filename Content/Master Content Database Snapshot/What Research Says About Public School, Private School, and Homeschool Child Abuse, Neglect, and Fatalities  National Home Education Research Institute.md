Text: Research indicates that 10-12% of public and private school children experience educator sexual misconduct, with thousands of student-on-student assaults occurring annually. Most child abuse and neglect fatalities happen before school age, and institutional school students may be at slightly higher risk than homeschool children. The type of schooling does not conclusively correlate with abuse rates, suggesting that demographic factors play a significant role. There is no evidence that increased homeschooling freedom leads to higher abuse incidents.

==**Key Points**==

- ==10% to 12% of public and private school children are victims of educator sexual misconduct during grades K-12.====[[1]](https://nheri.org/what-research-says-about-public-school-private-school-and-homeschool-child-abuse-neglect-and-fatalities/\#_ftn1)== ==This would suggest about 5,460,000 of school-age children in 2022-23====[[2]](https://nheri.org/what-research-says-about-public-school-private-school-and-homeschool-child-abuse-neglect-and-fatalities/#_ftn2)== ==would be victims of school employees by grade 12.==
- ==In addition, there are many thousands of student-on-student sex assaults====[[3]](https://nheri.org/what-research-says-about-public-school-private-school-and-homeschool-child-abuse-neglect-and-fatalities/\#_ftn3)== ==and bullying in institutional schools (public, private) every year.==
- ==The preceding-mentioned abuse occurs despite many laws and regulations controlling public and private schools and the mandatory reporters working in them.==
- ==Over 80% of child abuse and neglect fatalities occur before school age.====[[4]](https://nheri.org/what-research-says-about-public-school-private-school-and-homeschool-child-abuse-neglect-and-fatalities/\#_ftn4)==
- ==Wicked adults – whether public or private school teachers or other staff, school police officers, or parents – find ways to hide their evil deeds and harm children in spite of laws.==
- ==The limited number of research studies done to date suggest that institutional school students are at slightly higher risk than homeschool children for abuse, neglect, and fatalities.====[[5]](https://nheri.org/what-research-says-about-public-school-private-school-and-homeschool-child-abuse-neglect-and-fatalities/\#_ftn5)==
- ==Cross-sectional findings suggest that school sector (institutional school compared to homeschooling) “… is a non-issue after considering the role played by demographics (e.g., family structure, years in foster care, large family size, and household poverty) in the maltreatment of children,” shows a key peer-reviewed study.====[[6]](https://nheri.org/what-research-says-about-public-school-private-school-and-homeschool-child-abuse-neglect-and-fatalities/\#_ftn6)==
- ==The incidences of abuse and neglect for homeschool children are statistically significant only when the children are out in the community or some type of schooling environment, and not at home with their families.====[[7]](https://nheri.org/what-research-says-about-public-school-private-school-and-homeschool-child-abuse-neglect-and-fatalities/\#_ftn7)==
- ==There is no clear evidence of an increase in reported incidents of abuse or other harm in states that move toward laws recognizing and allowing fuller homeschooling freedom.====[[8]](https://nheri.org/what-research-says-about-public-school-private-school-and-homeschool-child-abuse-neglect-and-fatalities/\#_ftn8)==
- ==There is no correlation between the degree of state control of homeschooling and abuse and neglect.====[[9]](https://nheri.org/what-research-says-about-public-school-private-school-and-homeschool-child-abuse-neglect-and-fatalities/\#_ftn9)==

==**Interpretation of Research on Public School, Private School, or Homeschooling**==

==The research study designs to date do not conclusively “prove” or substantiate that type of schooling (school sector; e.g., public school compared to homeschool) causes more or less child abuse, neglect, or fatalities. One hypothesis is that the negative or positive observations might be due to the demographics of the students and families in the studies. Addressing these larger issues is likely to be more effective in preventing abuse and neglect than imposing additional restrictions on homeschooling. See the references in the footnotes regarding limitations and caveats in the studies.==
