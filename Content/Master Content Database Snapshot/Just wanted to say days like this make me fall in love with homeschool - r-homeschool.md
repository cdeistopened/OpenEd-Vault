==So I am part of a small but very tight knit homeschool community with mixed ages. My kids are 3 and 5. I saw someone post that they celebrated winter solstice by going on a hike in the forest with their friends and having a bonfire , roasting marshmallows on the fire etc. It sounded super lovely. So I decided to make it a thing, like start the tradition... and today, several families and I headed into the woods at a conservation area where they have a waterfall and a fire pit nearby. The kids gathered kindling in the forest as we walked to the fire pit (about a 30- 45 minute walk through the forest). Because it was a Thursday during the day during the school year, we had the place to ourselves. We got there and the kids worked together with the adults to get the fire going, and when it was blazing we all roasted hotdogs and marshmallows and chatted and the kids explored the surrounding forest. Some kids even made ornaments for the birds with bird seed and hung them up in the trees. It was honestly so warm and cozy and lovely and magical. I just kept thinking about how incredibly lucky we were to get to do this, instead of being stuck inside the 4 walls of a public school. Our kids are just so happy and thriving. And yes, we did our academic work in the morning before the hike! Lol. Just saying, I was filled with so many doubts about this path but days like this make it just feel so worthwhile and really makes me grateful and happy that I chose this, even if it's not always easy or straightforward. Even if down the road, for whatever reason, we decide to do public schooling, I know my kids will remember these days with such fondness and have such happy memories of childhood, wild and free and filled with nature.== ==[Sephora](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sephora/)==
