Text: Education startups struggle to scale due to profound market differences, misaligned incentives among stakeholders, and the challenge of creating effective learning experiences. While some companies succeed by focusing on entertainment rather than education, the rise of AI offers potential for personalized learning solutions. However, monetization remains a significant challenge, with high marginal costs and competition from both large and small players in the market.

==_Gian Segato is a founding data scientist and engineer at Replit, one of the most ambitious and fastest-growing startups today. When he was in college, Segato founded Uniwhere, Italy’s first app to help students manage college life end-to-end (he later sold it to a leading Italian education technology firm)._==

==_Last month, Segato guested in Pirate Wires with a banger on how AI is giving rise to_== [==_one-person billion-dollar companies_==](https://www.piratewires.com/p/agency-is-eating-the-world)==_. Today, he’s back with a new piece on why education startups are so difficult to build, and why they almost never pay off (until now, thanks to AI — maybe). If you’ve ever wondered why our schools feel like ancient relics of a forgotten civilization, and why they have not yet been remade by technology, this story is for you._==

==Some businesses have it easy. Netflix, Airbnb, and DoorDash capitalize on consumer habits that cross borders and cultures, meaning they can scale seemingly effortlessly. The product experience you get from Disney Plus in Ecuador is the same as the experience you’ll get in Mongolia because humans anywhere consume entertainment basically identically. Other products spread like wildfire because they’re malleable and adaptable, meeting very different needs while preserving their original shape. These are exceedingly rare, objectively magical tools like ChatGPT and Google.==

==Education is not like that. Inter-market differences are profound, almost unshakable, and extremely granular.==

==For example, think of internships. In the US, most college students take them in their junior and senior years, and they hold a lot of weight. In Europe, most do it just once, and they’re not as important. You== ==_can_== ==build a successful internship product in the States — like Handshake, a recruiting app for college students — but you’ll face an uphill battle in most other countries because they simply don’t need it. You== ==_can_== ==build a successful tutoring business in South Korea, but you’ll have a hard time bringing it to countries where tutoring just isn’t a big part of their culture.==

==If you’re leading an early-stage education startup that’s found product-market fit in one region, you’re unlikely to scale by simply replicating your model. You can== ==**dilute your product-market fit**== ==by expanding who you serve, or== ==**forgo growth**== ==and hunker down in your initial market. The former means you’ll lose customers, the latter means never reaching venture scale.==

==This was my dilemma when I built Uniwhere, the first mobile app to help Italian college students manage their coursework and track progress toward their degrees. We found a near-perfect product-market fit in Italy that we couldn’t transfer to adjacent markets, though we tried — hard. Ultimately, I had to sell.==

==To be clear, product localization is always difficult, no matter what you’re building. But growth friction must always be offset by larger expected returns — and in education, the math isn’t mathing: the returns are just too small.==

==Why? Misaligned incentives. Parents pay, students consume. As a result, education products aren’t optimized for their real users.==

==It’s even more misaligned than that: institutions== ==_pay_== ==for the product, educators== ==_administer_== ==the product, students== ==_consume_== ==the product, and parents== ==_passively evaluate_== ==the product. It’s an insane design challenge with too many parties to satisfy. So, instead of building meaningful products, education companies end up competing on low prices, easy compliance, or even parents’ ability to brag about whatever their kids are doing — rather than actual, durable learning.==

==The result?== ==**Most K-12 ed-tech products either suck or don’t sell**====.==

==One solution is to focus on users who== ==_can_== ==pay: adults. But adult ed-tech products run into yet another problem: the time horizon is too long. What you need to learn now won’t benefit you until months or years later. People hate to invest time and energy into things that won’t benefit them right away, even if they stand to gain more long-term (a phenomenon known as “hyperbolic discounting”).==

==Startups have found novel ways around this cognitive bias — but all of them have shortcomings.==

==Some have tried to bundle users together in small groups (“cohort-based courses”). These create rather successful (and often enjoyable) learning experiences — but they’re impossible to scale without making the cohorts worse and less cohesive, diluting the product effectiveness and thus hampering its growth.==

==Others have gamified the learning experience. A classic example is Duolingo, now a wildly successful public company with an over $24b market cap. But Duolingo is not really an education business: it’s a gaming app. For a host of psychological and biological reasons, learning (like exercising)== ==_must_== ==be hard to be effective. This is at odds with building a product optimized for engagement, which increases as you== ==_remove_== ==friction and effort from the learning process.==

==Duolingo is not in the business of teaching languages. It’s in the business of letting smart people play with their phones without making them feel like they’re wasting their time.==

==Third idea: solve the time-horizon issue by postponing payment. BloomTech (fka Lambda School) tried this; they popularized Income Sharing Agreements, a way for education purveyors to get paid later with a portion of their students’ future incomes. An innovative idea, sure, but it didn’t scale either (the courses themselves were cohort-based, which we already know don’t scale). BloomTech also resorted to aggressive financial engineering, bundling the student loans and reselling them to sophisticated investors while mischaracterizing their nature, burning the company’s brand.==

==Okay. So, making people pay for their education is hard at scale. What about ads?==

==Some startups have built platforms where people learn skills for free and recruiters pay to reach them (basically, the recruiters take out ads). If you can’t sell content — the thinking goes — you can sell== ==_access_== ==to customers you acquire cheaply before upskilling them. Recruiting and education are two sides of the same coin. In theory, it’s an ingenious plan.==

==Unfortunately, it doesn’t work.==

==The customers who need these products most — mom-and-pop businesses that can’t fill roles — either don’t have the budget to pay for niche hyper-specialized recruiting ads, or more frequently don’t even see the point in doing so, turning it into a self-fulfilling prophecy. There’s also an extreme variance between small and large companies’ recruiting needs. You can’t scale a business like this because your prospective customers (the advertisers) all want wildly different things.==

==Another angle of attack? Make companies pay for content to reskill and retain their employees. So far, I haven’t seen this work either. Large companies can leverage a higher base comp and better employer branding to attract and retain employees — which is much more effective than pure reskilling — and small companies don’t really need this. Typically, when large companies invest in educational content for their workforce, they’d rather make it themselves.==

==Essentially, education is hard to scale because it’s hyperlocal — people learn best in groups — and because learning new things is painful (as it should be). Take away the pain and it’s no longer effective education.==

==Going through all this during my experience as an ed-tech founder has led me to believe that the only way to== ==_easily_== ==monetize education at scale is to avoid the “education” part in the first place, and sell entertainment instead_._ Duolingo, Masterclass, Substack, YouTube, Morning Brew, and even magazines like The Economist are all great examples. Edutainment is pleasant. It’s satisfying. It can work spectacularly well as a business. But its memory decay curve will be steep because of the lack of effort and hardship involved in its (passive) consumption. It’s not education.==

==Of course, some ed-tech companies== ==_have_== ==managed to become robust global businesses: Udemy, ClassDojo, Lynda (acquired by LinkedIn), Coursera. They leveraged product primitives that quickly saturated, and today are no longer exploitable.==

==Crucially, however, none of them are what I’d consider generational companies.==

==Take Udemy. It’s a peer-to-peer marketplace. From a product design perspective, it’s no different from eBay or Uber. It’s the startup class of the early 2000s. Most critically, its nearly $4b market cap fell off a cliff over the last few years. Interestingly, Duolingo was in the same market cap class as Udemy for years until they finally decided to lean into what truly works for them (edutainment) and optimizing for engagement rather than deeper learning — at which point their valuation exploded.==

==In education, you’ll either find== ==**companies with high PMF that never scale**== ==beyond their initial successes (eg. Uniwhere), or== ==**companies that can scale but can’t achieve high PMF**== ==because regional players will always build better products. You’ll also find a lot of entertainment masquerading as education.==

==But things may finally be changing.==

==AI today adds a legitimately new element to education. It combines what’s already powerful about information technology (nearly perfect memory), with something elusive until recently: genuinely scalable personalization. This potentially nullifies the scalability-vs-effectiveness trade off: we can now build products that== ==_do_== ==provide true long-term learning while catering to the individual needs and cultures of their users.==

==This is encouraging, though it still doesn’t solve some of the monetization issues at the heart of the ed-tech problem — and may even introduce new ones. Companies must now suffer sizable marginal costs to build compelling products, which makes generating profit even harder. There’s also a novel market dynamic, with fierce competition from do-it-all behemoths like ChatGPT coupled with downward pressure coming from a plethora of small startups using their very technology.==

==All things considered, I’m positive someone will figure it out.==

==It’s just so hard that no one has yet.==
