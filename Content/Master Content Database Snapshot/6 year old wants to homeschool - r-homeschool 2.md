Text: A parent is conflicted about whether to homeschool their socially struggling 6-year-old son, who expresses a desire to be homeschooled despite being in a good school. The parent worries about the impact on his social skills and the potential chaos of homeschooling due to their part-time work. They are also considering therapy for his anxiety but are uncertain if homeschooling would help or hinder his social development in the long run.

==I'm wanting to make the right decision here, but I just keep going back and forth on what that is. Our son is super smart but struggles socially. He often can't find anyone to play with at recess, thinks school is mostly ok if boring but says he misses me all day. He's adamant that he wouldn't miss getting to be around kids his age all day and wants to homeschool. He's in first grade now and this hasn't changed from kindergarten. His school is great, and his teacher says he seems happy, but he's sad every morning when we leave to go to school.==

==Technically, I could homeschool although it would be somewhat chaotic at times as I do work part time, half in the home half outside the home, so our schedule wouldn't be consistent. There's not a lot for homeschoolers in our area, so I'm worried he'd just fall further behind socially. However, school doesn't really seem to be helping him socially either. He just gets sad. Maybe it is, and it's just that he's still struggling.==

==We have therapy starting up soon to address any anxiety issues, but do I homeschool to help ease that anxiety/sadness or stick with regular school as a kind of immersion therapy? I'm worried that when he's older, he'll be mad at me for homeschooling if he's still socially awkward. The rest I can probably handle. I can't handle letting him down.==
