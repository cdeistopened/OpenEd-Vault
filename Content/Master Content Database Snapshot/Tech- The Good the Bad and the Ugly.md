Text: A parent is concerned about their 14-year-old son logging out of Snapchat before bedtime, questioning whether their practice of taking his phone at night and reviewing his messages is too strict or appropriate. They seek advice on the matter.

Ask Jaime:

  

I have a son who is 14. at night, I take his phone at bedtime and give it back in the morning. I go through his Snapchat and phone messages on a regular basis. Last night he logged out of Snapchat before he gave me his phone. He said I don’t need to read his stuff and he is the only kid who’s mom takes his phone at night..

Too much? Not enough? HELP!!
