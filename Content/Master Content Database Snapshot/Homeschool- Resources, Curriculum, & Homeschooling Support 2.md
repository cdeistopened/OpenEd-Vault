[==I'm at my wits end. Falling behind in my relationships with the other kids, housework, because she will not cooperate. We have a curriculum. She's fully capable of doing it. It's not too hard. I'll say "it's time for x subject," and she'll just lose her mind. It's too hard, she hates that subject, it's too boring. We're late to everything because she won't get ready-the fun things, play dates, zoos, museums. Redirecting is met with fighting, changing subjects is met with fighting, trying to make it a game? More fighting. I limit how much time is spent on each subject so we don't drag out one, and she wastes the alloted time.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/17bmv34/daughter_insists_she_wants_to_homeschool_any/)

[==Is this the end? Do I give up and send her to school? At what point do we call it quits? She's incredibly smart, but all she wants to do is read books. (I cannot believe I'm complaining about that, but it's to the exclusion of all else-basic hygiene, sleep, etc.) We've mapped out her work. At most, it's 2h, but more like an hour and a half or so each day. However, so far, she complained for 1.5h and has done 5 math problems and written two short sentences. I've given her breaks (from what I don't know).==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/17bmv34/daughter_insists_she_wants_to_homeschool_any/)

[==I'm going to get backlash and guilt from my family if I put her in school. And we're all struggling having her home. I want to have a good relationship with her, but it just seems like most of our contact is negative. I'm stressed because she's whining, I'm behind on my work, and I can't sit and just play with my toddlers.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/17bmv34/daughter_insists_she_wants_to_homeschool_any/)

[==I've written this out and it seems really stupid now. She's in second grade. I'm just so frazzled and don't entirely know where to go with this.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/17bmv34/daughter_insists_she_wants_to_homeschool_any/)

[==Edited to add: Thank you all for your feedback. I didn't know this would get so much feedback. I really appreciate everyone who took the time to answer. It's given me a lot to think about and made everything seem far less out of control.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/17bmv34/daughter_insists_she_wants_to_homeschool_any/)

[==We'll be getting her evaluated for ADHD, it will just take some time where we're located. Her dad was diagnosed earlier this year with it, and it's been eye opening. I also should have clarified, she's really only been home schooled, except for a short stint in preschool pre-pandemic. She knew what was expected, but this year she's got more work than last, and I've organized it better. We are getting through her work, too. She's by no means behind or getting away with not doing her work. Just, many days start with whining and end with loss of privaleges.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/17bmv34/daughter_insists_she_wants_to_homeschool_any/)

[==I'll be sharing these responses with my husband while we figure out how to go on. I know I shouldn't worry about what my family will have to say about it, but that's a work on progress. I anticipate snide comments if she goes to school. Our son is in kindergarten at the local school and I'm getting plenty already.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/17bmv34/daughter_insists_she_wants_to_homeschool_any/)

[==My daughter is 13. She has been homeschooled her entire life, with lots of co-ops and extracurricular activities. This year for 8th grade, she mentioned she wanted to try public school. We just moved back to a great district, and they have some specialized programs that seemed to be a great fit. I have always told her she has the choice in her education to make decisions she feels are best (within reason of course), so she interviewed and was offered a spot in the project based learning program- No homework, lots of field trips, shorter day, and all hands on. She loved it for the first 3 weeks, and then the excitement of the new environment wore off. She came to me and said she wanted to come home- she felt like she was able to complete her work quicker and more throughly at home, along with have the time to explore her interests more. School was a sensory overload, with less rigorous work and more drama. She came home to tired to do the things she enjoyed, with little ability to share what she actually learned. She made a few new friends, but realized that its easier to make friends in her specialized groups, where the kids actually share a common interest and not just a common age.. Today is her last day. Her first and only report card came home with As. Now I am seriously working on a plan for high school homeschool, and she seems to be ready to get back to her own schedule.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1b1jp5v/we_tried_public_school_and_lasted_for_6_weeks/)

[==Discussion==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/?f=flair_name%3A%22Discussion%22)

[==Former homeschooler here! I hope you won't mind me sharing some thoughts that I have had recently.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1bf5qza/please_indulge_my_little_rant/)

[==As I mentioned, I was homeschooled for elementary and middle school and I did some homeschooling in high school. In hindsight, it was a pretty great education and it has allowed me to get into a competitive university and eventually get my masters degree.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1bf5qza/please_indulge_my_little_rant/)

[==In the past, I have disagreed with people who have advocated for abolishing or increasing regulation on homeschooling. I understand that some homeschoolers unfortunately fall through the cracks and experience educational neglect. However, having worked in reading intervention is public schools, I think people massively underestimate how many kids are falling through the cracks in public schools. Additionally, I believed the proportion of homeschoolers to be so small that homeschooling does not significantly impact society.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1bf5qza/please_indulge_my_little_rant/)

[==However, my thinking on this has been evolving somewhat recently. I live in a state with bottom of the barrel public education rankings and homeschooling is popular. Homeschooling has also gotten much more popular since COVID. I also work in two fields that attract a lot of homeschoolers (I'm a speech therapist and ice skating coach). So I interact with a lot of homeschoolers and their parents.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1bf5qza/please_indulge_my_little_rant/)

[==As homeschooling is getting popular, I am seeing parents become increasingly laissez faire in their educational approach. Truisms such as "homeschoolers only need to study a few hours of day" have seemed to morph into some families spending hardly any time on actually schooling. For what it's worth, I distinctly remember in my own homeschooling days doing school as the public school kids got home on the bus. My mom would point out that those kids would have to do homework, so it was only fair that I continued my school work into the evening. My sister would often wake up at 5 am in order to fit all her subjects in before our extracurriculars started in the afternoon. My mom put is massive amounts of effort into finding the best curriculums in all subjects, researching educational philosophies, and getting us into educational enrichment opportunities. Now it seems like more people expect homeschooling to be like schooling in COVID where you sit in front of a computer for a couple hours with whatever is available.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1bf5qza/please_indulge_my_little_rant/)

[==I am also seeing more and more families where both parents work, and the kids are left to essentially homeschool themselves on the computer all day. I recently had a friend ask me if she should start homeschooling her son. Both parents work full time and her son is in the gifted program at school where he is thriving. She was planning to leave him to do his school work at home alone on the computer all day. The dad wanted him to be homeschooled so he wouldn't be affected by the school calendar when he wanted to go to dirt bike races.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1bf5qza/please_indulge_my_little_rant/)

[==Which brings me to my third gripe, parents choosing to homeschool because they can't handle anyone else giving their kids any feedback, because their child experiences mild anxiety at school, or just because they can't handle school cramping their style. My biggest concern is the amount of kids I've seen whose anxiety and perfectionism has exploded since being pulled out of school. Too many parents are codependent with their kids and don't give their kids the space to experience the challenges they need to develop.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1bf5qza/please_indulge_my_little_rant/)

[==Finally, I feel that homeschooling communities have developed the same kind of "you go, Momma!" Kind of attitude that people have with parenting. The attitude seems to be that parent's are trying their best and can do no wrong. Unfortunately, homeschooling parents very much can harm their children even if they are doing their best. Sometimes I think parent's need a little tough love and maybe a reality check. Homeschooling is not for everyone.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1bf5qza/please_indulge_my_little_rant/)

[==With the explosion of homeschooling, I am no longer so sure that society won't ultimately be negatively affected by poor homeschooling. I suppose only time will tell. It will be sad if there is backlash that negatively affects the people who want to do homeschooling well.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1bf5qza/please_indulge_my_little_rant/)

[==With the understanding that no one asked for my opinion, here would be my unsolicited advice for homeschoolers:==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1bf5qza/please_indulge_my_little_rant/)

1. [==Homeschooling your kids should be a full time job. If you already have a full time job, you do not have the time to do this properly unless you are able to hire someone to do a lot of it.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1bf5qza/please_indulge_my_little_rant/)
2. [==You need to have strong boundaries and a healthy authoritative relationship with your kids for this to work. If you are unable to get your kids to do chores consistently without a lot of tantrums and fighting, you probably won't be able to get them to do their school work.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1bf5qza/please_indulge_my_little_rant/)
3. [==Homeschooling may be a good option for some kids with disabilities, but it shouldn't be a knee jerk reaction to their diagnosis. Public schools have resources to help your kids and they may benefit from the structure.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1bf5qza/please_indulge_my_little_rant/)
4. [==It is healthy for your kids to receive negative feedback from other adults. It is healthy for them to dislike or even hate some of their teachers. It is probably healthy for you to occasionally get some push back on how you parent your kids. Don't pull them out of school just to avoid this. If you homeschool, you need to let your kids experience this somewhere else, for example in a sport or job.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1bf5qza/please_indulge_my_little_rant/)
5. [==Anxiety flourishes when kids are allowed to avoid things that make them anxious. The answer to anxiety at school is not pulling kids out, it's therapy, problem solving and resiliency building.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1bf5qza/please_indulge_my_little_rant/)

I got stopped by strangers questioning why my kids weren’t in school, dealt with the police being called because they were out in public, and was told repeatedly that I was wrecking their future.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1iflplb/did_anyone_ever_tell_you_homeschooling_would_ruin/)

[==Now, homeschooling has gone mainstream, thank goodness! 🎉==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1iflplb/did_anyone_ever_tell_you_homeschooling_would_ruin/)

[==And it turned out I didn't ruin their future by my choice. One’s about to graduate from a top law school, another is a senior getting his mechanical engineer degree, my youngest will graduate this May with a psychology degree, and the oldest is a lab administrator in a hospital. So much for "ruining" their education.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1iflplb/did_anyone_ever_tell_you_homeschooling_would_ruin/)

[==I want to reach out to anyone who has recently been told by their pediatrician that their child, perhaps between 10 months and three years old, may be on the autism spectrum. If you're feeling incredulous about this label and are convinced there’s nothing "wrong" with your little one, I want you to know you’re not alone.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1f62z6k/to_the_parent_just_told_their_child_may_be_on_the/)

[==When I first received the diagnosis for my son, I was understandably upset. I felt frustrated and offended, questioning why my child, who I believe to be perfect, was being labeled. My husband and I had discussions about the pediatrician’s concerns, especially when we weren’t at all concerned or even realized he was considered “delayed.”==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1f62z6k/to_the_parent_just_told_their_child_may_be_on_the/)

[==However, as we approach a year since his diagnosis, my perspective has shifted significantly. Early intervention has made a remarkable difference in my son's development. Looking back, I can now appreciate how crucial that label was. Without it, he may not be thriving and progressing as he is today.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1f62z6k/to_the_parent_just_told_their_child_may_be_on_the/)

[==Yes, the label can feel daunting and carries its own set of challenges. But it also opened doors to resources and support that have propelled my child forward.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1f62z6k/to_the_parent_just_told_their_child_may_be_on_the/)

[==I urge you to consider this: embracing the potential benefits of a diagnosis might be valuable, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. Acceptance can take time, but trust that you will come to realize that, no matter what, your child is uniquely wonderful, and that fact will never change.==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1f62z6k/to_the_parent_just_told_their_child_may_be_on_the/)
