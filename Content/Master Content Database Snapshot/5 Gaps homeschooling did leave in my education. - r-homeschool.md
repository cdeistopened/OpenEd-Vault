Text: Homeschooling left gaps in education, including difficulties with group projects, focusing on repetitive class material, listening skills during public speaking, managing deadlines versus mastery, and maintaining a school-life balance. It's important to teach collaboration, provide feedback effectively, and set boundaries to prevent burnout.

==I am not a homeschool parent, i was however homeschooled all my life and went on to attend an ivy league school for college. I love homeschooling and plan to homeschool my kids in the future, but i thought this list might be helpful for those currently homeschooling.==

1. ==group projects no one likes them and i rarely encountered them, the first time i truly had to work on a group project i just about had a breakdown, please teach your kids collaboration in any way you can, as well as taking input from others- that part was especially hard for me==
2. ==focus on one thing while my attention span was mostly fine, when i went to college i== _==really==_ ==struggled with just sitting through a class on information that was already in the textbook, the repetition was mind numbing, i don’t know what could have been done differently but it was a problem i encountered==
3. ==being a good listener i had zero problems with public speaking, it was listening to== _==others==_ ==public speaking that was the problem, for the first year or so i often came off as overly critical or harsh during feedback- i needed a better understanding of the baseline for public speaking and how to better give feedback (i would suggest the compliment sandwich: compliment- critique- compliment)==
4. ==deadlines for mastery in homeschool i worked on something until i had it mastered no matter how long it took, but when i moved to college it became clear really fast that i couldn’t take my sweet time, and sometimes== _==sometimes==_ ==it was about reaching a deadline and not perfection==
5. ==school-life balance if i had one major complaint it would be this one, homeschooling blurs the lines of school and life together so intensely i didn’t even know they could be separated, this led to me being overwhelmed in the beginning of college because my whole life revolved around school, and while drive isn’t a bad thing, there needs to be a degree of separation so that you aren’t burnt out on just your day to day life. there need to be firmer lines drawn and not every moment is a teaching moment, for me that meant setting something like working hours that outside of i did things not related to school, just things that needed time be done or i enjoyed otherwise==

==i hope this is helpful to somebody, if there are any questions i can answer please let me know==
