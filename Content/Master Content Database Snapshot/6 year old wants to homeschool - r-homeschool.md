==I'm wanting to make the right decision here, but I just keep going back and forth on what that is. Our son is super smart but struggles socially. He often can't find anyone to play with at recess, thinks school is mostly ok if boring but says he misses me all day. He's adamant that he wouldn't miss getting to be around kids his age all day and wants to homeschool. He's in first grade now and this hasn't changed from kindergarten. His school is great, and his teacher says he seems happy, but he's sad every morning when we leave to go to school.==

==Technically, I could homeschool although it would be somewhat chaotic at times as I do work part time, half in the home half outside the home, so our schedule wouldn't be consistent. There's not a lot for homeschoolers in our area, so I'm worried he'd just fall further behind socially. However, school doesn't really seem to be helping him socially either. He just gets sad. Maybe it is, and it's just that he's still struggling.==

==We have therapy starting up soon to address any anxiety issues, but do I homeschool to help ease that anxiety/sadness or stick with regular school as a kind of immersion therapy? I'm worried that when he's older, he'll be mad at me for homeschooling if he's still socially awkward. The rest I can probably handle. I can't handle letting him down.==

First, a mantra around here: nothing has to be permanent. If you were to try homeschooling this year and something about it doesn’t work for you guys, he can go back to public school.  
As far as socialization, the thing I love about homeschooling is that socialization can be tailored in a far more mature way. Specific activity classes (sports, art, whatever is available in your area) might help your child socialize in an environment where the subject is interesting to them, and the time slot limited so he’s not socially exhausted. Keep in mind some people naturally need far less active social time than others.  
As far as your concern about letting him down. I am betting if you were to poll adults there would be far more of them able to say that they were let down by their parents because they weren’t heard when they spoke up. Your son is telling you how he feels. I can’t imagine he’s ever going to blame you for TRYING to hear him and find a solution. Again, if it doesn’t work for your family, you can make different choices.  
Keep thinking on it and learning about your options. Alternative schooling can look very different from family to family. Find what works for you two.

  

Let me put it this way, if you wanted to work on your social skills, would you choose an environment that mostly makes you sit in a room with people exactly your age at desks but not talking to them?

I understand lots of kids like seeing friends at school, but school isn’t really a great environment for social skills. Recess is often an unstructured free for all. Some kids will be bullying or abusive, so they can actually learn negative social skills or lose them.

For social opportunities, could you look for group art classes, ymca sports classes, music related stuff? It doesn’t have to be a literal homeschool coop. Or you could start your own park meetup day.

I would also like to add that my son had a terrible first grade experience, very few friends, crying and growing suicidal by the end of the year. He does not struggle socially - he has always been called a “social butterfly” by his preschool teachers, he know has over a dozen homeschooler friends and other friends in school. It was his constant need to socialize (and his adhd making it harder than average for him to stop talking).

I guess what I am saying is sometimes you struggle socially, sometimes you are just surrounded by assholes. 😂😂

  

I would try it. He can feel heard and see if he likes it. However, I would still make sure he has many opportunities to socialize. Co-ops, sports, a club based on an interest, library book nights, etc. While peoples desired interactions have a broad range (content to be alone 99% of the time vs. desperately wanting friends over every day) I think it’s important for kids to be able to socialize when appropriate and not super fearful of it, not counting the initially nervousness of new environment/situations. (I also don’t mean to throw him into situations or force it, it’s a skill that can develop slowly over time).

  

It could also be that he just doesn’t connect with kids his age. Homeschooling has the potential to give him more mixed groups.

And some kids just don’t WANT to be social. My second is fine being around people and interacting with them, but he’s never wanted a best friend or someone to hang out with on his off hours. People are meant to be in the background for him. He’s content with family.

  

We went through something similar with our our daughter who was in prek 4 last year. So I’ll share how it’s worked out for us.

She missed me a lot and was always very nervous to go. Often would cry. Asked me to homeschool her. I would get there early and observe her on the playground. She struggled to connect with the others. It was just so sad all around!

So we decided to go for homeschooling for kindergarten. I was so nervous to go for it but it’s turned out to be the best decision ever!

We do a co-op class once a week. Gymnastics and ballet. And then a lot of playground time. We also go on tons of “field trips” to museums, the mountains, the farm etc.

Her confidence has been growing so much! It’s so cool seeing her chat up kids of all ages and play with them.

It seemed like school had crushed her spirit a bit, so watching her grow and spread her wings has been so amazing.

Like another commenter said, it doesn’t have to be forever, take it year by year. But one things for sure, I’m going to look back on this time and be so thankful for these memories we have together.  
  

Homeschooling is a big commitment of the parents’ time to do properly. Does he understand that homeschooling isn’t simply staying home and playing all day?

I've tried to make that clear to him, so yes I think he does understand that.

  

If you do pull him out I recommend finding some kind of activity program or group to join to socialize and have somewhere else to go. It might take a bit of experimenting but I'm sure you guys can find somewhere he fits and feels comfortable expressing himself ♥️ based on my experience he probably feels like a bit of an outsider; recess can be tough without a default set of friends. I would bet it's less about you specifically and more that he's probably experiencing loneliness and other feelings he hasn't had to/doesn't know how to handle, and you're his safe people. I would wait to make a change until he's started therapy, just for the same of not making too many changes at once. And they might have some insights for how to improve his experience.

  

Can he change schools or classes? Sometimes that is all it takes.

He's in a much better school than his assigned school. His teachers are great. He even says he likes school. He just wishes I could be there all day with him, and it's not fair that kids have to be away from their parents so long. His teacher says he smiles all the time and is doing great. However, he goes from happy and exuberant at home to being silent and looking nervous as soon as we go to leave and he always tries to get out of going. It's not a huge battle, but he makes other comments. Yesterday, he said I didn't need him anymore but he still needed me which broke my heart.
