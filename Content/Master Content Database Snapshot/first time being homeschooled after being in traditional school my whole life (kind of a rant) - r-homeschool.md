Hi, I've been in a traditional school my whole life but recently switched to homeschool in 9th grade. I'm 6 months in and I'm having such a hard time. I study by myself and learn the material the school has given me, we have teachers but they don’t directly teach classes. No one tutors me and I'm just by myself. I'm just so used to learning in a teacher-class environment, that I feel like this is just a tiring cycle I do every day. I don't feel motivated and I'm losing my self-discipline. I'm just starting to get anxious, cause I feel like I'm not properly learning or doing things right. I still have so much left to do and I'm just feeling lost. I'm just sharing this because maybe there is someone here who's been in this position before and I just need some advice right now.==

I understand now - you want to keep the format similar to the original while adding a more direct response to the student after quoting them. Here's a revised version:

## **The Hidden Cost of "Hands-Off" Homeschooling**

A 9th grader recently shared their struggle on Reddit after transitioning from traditional school to homeschooling:

_"I study by myself and learn the material the school has given me... No one tutors me and I'm just by myself. I don't feel motivated and I'm losing my self-discipline. I'm just starting to get anxious, cause I feel like I'm not properly learning..."_

To this student: What you're experiencing isn't homeschooling—it's abandonment. Homeschooling is meant to be a relationship, not isolation. Your feelings of anxiety aren't a personal failure; they're a natural response to being left without proper guidance. Please show your parents what you wrote. Ask about co-ops, tutors, or hybrid programs. You deserve support.

For parents: The most successful homeschooling families understand that customized learning requires _more_ adult involvement, not less. Children need guidance, feedback, and someone to notice when they're struggling. Even the most independent learners benefit from structure and accountability.

If you're considering homeschooling, remember that curriculum is just one piece of the puzzle. The relationship and connection you build through learning together is what makes homeschooling powerful. As one commenter wisely noted: "Homeschool is a parent involvement adventure to build the family team."

The beauty of open education is that you don't have to choose between complete independence and traditional schooling—the best approach often lies somewhere in between.

==Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read this! :))==

This student's experience highlights a crucial truth about personalized education: "self-directed" shouldn't mean "on your own."

The most successful homeschooling families understand that customized learning requires _more_ adult involvement, not less. Children need guidance, feedback, and someone to notice when they're struggling. Even the most independent learners benefit from structure and accountability.

For families already on this journey: If your child seems adrift, it may be time to adjust your approach. Consider co-ops, tutors, or community college classes to provide the classroom experience they miss, while maintaining the flexibility of homeschooling.
