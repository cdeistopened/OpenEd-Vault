==As U.S. public schools emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic, longtime education policy wonk Liz Cohen saw that in many places, educators were finally taking tutoring seriously.== 

==For a year and a half in 2023 and 2024, Cohen traversed the country, interviewing educators, researchers and policymakers and observing tutoring sessions in seven states and the District of Columbia**.**==

==Liz Cohen’s new book is The Future of Tutoring: Lessons from 10,000 School District Tutoring Initiatives (Harvard Education Press)==

==Now the vice president of policy for the education group== ==[50CAN](https://50can.org/)====, Cohen shares her findings in a new book, out today from Harvard Education Press:== _==[The Future of Tutoring: Lessons from 10,000 School District Tutoring Initiatives](https://www.amazon.com/Future-Tutoring-Lessons-District-Initiatives/dp/B0DZGKPL4Q)====.==_

==She explores “the accidental experiment” that took place across American schools starting in 2020, as researchers figured out the principles of what was originally called “high-dosage tutoring” but has come to be known as “high-impact tutoring.”== 

==Its four pillars, according to Stanford’s== ==[National Student Support Accelerator](https://nssa.stanford.edu/)====:== 

1. ==It must take place at least three days a week.==
2. ==Sessions last at least 30 minutes.==
3. ==Sessions are with a consistent tutor.==
4. ==There are no more than four students working in a group.== 

==The moment couldn’t have been more tailor-made for such a comprehensive intervention. In the course of just a few months, federal aid to K–12 schools more than tripled, with districts slated to get at least 90% of the new funding. Federal rules eventually dictated that they reserve at least 20% of the largest pot of money to treat pandemic-related learning loss. Tutoring, Cohen writes, “quickly became the watchword of how learning loss should be addressed.”==

==Cohen interviewed everyone from Stanford scholar Susanna Loeb, whose research helped lay the groundwork for the movement, to Katreena Shelby, a Washington, D.C., middle school principal who somehow found a way to get a tutor for every student in her school.==

### ==[Leadership Is Key, Autonomy Matters: Lessons in Why Tutoring Programs Work](https://www.the74million.org/article/leadership-is-key-autonomy-matters-lessons-in-why-tutoring-programs-work/)==

==Ahead of the book’s publication, Cohen spoke to The 74’s Greg Toppo about her findings and her belief that, despite the bleakness of the past few years, educators “want to do good things for kids, and they’re willing to try new things.”==

_==Their conversation has been edited for length and clarity.==_ 

==**I want to start with a kind of impertinent question: I believe it was former U.S. Education Secretary Bill Bennett who said that many schools serve up what he called a “14-egg omelet.” Have you heard of this?**==

==No, but I like where it’s going.==

==**When what they’re doing doesn’t work, they just do more of the same. I’m guessing you would say that high-impact tutoring does**== _==**not**==_ ==**resemble one of Bennett’s lousy omelets. Are schools truly doing something different?**==

==It’s, of course, impossible to answer universally for every school and every tutoring program. And there have been tutoring programs that haven’t been super additive. But at this point, the schools that have implemented high-impact or high-dosage tutoring within the definition of what that is — and to the gold standard that the evidence suggests — are offering something different. Whether that’s home fries on the side of the omelet or a salad, you can choose, but it’s something else.==

==**You write that a couple of places have done better jobs than others. New Mexico, for instance, seems to have made a few missteps. What’s the difference between places where tutoring is working and where it’s not?**==

==Where tutoring works the best is where it is a strategy in service of a broader goal. Sometimes in education we make the mistake of thinking the thing is the goal, and tutoring isn’t the goal. I don’t want people to do tutoring just to do tutoring. I care if kids are learning in school, and so the places that are doing a great job with tutoring, first of all, are doing tutoring in service of the goal of improving learning, and that means it’s often connected to lots of other pieces around instruction, curriculum and all sorts of other things. One is being strategic. Two is recognizing that to do this kind of program well requires a lot of effort on the implementation side, and being willing to put in the resources necessary. Literally assigning someone at a district or at a school a role of high-impact tutoring manager — who a significant part, if not all, of their job for some period of time is making sure this program is working — is another hallmark of places that have had success as well.==

### ==[Under Pilot Program in Texas & Florida, Tutoring Fees Depend on Student Progress](https://www.the74million.org/article/under-pilot-program-in-texas-florida-tutoring-fees-depend-on-student-progress/)==

==**When you were in Louisiana, you looked at this Teach for America Ignite program, and you mention that it’s become a strong pipeline for TFA Fellows and, by extension, teachers. Should we look at tutoring as a pipeline for teaching?**==

==I think so. We have an evergreen population of college students, even if fewer than we used to. We’re always going to have some amount of college students. And what’s generally true about those young adults is that a lot of them are looking for ways to make some money, and a lot of them are not sure what they really want to do with their lives. So one of the interesting things — and the TFA program highlights this — is that when you create opportunities for young people to be involved in education, as a tutor, for example, they start thinking, “Oh, maybe this is a career that I would want to do.”==

==I like to joke that teacher unions have done such a great PR job that they’ve actually convinced people that they shouldn’t want to be teachers. They’ve convinced the American public that teachers don’t get paid enough and aren’t respected. And if you look at parent polls, more than 50% of parents in this country say they== ==[don’t want their kids](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/most-parents-dont-want-their-kids-to-become-teachers-poll-finds/2022/08)== ==to become teachers.==

==But what we’ve learned from some of the tutoring with college students is that when you actually give them a positive framework to enter the education space and interact with young people in this way, they start thinking about it. It’s not just the TFA program — I would say also the== ==[GO Fellowship](https://gofellows.org/?gh_camp=ga&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=15271159437&gbraid=0AAAAADXJ2WDaq3YSTi5z4CKASJXPZl1Z9&gclid=CjwKCAjwup3HBhAAEiwA7euZulAGF2kb_kngEDpZy9poc2vrepBnkfydt9n9iYbkuFqYuGoHhG7wFxoCr10QAvD_BwE)== ==in charter schools in New York and New Jersey, that also has had partnerships in D.C. and other places. Similarly, they’re using college grads through the AmeriCorps program. A lot of those young people end up sticking around and becoming teachers.==

==**At a school in D.C., you met Delilah, who you say could easily pass for a high school student, but she’s doing this great job leading students on a lesson about Homer’s**== _==**Odyssey**==_==******. It made me think that tutoring could blur the boundaries between who is an effective teacher — and how we find them. Do you have any thoughts on that?**==

==I don’t know about “blur,” but it certainly broadens how we might think about who can play effective roles in the learning of young people. And we see that in a few places. This isn’t in the book, but in Chattanooga, Tenn., they had a== ==[program](https://accelerate.us/2024-cea-grantees/)== ==that started during COVID where they actually hired high school students to tutor elementary school students. And those high schoolers, I believe, were getting school credit, and were getting paid. I spoke with this young woman, and she would literally walk down the hill from her high school to the elementary school, where she worked as a tutor and got real-world experience. She said she felt like she was treated like one of the staff at the school, and it was an incredibly positive experience. She is now graduating high school a year early and enrolling at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville to become a teacher, and she’s the first person in her family to go to college.== 

### ==[Learning Loss Win-Win: High-Impact Tutoring in DC Boosts Attendance, Study Finds](https://www.the74million.org/article/learning-loss-win-win-high-impact-tutoring-in-dc-boosts-attendance-study-finds/)==

==The other thing that I did write about is the way that education schools are rethinking the role of tutoring in teacher prep. We have all these college kids or young adults that we might want to expose to education. But then what about those who already think they want to work in education? The dean of the ed school of Bowling Green State University, which is the biggest teacher prep program in Ohio, has always been committed to giving kids as much field work and experience as possible, because she says, “I want to make sure before I send these students as graduates into classrooms, that that’s really where they want to be. How many different kinds of opportunities can we give people who think they want to be teachers to actually play teacher-like roles?” And so they’ve really leaned into tutoring. They think that the experience of me, Liz, trying to really just help Greg master how to read or how to do third-grade math is going to help me in the classroom, but also gives me more touch points to make sure this is really what I want to do.== 

==Another way to think about that: A principal in Alexandria, Va., told me, “The one thing I’m always looking for is how do I get my kids more time? More time learning. How do we give our kids more time?” And it wasn’t just him that I heard this from. This is a repeated theme that school leaders and teachers feel: Tutoring helps them add time. Time on task, quality learning time. And time is often the most precious resource we have in education, and that is how a lot of folks are thinking about this.==

==**One of the things you say is that if tutoring is woven into a school culture, the relationship that the student has with the tutor can be this “fulcrum that changes the student’s trajectory.” You’re imagining that tutoring could really transform schools at a very basic level, that the student-tutor relationship is transformative for a lot of kids.**==

==That’s right. What made this story so powerful was the power of the relationships. To me, the big takeaway is that young people are really hungry for meaningful adult relationships in ways beyond what even the best classroom teacher can possibly give to a full classroom of kids. Even when I interviewed some of those TFA college tutors, the thing they would tell me that surprised them about their experience was that kids were willing to open up to them even after just building a relationship on a Zoom call and doing tutoring. And I don’t know if it’s because after the pandemic there had been so much disconnect and isolation that people were hungry for a reconnect, or if it’s just a truism of human nature that we like to have relationships with other humans.==

==There’s something really powerful about bringing more people in to interact with young people in education, in an educational setting, in a variety of ways. And that’s why, even though generally I’m pretty bullish on tech — I don’t write in the book at all about AI because the stuff’s being built too rapidly — while tech can inform and empower, what’s happened, at least in the last five years, is really a story about human relationships, and it’s worth telling in a time when people feel more separate.==

### ==[It’s Time to Reject Chronic Absenteeism as the New Normal in Student Attendance](https://www.the74million.org/article/its-time-to-reject-chronic-absenteeism-as-the-new-normal-in-student-attendance/)==

==**Near the end of the book, you talk about one way to make tutoring work on a large scale, something called**== ==**[outcomes-based contracting](https://www.the74million.org/article/under-pilot-program-in-texas-florida-tutoring-fees-depend-on-student-progress/)**====**. Would you like to talk about that?**==

==I wrote a whole chapter about contracting, and tried to make it so you wouldn’t fall asleep while you read it. Partly why I dedicated so much space to it is because I actually think that we spend a lot of money on education in this country — we really do — and we don’t often get a lot for it. And so it’s interesting that we have this model now. Tutoring is the perfect case study to do an outcomes-based contract, because we have potentially clear outcomes that we’re trying to measure: We want kids to grow a certain amount, and then we can actually link the money to what we’re getting from it.== 

### ==[Tutoring Is the Teacher Pipeline We’ve Been Missing](https://www.the74million.org/article/tutoring-is-the-teacher-pipeline-weve-been-missing/)==

==Especially now that federal COVID funds== ==[are gone](https://www.the74million.org/article/esser-post-mortem-how-did-districts-spend-190b-in-federal-funds-did-it-work/)====, district and state budgets are tightening. I hope we don’t throw the success of tutoring that we’ve had to the wayside and instead think about how do we continue helping it deliver on its promise? And so if you can measure it and then pay only for getting the results that you want, that seems worthwhile, and something that we probably haven’t spent enough time exploring.==

==**Speaking of ESSER funds, that’s a lot of money that’s basically gone. You mention AmeriCorps as well — AmeriCorps is**== ==**[not in great shape](https://apnews.com/article/americorps-trump-doge-f9f15b48cd67d0ca5dc7b18643f0ca4a)**== ==**either. Going forward, where can schools turn if they want to fund these sorts of things? What’s out there that is not at so much risk?**==

==First of all, some districts are using their Title I funds. Now, those Title I funds might have been used for something else, and so you have to maybe make some tough choices — and I’m not going to say you should definitely do tutoring. I’m saying you should look at the evidence: What are you getting out of whatever it was you were doing? If you’re already doing tutoring and it’s going well, I’d rather a district keep it and give up something else that’s not working as well.==

==Ector County, Texas, has kept their tutoring program going to some extent, using Title I funds. Some other districts have done some similar work, even as districts like Guilford County, N.C., are having to scale back. But they are repurposing existing Title I funds, often to do this. One reason it’s really important to continue making the case for tutoring’s impact is that you can convince state legislatures, in some places at least, to fund tutoring. Louisiana put== ==[$30 million a year](https://doe.louisiana.gov/about/2024/06/17/louisiana-department-of-education-opens-application-for-math-and-literacy-tutoring-providers)====, both for last school year and this current year, into high-impact tutoring. And the funny thing about Louisiana is I didn’t even end up writing about it because it was happening so quickly last year while I was trying to finish the book.==

==I was like, “Wow, it’s a lot of money. Is this really going to happen?” And this year, 2025-2026, Louisiana is tutoring something like 240,000 kids using $30 million from their state budget, and I think some other district funds too, in a pretty effective model tied to their Science of Reading and their math work. And they have funded a lot of other pieces too, around curriculum, teacher professional development and instructional coaches. So for them, tutoring is that exact thing I said earlier about being a strategy within their broader goal of how to overhaul core instruction — and the state’s put in real money for it.==

==Connecticut passed== ==[$5 million](https://ctmirror.org/2025/03/12/do-the-math-connecticuts-investment-in-tutoring-adds-up/)== ==to continue some high-impact tutoring work. But then in other states, we aren’t seeing that. Where to look for money? Can you convince your state legislatures to support tutoring because it works? Some places are able to do that.==

==And also some city budgets: The mayor in D.C. has== ==[put money in](https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-and-osse-announce-7-million-investment-high-impact-tutoring-support-dc-students)====. And the mayor in Nashville has== ==[also put money](https://www.nashville.gov/departments/mayor/news/popular-metro-nashville-public-schools-programs-return-another-school-year-thanks-funding-metro-budget)== ==into tutoring.== 

==**At the end of the book, you lay out these three truisms from your reporting: “1. Public schools are hungry for new ideas that work. 2. Tutoring works. 3. Nothing is perfect.” It sounds like you’re a bit impatient here, and just want us to sort of get on with it.**== 

==I do! Every single day you have kids showing up to school, and those kids either want to learn or it’s our job to help them want to learn, and we need to figure out the tools to do that. If you look, for instance, at continued problems with chronic absenteeism, we flipped a switch during the pandemic, and we thought we could just flip it back on.  That’s not what’s happened. So I believe we have to continue the sense of urgency that we had in 2021 and 2022, because there are kids every day in our schools. But the other thing I really want people to know is that in all of these places I went, people want to do good things for kids, and they’re willing to try new things and implement new programs and make big changes.==

==That’s not the reputation that K-12 public education has overall. And I want people to believe that that is part of the story of public education in the United States in 2025. I want us to get on with it, because it’s what people want to do. So let’s just== _==do==_ ==the thing.==
