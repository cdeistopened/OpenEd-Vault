# CLIP 1: "How AI Could Transform Education"

## HOOK:

"I think we're at the cusp of using AI for probably the biggest positive transformation that education has ever seen." (0:33-0:42)

## SUPPORTING CONTENT:

- "And the way we're going to do that is by giving every student on the planet an artificially intelligent but amazing personal tutor." (0:44-0:51)
- "And we're going to give every teacher on the planet an amazing, artificially intelligent teaching assistant." (0:51-0:57)
- "That could take your average student and turn them into an exceptional student. It can take your below-average student and turn them into an above-average student." (1:41-1:50)
- "The student is against canceling student debt, and we've gotten very clear feedback... The students, the high school students especially, they're saying 'This is amazing to be able to fine-tune my arguments without fearing judgment.'" (7:16-7:32)

## ON-SCREEN CAPTION:

"What if AI could turn every student into an exceptional one?"

"The secret to turning EVERY student into a genius..."

# CLIP 2: "AI Doesn't Replace Writing, It Enhances It"

## HOOK:

"A lot of the narrative has been, 'It's going to do the writing for kids. Kids are not going to learn to write.'" (7:48-7:55)

## SUPPORTING CONTENT:

- "But we are showing that there's ways that the AI doesn't write for you, it writes with you." (7:55-8:00)
- "This is an activity where the student will write two sentences, and then the AI will write two sentences. And so they collaborate together on a story." (8:16-8:24)
- "The student writes, 'Beatrice was a misunderstood ghost. She wanted to make friends but kept scaring them by accident.'" (8:24-8:29)
- "And the AI says, 'Poor Beatrice, a lonely spirit yearning for companionship. One day she stumbled upon an old abandoned mansion,' etc." (8:29-8:36)
- "We think this is going to dramatically accelerate writing, not hurt it." (10:17-10:20)

## ON-SCREEN CAPTION:

"The writing tool that makes kids WANT to write..."
