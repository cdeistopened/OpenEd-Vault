Text: Homeschooling options include hiring private tutors, which can be costly, or utilizing part-time teachers and emerging "micro schools" where families share a teacher. While homeschooling allows for customization and pacing, parental engagement is crucial. Private schools may offer a more cost-effective solution with financial aid available, and they provide flexibility in advancing students and additional tutoring. It's important for parents to remain involved in their child's education to ensure effective learning.

- Why not just send him to public school and hire tutors for the money that would be spent on private? Hiring a good private tutor full time would probably be more expensive than what private schools charge. Expect about $50/hr.
- Yes, I have a private teacher for my kids. She comes twice a week and writes us a weekly assignment sheet to follow each week! She just helps keep us on track since I work full time from home. I pay her $250 per week for 4 hours, we’re in Arizona.
- Where I am from “micro schools” have become very popular. Usually it’s a couple families who pay a teacher a competitive rate just to teach their families. It sounds very expensive to be honest. I only have heard of it in some wealthier areas but it’s a really cool idea. I have meet one of these families and I talked to the teacher. She was a young girl fresh out of college and she preferred the flexibility of working for the 5 families. Each had about 3 kids.
- If you’re handling the administrative aspects of your child’s education—like overseeing progress and meeting state requirements—then you’re a homeschooler. For example, in my state, we have to submit portfolio reviews twice a year, and I’m responsible for that, regardless of any tutors I hire. The cost of one-on-one tutoring varies by state and whether it’s in-person or virtual. Personally, I prefer a customized, individualized approach for my child, which isn’t easily compared to a private school experience. My child has been in both settings, and homeschooling has allowed him to progress at his own pace. If you want to ensure your child is truly learning, I recommend never being fully hands-off. Always stay engaged with what they’re learning and how well they're grasping it. Even with a “good private school,” a quality education isn’t guaranteed. The podcast _Sold a Story_ exposes how even affluent districts have left children without basic literacy skills. People often ask, “How did parents not realize their kids couldn’t read?” The answer is that they trusted others without maintaining a hands-on role.
- It sounds like you're looking for a private school for him. It would likely be cheaper than paying a full-time private teacher. Most private schools offer some sort of financial aid. There is one here that costs $15K-30K per student per year, depending on what grade your child is in. The financial aid could bring that as low as $4200 per student per year, depending on your family size and income. Private schools can usually move him forward in certain classes or get him extra tutoring as needed.
