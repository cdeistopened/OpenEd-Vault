Text: A parent considering homeschooling is interested in "Khan Academy Kids" for their toddlers but is concerned about screen time, as they currently limit screens to family movie nights. They are weighing the benefits of using technology for education against their strict screen time rules.

==We haven't started homeschooling yet as our kids are toddlers but as maths was never something I enjoyed, I have been curious about ways to keep it fun and effective for my kids when the time comes (maybe as of 4 or 5 years old). Khan Academy is something I heard about for adults but I just saw they have a free course for kids up until the age of 7.==

==On the other hand, we are very strict with screen time (basically no screens at all, except for a family movie night once or twice per month where I'll put something on the projector). Has anyone tried Khan Academy with their kids? Maybe it's worth getting a low tech tablet. I'm coming to terms that homeschooling will involve using technology to our advantage. Just have to weigh the pros and cons...==
