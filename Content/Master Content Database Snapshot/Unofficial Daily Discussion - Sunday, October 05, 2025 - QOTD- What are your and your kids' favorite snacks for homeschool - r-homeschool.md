Text: A daily discussion thread encourages homeschooling parents to share their experiences, plans, and resources. New members are invited to introduce themselves, while seasoned homeschoolers can discuss their day, ask questions, and share methods or curriculum. The thread promotes community engagement and adherence to subreddit rules.

==This daily discussion is to chat about anything that doesn't warrant its own post. I am not a mod and make these posts for building the homeschool community.==

==If you are new, please introduce yourself.==

==If you've been around here before or have been homeschooling for awhile, please share about your day.==

==Some ideas of what to share are: your homeschool plans for the day, lesson plans, words of encouragement, methods you are implementing to solve a problem, methods of organization, resource/curriculum you recently came across, curriculum sales, field trip planning, etc.==

==Although, I usually start with a question of the day to get the discussion going, feel free to ask your own questions. If your question does not get answered because it was posted late in the day, you can post the same question tomorrow to make sure it gets visibility.==

==Be mindful of the subreddit's rules and follow reddiquette. No ads, market/ thesis research, or self promotion. Thank you!==
