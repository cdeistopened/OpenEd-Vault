Text: 'A recent report highlights concerns about AI bullying and child exploitation, emphasizing three key points: the introduction of the "Take it Down" bill to swiftly remove inappropriate AI-generated images of minors, the necessity of involving the "Missing and Exploited Children" organization for faster responses from social media companies, and the slow action of schools that often protect offenders. These issues reinforce the decision to homeschool as a response to the toxic culture in schools.'

==I just watched a== ==_60 Minutes_== ==report (which I'll post as a link separately as a response because the video title might cause an auto-flag).==

==Three major takeaways: (1) Ted Cruz and Amy Kobluchar have co-sponsored the "Take it Down" bill to remove inappropriate AI-generated images of minors== ==_immediately_====.==

==(2) Social media companies react more swiftly if parents go through "Missing and Exploited Children" organization. If not, it takes them months or longer, if at all. This was shocking to me that== ==_this_== ==is what's required, but good to know.==

==(3) Schools are slow to act and (surprise) go out of their way to protect offenders.==

==I'm sharing this because even if it doesn't affect you directly, you'll be more knowledgeable to help people you know.==

==This is yet another reason why we homeschool. This is the toxic culture they facilitate.==
