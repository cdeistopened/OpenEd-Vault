### ⚖️ Misattributed to Historical Figures

1. **"Be the change you wish to see in the world."**
    
    ❌ _Not Gandhi_
    
    ✅ Paraphrase of something Gandhi said, but not a direct quote. The closest verified version is:
    
    > "If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change."
    
2. **"Let them eat cake."**
    
    ❌ _Not Marie Antoinette_
    
    ✅ First appears in Rousseau’s _Confessions_ (written when Marie was only 9), and was likely a metaphor for aristocratic obliviousness—not a direct quote from her.
    
3. **"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."**
    
    ❌ _Not Edmund Burke_
    
    ✅ No record of Burke saying this. It's likely a modern paraphrase inspired by his writings.
    
4. **"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."**
    
    ❌ _Not Voltaire_
    
    ✅ Coined by biographer **Evelyn Beatrice Hall** to summarize Voltaire's beliefs.
    
5. **"A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes."**
    
    ❌ _Not Mark Twain_
    
    ✅ Appears in various forms before Twain’s time—often attributed to Jonathan Swift:
    
    > “Falsehood flies, and the Truth comes limping after it.” (1710)

    ❌ _Not Einstein_
    
    ✅ First appeared in a 1981 Narcotics Anonymous pamphlet; also used in _Alcoholics Anonymous_ and possibly _Rita Mae Brown_’s 1983 book _Sudden Death_.
    
2. **"Well-behaved women seldom make history."**
    
    ❌ _Not a feminist rally cry originally_
    
    ✅ Coined by **Laurel Thatcher Ulrich**, a _Harvard historian_, in a 1976 academic article about Puritan women.
    
3. **"If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter."**
    
    ❌ _Not Mark Twain or Winston Churchill_
    
    ✅ **Blaise Pascal**, in a 1657 letter: _“Je n’ai fait celle-ci plus longue que parce que je n’ai pas eu le loisir de la faire plus courte.”_
    
4. **"Blood, sweat, and tears."**
    
    ❌ _Not Churchill’s original phrase_
    
    ✅ He said _“blood, toil, tears and sweat”_ in a 1940 speech. The simplified version came later.
