==I’ve tossed around the idea of homeschooling my kids (5 and 2) for years. As of right now I’m enrolling my 5 year old in public school for the fall, but am willing to pull if I don’t like how it’s going.==

==So I’m always doing research on homeschooling.==

==One thing I’ve always wondered is how does college admissions work? Like do they just take mom/dad’s word for it in what their grades are? Like couldn’t mom/dad say they’re the smartest kids ever with straight A’s on even the most advanced material, but really have no proof of that? Do homeschool kids take entrance exams to prove their knowledge? Same for like scholarships.==

==Just always wondered how that worked when there’s no proof of grades being accurate throughout HS and parents could fudge to get their kids into Harvard or scholarships.==
