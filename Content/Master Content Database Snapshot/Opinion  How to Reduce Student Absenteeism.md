Text: Chronic absenteeism in U.S. schools has surged since the pandemic, prompting a need to rethink educational culture. Many schools still offer uninspiring, compliance-driven experiences, which may contribute to students' disengagement and absence. Engaging students requires a shift in how education is approached.

==**To the Editor:**==

==“====[Pandemic Effect: Absence From Schools Is Soaring](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/29/us/chronic-absences.html)====” (front page, March 30) highlights the persistent challenge of chronic absenteeism in U.S. schools. If pandemic-related “cultural shifts” are among the factors keeping students away from school, bringing them back may require us to rethink the culture of education itself.==

==Despite the efforts of many visionary educators, too many schools still offer a deskbound, test- and compliance-driven experience that leaves students passive, uninspired and flat-out bored.==
