> ==Enjoyed this read. I was struck by Cairo’s atypical path and how her talents went unrecognized for so long although others did occasionally point the way for her.==
> 
> ==Even after solving the problem, many colleges rejected her due to the lack of a high school diploma.==
> 
> ==Also, the doodles on her math solution crack me up. She wasn’t lying when she said math was an expansive escape for her. I can’t help but wonder if that helped at all in finding a solution, that way of thinking.==
