Text: For first graders, Math with Confidence is recommended for its engaging, mastery-based approach with built-in games. Other options include Math Mammoth, which is solid but less engaging, and Right Start Math, which is game-based but more time-consuming. For reading, "Teach My Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons," along with Book Shark and The Good and the Beautiful, are suggested, alongside extensive reading practice with leveled readers and read-alouds.

==I had never heard of those, so I looked them up. I would personally not do technology based curriculum, especially for a first grader. For math, we love Math with Confidence. It has games built in the lessons, and it teaches kids to have a good math sense. It is mastery based and also has review in every lesson.==

==We have also done math mammoth, which is a good solid program but more dry. And right start math, which also uses games to teach but is more time consuming than MwC.==

==For reading, we teach with Teach my child to read in 100 Easy lessons. Then we have used both Book shark and the Good and the Beautiful for language arts. And lots and lots of reading practice both with leveled readers and with read alouds.==
