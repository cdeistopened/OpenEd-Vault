==(Dreamstime)==

==Lindsey Casselman’s two autistic children were in Kindergarten and Grade 2 when she decided it was time to homeschool them.== 

==Her youngest child, a daughter, was over-stimulated by her school environment and acting out at home. Her older child, a son, was disengaged in the classroom.==

==The tipping point came when her son showed her a school project in which he described girls in Afghanistan as “lucky” because they are unable to attend school.==

==“It just hit me …  here is an eight-year-old [whose] … love of learning and curiosity is so fully and completely crushed that he has no appreciation for the gift that is learning,” said Casselman, who runs Schoolio Learning Corp., an online homeschooling platform.==
