Text: Children can improve their math skills through playful visuospatial activities rather than traditional math exercises. Engaging in tasks like building, puzzles, and memory games enhances their ability to visualize and sequence information, which is crucial for math reasoning. Activities are suggested for various age groups, emphasizing the development of foundational skills, mental rotation, and spatial sequencing to foster a strong mathematical understanding.

### ==✨What if I told you, you could help your child get better at math - without doing math?==

==Not only that - but it’d be delightful.==

==Before we get there, I have to explain something== _==wild==_ ==about how your brain does math.==

### ==To your brain, math is visual.==

==You read that right → VISUAL. Technically, it’s visuospatial.==

==Let me explain.==

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!77lO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9540c478-58fc-4749-a1a3-c83409fa9707_5472x3648.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!77lO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9540c478-58fc-4749-a1a3-c83409fa9707_5472x3648.jpeg)

==My Sunshine using Montessori math materials==

==Visual is processing images or patterns; while spatial means handling locations or sequences. Together, this means that your brain thinks of math as objects or patterns in different places or sequences.==

==Math savants will tell you that they “see” the math. They universally use this term. Moreover, there are some people with specialized brains that can look at objects on the floor and count them instantaneously into the hundreds.==

==Most of you aren’t math savants (I’m not either). You also probably don’t think you “see” math, but you do. How many birds are in the picture below?==

==Did you count them 1, 2, 3 - or did you just== _==know==_ ==there were 3. Most of us can only do this trick up to 5, but you can still easily look at the picture below and tell me which has more tulips. You didn’t count them, you visualized them spatially and just== _==knew.==_

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9bqh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe5718c5c-2ae0-4ff7-af79-bb6407bbd5f0_1280x720.jpeg)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9bqh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe5718c5c-2ae0-4ff7-af79-bb6407bbd5f0_1280x720.jpeg)

==The parts of your brain that manage visual information evolved into the parts of your brain that manage math - because math is so physical.==

==Your brain also stores numbers spatially. I want you to imagine the numbers 5 and 50. Now put the 5 in one hand and the 50 in the other. Most of you put the 5 in your left hand and the 50 in your right hand. That’s because you have a spatial representation of numbers in your mind.==

==Cool right? Now, if you were raised in a culture that writes right-to-left, you put the 5 in your right hand. This means that the direction of spatial orientation is not innate, but trained - but spatial orientation exists in everyone’s mind regardless of culture.==

### ==You’re probably thinking that’s cool Claire but why should I care about this?==

==You should care because children’s visuospatial working memory - the ability to hold and manipulate visual and spatial information - is== _==highly==_ ==correlated to math ability.==

==It’s not just related to the ability to do numerical operations (think addition/subtraction) but also math reasoning (think story problems).==

### ==Visuospatial working memory predicts math ability from preschool to high school, and even mathematical reasoning and geometry in adults.==

==Lack of these skills also predicts math difficulty - including dyscalculia.==

_==Side note:==_ ==Dyscalculia and dyslexia commonly occur together so if you have a child with dyslexia it’s worth getting them tested for dyscalculia too.==

==But most importantly👇==

### ==Training visuospatial tasks improves math ability!==

==Not only that, the training is delightful!==

==But, not all visuospatial tasks are created equal. First, let’s talk about the ones you need to train, and then I’ll give you a handy list - by age - to help your kids crush math.==

### ==There are two types of visuospatial tasks that are particularly important to math skills.==

- ==Visuospatial manipulation → Examples: Tetris, using an upside down map, navigating a parking lot==
- ==Spatial-Sequencing → Examples: Building/construction, dance choreography, sports==

==These two categories work together - manipulation builds the== _==mental models==_ ==of space, and sequencing keeps them in== _==order==_==. Train both, and you’re giving your child the mental architecture math thrives on.==

### ==Kids who can picture things in their minds and remember the order of steps have a big advantage in math.==

==These “mind’s eye” skills make it easier to understand shapes, patterns, and how things fit together. The good news? You can grow these skills through simple, playful activities—no worksheets required. Here’s an guide for kids, aged 3-18, you can use at home==

### ==How to Use This List==

==This list is== ==**long on purpose**====—not because you should do everything, but so you have plenty of choices to fit your child’s age, personality, and what you already have at home.==

==You will notice that the activities for ages 3-5 are super common in most households, but these activities are rarely extended to the upper ages, and unless kids have a unique interest in STEM are often are entirely eliminated in the middle/high school years. Thus, take the time to read how these activities grow and change as your child ages. In the younger ages, focus on breadth, in the older ages focus on depth → let them find something they want to work deeply on.==

==I know it doesn’t seem right but letting your kid become great at origami or model planes will help them be better at math!==

==**FINAL NOTE**====: To properly train visuospatial working memory, ideally kids are doing mental rotations. I’ve suggested how to add that to activities below.==

==✨Ages 3–5: Foundational Skills==

---

==**Why it matters:**== ==At this age, kids are wiring their brains to notice shapes, positions, and short sequences—core building blocks for future math reasoning.==

### ==🧩 Hands-on Building & Creating (Visuospatial Manipulation)==

- ==**Wooden Blocks, Magnetic Tiles, Playdough Legos**== ==– Let children make their own. Visuospatial challenge→ make your own objects, ask if your child to see if they can copy you. Then, do mental rotations. Ask them “can you make it upside down” or “on its side”==
- ==**Simple Puzzles (24 pcs)**== ==- Puzzles of increasing pieces great for all ages - these naturally include mental rotations → as kids age 3D puzzles are great.==
- ==**Stacking Cups/Rings**== ==– Stack, flip one, restack - the more alternative methods the better.==
- ==**Shape Sorters**== ==– this is for ages 2-3 typically, but you can make your own shape sorters for older kids with objects that have rotational symmetry which is harder but super fun! The more complex the objects the better.==
- ==**Sandcastle Building**== ==– Same rules as above, kid makes, kid copies, then "upside down” or “on it’s side”==
- ==**Train Tracks**== ==- This costs money, but when you purchase find ones that have up/down or unusual connections. Better buy from multiple different brands and see how the kids put them together.==
- ==**Mirror Play**== ==– This is a fun addition to all the above. Can you build “mirror objects”. Use a mirror to help.==
- ==**Sensory Bin**== ==– Hide shapes and objects, rotate them before revealing.==

### ==🔄 Memory for Steps & Patterns (Spatial Sequencing)==

==Strengthens remembering and ordering multi-step math processes.==

- ==**Simon Says Steps**== ==– 2–3 spatial moves (“left, forward, spin”).==
- ==**Obstacle Course Recall**== ==– Navigate 3–4 moves, repeat.==
- ==**Clapping Patterns**== ==– Clap short rhythms, repeat exactly.==
- ==**Beginner Dance Routines**== ==– 3–4 moves, recall order.==
- ==**Bead/Block Patterns (necklaces, anklets)**== ==– Arrange 3–4, mix, rebuild from memory.==
- ==**Memory Matching Games**== ==– Flip 3–4 cards, recall order.==
- ==**Animal Movement Sequences**== ==– Hop, crawl, spin—recall order.==
- ==**Musical Chairs with Moves**== ==– Add actions to each round.==
- ==**Echo Clapping with Twist**== ==– Repeat, add one motion.==
- ==**Toy Car Path**== ==– Trace a path, remember and retrace.==
- ==**Story Action Sequences**== ==– Act out steps from a story.==

==✨Ages 6–9: Skill Expansion==

---

==**Main Goal:**== ==Strengthen mental rotation and working memory for more complex problem-solving.==

### ==🧩 Hands-on Building & Creating (Visuospatial Manipulation)==

==Supports visualizing multi-step math problems.==

- ==**Lego Builds**== ==– Create small builds from memory. Let them make the same object more than once - let them make their own objects. Also, see if they can make a mirror of the object - you can use a literal mirror to help them do this.==
- ==**Origami**== ==– This can get quite complex and requires a lot of mental rotations when using instructions.==
- ==**Tangram Puzzles**== ==– Build designs from outlines, then recreate rotational symmetric objects==
- ==**Snap Circuits**== ==– Assemble simple circuits from diagrams, recall after viewing. Snap circuits are also a super fun for your engineering-focused kids!==
- ==**3D Model Kits**== ==– Assemble and reassemble! As kids get older, see if they can start to guess where things go. It’s about learning how to do these WITHOUT instructions.==
- ==**Cube Puzzles**== ==– Solve after imagining 1–2 rotations.== _==(Rubik’s-type - but there are other choices)==_ ==Canoodle is a great choice and inexpensive. Tetris is also VERY good.==
- ==**Magnetic Marble Runs**== ==– Build, mentally swap sections, rebuild.==
- ==**Pattern Block Designs**== ==– Copy patterns from memory. You can get create and do mosaic art. These can get quite complex. Watch== ==[THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9IFK8i0iSM)== ==video on this incredible glass mosaics and then have your kids try to figure out how to create their own.==
- ==**Construction Straws**== ==– Build shapes from diagrams without looking.==

### ==🔄 Memory for Steps & Patterns (Spatial Sequencing)==

==Improves mental ordering of longer processes.==

- ==**Pattern Replication**== ==– Copy color/shape patterns from memory.==
- ==**Drawing from Memory**== ==– Having them draw from their environment is great for visuospatial, but it’s even better if they can start trying to do it from memory too!==
- ==**Clay Replicas**== ==– Same rules as above - learn to do it with observation first, then through memory.==
- ==**Card Flip Order**== ==– Recall order of 5 flipped cards. This one is kinda contrived, but think about games like mahjong or blackjack where “counting” cards is helpful to winning.==
- ==**Mini Chess Challenges**== ==– Having them memorize chess patterns of expert players and then figuring out when to use them in game play will be very helpful.==
- ==**Marble Maze Recall**== ==– Navigate a maze, then repeat path. Have them start making their own mazes.==
