==I think I want to homeschool. I've done a lot of research on different types and I have a background in teaching/tutoring. I feel confident in my ability to either provide or outsource appropriate instruction for my kids in terms of academics.==

==My concerns are more about socialization. I know, I know that traditional schooling really just perpetuates socialization by proximity. I went to school and heard almost daily, "you're here to learn, not to socialize!"==

==How much socialization is enough? I get there are co-ops, sports, cub scouts, music lessons etc that all provide options for social interaction. But how do you know they're getting what they need? In other words, you can assess the academic but what's the benchmark for social interaction?==

==Another concern I have is that my kids are more reserved and when we go to playgrounds/library/play groups they tend to keep to themselves. They do great with their cousins and kids they know really well, but are generally slow to warm. It's not a bad thing by any means just makes it harder to feel like I'm meeting their social needs if that makes sense.==

==ETA Thank you all so much for the perspectives, advice and responses. My kids are only 4 and 2 so we are right at the start of the journey which makes it equally terrifying and exciting. We definitely plan on introducing our kids to a variety of extracurriculars and love the idea of the flexibility homeschooling provides for allowing our kids to follow their passions while still getting a well-rounded, developmentally appropriate and safe education.==
