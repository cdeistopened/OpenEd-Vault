Text: The author discusses the high cost of the All About Reading program and proposes an alternative using resources like The Ordinary Parents Guide to Teaching Reading, Explode the Code workbooks, decodable readers, and games to enhance reading skills without significant expense. They seek feedback on how this alternative compares to the original program.

==The all about reading programs sounds great, but at 250 dollars a year for just reading.... it's a tough ask. I've kinda created a make shift alternative and am open to suggestions.==

==The Ordinary Parents Guide to Teaching Reaading (Main Curriculum) Explode the Code Workbooks (Supplement) Decodable readers like Bob Books for additional practice and confidence. Maybe finish off with Reading Pathways for Fluency and comprehension And also adding games like Zingo, Flashcards, and magnet letters along the way.==

==For those who've done all about reading and maybe some of these. How would all this stack up together to the program without spending an arm and a leg?==
