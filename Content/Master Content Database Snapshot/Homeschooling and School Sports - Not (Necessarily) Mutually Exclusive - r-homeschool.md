Text: A homeschooling family emphasizes the importance of sports and physical fitness for their children, highlighting their sons' participation in high school baseball and football. They faced challenges with eligibility and integration into public school sports but believe athletic opportunities are essential for homeschooled kids. To support other homeschooling families, they created a 30-day Homeschool PE Curriculum to enhance sports involvement and fitness education.

==My wife and I homeschool our 9 children. We are a sports minded family, so fitness and athletic involvement is a critical aspect of our approach to teaching our kids to become fully educated. We honestly feel like it's a disservice to kids who are homeschooled to not give them athletic opportunities that their peers in school typically get access to.==

==Our two oldest boys just helped their high school baseball team in Tennessee win a state championship. There was a bit of an uphill battle getting them to be eligible to play on the team, and they didn't fit in very well with most of the team. This is one of those situations where we saw a lot of clashing with the public school mentality.==

==Despite our (half-hearted) protests, our boys are now playing high school football. It's a much more dangerous sport, but they've learned a lot about how to deal with serious physical adversity.==

==Because of our experience with homeschooling families who tend to be on top of everything on the academic side, but who tend to need help with the sports and athletics side of things, we published a== ==[30-day Homeschool PE Curriculum](https://robbinsathletics.com/homeschool-pe-curriculum/)== ==that we hope will help homeschool families with their commitment to sports, physical fitness, and the benefits that come from athletic competition.==
