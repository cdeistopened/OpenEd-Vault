# OPENING LETTER

Greetings Eddies!

One of my favorite illustrations of the power of open education comes from Isaac's oldest son, who was homeschooled until midway through high school.

Up to that point, he had avoided math entirely. Then he speedran through 9 years of Khan Academy math in one summer so he could attend public school and not be behind his peers.

The story goes against everything we hear about kids falling further behind once they fall behind. And in this case, the motivation to catch up was attending public school. Just imagine what happens when a kid's *own* motivation kicks in—when they want something badly enough that they'll teach themselves in a summer what took everyone else nine years?

That's what this week is about. We're diving into the math question every parent asks: "How do I teach something I never learned myself?" The answer is the same as Isaac's experience: you don't. You architect. You find the right tools and let your kid's motivation do the work.

Not a "math person"? Perfect. This one is especially for you.

# DEEP DIVE: Best Homeschool Math Curriculum

The myth is simple: you either have a math brain or you don't.

It's also completely wrong.

All humans are born with number sense. Babies a few days old can distinguish between two and three. Somewhere between birth and pre-algebra, things go sideways for a lot of kids—usually when they don't fully grasp a foundational concept before their class moves on anyway. In traditional school, you can't pause for an individual student. They get shuffled forward with the belief that they're "not a math person."

That belief sticks. It becomes self-fulfilling.

This is where open education changes the game. Laura Feller never took calculus. When her youngest son reached algebra, she panicked—how could she teach something she'd never learned? Then she shifted her mindset. She wasn't going to be his math teacher. She was going to be his architect. Her job: find the resources that teach it well, get out of the way, and let him learn.

Her son is now doing calculus with a curriculum she's never studied. He calls when he gets stuck. Someone answers. He learns. This isn't magic—it's what happens when parents stop thinking they need to know everything and start thinking about which tools fit their kid's brain.

**Different kids genuinely need different approaches.** When OpenEd founder Matt Bowman surveyed 92 families about their favorite math curriculum, he expected winners and losers. Instead, he got 92 different answers. Even more surprising: a mother with triplet teenage girls—same DNA, same household, same parents. Two of them loved one curriculum. The third needed something completely different.

The solution isn't finding the One True Curriculum. It's understanding that kids learn math three different ways. Mastery-based programs like Math-U-See force complete understanding before moving forward. Conceptual programs like Singapore Math make the why visible before the how. Spiral programs like Horizons Math touch multiple concepts and return to them deeper. Some kids thrive with structure. Others need variety. Your job is matching the tool to the kid, then being willing to switch if September's choice doesn't work for October.

The silver lining: math is unusually modular. If Teaching Textbooks isn't clicking in November, you can switch in December without destroying continuity. You don't need a credential. You don't need to have mastered calculus. You just need to be willing to architect.

# PODCAST HIGHLIGHT: The Etsy Effect—How (Not) to Kill Your Child's Passions

Brenna Clarke Gray is an educational technologist who studies how universities buy technology. But her real obsession is this: what kills a kid's love of learning faster than anything else?

Her 8-year-old loves mythology. Stacks of books. Mythology podcasts. A million facts about ancient civilizations from everywhere. She figured: *perfect, he'll want to do school projects on mythology*.

Wrong.

"Nothing kills intrinsic motivation like assigning grades to it," Brenna says. She saw it happen. The moment she suggested turning his passion into a project, into something graded, something with external standards and expectations—it didn't disappear exactly, but it changed. It became less *his* and more *assigned*.

She uses the perfect metaphor: "Everybody who's really good at a craft and then they open an Etsy store and then they hate that craft. As soon as you impose external standards and expectations on that thing you just loved for the love of it—that kills what makes you want to keep learning about it."

The question this week isn't just about math curriculum. It's about whether the tools and systems we choose support intrinsic motivation or kill it. Spoiler: this conversation belongs in every parent's house.
