# Newsletter Subject Line Options - Week of Nov. 7

## Source Content Summary
Newsletter focuses on homeschool math curriculum—how parents don't need to be math experts themselves, just architects choosing the right tools. Features Laura Feller's calculus story, Brenna Clarke Gray's insight on intrinsic motivation, and 12+ math learning platforms with different pedagogical approaches.

## Core Transformation
- **Problem:** Parents feel unqualified to teach math (or higher subjects), especially if they didn't take calculus themselves
- **Goal:** Find the right tools and systems so kids can learn independently
- **Path:** Understand that different kids need different approaches; you architect, don't teach
