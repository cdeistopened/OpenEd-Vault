# Week of Nov. 7 — Checkpoint 1: Outline

## DEEP DIVE: Best Homeschool Math Curriculum
**Feature:** OpenEd article on homeschool math approaches

**Current Length Target:** 3-4 paragraphs (third-person teaser)

**Key Points to Include:**
- The myth: "You either have a math brain or you don't" — debunked
- The real problem: Kids fall behind when they don't grasp foundational concepts before the class moves forward
- The solution: Personalization. Laura Feller's story — couldn't teach calculus herself, but found resources that could
- The architecture mindset: Parents as architects choosing the right tools, not as subject-matter experts
- Three main philosophical approaches: Mastery-based, Conceptual/Visual, Spiral/Incremental
- Why it matters: Different kids need different approaches (even triplets!)

**Format:**
- Paragraph 1: Hook with Laura's story or the "math person" myth
- Paragraph 2: Core insight (personalization over one-size-fits-all)
- Paragraph 3: The three approaches + why flexibility matters
- Paragraph 4: Silver lining (parents don't need to know all the math; they just need to architect)

## PODCAST HIGHLIGHT
**Feature:** Brenna Clarke Gray episode from OpenEd Podcast

**Topic:** "The Etsy Effect: How (Not) to Kill Your Child's Passions"

**Structure:**
- Hook: Brenna's observation about intrinsic motivation and how external rewards kill passion
- 1-2 direct quotes showing the main tension (grades destroying love of learning, the mythology example)
- Context: Why this matters for parents architecting learning environments
- Resource links: Website, Community of Praxis Podcast, relevant resources

**Length:** 2-3 paragraphs, tight

**READY FOR APPROVAL?**

Key decisions to validate:

1. **Deep Dive focus:** Is the math curriculum article the right choice, or should Brenna's episode be the deep dive instead?
2. **Podcast Highlight tone:** Should we focus on Brenna's passion-killing insight, or lead with her broader educational philosophy?
3. **Links We're Hovering Over:** Which trends should lead? (Punk rock choice, North Star/unschooling, or reading readiness?)
4. **Meme direction:** What visual or concept would best tie this week together?
5. **Tools count:** 15 items—should I trim to 10-12?

Let me know what adjustments you'd like before we move to Phase 3 (Full Newsletter Draft).
