## THE HEAVY LIFTING MYTH

COVID happened. And all of these families were stuck at home doing the online version of their school.

And they realized: whoa, what they're actually doing and learning in school is not that much. If they didn't learn this, nothing really that bad would happen.

They also learned something else. *I kind of like having my kids home more.* Maybe they want their kids to go somewhere and be with other kids a couple times a week, but they don't want them out all the time. And the kids don't like it either.

We started baking together. We started doing things together. The number of parents I talked to were like, "It was actually really magical during COVID when my kids were home from school and we were all together."

Wait a second - all this heavy lifting that I thought the conveyor belt education system was doing? **It wasn't doing any of it.** My kid didn't go for months and they were fine. They didn't fall behind.

They were actually happier than ever.

## FOUR TRENDS RESHAPING EDUCATION

Hannah Frankman ([@hannahfrankman](https://x.com/hannahfrankman)) writing for [The Daily Economy](https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/four-post-covid-trends-are-reshaping-american-education/) identifies four post-COVID shifts quietly rewriting American education:

**1. Zoom school revealed the rot.** Parents watched their kids' classrooms in real-time and were horrified. *This* is what they do all day?

**2. Homeschooling lost its stigma.** Overnight, it went from fringe practice to shared cultural experience. "You can't say 'homeschoolers are weirdos' without a tinge of irony if you yourself were once a homeschooling parent."

**3. Remote work broke the childcare trap.** If parents work from home, they don't need school as daycare. The default crumbled.

**4. Families migrated to choice-friendly states.** 18 states have implemented universal school choice since 2020. Policy is catching up to culture.

The numbers: public school enrollment dropped 2.5% between 2019-2023 and keeps falling. Austin's school district lost 10,000 students while the city gained 100,000 residents. Satisfaction with public schools hit a 25-year low.

COVID is becoming history. But its fingerprints are everywhere.

## TOOLS THAT INVITE CURIOSITY

Claire Honeycutt ([@clairehoneycutt](https://x.com/clairehoneycutt)), a 20-year classroom teacher turned homeschool mom, compiled [tools that actually earn their shelf space](https://www.clarified.life/p/tools-that-build-a-curious-home). Not curricula. Not systems. Just things that shape atmosphere and invite curiosity.

Her top picks:

**Build the home library first.** "If you do nothing else on this list: build the home library." Books within reach summon learning in ways worksheets never will. It doesn't have to be fancy - just present.

**National Park Pass ($80/year).** The Junior Ranger program turns every hike into a self-guided nature and history lesson. Bonus: 4th graders get a free pass.

**Anywhere-school backpacks.** Keep them packed with school books. When you want to take learning on the road, there's no friction. "Grab your bags, let's go."

The insight behind all of it: "You don't need a room full of gadgets to build a rich, beautiful life with your kids. You just need a handful of well-chosen tools."

Curiosity can't be forced. But it can be invited.
