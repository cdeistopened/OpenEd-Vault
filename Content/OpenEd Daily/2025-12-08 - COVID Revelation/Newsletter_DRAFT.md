## THE HEAVY LIFTING MYTH

{Let's rewrite this in Isaac's voice first person}

COVID gave millions of families an accidental experiment.

For months, the educational conveyor belt ground to a near halt. Kids stayed home. Parents braced for disaster. And then... nothing collapsed.

Isaac Morehouse captured what so many parents discovered: "All this heavy lifting that I thought the conveyor belt education system was doing, **wasn't doing any of it**. My kid didn't go for months and they were fine. They didn't fall behind. They were actually happier than ever."

The revelation went deeper than academics. Families started baking together. Reading together. Actually *being* together. Many parents told Isaac the same thing: "It was actually really magical during COVID when my kids were home."

The system had been getting credit for work it wasn't doing. When families took over, nothing fell apart. Something clicked into place.

## FOUR TRENDS RESHAPING EDUCATION

{give credit to Hannah Frankman right away and note the outlet where she's writing this - don't feel the need to connect it to the thought. People will make that connection on their own}

That personal revelation didn't stay personal. It rippled outward into four structural shifts that are [quietly rewriting American education](https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/four-post-covid-trends-are-reshaping-american-education/).

**1. Zoom school revealed the rot.** Parents watched their kids' classrooms in real-time and were horrified. *This* is what they do all day?

**2. Homeschooling lost its stigma.** Overnight, it went from fringe practice to shared cultural experience. As the article puts it: "You can't say 'homeschoolers are weirdos' without a tinge of irony if you yourself were once a homeschooling parent."

**3. Remote work broke the childcare trap.** If parents work from home, they don't need school as daycare. The default crumbled.

**4. Families migrated to choice-friendly states.** 18 states have implemented universal school choice since 2020. Policy is catching up to culture.

The numbers tell the story: public school enrollment dropped 2.5% between 2019-2023 and keeps falling. Austin's school district lost 10,000 students while the city *gained* 100,000 residents. Satisfaction with public schools hit a 25-year low.

COVID is becoming history. But its fingerprints are everywhere.

## TOOLS THAT INVITE CURIOSITY

{If you were one of the families that, or if you're late in jumping on the band, actually, you know what? Let's not make such a leap to try to connect it. Let it in on its own. Also Clara Borromeo on X, what the heck? No, Claire Honeycutt}

So you've made the leap. Now what?

Claire, a 20-year classroom teacher turned homeschool mom, compiled [tools that actually earn their shelf space](https://www.clarified.life/p/tools-that-build-a-curious-home). Not curricula. Not systems. Just things that shape atmosphere and invite curiosity.

Her top picks:

**Build the home library first.** "If you do nothing else on this list: build the home library." Books within reach summon learning in ways worksheets never will. It doesn't have to be fancy - just present.

**National Park Pass ($80/year).** The Junior Ranger program turns every hike into a self-guided nature and history lesson. Bonus: 4th graders get a free pass.

**Anywhere-school backpacks.** Keep them packed with school books. When you want to take learning on the road, there's no friction. "Grab your bags, let's go."

The insight behind all of it: "You don't need a room full of gadgets to build a rich, beautiful life with your kids. You just need a handful of well-chosen tools."

Curiosity can't be forced. But it can be invited.

{where is the fourth bonus segment with the meme about 14,000 hours with your family? actually scratch that. We're going to post a meme of a kitten firing lasers out of its eyes, riding a unicorn, and saying "Home school parents when COVID hit." The implication is that they've been doing this all along. They're familiar with it. And then the background music playing on the reel is "Welcome to the Jungle." we just need to come up with 10 possible captions that we could put on this post to you know like "If you know, where were you?" or "You know something like that." I don't know}
