# Checkpoint 1: Angles & Structure - December 8, 2025 (v2)

---

## SUBJECT LINE (My Pick)

**"The heavy lifting school wasn't doing"**

Why: It's a direct quote from the source that sticks. It's counterintuitive (school = heavy lifting in most parents' minds), creates curiosity (what heavy lifting?), and captures the entire thesis of the newsletter in 6 words.

Runner-up: "Austin lost 10,000 students. The city grew by 100,000." - Great specificity, but feels more like a Trend lead than a Thought lead.

## SEGMENT 1: THE HEAVY LIFTING MYTH (Thought)

**Source:** Isaac Morehouse / Minimalists Clip

**Angle:** The conveyor belt got credit for work it wasn't doing. COVID exposed this. Kids didn't fall behind - they were happier than ever.

**Structure:**
- **Hook:** COVID gave parents an accidental experiment.
- **Substance:** Morehouse quote - "All this heavy lifting that I thought the conveyor belt education system was doing, wasn't doing any of it. My kid didn't go for months and they were fine."
- **Insight:** The system's value was assumed, not proven. When families took over, nothing collapsed.

**Title Options:**
1. THE HEAVY LIFTING MYTH
2. WHAT THE CONVEYOR BELT WASN'T DOING
3. THE ACCIDENTAL EXPERIMENT

## SEGMENT 2: THE TRUST COLLAPSE (Trend)

**Source:** The Daily Economy - Four Post-COVID Trends

**Angle:** Focus on the trust erosion and the taboo-breaking. The structural changes (policy, migration) flow from the cultural shift.

**Key Data Points:**
- Public school satisfaction at 25-year low
- Enrollment dropped 2.5% nationally (2019-2023), still falling
- Austin lost 10,000 students while city grew by 100,000
- 18 states implemented universal school choice since 2020
- "You can't say 'homeschoolers are weirdos' if you yourself were once a homeschooling parent"

**Structure:**
- **Hook:** Austin's population grew by 100,000. Its school district lost 10,000 students.
- **Substance:** The pandemic shattered two things - the illusion that public schools were trustworthy institutions, and the taboo around alternatives. Homeschooling went from fringe to "something everyone could imagine."
- **Insight:** Policy is catching up to culture. 18 states now have universal school choice.

**Title Options:**
1. THE TRUST COLLAPSE
2. FROM FRINGE TO NORMAL
3. WHAT 18 STATES DID NEXT

## SEGMENT 3: ATMOSPHERE OVER CURRICULUM (Tool)

**Source:** Claire / Clarified Life - Tools That Build a Curious Home

**Angle:** You don't need fancy curricula. You need a handful of well-chosen tools that shape atmosphere and invite curiosity.

**Featured Tools (pick 2-3):**
- **Home Library:** "If you do nothing else on this list: build the home library." Books summon learning.
- **National Park Pass ($80):** Junior Ranger program turns every hike into a self-guided lesson. 4th graders get free pass.
- **Anywhere-School Backpacks:** Always packed, zero friction. "Grab your bags, let's go."

**Structure:**
- **Hook:** You don't need a room full of gadgets.
- **Substance:** Claire (20-year teacher turned homeschool mom) shares tools that earn their shelf space. Start with the home library - books "summon" learning in ways worksheets never will.
- **Insight:** Curiosity can't be forced. But it can be invited.

**Title Options:**
1. ATMOSPHERE OVER CURRICULUM
2. TOOLS THAT INVITE CURIOSITY
3. BUILD THE LIBRARY FIRST

## OPENING LETTER APPROACH

**My Pick: Lead with the Revelation**

Greetings Eddies!

COVID gave millions of parents an accidental experiment.

For months, the conveyor belt stopped. Kids stayed home. And something unexpected happened - nothing collapsed. In fact, many families discovered their kids were *happier* than they'd been in years.

Isaac Morehouse put it this way: "All this heavy lifting that I thought the conveyor belt education system was doing, wasn't doing any of it."

Today: what parents learned, what happened next, and tools that invite curiosity without forcing it.

Let's dive in.

- [x] **Tool:** Practical application (build the environment)
- [x] **Distinct but connected:** All three flow from the COVID moment but address different dimensions
- [x] **Sarah would forward:** Validates her journey, gives language, offers action
