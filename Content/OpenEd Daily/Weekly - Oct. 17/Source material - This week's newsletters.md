# The Lawnmower Fallacy

Growing up, my mom would always say, "You boys should take a small engine repair class." I don't know where she got this idea—she must have associated it with being a useful grown man. I never did and I still don’t know how to repair small engines. Here I am today: I do work that I love, but have no clue how to fix my lawnmower. If it breaks, I’m fortunate that I can hire someone to fix it.

But my mom still has this thing—and I love her for it.

For some people, it's much bigger than that. It's like, "I only view you as successful if you have a degree."

I've met entrepreneurs who are thriving—making great money, happy with their lives—yet their parents are _still_ disappointed they didn't get a degree. Once we lock onto an idea of what success should look like for our kids, it's hard to let go.

# The Soft Bigotry of Education Blather

Rick Hess at [AEI calls out "the soft bigotry of education blather"](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/the-soft-bigotry-of-education-blather/) as high school seniors post their worst reading scores since 2005. Half score below basic in math—meaning they can't read tables or apply percentages. That _sounds_ bad, but The National Association of Secondary School Principals insists test scores are "only one lens for understanding success" and calls for more funding so students can "thrive."

We agree standardized tests aren't the best North Star for education. But Hess says this is blather:

"Forget thriving—huge numbers of America's 17-year-olds aren't even learning to read or do math."

Schools can't bomb the test and then decide tests don't matter. Either commit to improving the metrics you chose, or ditch them and measure something else.

# In the Field

The [Abeka blog](https://www.abeka.com/blog/homeschool-field-trip-ideas/) rounded up some simple, low-cost field trip ideas that beat a week of classroom worksheets. Here are some of our favorites, and the subjects they can be linked to:

1. **Apple orchard or cider mill** – Economics (price comparisons), botany (pollination), agriculture (harvesting)
2. **Nature hike** – Ecosystems, plant identification, observation journaling
3. **Local theater or symphony** – Literature, storytelling, plot structure, character development
4. **Career day visit** – Interview a baker, contractor, or nurse; build communication skills
5. **Garden center or nursery** – Plant species, photosynthesis, soil science, responsibility
6. **Fire station or police department** – Civics, community roles, safety, public service

# Word of the Day: Blather

**blath·er** | /ˈblæðər/ | _verb, noun_

To talk long-windedly without making much sense; foolish or meaningless talk. Old Norse _blaðra_.

**Example:** "The superintendent's response was pure blather—lots of buzzwords about 'holistic learning environments' but zero accountability for falling test scores."

# Einstein had a tutor? | OpenEd (1)

‍**THOUGHT:** Einstein Had a Tutor**TREND:** High-Impact Tutoring**TOOL:** What to Do With Genius

# Einstein Had a Tutor

Newton said he stood "on the shoulders of giants." We remember the genius—we forget the giants who lifted him up.

We mythologize genius as isolated. Some kid alone in a room, brilliant thoughts from nowhere. But Max Talmud introduced Einstein to geometry at age 12. Bertrand Russell had tutors until 16. John von Neumann's governesses taught him languages. Darwin hired tutors at university. Name a genius, find a tutor.

Erik Hoel calls this "aristocratic tutoring"—not SAT-prep, but intellectuals spending real time engaging young minds. We stopped doing it. And we stopped making Einsteins.

The internet gave us information access. But access isn't engagement. What's missing isn't information—it's the Max Talmuds. The people who hand you the right book at the right time and stick around to talk about it.

Modern homeschoolers have options aristocrats would envy. Virtual tutors, AI tutors, college students looking to earn. You can recreate the conditions that historically produced genius.

# High-Impact Tutoring

After COVID, schools tried something desperate: actual tutoring. High-impact tutoring—at least three times a week, 30 minutes minimum, consistent tutor, no more than four students. Federal money flooded in. And it worked!

[Liz Cohen spent 18 months visiting schools](https://www.the74million.org/article/the-post-pandemic-promise-of-high-impact-tutoring/) across seven states for her new book [_The Future of Tutoring_](https://a.co/d/1kd3UA4). She found that places that treated tutoring as strategy (not just intervention) saw results.

"The average tutored student was above 98% of the students in the control class."

One D.C. principal got a tutor for every student in her school. Louisiana put $30 million into tutoring and now serves 240,000 kids.

Cohen heard repeatedly that kids are hungry for meaningful adult relationships beyond what even the best classroom teacher can give a full class.

We've [known since the 1980s](https://web.mit.edu/5.95/www/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf) that tutored students perform two standard deviations better. We just weren't desperate enough to try it at scale until COVID forced our hand.

Education experts designed a system that produces worse outcomes with each passing year, then get mad when parents opt out.

Maybe the experts should learn slower?

# What is Open Education? | OpenEd (1)

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e31168e49f5b7e6f76f0e5/68f00437a9b9895cde92b746_Youtubepodcast%20thumbnail%20\(1\).png)

Imagine you're on a game show. The host gestures to a stage, revealing three massive doors, and shouts, "It's time to choose your child's future!"

Behind **Door #1** is your local school district. It's a known quantity—solid and dependable. You know what you're getting: a built-in community, a familiar structure, and no upfront cost.

Behind **Door #2**, you get a choice of several curated private school packages. There's the local Catholic school, the innovative tech-focused magnet school, or the quirky, nature-based forest school. Each offers a distinct philosophy and a strong community, but they come with a hefty price tag and their own set of non-negotiables.

Then there's **Door #3**. You push it open and find yourself standing at the entrance to a dizzying, endless hallway. A hundred smaller doors stretch out before you into the horizon, each labeled with a different curriculum, co-op, or educational philosophy. This is the homeschool option—the ultimate freedom, _but also the ultimate burden of choice_.

For generations, this has been the game. You pick a door, then maybe another door, and hope you've chosen wisely.

But education isn't actually a game show where you have to swear loyalty to what's behind a single door. Perhaps we need a better analogy.

Let's think of education as a kind of computer operating system.

An operating system (OS) is the foundational software that runs everything on a device. It dictates what programs you can use and how they work together. For the last 150 years, the vast majority of us have been using the same one.

The prize behind Door #1, the public school, is like a corporate PC from the 90s—it comes pre-loaded with approved software (Windows 95), it's hard to customize, and it's designed for institutional efficiency, not the individual user.

The options behind Door #2 are like niche computer brands that run a proprietary version of that same OS. And the endless hallway behind Door #3, homeschooling, has traditionally been like building your own computer from scratch—a powerful option, but only accessible to the most dedicated hobbyists.

The reason you can't easily take the math program from the tech magnet school, the nature walks from the forest school, and the literature list from a Classical curriculum is the same reason you can't run an iPhone app on a Windows PC. They were built to run on different, incompatible platforms.

The solution isn't another door. The solution is a better operating system.

This is [open education](https://opened.co/open-education). It's the modern, flexible education OS (eOS)designed for the user, not the institution. It's the platform that finally allows you to download and run the best "apps" from every tradition—[Montessori](https://opened.co/open-education/montessori), [Classical](https://opened.co/open-education/classical-education), [virtual](https://opened.co/open-education/virtual-school), project-based—and have them all work together seamlessly on a single platform.

To see how we get to this new, open-source future, we first have to understand the story of the closed-source code we all inherited.

## The Story of Our Outdated eOS

The operating system we've all been running was designed in the 1840s. Its lead architect, [Horace Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Mann), saw a nation grappling with the chaos of the Industrial Revolution and prescribed a powerful solution: the "[common school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_school)."

It was a brilliant piece of social engineering for its time. It took a diverse, scattered, and largely uneducated populace and created a scalable system to produce literate citizens and competent factory workers. Its core features—age-based grades, a standardized curriculum, bell schedules, and batch processing of students—seemed revolutionary. It was, in effect, a human assembly line.

The rigidity of this system wasn't a bug; it was the central feature. Standardization was the goal.

As Matt Bowman and Isaac Morehouse put it in the [_Open Education_ book](https://opened.co/book):

_"The system sorted children by manufacture date (what we now call grade levels), processed them into batches, and tested their conformity at regular intervals. Those who didn't fit the mold were labeled as troublemakers or failures."_

The problem is that while every other industry has undergone relentless reinvention, the basic architecture of school has remained frozen in time. The education OS designed for the 1840s is still running on the devices of the 2020s. A doctor from 1900 would be utterly lost in a modern hospital, but a teacher from that same era could walk into most classrooms today and know what to do (assuming they could figure out how to get their pupils to put their smartphones away).

This stagnant, closed-source eOS created the walled gardens we see today. Brilliant innovators like [Maria Montessori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Montessori) and [Susan Wise Bauer](https://susanwisebauer.com/) created incredible new approaches to learning, but to use them, families felt like they had to go all-in. These philosophies became their own isolated ecosystems because the mainstream system was too rigid to accommodate them.

## The Great Unbundling Begins

For decades, the system chugged along. But in the 21st century, the cracks began to show.

The internet was the first major shock to the system. Suddenly, world-class expertise was no longer confined to a single building. The "unbundling" began as families realized they could get a better math component from [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) or a more engaging history class from an [Outschool](https://outschool.com/) teacher. The monolithic bundle of "school" started to come apart.

As education researcher [Michael Horn](https://michaelbhorn.com/) observed, we are seeing "a gradual move away from the one-size-fits-all model of schooling toward more personalized, à la carte educational options."

Starting in the 1960s, pioneering parents rediscovered home-based learning. It was mostly illegal until court victories throughout the 1980s made it safe, but still fringe. These early homeschoolers created networks, newsletters, co-ops, sports leagues, conferences, and publishing houses. They showed a different way was possible.

By the early 1990s, homeschooling had grown from 250,000 students in the 1980s to over 1 million. Today, there are approximately [3.5 million homeschooled students in the U.S.](https://nces.ed.gov/)—and the definition of "homeschool" keeps expanding.

Then came the pandemic, the single greatest stress test the system had ever faced. For millions of parents, it was the moment their old eOS finally crashed.

The numbers tell the story. Public school enrollment dropped by 1.2 million students across thirty-seven states. Homeschooling grew by about 1 million during that same period. Parents everywhere had the same realization: _Wait, I can do this?_

Kerry McDonald, a leading voice in alternative education and the author of [_Joyful Learning_](https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/kerry-mcdonald/joyful-learning/9781541705524/), explains: "Remote learning gave parents an up-close view of what was actually happening in their students' classrooms... A lot of the parents and founders that I've talked to said, 'Hey, I can do this. This isn't rocket science.'"

The pandemic didn't create dissatisfaction with traditional schooling—parents had been frustrated for years. What it did was fulfill the third condition necessary for change: belief in your ability to create something better. Parents discovered their kids could take weeks off from formal learning without falling behind—a revelation that challenged everything they'd been told about educational necessity.

[Tyler Thigpen](https://www.tylerthigpen.com/), founder of [The Forest School (an Acton Academy)](https://theforest.school/), explains what remote learning exposed: "You've got a learner in a classroom for 12 years plus, and they are having to follow rules they didn't make and listen to answers of questions that they didn't ask… [I]f you do that for enough time, what does it do to you? What does it do to your spirit?"

He calls it "[the epidemic of dependent learners](https://opened.co/blog/why-traditional-schools-create-dependent-learners-tyler-thigpen)"—students who've been trained to wait for adults to tell them what to do, what to learn, when to learn it. The pandemic made this dependence impossible to ignore.

Something else has changed too. When our kids were young and we told people we homeschooled, they'd look at us like we had two heads. Today, the most common response is: "I wish I could do that."

The [Overton Window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window)—what society considers acceptable—has shifted dramatically. What was once fringe is becoming mainstream.

## The New eOS—Open Education & the Platform for Everything

We are living through what could be called the "[iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS) moment" for education.

In the same way that the iPhone was not merely an upgraded iPod mp3 player, open education is not another competing program or philosophy. It is a new operating system. It is the clean, flexible, user-centric platform designed to finally run all the best programs together. Its core design principle is _interoperability_.

This new eOS fundamentally changes your role as a parent/educator. You are no longer a passive consumer forced to use the pre-installed software. You become the architect of your child's learning journey, with the power to create a personalized "home screen" of educational experiences.

On this new platform, you can place the "Montessori app" for hands-on, self-directed learning in the early years right next to the "Classical literature app" for building a foundation in the [great books](https://www.greatbooks.org/). You can run a "[Beast Academy app](https://beastacademy.com/)" for conceptual math while simultaneously accessing a "Forest School co-op app" for real-world science. They all work together because the underlying operating system is built for flexibility, not rigidity.

The first page of the [_Open Education_ book](https://opened.co/book) features a real anecdote about a teenage girl who was asked whether she was homeschooled, whose difficulty answering the question illustrates this concept in practice.

She played volleyball on a club team and took a science class at the local public school, but the core curriculum was delivered via online courses from a virtual charter school. She participated in a homeschool co-op once a week, had a tutor for math, worked part-time, and mostly "[unschooled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling)" on Fridays.

What would you call this? She didn't know either. But she knew she loved it.

As [Kerry McDonald](https://www.liberatedpodcast.com/) observes, traditional educational categories are becoming increasingly difficult to define. "Even before 2020, families were blending approaches," she explains. "People would ask, 'Wait, you're a homeschooler, but you attend this school five days a week?' The overlap and fluidity around these definitions has been growing for years."

This blurring of boundaries is a positive development. While it may create challenges for educators and researchers trying to categorize these approaches, McDonald emphasizes what matters most: "As a parent in the trenches, I don't care what you call it. I just need to have all the tools available on the table."

The focus shifts from fitting into predefined categories to accessing whatever resources best serve each child's needs.

## Real Examples of the New eOS in Action

The move to open education often begins with a simple realization: the traditional schedule isn't sacred. Former public school principal and [Libertas Institute](https://libertas.org/) analyst [Jon England](https://libertas.institute/author/jonengland/) and his wife found a local [microschool](https://microschoolingcenter.org/) that operates just three days a week. "It is amazing how much of a difference that one change alone makes," he explains. The open approach allows for the structure they want _and_ the family time they need.

Consider [Breakout School](https://breakoutschool.org/) in Utah, a program that spends 80-90% of its time outside and is specifically designed for students with [autism and ADHD](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/autism-spectrum-disorders-asd). Students who hated traditional school are now thriving. As England describes it, these kids can "run over to a playground or run around the park and get their energy out and then come back and buckle down and do 15 more minutes of math."

The founder, [Dr. Dow Richardson](https://breakoutschool.org/), calls their challenges "their superpower." Students return to traditional high schools "getting A's and B's and they're loving it because now all of a sudden they found their love of learning by having this program that fit who they were."

Technology enables this flexibility. As [Kerry McDonald](https://www.liberatedpodcast.com/) notes: "Now we're able to tap into such extraordinary, in some cases, free or low-cost software, like [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)... That just makes these unconventional spaces able to do what they're going to do."

Even a one-room schoolhouse model can access world-class instruction in every subject. The innovation isn't the technology itself—it's using technology to enable the human connections and personalized support that actually drive learning.

## The Architect's Toolkit—Building Your Open Education

This new approach is about more than just technology. When you adopt an Open eOS, your "app store" contains the entire world. The architect's toolkit allows you to integrate:

- World-Class Digital Tools: The best online curricula, adaptive learning platforms, and specialized virtual classes from across the globe.
- Local Community Resources: The hands-on science co-op that meets at the park, the robotics club at the local library, the theater program downtown.
- Real-World Experiences: An apprenticeship with a local mechanic, a project-based quest to build a community garden, a deep dive into family history through travel.
- Hybrid Models: Public school for some subjects, homeschool co-ops for others, online courses for advanced topics, part-time enrollment where it makes sense.

The true power of this new eOS is the ability to re-bundle these components into a coherent, personalized philosophy that evolves as your child grows. You are no longer just picking a program; you are building a custom suite of tools designed for a specific user: your child.

This is the "no-code" revolution for education: you no longer need a teaching credential or specialized expertise to build something amazing, just the right tools and support.

## The OpenEd Marketplace and Resources

This isn't a DIY fantasy accessible only to the wealthiest families or the most dedicated pioneers. The [OpenEd program](https://opened.co/) provides the essential infrastructure that makes being an architect feel empowering, not overwhelming. This year, we launched a new streamlined platform that makes it easier than ever for parents to build a well-rounded schedule, track progress, course correct when a given curriculum isn’t working, and get support from an accredited teacher when they need it.

The [OpenEd Marketplace](https://opened.co/marketplace) makes it easy to browse hundreds of vetted learning resources, curricula, classes, and experiences. Think of it as the App Store for your new education OS—curated, reviewed, and designed to work together.

For those outside of our program states, the [OpenEd Daily](https://opened.co/blog) aims to deliver daily inspiration, practical tips, and stories from families who are making this work. Our deep dives explore different pedagogical approaches—[Classical](https://opened.co/blog/classical-education), [Montessori](https://opened.co/blog/montessori-curriculum-for-homeschooling), [Waldorf](https://www.waldorfeducation.org/), [Unschooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling), and more—not as competing ideologies, but as tools in your toolkit.

We’ve begun organizing these resources within a new central ['Open Education' hub](https://opened.co/open-education) where you can explore different approaches, compare philosophies, browse tools, and start drafting the blueprint for your child's unique journey. It's where you begin to see all the pieces and how they might fit together.

## Your Permission Slip to Design

Whether you're fully enrolled in [OpenEd programs](https://opened.co/) or just exploring ideas, these resources help you think like an architect.

You don't have to have it all figured out today. You just need to take the first step: opening your mind to the possibility that your child's education can be different.

Maybe you've been feeling for a while that something isn't working. Maybe you've dismissed those feelings because you thought you had no choice. Maybe you've wondered if you're qualified to make these decisions.

Here's what we know from working with thousands of families: You are more qualified than anyone to make these decisions for your child. You know them better than any system ever could.

The era of being locked into a single, rigid system is over.

With a new operating system, you have permission to take what works, leave what doesn't, and build something better.

Explore Classical, Montessori, Virtual, and Microschooling (with more coming soon!)—not as competitors, but as components in your toolkit: [OpenEd.co/open-education](http://opened.co/open-education)

# The School-to-Prescription Pipeline: Ben Somers on How We Medicate Kids Who Don't Fit the Mold | OpenEd (1)

# Ben Somers: Friends, Choice, and the Future of Learning

_OpenEd Podcast Episode - Ela Richmond_

---

## Full Transcript

**Ela Richmond:** Ben, welcome to the podcast. What got you interested in education to begin with?

**Ben Somers:** I was truant from grade six to grade nine and dropped out of high school. I really didn't like school as a kid. When I was 11, I had this teacher frustrated that I was a foot tapper and wiggler. We had to see a psychiatrist and I went on 70 milligrams of Concerta when I weighed about a hundred pounds—a really large dose of methamphetamines. As an adult looking back, loading up a hundred-pound 11-year-old with tons of drugs seems really crazy. There has to be a better way. I felt wronged during my school process, but I liked learning and liked a bunch of my teachers. I can imagine a version that's much better.

**Ela Richmond:** Did you in the moment know that it was wrong?

**Ben Somers:** For sure. Do you know how much 70 milligrams of methamphetamines are? If you're 100 pounds and you take that, you have anger issues, you're crazy constipated—there's a ton of side effects. We went to an endocrinologist years later and it had some effects on my puberty. But for sure, when I was 11, I was aware that when I took this pill in the morning, my day looked way different.

**Ela Richmond:** The purpose of the pill was just to keep you paying attention in school?

**Ben Somers:** I had tons of great teachers. My fifth grade teacher was not good. I think it was really about the other kids. I was disruptive and probably talked a lot and was running around all the time. It was to make it easier for the teacher to deal with the classroom. What's funny is in my town that year, I think almost a quarter of all the boys in the school were on stimulants.

**Ela Richmond:** And then as you got older, you started looking back on your journey. I wonder what I would have become if my education looked different. I'm entirely happy with who I am, but I wonder.

**Ben Somers:** I think there are only two or three reasons you work in education if you're specifically working on building something that changes the system. Either you had a bad experience and you can imagine a version of yourself that's better than you are now, and you want to build the education that would have produced that version of yourself. Or maybe the second is that you felt you had a particularly good schooling experience and you want to bring that to more people. But if you're working on net new things, I think it means you can imagine a version of yourself that's better than you are now. And that definitely is true for me.

**Ela Richmond:** Did you do any education things before Recess or was Recess your first foray?

**Ben Somers:** I did some tutoring in high school and college and some debate coaching. Then three or four years ago, I went to work at a company called Synthesis School, which makes team simulation games for kids and a digital math tutor. I decided to work in education after building a company with my brother and wanted something I could work on for 40 years. I picked education as a problem and then went to go work for the smartest people I could find. I thought Josh Dahn and Crispin Frank were both really good options. Josh had built this school at SpaceX and done really cool work. Crispin had collaborated and made these great stories called the Conundrums and built tutoring companies. So I went to go work there and learn from them.

**Ela Richmond:** What would you say that you learned from them there?

**Ben Somers:** I wrote a 30 or 40 bullet point doc of all the things I learned and sent it to Crispin afterwards. I learned a lot of things about company building. The company grew really quick—from zero to 20 million in two years, then all the way back down to 3 million after a product pivot, then clawed its way back up to 10 million ARR. Crispin in particular is really comfortable with his back against the wall. He's just very fearless and endlessly optimistic. I saw the power of that and how many problems come up, even if your company is interesting and cool and good. Just how hard it is. I learned something about the need for total perseverance.

I learned a lot about education. It was a cool place because I think it was the Mecca for two years for forward-thinking teachers, right as COVID hit. This great company launches with this cool backstory with SpaceX and it's this new way of teaching kids things. Everyone's looking for part-time income as teachers. So I think it was the Mecca for all of these great forward thinking teachers. I learned a ton from them—details about how to make a kid feel seen, how to use after-class time to pull them aside and get them to do things, how to motivate a room of people and tell a story that gets everyone excited.

Josh was particularly good at making kids feel like whatever they were doing was really important. He would really get everyone to buy in. There's a whole lot of that stuff that I picked up that was really valuable. I'd say it's a thousand tiny skills. I learned a lot of stuff. It was a really good experience.

**Ela Richmond:** How did it evolve your understanding of education?

**Ben Somers:** There were two core insights that were very specific. The first was that the number one predictor of retention—and this is a business metric, but also a learning metric—was if the kid had a friend in their class. It wasn't who the teacher was, whether they were Illinois Teacher of the Year, or whether they won a ton of games or lost a ton of games. All these things that you'd expect didn't make that big of a difference. But really, if you had a friend in your class, you stuck around forever. If you didn't, you churned in three to six months.

My anecdotal experience was that the kids performed way better when they had a friend in the class. They could take criticism from the teacher or from their peers way better when they had a friend. They would talk about it sometimes when they weren't in the class. They'd make maps in their free time because they would make it and send it to their friend. There were all these things. I was shocked by how much a good social experience led to a better learning experience and a better business model.

We spent, at one point, I wanna say $10 million a year on games—probably $7 million on games out of maybe $10 million total on engineering. The games had less of an impact on retention than "friend in a class," which is close to free. So from a business perspective, we really gotta laser in on this and make this experience really good. And the learning one was true too.

The second was the kids had a mandatory Recess session once a week, and then they could choose from a list of events for the rest of the week. The feeling in the mandatory class and the chosen class—I taught both—was really different. The chosen class just felt electric. Every kid wanted to be there. They didn't have to go there. The parents weren't paying for that session. They chose to be there. Their level of commitment, their level of drive, their skill in the game, what you could do in a session was so different. I then had this second thought of, "kid buy-in matters a lot more than we treat it or think about it." Other than homeschooling, I don't really know of any good model that works in kid choice as a very serious part of their curriculum design. At best they pay lip service to it.

So the two core insights that led to Recess were—and you'll catch the name—you hang out with your friends a lot at recess and you get to choose what you do. That's what led to Recess: a place where you could choose what you do and you'd meet lots of cool people and you could hang out with them whenever you want. So if you were a kid in Idaho who was really into building circuits and crazy Minecraft contraptions and cool products, you could find other homeschoolers from around the country who did that kind of stuff. Or if you're someone who loved publishing books, you could make other friends who liked doing that and making art.

**Ela Richmond:** That's really fascinating, especially because what is the topic that I hear kids bring up all the time today? It's Roblox. And why is it Roblox? It's because they're playing with their friends most of the time, or they're meeting people.

**Ben Somers:** Yeah. And it's one of the only game platforms—on iOS, a lot of kids can't download apps without their parents. So you either have to get approval to pay for the app or just to download it. Roblox is actually just a giant app marketplace. It's hidden as if it's a game. If you open it up, it's 10,000 games and the kids get to pick which ones they want. So both a place where you hang out with your friends and a place where you get to choose what you do with total freedom.

**Ela Richmond:** How have you taken all of these insights and put them into Recess? Have there been any things that surprised you?

**Ben Somers:** Recess started as basically once a day, as close to the word recess as we could get. Once a day at the same time every day, a whole bunch of kids would log on and we would use something like Gather Town and they could run around and talk to each other and hang out and meet each other. I would place games down and they could convene around the games they wanted to play. Now the way the friend thing and the choice thing work really hand in hand. There's a big marketplace of classes and the classes are run by YouTubers and people who are professionals in their field.

The interesting thing about Recess is your parents can't sign you up for any classes. The kids pick the classes. But there's a second trigger. The kids look through this marketplace and all the thumbnails are really exciting to them. It's not "learn circuit design and learn the basics of circuit design." It's "how to build a trap door in Minecraft," "how to write a show for your favorite TV show." They're presented in a way that kids are very excited about them, because the only way you sell the class is if the kid wants to click on it.

Then the second part is the kid requests it from their parent and then their parent can approve or deny the request. So there's no such thing as a kid being in a class they don't want to be in. So every room you go into, everyone wants to be there. And there's no such thing as a parent paying for a class they don't value.

The second part about the friends is when you join a class, you're going to meet everyone who wants to be there and they all like the same stuff as you. So you already are going to have a lot in common with them. After the class is over, we basically suggest friends—all the kids you just met—and you can add them as a friend. Then we give you a Discord-style chat where you can chat with them and call them and hang out with them and play games with them. Then you can see what classes your friends are in, so you can organize and easily schedule joining up with them.

So those are the two main parts: kids pick the classes and parents approve them. Then we use the classes to help the kids make friends who like the same stuff as them. What's cool is things kind of trend on Recess. One kid will get really into this engineering thing or making these kinds of videos, and one of their friends will see and they'll join that class, and then one of their friends will see and they'll join that class. Now you've seen three people just join that class this week and it kind of becomes popular.

**Ela Richmond:** What have you been surprised by on this journey?

**Ben Somers:** We launched this jobs feature and kids were going to hire each other. We were trying to make a mini economy. So you hire each other and pay each other and get someone to make your book cover. I was surprised at how much kids like to fire each other. I didn't see that coming. So we had to take that feature away. It's a small number of kids who like to fire people, but the same people who wanted to post jobs were the kids who wanted to fire people.

I think I'm continuously surprised by how a lot of people would try to label kids as being motivated or diligent or ambitious or curious, and I've been surprised at how often kids you would label as none of those things totally morph into absolutely those things in the right circumstance. When you get them going about their thing—we all know this intuitively. You ask some kid who can't memorize state capitals and they can rattle off all 372 Pokemon and which ones were part of the different leagues and memorize them perfectly and all their moves. It's like, this doesn't make sense. You can't remember 50 things that are pretty easy, but you can remember 372 complicated things. Every time you either help it happen or see it and can do something with it, it's just always surprising. Something about that feels slept on.

**Ela Richmond:** What do you think that means? So there's a lot of criticism around homeschool approaches, more unschool approaches, right? Your kid do a lot of what they like. But there's a lot of criticism around an unschooling approach, because it's like, okay, but in life, there are things that you have to do, right? For example, you might not want to memorize the 50 states, but at some point there are some things that you have to do. I'm curious to hear your take on the balance.

**Ben Somers:** I have a few thoughts. The first is things have a reason. I think it's useful if you can attempt to figure out what the reason that you do things are. I'm particularly bad at doing things I don't want to do or that I don't think matter. I do think there are things you have to do, but I'm way more willing to pay my taxes when I think about the purpose of taxes and the purpose of a country and what it means to be a citizen. When I start to think about them, even though I don't like doing the paperwork, I think this is where good entrepreneurs come from. You're doing your taxes and you're like, "this is total nonsense. Why do I have to do it this way?" And someone is like, "well, maybe you don't have to, maybe we could make something that would make it simpler to do this."

I do think a small amount of discipline training is a useful thing to learn. I think you can train discipline in a bunch of different areas. Sometimes I think there's something to learn about when you can rely on an expert authority and when you can't. When you can rely on an expert authority, you don't always have to ask why if you really trust them. We do a bunch of full school for kids or have a handful of kids that basically is just a full school. For sure they're doing rigorous math practice every day, even if they don't want to. They're occasionally doing reading comprehension tests. So as radical as I am, I still think there's room for that stuff.

Then my second answer is kind of the Montessori idea. I actually don't really think kids should play Pokemon. I think it's a pretty bad game from a learning design standpoint. There are other games that are similarly fun and exciting for a kid that have you do a lot more problem solving and logic problems or other types of problems and have more transferable skills.

I think this is where Montessori was really smart. She really wanted to give the kid a lot of freedom and have the kid learn independence and learn self-motivation and how to focus themselves. So she would let the kids choose whatever they wanted within a curated environment. You couldn't bring your toys from home in. But anything she had in her space, you could take out and play with. There were these materials that she had custom designed that would help scaffold the kids' knowledge and build upon each other. When they moved to the next one, there were new things for them to learn. When given that curated environment, the kid earns a lot more freedom.

I think this is similar to if you grew up in a nice town that's super safe, where your parents spend a lot of time learning, working, doing interesting things, they have good value systems. The kid can have a ton of freedom from the time they're eight years old. I think if you grew up in other environments where there are tons of bad influences around and lots of negativity and potentially even violence, you shouldn't get a lot of freedom as a kid. So the better you can make the environments—and this is where I get super obsessed—is the digital environment. I think there's this idea that screens are bad. Almost every parent I know with a kid under 10 is terrified of screens. They have a lot of anxiety about them.

**Ela Richmond:** So speak to that a little bit, because that was one of my questions. I love this idea of curating the environment and then having kids earn a higher level of freedom. But how do you determine when is the right point to expose them to things that are highly addictive? Because that's the issue with technology. It's not that technology is bad. It's a tool, right? But then if you give your kid access to a tool that has a lot of potential—they could use YouTube for tutorials. They could also use YouTube for a host of other things that you don't want them doing. So from your perspective, where does technology fit in?

**Ben Somers:** Totally. If you are a crazy involved parent who spends a lot of time with your kid and is nearby them with the screens all the time, and you use your screens in a really great way so you don't model behavior of watching TikTok on the couch for 45 minutes, but you do model pulling them over and showing them how to build something in CAD or that you wrote a short story or that you did these things, and you're going to talk to them about the pitfalls of where tech can get dangerous—I think you can give them a ton of freedom really young.

If you are the 99.8% of parents who have a lot of other stuff going on and you are not going to dedicate probably what is a full-time job to curating their screen time, then I agree with them that I don't really know when. Three doesn't seem like a good time. Seven doesn't seem like a good time. Twelve doesn't seem like a great time. Fifteen doesn't seem like a great time. And then 18, you've gotta stop doing stuff for them anymore. If you're not gonna be—you can't rely on the tech to raise your kids correctly or to teach the kids how to use them safely. They will not do that. That really has to be you.

Or you work on the thing I'm working on, which I hope will have this effect. For the YouTube example that you're giving, there's a segue into this thing I'm building now. The super long story short is you download an app on your iPad and it turns your iPad from bad to great. It goes from something you really are nervous about giving your kid to something you are absolutely hyped to give your kid. They're coming to you at the end of the day and teaching you all these things they learned and you're excited about it and it's a very different way of kids interacting with screens.

We do that by relying a lot on AI for sure. Using one of the things that AI is really good at is kind of mimicking text, parroting something or translating it. If you want to translate a document, it's really good at that. For us, if we can get a good description of a parent's values, their value system—whether that be that they're really into faith and they want faith to be a big part of their kid's life, or they really want their kid to develop strong technical skills, or they want them to have a strong moral backbone in this area or whatever—if we can get a good picture of what their value system is, I actually think we can have AI kind of help the kid discover the internet within the confines of their parents' values.

We're gonna basically try and automate that and then give you as a parent samples and experiences that make you feel connected to your kid's screen time so you understand what they're doing on it so it's not a mystery to you. Then you can just tell if this thing is working and you trust it to help you parent your kid. It's kind of like a digital companion for you on the iPad that makes the iPad good.

**Ela Richmond:** That's really fascinating. Yeah, that's really fascinating and it aligns with—so we recently compiled all of the ideas that Matt Bowman, who's the founder of OpenEd, had kind of put together. And it's basically education should be mix and match. Mix and match aligned with your values and your priorities as a family and a child's individual personality, their interests, their strengths and weaknesses. If for you as a parent—this is what always scared me. I never thought I'd be a good homeschool mom because I always thought homeschooling was "I'm gonna sit in front of a whiteboard and I'm going to personally be the one to teach you every single subject forever."

**Ben Somers:** Yeah. Totally.

**Ela Richmond:** And that never excited me. I'm not a teacher. I don't think I could explain it well. I think I'd get frustrated. Really expanding my idea to, okay, I'm not necessarily having to open myself up to being the teacher in everything. Rather, I'm becoming an education designer. It's like, what could my child's education become? And I'm designing the education that aligns with our values, that aligns with them and that becomes something that can help them to become who they could possibly be. You get into education thinking, oh, if I had these different experiences, who could I possibly be? And as a parent, you now get to look down at your kid and you're like, okay, who could you possibly be? Let's figure it out. And that is infinitely more exciting to me.

I think examples like what you were talking about where these things get to be aids to you, right? You get to ask questions and figure it out and you're not alone on this process. It's not like, okay, find one curriculum and let that be it. It's like, okay, I'm gonna pick the very best thing for math for this week. And then maybe next week it'll change and maybe—it is this much more dynamic process, which is kind of scary for a lot of people, but it's to me a lot more exciting.

**Ben Somers:** I think you're gonna remove the fear too. I think the removing the fear—there's a product that's missing that would remove the fear, which is—in school they have these things called learning management systems and they're really built for the administrator, not for the kid. So they're built to keep track of a whole class or a whole grade, a whole grade year, and to notice trends. Then there's a little bit there to kind of make sure the kid didn't miss assignments or track attendance or maybe notice that they've fallen behind in something.

I think you can—there are examples in a handful of tech tools now that are really good. There's this one called Math Academy. I don't know if you guys have that in your marketplace, but you definitely should. School treats all knowledge like it goes in a line. So it's really scary as a homeschool parent because if you don't want to go in that line, then you are no longer on the same track as school and you can't compare yourself to the school benchmarks anymore. That's really scary because it's like, if we deviate from this line, we're kind of flying blind.

I think in reality, knowledge is not ordered in a straight line. It's ordered in a big complex graph of ideas that are connected to each other in different ways. There are prerequisites and post-requisites, but it's much messier. There are many different ways to get to the same idea. Some ideas rely on a bunch of ideas, others you can skip right over. What I think is missing is a really good tool that kind of maps the kid's knowledge in a more open-ended and less linear way and is backed and connected to standardized test scores. I think a lot of parents and homeschoolers don't like them. But I think you can actually build a system that allows for rabbit holes and offshoots and tangents and a totally different way of going about it and still have it feel really clear about all the knowledge that you're supposed to acquire in school and what your kid has acquired thus far and what they're not going to acquire and what they will if you get on this path. If you're missing this knowledge, here's a really clear and easy way to go get it if you do want to kind of go back into the physical school.

So I think this product is broadly missing. This is part of the thing that we're making for the browser. Part of what we think is making the right environment for the kid to exist on the screen is for it to have a good experience with their computer. With this tool, it should build a lot of confidence and make it really clear for the parent about how they're using their computer, how it's affecting their learning and where they can go. I think computers are uniquely good at kind of measuring and mapping this kind of stuff compared to even if you had a human sitting next to the kid 24/7.

**Ela Richmond:** Yeah. Yeah, this is interesting because this was the very first thing that—I think everybody that saw that first Khan Academy video of Sal Khan sitting with his son, right? On the iPad. That was the very first aha moment that everybody had of like, wow, what could possibly be the future of education? And I think that there's something so important there because there is this shift happening where in the past education was this thing that you entirely outsourced.

**Ben Somers:** Yeah, way past there was something you did all yourself and then you outsourced it all.

**Ela Richmond:** Yeah, yeah, exactly. And so we've been in this kind of movement of outsourcing education is the way to go. But it's not working for a lot of families. A lot of families are not aligning with the curriculums that they're choosing or more like in your case, some families are seeing their children being mistreated by the system. It's not set up to treat their kid properly. So they're creating this new paradigm where I think parents are becoming education designers. My hope at least is that this opens up a new conversation about kind of what you were saying where parents need different information if they're education designers, right? They need information about what do my kids want? What do my kids like? Where are my kids struggling? They need different kinds of information to fill those gaps.

They also need to be connected with the solutions to those things. So if they are this in-between, this person that is diagnosing and also trying to fix—something that I love to bring back is this phrase I heard—they were like, the person most invested in making your child successful is the parent, period. Because they're the one that has to live with them, they're the one that has to experience them all day long, they're the ones that later in life, whenever they are successful, get to look back and be like, all right, we're good, right? They're the closest to wanting this kid to succeed. And so empowering them to be able to make these decisions is really, really fascinating.

**Ben Somers:** Yeah. Yeah. While you were talking, I was thinking of some analogies or metaphors. Yeah, the idea that you design your kid's education, not necessarily that you facilitate every part of it. It feels like a big shift. Even if you go—you're on a spectrum from "I dig all my soil and mix it with the cows that I have on my site and make my own manure and find all the seeds from things that are near me and plant them all and I don't buy anything from anybody and then I get the food and then I make"—there's this video where one guy tries to make a chicken sandwich from scratch, but truly from scratch, and it takes him six months and it's a terrible sandwich and he was really bummed that it wasn't a good sandwich.

On the other end of the spectrum is not DoorDash. It's someone chooses every single meal for you and sends it to you and you have no choice in the matter about even what meal you have. Most people actually want to definitely pick their meals and sometimes cook and do some other things with them. But if they had to do all that stuff on their own, they'd be like, please just someone feed me. But when you can make it really easy, they actually want to be involved and they want to do this stuff. So I think there's something similar. Maybe not the perfect metaphor, but the fact that it's way easier to homeschool now and there are lots of good software materials and good online classes and tutors available, I think are a huge contributor to why homeschooling is getting way more popular.

**Ela Richmond:** Yeah, I would agree. I would definitely agree. I think it's easier to homeschool now than ever. A lot of the stigma is falling away as to what a homeschooler is, even within the homeschool community. And I know that some people are very particular, like, this is homeschooling, this is not. But I think there's this—

**Ben Somers:** Where I am now in San Francisco—it's now high status to homeschool. Like it is the opposite. If you hear someone's a homeschooler from somewhere else, I don't know if it engenders the same thing, but if someone in San Francisco hears another person in San Francisco is homeschooling, they assume that means those parents are really smart. They're doing something really good, different. The stigma is for sure falling away.

**Ela Richmond:** That is awesome. Interesting. Isn't that fascinating that the privileged thing to do now is to be able to teach your own kids and take them out and choose how they learn and imbue your culture?

**Ben Somers:** I think it makes sense. It makes a lot of sense because it means two things. It means one, you're dissatisfied with the quality of the education. Here, it means that you're dissatisfied with the quality of education, which means you've got high standards. And two, it means you've organized your life in such a way that you can solve childcare and good instruction. I think a lot of people just assume they're going to spend a lot of time on it, that you have figured out how to carve out enough time to be able to do a good job with that and be able to figure out childcare in an expensive city. So it's almost like—yeah, it means that you've got really high standards and you have a lot of control over what your lifestyle looks like.

**Ela Richmond:** Interesting. That leads me to my final rapid fire questions. My first question for you is, what do you see, ideal world, the future of education looking like?

**Ben Somers:** Flexible campuses with lots of great resources and amenities. So pottery workshops and basketball courts and sports fields and all that kind of stuff. And they're flexible in that you can go at different times. You can come late, you can leave early. Your family can go on vacation for a week when you want to go on vacation. Your parent can come hang out with you for an hour in the middle of the day and get lunch with you if they've got the hour free. In nice places where the kids can have lots of physical freedom and they get to know the same people from the time they're five to 18, so they can have long-standing relationships.

Plus, an extremely rigorous interactive dynamic learning experience. I'm really into this guy named Seymour Papert who has this concept of microworlds, which is how kids should learn things. They are immersed in a microworld. So he talks about language learning and how much better language learning is when you're immersed in it. And he's like, I can imagine this for things that aren't just learning foreign languages. I can imagine versions of it that are good for math, versions of it that are—Ms. Frizzle's Magic School Bus, if you ever watched that as a kid. You know, get transported into the inside of a vein. That's how you start learning biology because you're trying to get out and you've got all these problems that you encounter. The white blood cells come to attack you. That's how you learn about the immune system. I think that is the right model.

So one half is this wonderful physical place with great culture, great resources, tons of cool people, flexibility for the family and for the kid. And combined with spectacular interactive dynamic experiences that respond to the individual kid and make their learning experience really good and fun and interesting and visceral. So yeah, what it looks like is that campus plus a few hours a day working really hard on a screen.

**Ela Richmond:** Very cool. Second question, what are some of the best—give me the top two education books that you'd recommend everybody read?

**Ben Somers:** I'm gonna give such lame answers. One is the dialogues—any of the conversations between Plato, Socrates and Aristotle, any of that kind of stuff. That's too hard. I only get two. Then Seymour Papert's _The Children's Machine_.

**Ela Richmond:** That's a good one. I haven't read that one yet, actually. I always, I pride myself. I want to have a stellar library one day and I don't have that one yet.

**Ben Somers:** I'm obsessed with that guy. If you want to try and figure out what I'm attempting to build, you can basically just read his books and more or less—even the campus I described is somewhat similar to the way he envisioned. He talks about Samba schools and these different places. I really think he really had it mostly down. Just the things he was trying to do were technically infeasible at the time.

**Ela Richmond:** Interesting. There's—I gotta give a shout out as you're talking about this. The best way that I've currently seen this done is in Kansas, they have this thing called a Learning Lab. Have you heard of it?

**Ben Somers:** I've heard of Learning Labs, but I don't know about the one in Kansas.

**Ela Richmond:** So this is a really cool model and it was built by—there are a couple of really strong donors in Wichita—but what it is is basically a kid coworking space. There are seven different school models inside of it. So it's very similar to this. It is as close to this as you get and they have a ton of amazing resources. So they have a podcast studio, they have a video studio, they have what they call a mess lab, which is a decked out science lab. They have basically a whole print shop. They have basically any sort of resource that you would want as a kid and as a parent. And the way that their facility works is they have rooms that people can rent. So there are microschools that rent them. There are different homeschool co-ops that rent them, and they also have a subscription model. So families can purchase a month of subscription, and then they can just go in whenever. And that is a really great idea. It is—I think we're not there yet. I look at it, and it's working.

**Ben Somers:** Wow. Get a desk or something. Wow. Yeah. Is it working?

**Ela Richmond:** What's interesting is the people that have the hardest time buying into it are homeschoolers. So people that are open to microschools—yeah, people that are open to microschools, people that want an alternative type of education—they're down. But if they don't explain it as alternative education, if they explain what they're doing as homeschooling, usually that's not the crowd that they hang out with. It's a really, really cool space. I'd recommend going to check it out if you ever have a chance.

**Ben Somers:** I will go. I like flying to go look at schools and hang out with them and see what they do right and do wrong. So I actually probably will reach out to them and see what's up.

**Ela Richmond:** Yeah, I can introduce you. They're great. But that is—I went there and I was like, I love this place. I can't believe there are not more of them. But I think it will take a cultural movement shift in the definition of what is education? What is homeschooling? How are we doing these things for it to work.

**Ben Somers:** True for all—sometimes I'll talk to other people who are working on education and sometimes it'll get competitive between different people or I'll hear other people get fed up with another company. My perspective is none of us are fighting against each other really. We're really attempting to fight the status quo. The amount of dollars in education, the amount of room for expansion of new ideas is ginormous. Yeah, we should figure out as a community, an ed tech, as people who are working on new things, how to help each other make that true. Because if there's anything we do to crack the—put cracks in the system, it'll have a much bigger impact for all of us, even as businesses, than it would be to compete for the relatively small alternative or homeschool market.

**Ela Richmond:** And to be quite honest—

**Ben Somers:** But yeah, there's going to be big cultural changes.

**Ela Richmond:** And to be honest, the thing that I love about OpenEd is it was started with the mindset, we celebrate when a student leaves because they're going on to find something better. And we are creating, hopefully, this robust ecosystem of educational options because if we actually believe that kids need something different—no child is standard, they're going to need different things, right? So to be that prideful to say, yes, my company is going to solve every single homeschool need—you just can't do it. And the more that people see this space as something that they can pick and choose from, the more you have to be okay with that. They're going to choose the best thing for them and that's good.

**Ben Somers:** Yeah. And I think it's extremely good for the overall system. When people get locked into contracts or experiences or products for too long—right now, when you're in school, you're kind of stuck there for a long time and you don't really leave the school except if it goes absolutely terribly. And the school makes unilateral decisions. So you just don't get a lot of evolution. There's not a lot of iteration. The good products don't float to the top. They don't become popular. It's very hard to break into the model with new things. If you can move into a pick-a-mix world or a mix-and-match world, I think the products will get a lot better just by nature of the fact that people are making more choices.

**Ela Richmond:** Yeah, very interesting. Last question. When parents haven't found out yet what clicks for their kids, what do you recommend?

**Ben Somers:** I think about how to answer this one. Find out what video games they play. That's the most actionable piece of advice I can come up with. Your kid could play lots of different video games and they choose to play a small number of them. If they read a lot, what books they read. Video games, it tends to be easier for them to choose because the games are really made to be available to kids and easy to find and stuff like that. And hidden in their video game choices are a bunch of preferences about what kinds of problems they like to solve and what kinds of topics they like to think about. So don't look at them as trivial, look at them as signal. So go hang out with your kids and play video games for an hour. And I think you'll come back thinking they're very passionate.

**Ela Richmond:** Very interesting. That was a perfect note to end it on. Thank you so much for coming on the podcast. This was quite interesting.

**Ben Somers:** This is really fun. You're great at this.

**Ela Richmond:** Thanks.

Greetings!

[Ben Somers](https://x.com/ben_m_somers) was 11 when a teacher—frustrated that he was a foot tapper and wiggler—sent him to a psychiatrist. He was put on 70mg of Concerta (that's a pretty hefty dose of amphetamines for a kid who weighed about 100 pounds).

The medication wasn't prescribed to help Ben learn better. It was prescribed to make him easier to manage.

And he wasn’t alone. In Ben’s town that year, 25% of all the boys were on some kind of ADHD medication. How many of these prescriptions were written to make the classroom run more smoothly?

**Fast forward:** Ben dropped out of high school, worked his way into education technology, and now runs a platform called [Recess](http://recess.gg/) that's trying to solve the problems he experienced firsthand.

[On the latest podcast, we talked about what he's learned](https://opened.co/blog/the-school-to-prescription-pipeline-ben-somers-on-how-we-medicate-kids-who-dont-fit-the-mold)—including a surprising data point that should make every parent who's agonizing over curriculum choices relax a little.

Let's dive in.

‍**THOUGHT:** The Education Designer**TREND:** High-Status Homeschooling**TOOL:** Where Kids Design Their Learning

# The Education Designer

Did you hear about the guy who tried to make a chicken sandwich completely from scratch?

This isn’t the setup for a corny joke. Andy George spent six months and $1,500 dollars growing the wheat for the bun, raising the chickens, harvesting salt from the ocean—all of it. In the end, he had... a mediocre sandwich.

Most parents think homeschooling means becoming that guy—digging your own soil, growing everything yourself, and hopefully not producing a terrible sandwich after six months of exhaustion.

My guest Ben Somers has a different take: **you're not supposed to be the teacher of everything. You're the education designer.**

You don't need to personally deliver every lesson. You need to curate the right mix of resources, experiences, and relationships that work for your child. Some families cook every meal from scratch. Most people want to pick their meals and occasionally cook. When you make it easier to be involved, parents actually want to design the experience—they just don't want to grow the wheat.

The tools exist now. Are you designing, or are you trying to be a one-person school system?

# High-Status Homeschooling

In San Francisco, homeschooling is now high-status.

Why? Ben gives two reasons.

First, it signals you're dissatisfied with the quality of conventional education—which means you have high standards. Second, it means you've organized your life in such a way that you can solve childcare and instruction yourself. You've carved out enough time and figured out how to make it work in an expensive city. High standards plus life control equals status.

Of course, this feels a bit elitist—and it is. But the reason homeschooling is easier now isn't just resources. It's realizing you don't have to do everything yourself.

OpenEd families are proving that you don't need to be wealthy to be an education designer. You just need to care enough to start curating.

# Where Kids Design Their Learning

[Recess](http://recess.gg/) is what happens when you build a platform around kid choice and friend-making.

Here's the insight that shaped it: when Ben worked at [Synthesis School](https://www.synthesis.com/tutor) (the SpaceX school), they spent **$10 million a year on developing the best educational games possible.** You know what beat all of it? Whether the kid had a friend in their class. Not teacher credentials. Not curriculum quality. If a kid had one friend in class, they stuck around forever and performed better. Without a friend, they churned in 3-6 months.

So Recess built around that.

**Kids browse a marketplace of classes** (taught by YouTubers and professionals) and **request the ones that excite them**. Parents approve or deny. When kids join a class, they meet others who like the same stuff. After class, Recess suggests those kids as friends and gives them Discord-style chat to stay connected.

Your kid picks the classes. You approve them. Friends form naturally. That's Recess.

# Word of the Day: Verschlimmbessern

**verschlimmbessern** | /fɛɐ̯ˈʃlɪmbɛsɐn/ | verb

To make something worse by trying to improve it; to "improve" something into a worse state. German _verschlimmern_ (to worsen) + _verbessern_ (to improve).

**Example**: "When Ben's fifth-grade teacher decided the best way to help an energetic 11-year-old focus was to prescribe him 70mg of methamphetamines—not to help him learn, but to make the classroom easier to manage—that was peak verschlimmbessern. They took a kid who just needed to move around and turned him into someone dealing with anger issues, constipation, and long-term side effects."
