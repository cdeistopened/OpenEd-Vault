# Weekly Newsletter - Oct 17
## Checkpoint 1: Narrative Thread & Outline

---

## APPROACH

**No Forced Narrative:** Let pieces stand on their own merit. The Weekly is a curated digest, not a themed essay.

**Opening Style:** Short, punchy, Pirate Wires voice. Set the Friday vibe without trying to tie everything together with a bow.

**Content Strategy:** Strong Deep Dive + compelling podcast moment + best insights/trends/tools from the week

---

## OPENING LETTER (2-4 sentences max)

**Tone:** Pirate Wires style - conversational, a bit cheeky, end-of-week energy

**Possible approach:**
- "Greetings! This week we talked about operating systems, Einstein's tutor, and why your kid's Roblox obsession might actually be useful. Also: Ben Somers dropped out of high school after being medicated to make him easier to manage. Now he runs a platform that's trying to fix what broke him. Let's dive in."

OR

- "Greetings! It's Friday. This week: we published a 3,000-word piece on why education is an operating system (not a door), talked to a guy who spent $10 million to discover that friendship is free, and found out homeschooling is now high-status in San Francisco. Of course it is."

**Will draft in Phase 3**

## DEEP DIVE TOPIC (400-600 words)

**Selected Topic:** What is Open Education? (The Operating System)

**Why this topic:**
- Most substantial piece of the week (3,000+ words)
- Core OpenEd message/positioning
- The game show/door metaphor is strong
- OS metaphor is clear and compelling
- Explains what we actually do
- Evergreen content worth highlighting

**Structure:**
- **Hook**: The game show with three doors (public, private, homeschool)
- **Problem**: Education isn't a game show where you swear loyalty to one door
- **Solution**: Better analogy = operating system
  * Current eOS designed in 1840s (Horace Mann)
  * Frozen while everything else evolved
  * Created walled gardens (Montessori, Classical as isolated ecosystems)
- **The Shift**: The great unbundling (internet → pandemic → 3.5M homeschoolers)
- **The New eOS**: Open Education as iOS moment
  * You're not passive consumer, you're architect
  * "Montessori app" + "Classical app" + "Beast Academy app" working together
  * The girl with volleyball + public school science + virtual charter + co-op + tutor + unschooling
- **Takeaway**: Era of single rigid system is over. You have permission to mix and match.
- **CTA**: Link to full piece + OpenEd.co/open-education hub

**Word count target:** 500-600 words

## PODCAST HIGHLIGHT (150-250 words)

**Three Strong Options - Pick One:**

### OPTION A: The $10 Million Discovery
Ben worked at Synthesis School (the SpaceX school). They spent **$10 million a year on developing educational games**. You know what predicted retention and performance better than all of it? Whether the kid had a friend in their class. Not teacher credentials. Not curriculum quality. Not the games. Friends > everything else. And friendship is free.

**Why:** Data-driven, surprising, changes how you think about learning

---

### OPTION B: The Medication Story  
Ben was 11 when his teacher—frustrated he was a foot tapper and wiggler—sent him to a psychiatrist. He was put on 70mg of Concerta (hefty dose of amphetamines for a 100-pound kid). The medication wasn't to help him learn better. It was to make him easier to manage. That year, **25% of all the boys in his town were on ADHD meds**. Ben's now building the education he needed as a kid.

**Why:** Personal, powerful, systemic critique, explains his motivation

---

### OPTION C: Find the Signal in the Games
Your kid can't memorize 50 state capitals but can rattle off all 372 Pokemon, their moves, and which leagues they're from? That's not a problem—it's signal. Hidden in their video game choices are preferences about what kinds of problems they like to solve. Ben's advice: "Go hang out with your kids and play video games for an hour. You'll come back thinking they're very passionate."

**Why:** Practical, immediately actionable, reframes "screen time" anxiety

---

**RECOMMENDATION:** Option B (Medication Story) - Most compelling narrative, explains who Ben is and why Recess exists

**Word count target:** 180-220 words per option

## THOUGHTS OF THE WEEK (4-6 items)

### 1. **The Lawnmower Fallacy**
Isaac's mom wanted him to take small engine repair. He never did. He's thriving anyway. Once we lock onto an idea of success for our kids, it's hard to let go—whether it's fixing lawnmowers or getting degrees. [Watch the clip](link)

### 2. **The Education Designer Shift**
You're not supposed to grow the wheat, raise the chickens, and make everything from scratch. You're supposed to pick your meals and occasionally cook. Most parents think homeschooling means becoming the chicken sandwich guy. It doesn't. [Listen to Ben Somers](link)

### 3. **High-Status Homeschooling**
In San Francisco, homeschooling now signals two things: high standards (you're dissatisfied with conventional options) and life control (you've organized your life to make it work). The stigma is gone. [Watch clip](link)

### 4. **The Thing About Discipline**
Ben Somers on mandatory vs. chosen classes: "The feeling in the mandatory class and the chosen class was really different. The chosen class felt electric. Every kid wanted to be there." Kid buy-in matters more than we admit. [Full transcript](link)

### 5. **Find the Signal in the Games**
Your kid can't memorize 50 state capitals but can rattle off 372 Pokemon? That's not a problem—it's signal. Hidden in their game choices are preferences about what problems they like to solve. Go play video games with your kid for an hour. [Podcast episode](link)

### 6. **The Mix-and-Match Moment**
The girl who played volleyball on a club team, took science at public school, did core curriculum through virtual charter, attended homeschool co-op weekly, had a math tutor, worked part-time, and unschooled on Fridays. What do you call this? She didn't know. But she loved it. [Read the full piece](link)

## TRENDS OF THE WEEK (4-5 items)

### 1. **[The Soft Bigotry of Education Blather](link)**
High school seniors post worst reading scores since 2005. Half score below basic in math. The National Association of Secondary School Principals says test scores are "only one lens" and calls for more funding. Rick Hess at AEI calls BS: "Forget thriving—huge numbers aren't even learning to read or do math." (Source: AEI)

### 2. **[The Post-Pandemic Tutoring Boom](link)**
After COVID, schools tried actual tutoring (3x/week minimum, consistent tutor, max 4 students). Liz Cohen spent 18 months visiting schools: "The average tutored student was above 98% of students in the control class." Louisiana now serves 240,000 kids. We've known since the 1980s that tutored students perform two standard deviations better. (Source: The 74 Million)

### 3. **[Why We Stopped Making Einsteins](link)**
Erik Hoel's thesis: aristocratic tutoring—intellectuals spending real time engaging young minds—is what produced genius. Max Talmud gave Einstein geometry at 12. Bertrand Russell had tutors until 16. Darwin hired tutors at university. We have information access now. What's missing is the Max Talmuds. (Source: The Intrinsic Perspective)

### 4. **[The Homeschooling Numbers](link)**
Homeschooling grew from 250,000 students in the 1980s to 1 million by early 1990s. Today: approximately 3.5 million homeschooled students in the U.S. Public school enrollment dropped by 1.2 million students across 37 states during pandemic. The Overton Window has shifted. (Source: NCES + Open Education book)

### 5. **[Learning Management for Non-Linear Knowledge](link)**
Ben Somers: "School treats all knowledge like it goes in a line. In reality, knowledge is ordered in a big complex graph." What's missing: tools that map knowledge in open-ended ways while staying connected to benchmarks, giving parents confidence to deviate from the line. (Source: OpenEd Podcast)

## TOOLS OF THE WEEK (8-12 items grouped)

### Building Genius (The Tutor Category)

**[Brilliant](link)** - Self-paced, interactive STEM learning used by 10 million people. Hands-on problem-solving from foundational math to quantum mechanics. Ages 13-113 (advanced younger learners can use it). $25/month covers everything from math to AI and Python.

**[Math Academy](link)** - Mentioned by Ben Somers as a must-have. Maps knowledge as a complex graph instead of a straight line. Adaptive learning that lets kids take different paths to the same concepts.

**[Recess](link)** - Platform where kids browse classes (taught by YouTubers and professionals), request what excites them, parents approve. Automatically helps kids make friends who like the same stuff. Built around the $10M insight: friends > curriculum.

### Real-World Learning

**[Abeka Field Trip Ideas](link)** - Simple, low-cost field trips that beat worksheets:
- Apple orchard (economics, botany, agriculture)
- Nature hike (ecosystems, observation journaling)
- Local theater (literature, plot structure)
- Career day visits (interview professionals, build communication)
- Garden center (plant science, responsibility)
- Fire/police station (civics, public service)

### For Parents

**[Erik Hoel's Essay: Why We Stopped Making Einsteins](link)** - The aristocratic tutoring thesis. Required reading for any parent thinking about education design.

**[The Future of Tutoring by Liz Cohen](link)** - 18 months visiting schools across 7 states documenting the post-pandemic tutoring revolution. Shows what works at scale.

**[Open Education Book](link)** - The comprehensive case for education as a flexible operating system, not a rigid program. Free to read online.

### Communities & Programs

**[Synthesis School](link)** - The SpaceX school model that taught Ben Somers about the power of friends in learning. Team simulation games for kids and digital math tutor.

**[Breakout School](link)** (Utah) - Spends 80-90% of time outside, designed for students with autism and ADHD. Dr. Dow Richardson calls their challenges "their superpower." Students return to traditional high schools getting A's and B's.

**[The Forest School (Acton Academy)](link)** - Founded by Tyler Thigpen. Addresses "the epidemic of dependent learners"—students trained to wait for adults to tell them what to do.

**[Learning Lab](link)** (Wichita, Kansas) - Kid coworking space with 7 different school models inside. Podcast studio, video studio, mess lab, print shop. Microschools rent rooms, families can subscribe monthly. (Mentioned by Ela as closest to Ben's vision)

## PARTING THOUGHT/QUESTION

**Format: Quote + Commentary**

> "I think there are only two or three reasons you work in education... Either you had a bad experience and you can imagine a version of yourself that's better than you are now, and you want to build the education that would have produced that version of yourself. Or you had a particularly good schooling experience and you want to bring that to more people." — Ben Somers

Ben dropped out of high school after being medicated to make him easier to manage. Now he's building what he needed. What version of education would produce the best version of your child?

## SUBJECT LINE OPTIONS

1. **Education isn't a game show (it's an operating system)** (Observation-based, OS metaphor)
2. **The three doors everyone thinks they have to pick from** (Obstacle-focused, game show setup)
3. **Your kid's education is an iPhone, not a PC** (Surprise element, iOS moment)
4. **25% of boys in one town were medicated for school** (Surprising stat, Ben's story)
5. **Stop picking doors. Start building apps.** (Opinion-based, architect message)
6. **Why education is stuck running Windows 95** (Observation-based, tech metaphor)

**Recommended:** #1 or #2 (set up the Deep Dive clearly)
