# OpenEd Daily - NYT Unschooling Response

**SUBJECT:** The New York Times is arguing with itself
**PREVIEW:** Three weeks apart, two very different takes on education. PLUS: What unschooling actually is.

Greetings Eddies!

We were going to cover the New York Times today anyway - a November piece asking whether schools are part of the youth mental health crisis. Honest reporting. Good data. Peter Gray quoted.

Then the Times published a guest essay this weekend calling for mandatory state oversight of homeschoolers.

Three weeks apart. Two very different takes. The Times is arguing with itself.

Let's dive in.

## THOUGHT: WHAT BLOCK DESCRIBES ISN'T UNSCHOOLING

The guest essay is by novelist Stefan Merrill Block. He invokes John Holt, the educator who coined "unschooling" in the 1970s. But what he describes is the opposite of Holt's vision.

Holt's unschooling: Child-led learning that *expands* a child's world. Community. Mentors. Real-world engagement. Following curiosity wherever it leads.

Block's experience: A struggling mother who *contracted* her son's world. Isolation from peers. Emotional enmeshment. Using him to fill a void. ("You are better than any grown-up, Stef. You are more than all I need.")

Block spent his days with his mother, alone, having his hair bleached while she processed her own grief. That's not unschooling. That's a parent in crisis.

We take his pain seriously. His experience isn't an indictment of unschooling - it's an indictment of isolation. Real unschooling looks nothing like this.

## TOOL: RECESS.GG

If Block's problem was isolation, here's what the opposite looks like.

[Recess.gg](https://recess.gg) is a platform where homeschoolers make friends - worldwide. Virtual classes. Social feeds for parents and kids. A community that solves the exact problem Block is describing.

John Holt argued that children learn through real connection with the world. Recess is one way families are building that connection - kids finding peers who share their interests, parents finding their village.

Block wanted someone from outside the home to notice him. Recess is how homeschool families build that outside connection on their own terms.

## TREND: THE SELF-REFUTING TIMES

**November 24:** The Times publishes "[America's Children Are Unwell. Are Schools Part of the Problem?](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/24/magazine/youth-mental-health-crisis-schools.html)" Data: 1 in 4 teenage boys diagnosed with ADHD. Autism from 1 in 2,500 to 1 in 31. Anxiety onset at age 6. Peter Gray quoted: "Instead of saying 'We need to fix the schools,' the message is 'We need to fix the kids.'"

**December 14:** The Times publishes a guest essay arguing homeschoolers need more state oversight. Mandatory registration. Assessments. Check-ins.

Block argues that "lack of state oversight" allowed his mother to isolate him. He wants mandatory checks so someone could have intervened.

This is the Nirvana Fallacy. Block compares homeschooling to an imagined school system where mandated reporters catch every struggling child, where teachers notice every cry for help.

But the Times' own reporting - three weeks earlier - shows the actual school system failing millions of kids. The track got narrower. More kids didn't fit. And we called it a disorder.

Which is it?

We wrote about [what the Times got wrong about homeschooling](https://opened.co/blog/what-the-new-york-times-got-wrong-about-homeschooling) earlier this year. The pattern continues.
