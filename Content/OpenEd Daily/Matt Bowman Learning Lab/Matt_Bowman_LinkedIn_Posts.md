### 1. Agree or Disagree (Framework #1)
**Hook:**
Parenting comes with a manual… said no one ever.

**Post:**
Agree or disagree?

Last night at Wichita’s Learning Lab, Matt Bowman reminded us that parenting is “a learning lab, not a standardized curriculum.” I flashed back to the moment we let two athletic sons pick *different* high schools—even though the district begged us to keep them together for a state title.

Here’s what we learned:
- There is no single playbook for an unstandardized population (a.k.a. our children).
- Giving kids a voice can feel like heresy… until you see them thrive.
- The family survives the critics who wanted bragging rights more than a fit.

Curious where you land. Is parenting a compliance exercise or a co-designed experiment?

### 2. Work vs Personal Life (Framework #4)
**Hook:**
Matt Bowman put his reputation on the shelf to let his sons choose different schools.

**Post:**
We all say “child first,” but then the booster club calls.

Work: “Keep both boys on the varsity roster. Imagine the championship!”
Personal life: “Dad, we want different paths.”

Matt chose personal life. No shared trophy, but two kids who own their schooling. That choice built OpenEd’s culture: parents are architects, not spectators. The Wichita Learning Lab is filled with families making similar tradeoffs—less applause, more agency.

Question: Where have you willingly disappointed the crowd to do right by your child?

### 3. Failure Post (Framework #6)
**Hook:**
We tried to design education from the bleachers. It bombed.

**Post:**
Failure file: assuming one schedule would fit five kids because we lived under one roof.

What happened?
- Same chores, same bedtime, same school bus.
- Completely different personalities (even among “Irish twins”).
- Massive burnout when we ignored their intersections of interest + need + resource.

Fix:
- Let each child detox from structure and list what they did when no one was watching.
- Mapped interests → family needs → available resources.
- Rebuilt the week with their fingerprints.

Result: fewer power struggles, more momentum. Lesson learned—standardization is the real failure.

### 4. Tips Post (Framework #18)
**Hook:**
Five tips from Matt Bowman’s Learning Lab playbook.

**Post:**
Want to turn “parenting is a learning lab” into action? Try this:
1. Schedule white space—kids need boredom before curiosity shows up.
2. Ask, “What do you think about when no one assigns you anything?”
3. Map family needs first (budgets, chores, caregiving). Constraints are clarity.
4. Inventory resources from **free → fee**. Start with what’s already in your home & neighborhood.
5. Run two-week learner-led sprints. Pizza-fueled presentations at the end.

The Wichita Learning Lab uses this loop weekly. Copy and remix.

### 5. Study Summary (Framework #24)
**Hook:**
Learning Labs are the new field trip.

**Post:**
Key takeaways from our latest OpenEd field visit to the Wichita Learning Lab:
- 60+ families co-manage a shared calendar of workshops, labs, and mentor sessions.
- Every intake starts with the Interests → Needs → Resources worksheet.
- Kids as young as six pitch micro-ventures (from pumpkin sales to robot builds).
- Parents report lower burnout because they share facilitation load.

TL;DR: Community-built environments are beating one-size-fits-all. We documented the process here → *[link to worksheet/toolkit]*.

### 6. Curiosity Post (Framework #25)
**Hook:**
What happens when you ask, “What do you *dislike* learning?”

**Post:**
At the Wichita Learning Lab, Matt Bowman asks kids to list:
- What I love
- What I’d like to get better at
- What I genuinely dislike

That third column sparks more breakthroughs than the other two combined. When a child feels safe saying “I hate gardening,” you can pivot: is it the dirt, the lone work, or the fact that it’s mandated? Suddenly you’re designing a market garden together—or swapping the chore for a different family need.

Curious: Have you tried the “dislike list” at home? What did it reveal?

### 7. Crowdsource Post (Framework #29)
**Hook:**
We’re mapping “free-to-fee” resources for learner-driven families. Help? 🙌

**Post:**
Our Interests → Needs → Resources sheet starts with *free* assets before moving down to *fee*. The Wichita Learning Lab already has:
- Library partnerships
- Zoo internships
- Neighborhood mentors (NASA engineer included!)

We’re building a shared database. Drop your favorite free or low-cost resource (city + link). We’ll consolidate and send it back to the community.

### 8. 10 Ideas Post (Framework #31)
**Hook:**
Ten ways to let kids go deep without losing breadth.

**Post:**
Matt Bowman’s advice: when a child fixates (space, stop-motion, ballet), they’re mastering the *skill of depth*. Keep the curiosity alive while sprinkling new inputs.

10 prompts:
1. Pair their obsession with entrepreneurship (sell the menu before the muffin). 
2. Invite an expert Zoom call from your network. 
3. Design a board game about the topic. 
4. Run a two-week sprint with a public share-out. 
5. Visit a local space like Wichita Learning Lab to find “co-explorers.” 
6. Start a podcast or mini-doc interviewing peers. 
7. Volunteer in a related community project. 
8. Turn the interest into a family need (space-themed babysitting, anyone?). 
9. Compare the topic to another field (ballet + physics). 
10. Teach a workshop—nothing reveals gaps faster.

### 9. 5 Types of People Post (Framework #32)
**Hook:**
Five people you need in your family learning lab.

**Post:**
According to Matt Bowman, every parent-led ecosystem benefits from:
1. **The Curiosity Scout** – finds raw interests before kids lose the spark.
2. **The Constraint Keeper** – balances dreams with budgets + chores. 
3. **The Resource Librarian** – maintains the free → fee inventory. 
4. **The Sprint Coach** – guides those two-week experiments. 
5. **The Connector** – links kids to mentors (Learning Lab Wichita is full of them).

Which role do you play naturally? Which one needs a partner?

### 10. Mistakes Listicle (Framework #36)
**Hook:**
Three mistakes we made before treating education like a learning lab.

**Post:**
1. **Copy-pasting our childhood.** “I loved varsity basketball, so you will too.” Spoiler: they didn’t. 
2. **Ignoring dislikes.** We forced gardening as a virtue. Turns out the real lesson was entrepreneurship, not tomatoes. 
3. **Outsourcing curiosity.** We assumed school would cover it. It didn’t—until we handed the mic to our kids.

Correction: adopted the Interests → Needs → Resources framework, partnered with communities like the Wichita Learning Lab, and started co-designing education instead of prescribing it.

What mistake are you retiring this year?
