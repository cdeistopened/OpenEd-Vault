# Parenting Is a Learning Lab
*Preview: Matt Bowman reminds us there’s no manual for raising unique kids—and spotlights the Wichita Learning Lab built to honor that truth.*

Greetings!

At a recent OpenEd gathering in Wichita, founder Matt Bowman reminded parents of the obvious thing we often forget: *“Parenting is a learning lab. There’s no manual or standardized curriculum that you go through to be a parent.”* The same is true for education. Every child in Matt’s family—five kids, five spouses, and now a growing gaggle of grandsons—needed something different even though they lived under the same roof.

Here’s how to turn that mindset into a plan.

**THOUGHT: Parenting is a learning lab**  
Parenting has never felt like a manual to me—it’s a learning lab. With five kids (and now an army of grandsons), my wife and I learned the hard way that you can’t standardize an unstandardized population. We kept the chores and job charts consistent, sure, but when our two basketball-loving sons asked for different schools, I let them choose—even as the district tried to guilt me into keeping them together so the town could chase a championship. The result? Two confident young men who know their education wasn’t copied from my playbook; it was co-designed with them. We’re all learning out loud; the experts are the kids in front of us.

**TREND: Learning Labs are popping up to support parent-designed education**  
Take the Wichita Learning Lab: part co-op, part makerspace, part community center. Families meet there to map interests, swap mentors, and launch learner-led sprints together. We’re seeing similar hubs replicate across the OpenEd network because parents are done waiting for one-size-fits-all. These spaces make flexible scheduling possible while connecting kids to real resources—local zoos, libraries, entrepreneurship mentors, even NASA-linked projects for the space-obsessed.

**TOOL: The Learning Landscape Worksheet (Interests → Needs → Resources)**  
Start by giving kids unstructured time so you can observe what they *actually* do when nothing is assigned. Layer in the non-negotiables—family budgets, chores, caregiving, screen rules—and note them alongside the interests. Then inventory resources from **free-to-fee**: what’s in your home, who lives in your neighborhood, which community hubs (like the Learning Lab) are available. The worksheet guides you through that conversation. Download the template (PDF + Notion), run a two-week learner-led sprint, and celebrate the share-out over pizza.

**Question of the Week**  
“Where did your child learn the most in the last two weeks—and what made that moment possible?” Reply and let’s build a community list of surprising learning labs.

That’s all for today!
