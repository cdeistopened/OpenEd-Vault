## GABOR MATÉ VIDEO CLIP

"You don't have to impose hard things on kids."

Gabor Maté on why confidence—not manufactured hardship—is what prepares kids for life.

Every parent has seen it: the moment your toddler says "I'm gonna do it myself."

You didn't teach them that. That's nature's agenda.

Our job? Build their confidence. Then get out of the way.

"You don't have to impose hard things on kids."

Gabor Maté on why confidence—not manufactured hardship—is what prepares kids for life.

Life is already hard. Tying your shoes at age 2 is hard. Learning to read is hard. Making friends is hard.

Kids with confidence don't avoid hard things. They seek them out.

Our job isn't to manufacture struggle. It's to build the foundation that makes them want to try.

What's one hard thing you've seen your kid take on independently? Drop it in the comments.

## BUSINESS INSIDER ARTICLE SCREENSHOT

### LinkedIn Post (Screenshot + Link in Comments)

She swore she'd never send her kids to public school.

Ten years later, all three are on different paths:
- One in private academy
- One in online school with a gifted plan
- One homeschooling

Colleen Kelly started as a "crunchy mama" with firm convictions. Waldorf. Montessori. No public school—she saw it as a factory for cookie-cutter kids.

Then life happened.

Single mom. Three kids. Limited bandwidth.

With "great reluctance," she enrolled them in public school.

Two thrived. One didn't.

So she pulled her middle child out for online charter.

Her takeaway?

"An ideal education didn't just look different for my family—but for each child within it."

This is the open education mindset:

You're not locked into the approach you swore by five years ago.

Different kids need different things.
Different stages call for different solutions.

The question isn't "What's the best school type?"

It's "What's the best match for THIS kid, right now?"

She swore she'd never send her kids to public school.

Ten years and three kids later? One's in private school. One's doing online school. One's homeschooling.

Colleen Kelly started as a self-described "crunchy mama"—Waldorf, Montessori, whole-child learning. Public school was the enemy.

Then life happened. Single mom. Three kids. No bandwidth to customize curricula for each one.

With "great reluctance," she enrolled them in public school.

Two thrived. One didn't.

So she adapted. Pulled her middle child out. Found what worked.

Her conclusion: "An ideal education didn't just look different for my family—but for each child within it."

That's the open education mindset. You're not locked into the approach you swore by five years ago.

Different kids. Different stages. Different solutions.
