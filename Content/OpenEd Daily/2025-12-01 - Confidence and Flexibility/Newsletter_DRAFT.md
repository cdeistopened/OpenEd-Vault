### OPENING OPTIONS (pick one):

**A. Lead with identity shift (direct):**
Greetings Eddies!

A Business Insider piece caught my eye this week. A self-described "crunchy mama" who swore she'd never send her kids to public school ended up doing exactly that—and watching two of them thrive.

Her decade-long journey through homeschool, public, and private taught her something worth sitting with.

Let's dive in.

**B. Lead with the lesson (teaser):**
Greetings Eddies!

What happens when a mom who swore off public school ends up enrolling all three kids—and watches two of them flourish?

She learns that the right education isn't about the school type. It's about the match.

Let's dive in.

**C. Quick holiday transition:**
Greetings Eddies!

Back at it after Thanksgiving. This week: a mom who tried every school type over ten years, and a Gabor Maté clip that stopped me mid-scroll.

Let's dive in.

## YOU DON'T HAVE TO IMPOSE HARD THINGS

From a [Gabor Maté interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCSZ-F-MoX4) that's been circulating:

**"Living is a hard thing. Life brings sorrow. It brings pain. It means loss. You don't have to impose hard things on kids."**

He points to something every parent has witnessed: the moment a toddler declares, "I'm gonna do it myself." You didn't teach them to want independence. That's nature's agenda.

**"What they need is confidence. If they have it, they'll naturally take on hard things. They'll want to. We don't have to impose it."**

We think we need to manufacture hardship to prepare kids for life. But kids with confidence seek out challenges on their own—enthusiastically.

## THREE KIDS, THREE DIFFERENT PATHS

Colleen Kelly started her parenting journey with firm convictions. Waldorf. Montessori. Whole-child learning. [No public school](https://www.businessinsider.com/kids-attend-public-private-homeschool-pros-cons-2025-11)—she saw it as a factory for cookie-cutter kids.

Then life happened. Single mom of three. No bandwidth to customize curricula for each child. With "great reluctance," she enrolled them in public school.

The surprise? Her oldest and youngest thrived. Extroverts who reveled in the social setting. Her middle child? Not so much—so she pulled her out for online charter.

**"An ideal education didn't just look different for my family,"** she writes, **"but for each child within it."**

Today, all three are on different paths: private academy, online school with a gifted plan, and homeschool. That's Open Education in action: you're not locked into the approach you swore by five years ago. Different kids need different things. Different stages call for different solutions. The beauty is that you get to choose.

## HOLD ON TO YOUR KIDS

[Hold On to Your Kids](https://www.amazon.com/Hold-Your-Kids-Parents-Matter/dp/0375760288) by Gabor Maté and Gordon Neufeld argues that modern childhood has inverted the natural order. Kids now orient toward peers instead of parents—and that shift undermines the very confidence Maté describes in today's opening.

The book's premise: attachment to caring adults is the foundation of healthy development. When that attachment is secure, kids venture out boldly. When it's replaced by peer orientation, they become anxious, conformist, and harder to reach.

**Who it's for:** Parents who sense their influence slipping to peers, screens, or school culture—and want to understand why.

That's all for today!
