**SUBJECT:** Three moves when your kid refuses to practice music

**PREVIEW:** The 30-year regret that changed one music teacher's parenting. PLUS: Science + concrete moves.

Here's the thing nobody tells you: your kid doesn't need perfect practice habits to benefit from music lessons. This realization came to Deborah Pratt after 30 years—when her own daughter, now 45, told her something that changed everything. Let's dig in.

## THE REGRET NOBODY TALKS ABOUT

Deborah Pratt is a professional music educator. She runs the Southern Oregon School of Music. She has her degrees in music education. And she made a parenting mistake that still stings.

Her daughter was taking trumpet lessons in high school but wasn't practicing at home. As a music teacher, Deb felt embarrassed. So she made the logical call: no practice, no lessons. Her daughter quit.

Thirty years later, her daughter said something that rewired how Deb thinks about everything: "I really wish you'd let me continue to take lessons because I could be playing today if you had let me keep playing."

The lesson here isn't about practice. It's about continuity. **Just taking the lesson—even without home practice—keeps a child connected to something that builds real skills.** And the cost of quitting in a moment of frustration is regret that stretches across decades.

## WHY SHOWING UP MATTERS (NEUROSCIENCE CONFIRMS IT)

Here's what makes this story more than parental guilt: the science backs Deb up.

[Research from Harvard Medical School](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996135/) shows that music activates the entire brain in a way almost nothing else does—not math, not exercise, not art. Music engages auditory processing, motor control, language, and emotional centers simultaneously.

More significantly: [music training physically enlarges the corpus callosum](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/3/1282), the part of your brain that connects your left and right hemispheres. This structural change is permanent. **So when Deb says "just taking lessons matters," she's describing actual brain development.** Showing up—even without rigorous home practice—is building neural pathways that last a lifetime.

## THREE MOVES WHEN YOUR KID WON'T PRACTICE

When your kid says "I don't want to practice," here's what actually works:

**Move 1: Talk to the teacher first.** Most parents never do this. They assume lessons are pointless without practice, so they pull the plug. But teachers have tools. Maybe the songs are too hard. Maybe the approach isn't clicking. Maybe there's something missing from the lesson structure. A good teacher (whether it's a private instructor, Kinder Music instructor, or Hoffman Academy guide) can often solve the practice resistance with a small adjustment.

**Move 2: Treat practice like homework.** Deb is clear on this: if your kid wouldn't skip math homework because they didn't feel like it, don't let them skip music practice. Set the expectation kindly but firmly. Be consistent. Practice stops being optional and starts being part of the routine—like homework, like chores, like brushing teeth.

**Move 3: Don't make practice the condition for continuing lessons.** This is the paradigm shift. Practice should be expected, yes. But not practicing shouldn't be the ending of the story. It should be a conversation with the teacher about what might help—not a reason to quit. Keep them in. Keep showing up. That's what builds.

If you're exploring options, consider programs that make this easier: **Kinder Music** builds community around learning (the group cohort keeps kids motivated). **Hoffman Academy** offers YouTube-based lessons that are self-paced and flexible (removes teacher frustration as an excuse). **Local studios like SO School of Music** focus on relationships and personalization (the teacher becomes invested in your kid's growth).

That's all for today!

P.S. The biggest insight from this episode: your kid might not love clarinet. They might not love piano. But if they stay long enough—through the hard parts—they might discover they love the bass. Or they might discover they love learning itself. That discovery only happens if they don't quit.
