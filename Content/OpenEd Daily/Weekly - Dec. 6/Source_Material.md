## DEEP DIVE ARTICLE (Wednesday)

**Title:** Homeschool Art Curriculum
**URL:** https://opened.co/blog/homeschool-art-curriculum
**Author:** Charlie Deist, Head of Content at OpenEd

### Key Quotes & Insights

1. "When it comes to teaching art, there's no answer key."

2. "With math, you can check their work. With reading, you measure fluency and comprehension. Even science has a method—hypothesize, test, observe. But art? The definition is so broad it practically dissolves under scrutiny."

3. Viktor Lowenfeld quote: Kids in the "schematic stage" draw what they *know*—a house is a square with a triangle roof, a person is a circle with stick legs—not what they actually see.

4. "Trying to teach realistic rendering to a five-year-old is like teaching calculus to someone who hasn't learned multiplication. You're working against developmental reality."

5. "Push the wrong curriculum too hard at the wrong time, and you can watch a child's creative confidence evaporate. (Ask any adult who decided at age 11 that they 'weren't artistic.')"

6. On the transition to "dawning realism" stage: "Kids become self-critical, and if they don't have tools to bridge the gap between what they imagine and what they can execute, they give up."

7. High school section: "Not every artistically inclined kid wants to go to art school or needs a transcript credit. Some just want to create—and the best thing you can do is get out of their way while providing resources and community."

## DEEP DIVE PODCAST (Thursday)

**Title:** When (Not) to Quit Music Lessons
**Guest:** Deborah Pratt (music teacher)
**URL:** https://opened.co/blog/the-wasted-years-of-music-lessons-and-why-they-matter
**Instagram Clip:** https://www.instagram.com/reel/DR2MZ6bgoOw/

### Key Quotes

1. "As a parent, you can't undervalue the importance of learning to go deep on something. And I think that's kind of what you're speaking to, where like, I did the same thing. I told my mom, I was like, 'I wish you would've kept me in piano.'"

2. "Being able to go deep in something, being able to master something and have a really amazing skill, like I think that's the thing that everybody looks at music and is like, oh, it'd be so cool if I had this amazing skill."

### Key Story
- One student started piano at eight, practiced inconsistently, cycled through instruments
- At 16, walked in and said "I bought a bass"
- Finally clicked—patterns matched how his brain worked
- Started practicing for hours without anyone pushing

### Takeaway
If his parents had required practice to "earn" lessons, he might've quit before the breakthrough. Don't quit during a normal lull.

### Related Science
- Music is the only activity that lights up the entire brain simultaneously
- Physically enlarges the corpus callosum (bridge connecting left/right hemispheres)
- Research from Journal of Neuroscience shows this structure is significantly larger in musicians

## NOTES

- Deep Dive approved: Viktor Lowenfeld angle with "no answer key" framing

- Avoid: "X isn't just Y, it's Z" constructions, hedging, passive voice
- Each link needs enough context to pique curiosity without summarizing
