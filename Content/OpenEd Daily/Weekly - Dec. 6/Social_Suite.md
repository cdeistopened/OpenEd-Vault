### Post 2: Viktor Lowenfeld Hook

**Background:** Photo of kid's drawing (stick figures, square house with triangle roof)

**Text on image:**
```
This is developmentally
correct.
```

**Caption:**
Why does every 5-year-old draw people as circles with stick legs?

It's not laziness. It's not "bad at art."

Psychologist Viktor Lowenfeld called it the "schematic stage"—kids draw what they KNOW, not what they see.

Trying to teach realism at this age is like teaching calculus before multiplication.

Our new guide breaks down what actually works at each age:

### Post 3: Music Lessons Story

**Background:** Photo of bass guitar or teen with instrument

**Text on image:**
```
"I bought a bass."
```

**Caption:**
He started piano at 8. Practiced inconsistently. Cycled through instruments.

At 16, he walked in and said: "I bought a bass."

Suddenly it clicked.

Music teacher Deborah Pratt says those "wasted" years weren't wasted—they were groundwork.

The breakthrough rarely comes on YOUR timeline. It comes on theirs.

### Static Post: Harada Method

**Image:** 64-square grid (or graphic representing it)

**Caption:**
At 18, Shohei Ohtani filled out a 64-square grid mapping exactly how he'd become the greatest baseball player in history.

It worked.

The Harada Method is the opposite of vision boards. Instead of dreaming big and hoping, you think systematically about every factor—including the weird stuff nobody talks about.

What goal would YOU map out?

### Carousel: Art Curriculum by Age

**Slide 1:**
"The right art curriculum depends on their age."

**Slide 2:**
**Kindergarten (Schematic Stage)**
They draw what they KNOW, not what they see.
Goal: Hand strength + positive associations
Try: iCreate Art Box, Art for Kids Hub

**Slide 3:**
**Elementary (Dawning Realism)**
They want the horse to LOOK like a horse.
Goal: Technique without crushing confidence
Try: The Great Artist Program, Artistic Pursuits

**Slide 4:**
**Middle School (Apprenticeship)**
Treat them like artists, not kids doing crafts.
Goal: Professional materials + real technique
Try: Creating a Masterpiece, Atelier

**Slide 5:**
**High School (Self-Direction)**
They can curate their own path.
Goal: Portfolio prep OR art for life
Try: YouTube (Proko, Marco Bucci), dual enrollment

**Slide 6:**
Full guide in bio.
What's working for YOUR family?

**Caption:**
Why does every 5-year-old draw people as circles with stick legs?

Psychologist Viktor Lowenfeld called it the "schematic stage." Kids draw what they KNOW, not what they see. That's developmentally correct.

Push the wrong curriculum at the wrong time and you can watch creative confidence evaporate.

Our new guide organizes recommendations by age—from subscription boxes to video courses to co-op options.

### Post: Parent-Curated Education

Traditional school is like a DirecTV bundle—132 channels, take it or leave it.

Traditional homeschool is like community theater—Shakespeare, but mom and dad are handling sets, costumes, and lighting.

Today's version? Netflix plus a touring Broadway show. Professional production values. You choose what fits.

Leo Linbeck III calls it "Parent-Curated Education."

Mom doesn't have to master every subject. She finds the masters.

The data backs it up: homeschooling grew 5.4% this year—nearly 3x the pre-pandemic rate. Over 70% of parents now say they favor it.

This isn't a trend. It's a fundamental shift in how families think about education.

### Post: Homeschooling Outcomes Data

New data from NHERI on what happens to homeschooled kids when they grow up:

→ 50% of peer-reviewed studies show they perform statistically significantly BETTER than institutionally schooled peers

→ Higher rates of community service participation

→ Similar or higher college attendance rates

→ Higher internalization of family values

And here's the kicker:

Zero empirical evidence that homeschooling causes negative outcomes compared to institutional schooling.

None.

The narrative is shifting because the data is shifting.

### Standalone Tweets

**Tweet 1:**
Why does every 5-year-old draw people as circles with stick legs?

It's not laziness.

Psychologist Viktor Lowenfeld called it the "schematic stage"—kids draw what they KNOW, not what they see.

Trying to teach realism at this age? You're working against biology.

**Tweet 2:**
He started piano at 8.

Practiced inconsistently.

At 16, he walked in and said: "I bought a bass."

The breakthrough rarely comes on your timeline.

It comes on theirs.

**Tweet 3:**
Homeschooling grew 5.4% this year.

That's 3x the pre-pandemic rate.

This isn't a COVID hangover. 70%+ of parents now favor homeschooling.

If trends continue, public schools could lose 8.5M students by mid-century.

The question isn't whether it's happening.

It's what happens next.

**Tweet 4:**
72% of teens now seek emotional support from AI.

Student-to-counselor ratio: 376:1
Recommended ratio: 250:1

Kids aren't stupid. They're going where they can actually get a response.

**Tweet 5:**
A founder kept getting told she had to be "a daycare or a private school."

So she started a church.

Religious exemption.

75 students now.

Sometimes the workaround IS the way forward.
