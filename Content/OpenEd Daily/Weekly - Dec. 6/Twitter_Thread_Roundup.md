```
Ed's Roundup: The most clicked education links from this week

Here's what 17K+ readers of OpenEd Weekly are paying attention to.

9 creators. 1 thread.

### TWEET 2 (Viktor Lowenfeld / Art Deep Dive)
```
Why does every 5-year-old draw people as circles with stick legs?

It's not laziness. It's developmental biology.

Psychologist Viktor Lowenfeld called it the "schematic stage"—kids draw what they KNOW, not what they see.

Trying to teach realism at this age? You're working against nature.

### TWEET 3 (Deborah Pratt / Music)
```
"As a parent, you can't undervalue the importance of learning to go deep on something."

Music teacher Deborah Pratt watched a student practice piano inconsistently for 8 years.

At 16, he walked in and said: "I bought a bass."

Finally clicked. Don't quit during a normal lull.

### TWEET 4 (Shohei Ohtani / Harada Method)
```
At age 18, Shohei Ohtani filled out a 64-square grid mapping exactly how he'd become baseball's greatest player.

It worked.

The Harada Method is the opposite of every Western vision board you've ever seen.

Hat tip to @flowidealism for the breakdown:

### TWEET 5 (Leo Linbeck / Parent-Curated Education)
```
The best analogy for modern homeschooling we've seen:

Traditional school = DirecTV bundle (132 channels, take it or leave it)

Traditional homeschool = Community theater (Shakespeare, but mom handles everything)

Today's version = Netflix + touring Broadway

Mom doesn't master every subject. She finds the masters.

### TWEET 6 (Tara / Church Microschool)
```
"I was either being cornered into being a daycare or a private school."

So Tara Famularo-Del Bianco founded a church.

The House of Natural Living gave her a religious exemption from state licensing.

The Magnolia Schoolhouse now serves 75 students.

@kaborovsky has the story:

### TWEET 7 (AI Tutoring Data)
```
Students using AI tutoring solved new problems 66.2% of the time.

Human tutors alone: 60.7%.

But here's the catch: AI worked best WITH human oversight, not as a replacement.

"A reliable source of instruction."

That's actually rare in ed-tech.

```

**Structure:** Data Point + Nuance + Observation

### TWEET 8 (Homeschool Growth)
```
Homeschooling grew 5.4% in 2024-2025.

That's nearly 3x the pre-pandemic rate.

This isn't a COVID hangover. 70%+ of parents now favor homeschooling.

If trends continue, public schools could lose 8.5M students by mid-century.

The question isn't whether this is happening.

It's what happens next.
