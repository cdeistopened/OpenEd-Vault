## OPENING LETTER

Greetings Eddies!

Why does every five-year-old draw people as circles with stick legs and houses as squares with a triangle roof?

It's not because they're lazy or "not artistic." A psychologist named Viktor Lowenfeld spent his career studying this. He called it the "schematic stage"—kids draw what they *know*, not what they see. A house is a square with a triangle roof. A person is a head with legs coming out of it. That's developmentally correct.

Trying to teach realistic rendering to a kindergartner is like teaching calculus before multiplication. You're working against biology. More on this in our Deep Dive on homeschool art curriculum—including which programs actually work at each age, according to OpenEd's teachers and veteran homeschool families.

Also this week: a music teacher explains why those "wasted" years of piano lessons might not be wasted at all (spoiler: the breakthrough often comes later), and a Japanese goal-setting method that created baseball's greatest player.

If you know a family exploring a different approach to education, mid-year enrollment is open in select states. [Check availability here](https://opened.co/).

Now let's dive in.

## DEEP DIVE: [Homeschool Art Curriculum](https://opened.co/blog/homeschool-art-curriculum)

Here's the problem with teaching art at home: there's no answer key.

Math has right answers. Reading has fluency scores. Science has a method. But art? You're staring at a drawing of a horse that looks like a melted potato and trying to figure out if that's creative expression or a cry for help.

This ambiguity makes art uniquely dangerous. Push the wrong curriculum at the wrong time and you can watch creative confidence evaporate in real time. Ask any adult who decided at age 11 that they "weren't artistic"—that decision usually traces back to a specific moment when what they made didn't match what they imagined.

The transition happens somewhere in elementary school. Kids go from happily drawing stick figures to wanting their horse to actually *look* like a horse. When it doesn't, many quit entirely. **This is the moment that makes or breaks a young artist**—and it's also the moment where actual technique instruction (perspective, shading, proportion) becomes useful instead of soul-crushing.

The good news: you have more flexibility here than anywhere else in your homeschool. No tests. No required sequence. Just a kid, some materials, and permission to explore. Our new guide organizes curriculum recommendations by age and format—subscription boxes, video instruction, book-based programs, co-op options—tested at actual kitchen tables by OpenEd families.

## PODCAST HIGHLIGHT: [When (Not) to Quit Music Lessons](https://opened.co/blog/the-wasted-years-of-music-lessons-and-why-they-matter)

Music teacher Deborah Pratt has watched this story unfold dozens of times:

Kid starts piano at eight. Practices inconsistently. Cycles through a few instruments. Parents wonder if they're wasting money on lessons. From the outside, it looks like a dead end.

Then at 16, he walks in and says: "I bought a bass."

Suddenly the patterns click. The years of exposure to rhythm and melody and muscle memory finally have somewhere to go. He starts practicing for hours—not because anyone's pushing him, but because he's found his thing.

The takeaway isn't "force your kid to practice." It's closer to the opposite: if his parents had required practice to "earn" lessons, he might've quit before the breakthrough. Sometimes the click comes at 16, not 8. Don't quit during a normal lull.

## TRENDS WE'RE FOLLOWING

[**Homeschooling Growth Isn't Slowing Down**](https://reason.com/2025/11/19/homeschooling-hits-record-numbers/) — The numbers for 2024-2025 are in: 5.4% growth, nearly three times the pre-pandemic rate. Translation: This isn't just a COVID hangover. Over 70% of parents now say they favor homeschooling—and if current trends continue, traditional public schools could lose 8.5 million students by mid-century. ([Reason](https://reason.com/2025/11/19/homeschooling-hits-record-numbers/))

[**The Goal-Setting Method That Created Baseball's Greatest Player (And How Your Kid Can Use It)**](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-193-the-method-that) — At age 18, Shohei Ohtani filled out a 64-square grid mapping exactly how he'd become the best player in baseball history. It worked. The Harada Method is basically the opposite of every Western vision board you've ever seen—instead of dreaming big and hoping for the best, you think systematically about every factor that could affect your goal, including the weird tangential stuff nobody talks about. Austin Scholar breaks down exactly what Ohtani did differently—and what parents miss. ([Austin Scholar](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-193-the-method-that))

[**A Founder Started a Church to Run Her Microschool**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerrymcdonald/2025/12/01/meet-the-founder-who-started-a-church-to-run-her-microschool/) — Tara Famularo-Del Bianco kept hitting the same wall: "I was either being cornered into being a daycare or a private school." Every fiber of her being said "No- I'm neither of those." So she did what any reasonable person would do: she founded a church. The House of Natural Living gave her a religious exemption from state licensing requirements. The Magnolia Schoolhouse now serves 75 students. Kerry McDonald has the full story in her excellent [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerrymcdonald/2025/12/01/meet-the-founder-who-started-a-church-to-run-her-microschool/) column.

[**AI Tutoring Works. But it Works Better With Humans in the Loop**](https://www.the74million.org/article/ai-tutors-with-a-little-human-help-offer-reliable-instruction-study-finds/) — Students using AI tutoring solved new problems 66.2% of the time, narrowly beating out those who used human tutors alone (60.7%). But the AI worked *best* when combined with human oversight, not as a replacement. The researchers called it "a reliable source of instruction"—which sounds like faint praise until you realize how rare reliability actually is in ed-tech. ([The 74 Million](https://www.the74million.org/article/ai-tutors-with-a-little-human-help-offer-reliable-instruction-study-finds/))

[**72% of Teens Now Seek Emotional Support From AI**](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2025/12/04/what-is-the-role-of-school-counselors-in-the-age-of-ai/) — The current student-to-counselor ratio in American schools is 376:1. The recommended ratio is 250:1. Kids aren't stupid—they're going where they can actually get a response. Getting Smart asks the obvious question nobody wants to answer: what's the role of school counselors when a chatbot is more available? ([Getting Smart](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2025/12/04/what-is-the-role-of-school-counselors-in-the-age-of-ai/))

[**"Parent-Curated Education" Is the New Homeschooling**](https://leo3linbeck.substack.com/p/the-artists-formerly-known-as-homeschooler) — Leo Linbeck III (who sounds like he should be commanding a Swedish cavalry regiment, but is actually a Houston-based engineer) offers the best analogy we've seen: Traditional school is like a DirecTV bundle—132 channels, take it or leave it. Traditional homeschool is like community theater—Shakespeare, but mom and dad are handling sets, costumes, and lighting. Today's version? Netflix plus a touring Broadway show. Professional production values. You choose what fits. Mom doesn't have to master every subject. She finds the masters. ([Leo Linbeck, Substack](https://leo3linbeck.substack.com/p/the-artists-formerly-known-as-homeschooler))

[**So You Can Finish School in 2 Hours. Then What?**](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2025/11/20/so-you-can-finish-school-in-2-hours-a-day-then-what/) — Alpha School promotes a "two-hour AI school day" aimed at mastery-based learning. (In practice, actual hours are closer to four.) But the more interesting question isn't whether AI can compress academics—it's what fills the remaining time. Getting Smart makes the case for experiential learning: not just how we contribute, but how we learn to be nimble between competing and cooperating. When students get their day back, that creates a huge opportunity—or a huge vacuum. ([Getting Smart](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2025/11/20/so-you-can-finish-school-in-2-hours-a-day-then-what/))

[**Homeschooling Success in Adulthood: The Data**](https://nheri.org/homeschooling-success-in-adulthood-fact-sheet/) — NHERI compiled the peer-reviewed research on what happens to homeschooled kids when they grow up. The findings: 50% of studies show they perform statistically significantly *better* than institutionally schooled peers. They participate in community service more frequently. They go to college at similar or higher rates. They internalize their parents' values at higher rates. And here's the kicker: no empirical evidence that homeschooling causes negative outcomes compared to institutional schooling. Zero. ([NHERI](https://nheri.org/homeschooling-success-in-adulthood-fact-sheet/))
