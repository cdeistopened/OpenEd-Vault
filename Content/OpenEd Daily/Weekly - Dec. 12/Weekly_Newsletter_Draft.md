## OPENING LETTER

Greetings Eddies!

Every December, parents feel the pressure to buy the “educational” gift. The kind that looks virtuous in the cart. The kind that ends up under the couch by January.

This week, we’ve got two practical things:

First: OpenEd’s Holiday Gift Guide—community-tested picks that kids actually come back to.

Second: a Dalena Wallace clip that hits a nerve for a lot of parents. Burnout isn’t a personal failure. It’s what happens when the entire thing lives on your shoulders.

Quick hits before we dive in:
1. The gift guide: [The OpenEd Holiday Gift Guide 2025](https://opened.co/blog/homeschool-gift-guide-2025) (OpenEd)
2. The merch: [store.opened.co](https://store.opened.co/) — code **DROP** for 20% off, everything sold at cost (OpenEd)

Now let’s dive in.

## DEEP DIVE: [The OpenEd Holiday Gift Guide 2025](https://opened.co/blog/homeschool-gift-guide-2025)

Every year there’s pressure to buy the “educational” gift. The kind that signals you’re doing it right. The kind that promises outcomes (and quietly dares you to feel guilty if it doesn’t deliver).

OpenEd’s guide uses a better filter: *engagement.* The gifts that keep teaching aren’t the ones that make the boldest claims—they’re the ones that pull kids back in on a random Tuesday. They create habits: building, making, exploring, listening, moving. Curiosity doesn’t need a lecture. It needs something to grab onto.

Instead of “here are 73 ideas,” OpenEd asked real families and teachers what actually earned a permanent place in homes where living and learning share the same rooms—and organized the best picks into **10 categories**, each with an OpenEd Favorite and a short list of runner-ups.

It’s practical, specific, and built for mixed ages: game-night picks that keep the whole family at the table, nature gear that turns “go outside” into an adventure, and teen tools that can turn screen time into making time. If you’re stuck, this is the guide that stops the spiral and gets you to “wrap it and ship it.”

## PODCAST HIGHLIGHT: [How to Homeschool (Without Being the Teacher)](https://opened.co/blog/how-to-homeschool-without-being-the-teacher)

Ela’s conversation with Dalena Wallace includes the sentence a lot of parents won’t say out loud until they’re already drowning:

“I’ve even talked to therapists who have said, ‘Our number one clients are homeschooling moms.’”

Dalena doesn’t romanticize it. She names the weight—then gives parents permission to stop carrying it solo:

“After 13 years of homeschooling, I was experiencing some burnout… I almost gave up on homeschooling. I thought, ‘I don’t think I can do this.’”

Her solution isn’t “try harder.” It’s redesign. Tutors. Co-op. Curriculum that grades itself. A village.

She has a one-question filter for anything she’s considering: “Does it grade itself?” And she schedules around her real bandwidth—keeping the days she does well and outsourcing the rest. That one shift turns homeschooling from “this is all on me” into “this is designed.”

If teaching isn’t your strong suit, the move is not pretending it is. The move is building a system that doesn’t collapse when you have a bad week—and then giving other parents permission to do the same.

## REDDIT CORNER

**[Favorite Historical Fiction Books for Interdisciplinary Learning (middle school-ish)](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1pje6al/favorite_historical_fiction_books_for/)** — A parent asks for historical fiction that can do double duty (history + writing + rabbit-hole conversations).

## PARTING THOUGHT

If your teen asked to try school (or asked to quit), most parents would reach for rules. Isaac Morehouse reached for a whiteboard.

He asked a better question: “What do you actually want?” Not “What are you supposed to do?” Not “What will this look like to other people?” Money. Friends. Freedom. Then he and his son did something almost nobody does: they mapped which option delivered the most of the life the kid said he wanted.

That’s the whole Open Education move in miniature. Stop treating school as the default. Start treating it as one possible tool. When you can name the goal, you can design the path—and you don’t have to turn every decision into a moral crisis.
