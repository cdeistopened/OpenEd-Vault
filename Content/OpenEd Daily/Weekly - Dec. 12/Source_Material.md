## Podcast Highlight — Dalena Wallace Episode
- **Title:** "The Mom Who Quit Teaching" (OpenEd Daily version) / "How to Homeschool (Without Being the Teacher)" on podcast.
- **Links:**
  - Instagram clip: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSIy4DQiOfj/
  - Full episode: https://opened.co/blog/how-to-homeschool-without-being-the-teacher (podcast embed lives on blog).
- **Episode angle:** Dalena outsources the parts she's weakest at, curates tutors, and treats micro schools + co-ops as non-negotiables for sustainability.
- **Quotes for summary:**
  1. "I'm curating it thoughtfully, prayerfully, and intentionally based on our family's needs."
  2. "Does it grade itself?" as her filter for curriculum (Teaching Textbooks, Veritas Press, Good and the Beautiful critique).
  3. Kansas network (WISE) dream: every neighborhood church hosts a school.
- **Callouts:** highlight Tue/Thu tutor days, Wed co-op she founded 8 years ago, OpenEd funds enabling laptops + microschool staff.
- **Weekly podcast highlight clip (burnout + grace):**
  - “I’ve even talked to therapists who have said, ‘Our number one clients are homeschooling moms.’”
  - “After 13 years of homeschooling, I was experiencing some burnout.”
  - “I almost gave up on homeschooling. I thought, ‘I don’t think I can do this.’”
  - Takeaway framing for the weekly: offer grace + “you don’t have to do it alone,” then tease Dalena’s solution—stop trying to be the teacher, build the village (tutors/co-op/self-grading curriculum).
