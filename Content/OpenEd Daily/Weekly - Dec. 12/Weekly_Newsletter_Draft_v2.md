## OPENING LETTER

### Option A — The December Trade

Greetings Eddies!

December has a trade:

You get the lights, the music, the family time.

You also get decision fatigue.

So I’m trying to earn your clicks this week without asking for more brainpower than you’ve got left. We’ve got a holiday gift guide you can trust, and a podcast highlight that offers a rare kind of permission: you’re allowed to build a homeschool that doesn’t depend on you having unlimited energy.

Let’s dive in.

— Charlie (the OpenEd newsletter guy)

### Option B — The “Wrap It and Ship It” Week

Greetings Eddies!

If your brain feels like 37 tabs are open and one of them is playing music: same.

So we’re keeping this week practical. A gift guide that ends the spiral. A podcast clip that names what a lot of parents feel and then points to a way out that doesn’t involve becoming a superhero.

Let’s dive in.

— Charlie (the OpenEd newsletter guy)

### Option C — The Burnout + Buying Combo

Greetings Eddies!

Holiday shopping and homeschool burnout have one thing in common: both get worse when you try to do them alone.

This week’s Deep Dive is our Holiday Gift Guide—community-tested picks that actually get used. And our Podcast Highlight is Dalena Wallace on what it looks like to stop carrying the whole thing on your back.

Let’s dive in.

— Charlie (the OpenEd newsletter guy)

### Option D — The Hidden KPI

Greetings Eddies!

There’s a hidden KPI in every homeschool: not test scores—adult capacity.

When your capacity drops to zero, even “good” curriculum turns into friction. This week, we’ve got a gift guide for the buying side of December, and a podcast highlight for the part nobody posts about: how to rebuild a week that works when you’re tired.

Let’s dive in.

## DEEP DIVE: [The OpenEd Holiday Gift Guide 2025](https://opened.co/blog/homeschool-gift-guide-2025)

Every year there’s pressure to buy the “educational” gift. The kind that signals you’re doing it right. The kind that promises outcomes.

OpenEd’s guide uses a better filter: *engagement.* The gifts that keep teaching aren’t the ones that make the boldest claims—they’re the ones that get used again. They create habits: building, making, exploring, listening, moving. Curiosity doesn’t need a lecture. It needs something to grab onto.

So this isn’t a “73 ideas” list. It’s organized into **10 categories**, each with an OpenEd Favorite and runner-ups—built from what OpenEd families and teachers say their kids actually love (and keep loving).

If you’re stuck in the shopping spiral, this is the guide that gets you to “wrap it and ship it.”

## PODCAST HIGHLIGHT: [How to Homeschool (Without Being the Teacher)](https://opened.co/blog/how-to-homeschool-without-being-the-teacher)

Ela’s conversation with Dalena Wallace contains a blunt observation that explains a lot of hidden burnout:

“I’ve even talked to therapists who have said, ‘Our number one clients are homeschooling moms.’”

Dalena treats that as a signal flare, not a shame spiral:

“After 13 years of homeschooling, I was experiencing some burnout… I almost gave up on homeschooling. I thought, ‘I don’t think I can do this.’”

What’s useful about Dalena is the practical architecture: rebuild the week around support. Tutors. Co-op. Curriculum that grades itself. A village. A schedule that matches reality: where you’re strong, where you’re not, and what kind of support you actually need.

If you’ve ever felt the “45 minutes for the 15-minute lesson” spiral, this episode is a reset: you don’t have to do it alone, and you don’t have to do it the hard way.

## WHAT’S MOVING

[**Post-COVID “Normal” Isn’t School-As-Default**](https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/four-post-covid-trends-are-reshaping-american-education/) — Hannah Frankman lays out four shifts that are sticking: Zoom school revealed the day-to-day reality, homeschooling lost its stigma, remote work broke the childcare trap, and policy is scrambling to catch up. (The Daily Economy)

[**Grade Levels Never Worked (And We’ve Been Pretending for 100+ Years)**](https://abovegradelevel.substack.com/p/grade-levels-never-worked) — A case against age-based “grade level” as anything more than an administrative convenience, backed by early data showing 30–50% of students repeating grades in major cities even in the early 1900s. (Above Grade Level)

[**College Remedial Math Is Getting Absurd**](https://www.aei.org/education/a-sad-collapse-in-student-preparation-at-uc-san-diego-was-inevitable/) — UC San Diego faculty report: between 2020 and 2025, the share of students below middle-school math jumped from under 1% to roughly **1 in 8**—with remediation now covering elementary material. (AEI)

[**The “No” Approach vs the “Know” Approach to Safety**](https://petergray.substack.com/p/99-protecting-children-by-empowering) — Peter Gray makes a clean distinction: “no” bans risk, but can also breed fear, secrecy, and low agency; “know” means discussion, learning the real risks, and building competence so kids can do more safely over time. He’s setting up the hardest test case next: smartphones and social media. (Peter Gray Substack)

[**The “Kitchen Phone Rule” (A Boundary That Actually Works)**](https://x.com/privateinequity/status/1997766129649885389) — The idea: one phone lives in the kitchen. Kids can take it when they go out, but it comes back downstairs. No phones disappearing into bedrooms. The most interesting part is the pushback: “If I don’t give my daughter IG she will vanish from the social orbit.” That’s parental FOMO driving decisions before kids even ask. (X @privateinequity)

(Reddit r/homeschool)

**[Teaching your kids coding at home isn’t really about the code](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1phq09a/teaching_your_kids_coding_at_home_isnt_really_about_the_code/)** — A long-time programming teacher says the real win is cognitive: slow down, break problems into steps, treat mistakes as clues, and build patience with yourself. (Reddit r/homeschool)

## PARTING THOUGHT

COVID forced an accidental experiment: millions of families got to see school up close—then watch it stop.

Isaac Morehouse describes what he heard over and over: parents looked at the online version of school and realized, “what they’re actually doing and learning in school is not that much.” If they missed it, “nothing really that bad would happen.”

And then came the surprise: a lot of families didn’t just survive it. They liked it. “We started baking together,” he says. “It was actually really magical during COVID when my kids were home from school and we were all together.” The kids didn’t want to go back to being out of the house all day, every day. The parents didn’t either.

He puts it more bluntly: “All this heavy lifting that I thought the conveyor belt education system was doing, wasn’t doing any of it.” Kids didn’t go for months and they were fine. “They didn’t fall behind.” In plenty of homes, they were “actually happier than ever.”

That’s a clue worth taking seriously. If a system can pause and your child stays okay, you can redesign the week—and keep the parts that made your family feel more like itself.
