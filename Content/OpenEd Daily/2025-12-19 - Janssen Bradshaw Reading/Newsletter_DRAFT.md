Greetings Eddies!

If you follow [@everydayreading](https://instagram.com/everydayreading) - and nearly 600,000 parents do - you know Janssen Bradshaw as the person who always has the perfect book recommendation.

What you might not know is that one of her daughters almost gave up on reading entirely.

On this week's podcast, Janssen shares how she watched her bright, capable daughter start to believe she was dumb - simply because reading didn't come easily. And she shares what actually turned things around. (Hint: it wasn't more books.)

The moment that stuck with me? When Janssen asked her daughter if she was embarrassed that mom talks publicly about her early struggles. Her daughter's response is worth [reading the whole piece](https://opened.co/blog/child-struggling-to-read-what-actually-works) for.

Let's dive in.

## 5,000 BOOKS WEREN'T ENOUGH

We love to believe that if we just fill our homes with books, our kids will become readers. [Janssen Bradshaw's story](https://opened.co/blog/child-struggling-to-read-what-actually-works) complicates that narrative - and ultimately makes it more hopeful.

She was an elementary school librarian. Her house has somewhere between 2,000 and 5,000 books. Her mom was an English major who read aloud every single day. When her first daughter tested at a 12th-grade reading level in kindergarten, Janssen figured this is just what happens when you surround kids with books.

Then came her second daughter. Same methods. Same environment. By first grade, she was barely at grade level and drifting lower.

"My second daughter is extremely bright," Janssen said. "It was not like she was not smart. But learning to read is just really hard for some kids."

The environment creates possibility. It doesn't create guarantee. Some kids need something different - and recognizing that early is a gift, not a failure.

## 60 MINUTES IS TOO LONG

Nobody gets fit doing one three-hour gym session every two weeks. Learning works the same way.

When parents see their child struggling, the instinct is more help - which usually means traditional tutoring: hour-long sessions, once or twice a week. But as one educator put it: "What child is going to have fun learning to read for 60 minutes? That's tough for me as an adult."

The research backs this up. Benjamin Bloom's "[Two Sigma Problem](https://opened.co/blog/einstein-had-a-tutor)" found that one-on-one tutoring made average students outperform 98% of classroom-taught peers. But it's not just about personalization - it's about frequency. [Harvard research on high-dosage tutoring](https://scholar.harvard.edu/fryer/publications) shows that consistent, shorter sessions outperform sporadic longer ones.

Janssen's daughter did 25-minute sessions, four days a week. Not marathons. Not cramming. Just consistent, focused practice that compounds.

That experience eventually became [Savvy Learning](https://savvylearning.com/) - personalized reading and math instruction built on this exact formula. It's available in the [OpenEd Marketplace](https://opened.co/marketplace), and families tell us it's been transformative for kids who were stuck.

## AUDIOBOOKS AREN'T CHEATING

Here's a tool that often gets dismissed as a shortcut: audiobooks. But for struggling readers, they're a bridge.

Janssen's daughter couldn't decode words on the page - but she still loved stories. So they kept the audiobooks going. She listened to the Penderwicks series 15 or 20 times through. Her comprehension and vocabulary kept growing even while the mechanics lagged behind.

"When she did start getting the reading help she needed, she could put those parts together pretty quickly," Janssen said. "Because she understood the fundamentals of how stories and words and vocabulary all work."

Don't let decoding struggles kill the love of stories. A kid who can follow complex narratives by ear is building reading muscles - just not the ones you can see yet. When the mechanics click, everything else is already there waiting.

Janssen recommends [Yoto players](https://us.yotoplay.com/) and Echo Dots with Audible for screen-free listening. The goal: keep them in the world of books while they work on the hard stuff.

That's all for today!
