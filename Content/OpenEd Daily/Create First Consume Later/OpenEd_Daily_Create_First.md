# Create First, Consume Later
*Preview: Isaac Morehouse’s “make something before you watch something” rule, Brian Ray’s latest research, and 10 YouTube channels that justify screen time.*

Greetings!

Isaac Morehouse, our CEO, has a weird YouTube rule that actually works. We paired it with Brian Ray’s brand-new homeschooling research and a curated list of channels from the r/homeschool community so you can keep devices in “create” mode instead of “scroll” mode.

## Thought: Isaac’s “Create Before You Consume” Rule
One of my younger kids wanted to make YouTube videos—and wanted to watch them all day. So we made a rule: until you’ve created an episode, you can’t consume one. It doesn’t have to be good. You don’t even have to like it. Just create something, then go study what other people built, and come back to create again. I’m big on this because devices have power when they let us be curious and creative. They turn on us when they suck us into being only consumers or critics.

I’ve watched the pattern with Minecraft and Roblox. Kids start by playing, then they watch other people play for inspiration, then they just watch, and pretty soon the motivation is gone. If you consume too much, you start to feel like whatever you make won’t be good enough because you’re comparing it against MrBeast. “Create first, consume later” keeps the spark alive.

## Trend: What Counts as “Homeschool” Anymore?
Brian Ray’s new paper—[*Defining Homeschooling and Why It Matters*](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5211580)—makes a strong case for clarity. He argues that true homeschooling is parent-controlled, home-based, and privately funded. We appreciate the scholarship. Lawmakers and researchers need crisp language to defend parental rights. But once you try to pin the term down, you run into the weird technicalities families confront every day.

What about roadschoolers who learn on the road? Families who share studio space and employ a certified teacher two days a week? Households using ESA dollars to cover a coding tutor? OpenEd families routinely blend parent-designed schedules with public-school partnerships so their kids can access specialized teachers, labs, or therapy. The learning often happens everywhere but “home.”

If we cling too tightly to the old label, we risk ignoring the innovation happening in real families. Our take: let Ray’s definition defend the legal perimeter while we grow a bigger tent. Call it open education if you must. What matters is who holds the steering wheel—not whether the learning takes place at a dining-room table or a community lab.

## Tool: 10 YouTube Channels Worth the Bandwidth
Inspired by a recent [r/homeschool thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1k1mmlq/im_looking_for_good_youtube_channels_for_kids_510/), here’s a curated list for kids who are ready to watch *after* they’ve made something of their own:

1. [Miacademy](https://www.youtube.com/@MiacademyLearningChannel) – multi-subject lessons produced for homeschoolers.
2. [Peekaboo Kidz (Dr. Binocs)](https://www.youtube.com/@PeekabooKidz) – animated science explainers for ages 5–10.
3. [Twinkl Teaching](https://www.youtube.com/@TwinklTeachers) – quick videos that pair with printable activities.
4. [Homeschool Pop](https://www.youtube.com/@HomeschoolPop) – geography, history, and social studies from fellow homeschoolers.
5. [Mark Rober](https://www.youtube.com/@MarkRober) – engineering, glitter bombs, and problem-solving inspiration for tweens and teens.
6. [CrashCourse Kids & CrashCourse](https://www.youtube.com/@crashcourse) – structured series on everything from astronomy to entrepreneurship.
7. [TED-Ed](https://www.youtube.com/@TEDEd) – beautifully animated lessons that prompt discussion.
8. [Code.org](https://www.youtube.com/@codeorg) & [Scratch Team](https://www.youtube.com/@scratchteam) – coding tutorials that move from blocks to text.
9. [Art for Kids Hub](https://www.youtube.com/@ArtforKidsHub) – step-by-step drawing and painting for the whole family.
10. [Two Cents (PBS)](https://www.youtube.com/@TwoCentsPBS) & [The Financial Diet](https://www.youtube.com/@TheFinancialDiet) – finance and entrepreneurship talk for teens.

Deploy these channels like a menu: have your child create something first, then choose one episode to study, analyze, and remix. Creation stays the default; consumption turns into research.

That’s all for today!
