## Article 1: High Schooler Graduates Illiterate
**Source:** The Free Press (via Substack inbox)
**URL:** https://www.thefp.com/p/high-schooler-graduates-illiterate-sues-tennessee-school

**Key Points:**
- "William A." graduated with 3.4 GPA but couldn't read his diploma or spell his name
- Suing Clarksville-Montgomery County Schools in Tennessee
- Claims teachers denied him "free appropriate education" under federal law
- Context: Covid generation nearly 8 IQ points less intelligent due to lockdowns
- Reading/math scores at lowest in decades
- Teachers report mass illiteracy on TikTok
- Trump admin terminated $900M in Dept of Education contracts
- Betsy DeVos argues Dept of Education "shuffles money around" but doesn't educate kids
- Key quote from Frannie Block: "education, by and large, is a local problem that requires local solutions"

**Angle Notes:**
- This is a THOUGHT piece: How did we graduate a kid who can't read?
- Contrarian angle: The system worked exactly as designed (passing kids for efficiency)
- Connect to bureaucratic bloat vs. actual learning
- This is about institutional failure, not teacher failure

## Article 2: Equitable Grading Reform
**Source:** Education Next
**URL:** https://www.educationnext.org/time-to-pull-plug-on-traditional-grading-supporters-say-mastery-based-grading-could-promote-equity/

**Key Points:**
- Joe Feldman's "Grading for Equity" gaining momentum post-Covid
- Eliminates 100-point scale, no penalties for late work/missed assignments
- Focus on "mastery" not behaviors (homework, attendance, punctuality)
- Clark County, NV student: "nothing has been standard about it at all... things have gotten worse"
- Critics: not enough empirical data, increases teacher workload, lowers expectations
- Wakefield HS teachers argued it hurts students who lack support at home
- Charleston teacher Jody Stallings: "race to the bottom"
- Feldman's consultant group (Crescendo) paid $114K to train Santa Clara district
- Proponents claim it reduces Ds/Fs and narrows achievement gaps
- Critics say it's about making it easier to pass, not promoting mastery

**Key Quotes:**
- Thomas R. Guskey: current grading is a "hodgepodge" of measures
- Letter-based grading universal by 1940s
- Feldman: "Inherited grading practices have always hurt underserved students"
- Arlington teachers: grading for equity could hurt students without support at home
- Jody Stallings: "Lots of people have pushed for changes in grading policy. Feldman's shtick is to inject a lucrative dose of race and class into the mix"

**Angle Notes:**
- This is a TREND piece: Policy gaining traction despite mixed results
- Contrarian angle: "Equitable" grading might be enabling the next William A.
- Connect to the illiteracy story: When we stop measuring real learning, we graduate illiterate kids
- The tension: Is this compassionate or enabling failure?

## Thematic Connection:
Both stories are about systems that prioritize appearance over reality. One graduates illiterate students. The other eliminates accountability measures in the name of equity. Both claim to help underserved students but may be failing them in new ways.

**OpenEd Core Belief Alignment:**
- Question standardized systems that prioritize efficiency/optics over learning
- Trust that real learning requires real accountability
- Individual progress > institutional metrics
- Local solutions > bureaucratic mandates

## Tool Segment Options:
Since neither article provides an obvious tool, we need to source one that connects thematically:

**Option 1:** Practical literacy resources for parents who want to ensure their kids can actually read
**Option 2:** Framework for assessing real mastery vs. grade inflation
**Option 3:** Alternative assessment methods (portfolios, competency demonstrations)
**Option 4:** Resources for parents considering homeschool due to institutional failure
