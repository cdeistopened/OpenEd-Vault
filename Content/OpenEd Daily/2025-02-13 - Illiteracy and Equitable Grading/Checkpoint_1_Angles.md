## SEGMENT 1: THE DIPLOMA HE COULDN'T READ (THOUGHT)

**Source:** The Free Press - Frannie Block report on William A. lawsuit
**URL:** https://www.thefp.com/p/high-schooler-graduates-illiterate-sues-tennessee-school

### Angle Options:

**Option 1 - The System Working as Designed**
Lead with the uncomfortable truth: This isn't a bug, it's a feature. The system is designed to pass kids, not educate them.

- Hook: William A. graduated with a 3.4 GPA. He couldn't read the words on his diploma.
- Substance: How do you pass 12 years of school without learning to read? Easy—when the system measures compliance, not learning
- Insight: This is what happens when institutions prioritize throughput over outcomes
- Why it works: Reveals the fundamental misalignment between what schools measure and what matters
- Best for: Parents who suspect school isn't actually teaching

**Option 2 - The Local Solution Frame**
Use Frannie Block's key insight: education is a local problem requiring local solutions. This case proves federal money doesn't fix local failure.

- Hook: $900 billion in federal education spending. One graduate who can't read his diploma.
- Substance: Betsy DeVos is right—Dept of Education "shuffles money" but doesn't educate kids
- Insight: The solution isn't more federal oversight; it's local accountability
- Why it works: Connects individual failure to systemic bloat
- Best for: Readers skeptical of bureaucratic solutions

**Option 3 - The Covid Excuse Collapse**
Everyone's blaming Covid for falling scores. But William A.'s story reveals something deeper—this was broken before the pandemic.

- Hook: We're blaming lockdowns for kids getting dumber. But William A. graduated before Covid hit its peak.
- Substance: Yes, Covid generation is 8 IQ points lower. But this kid passed 12 years of school without reading
- Insight: Covid didn't break education; it exposed what was already broken
- Why it works: Challenges the easy narrative
- Best for: Readers tired of Covid excuses

**Option 4 - The Teacher Trap**
This isn't about bad teachers. It's about teachers forced to pass kids regardless of mastery. Individual teachers are trapped in a system that punishes honesty.

- Hook: The teachers knew. They had to pass him anyway.
- Substance: Federal requirements + social promotion policies = graduating illiterate students
- Insight: When you punish teachers for failing students, you guarantee some students will be failed by passing
- Why it works: Reframes from teacher failure to systemic failure
- Best for: Readers sympathetic to teachers

### Recommended:

**Option 1 (System Working as Designed)** — This is the most OpenEd-aligned. It's the hardest truth: the system isn't failing, it's succeeding at the wrong goals. Most likely to be forwarded because it names what everyone suspects but won't say.

## SEGMENT 2: WHEN EQUITY MEANS NOBODY LEARNS (TREND)

**Source:** Education Next - Equitable Grading article
**URL:** https://www.educationnext.org/time-to-pull-plug-on-traditional-grading-supporters-say-mastery-based-grading-could-promote-equity/

### Angle Options:

**Option 1 - The Next William A.**
Connect directly to Segment 1: Equitable grading removes the very mechanisms that would catch another William A. before graduation.

- Hook: While Tennessee deals with its illiterate graduate, hundreds of districts are eliminating the assessments that would catch the next one
- Substance: No penalties for late work, unlimited retakes, grades only reflect "mastery" (but who's checking?)
- Insight: When you remove accountability in the name of equity, you enable the very failures you claim to prevent
- Why it works: Direct connection between stories; shows consequence of well-intentioned reform
- Best for: Readers who see the irony

**Option 2 - The Consultant Grift**
Follow the money: Joe Feldman's company makes $114K per district while student outcomes get worse.

- Hook: A consultant charges six figures to tell schools: stop grading homework, stop penalizing late work, stop measuring behaviors
- Substance: Clark County student: "things have gotten worse." But Feldman's Crescendo Group keeps cashing checks
- Insight: Education reform has become a lucrative industry that profits regardless of results
- Why it works: Reveals financial incentives behind "equity" push
- Best for: Readers skeptical of consultant culture

**Option 3 - The Teacher Rebellion**
Lead with the voices pushing back: Arlington teachers, Charleston teacher Jody Stallings calling it a "race to the bottom"

- Hook: Teachers are revolting—against the grading reforms designed to help their students
- Substance: "Students who lack support at home" will be hurt most by flexible deadlines
- Insight: The people closest to students see what theorists miss: some structures help
- Why it works: Teacher voices carry credibility; challenges progressive assumptions
- Best for: Readers who trust practitioner wisdom over theory

**Option 4 - The Hodgepodge Problem**
Maybe traditional grading IS broken (Thomas Guskey's "hodgepodge"). But replacing it with "don't grade anything that matters" isn't the answer.

- Hook: Traditional grading is incoherent. Equitable grading is worse.
- Substance: 100-point scale is arbitrary, but eliminating consequences for behavior doesn't measure mastery—it just stops measuring
- Insight: The correct response to bad measurement isn't no measurement
- Why it works: Steelman both sides, then reject the false choice
- Best for: Intellectually honest readers

### Recommended:

**Option 1 (The Next William A.)** — This creates the tightest connection between segments. William A.'s story becomes the cautionary tale for what happens when systems prioritize equity optics over real learning. Most compelling because it's predictive, not just descriptive.

## SEGMENT 3: HOW TO ACTUALLY MEASURE LEARNING (TOOL)

**Note:** Neither source article provides an obvious tool, so we need to provide practical resources that connect thematically.

### Angle Options:

**Option 1 - The Three Questions Test**
Give parents a simple framework to assess whether their kid is actually learning or just getting grades.

- Hook: Three questions every parent should ask about their kid's education
- Substance:
  1. Can my child demonstrate knowledge without the worksheet?
  2. Can they explain it to someone else?
  3. Will they remember this in six months?
- Insight: Real mastery is demonstrable, transferable, and durable
- Why it works: Immediately actionable, simple, memorable
- Best for: Parents suspicious their kid's grades don't reflect reality

**Option 2 - Reading Assessment Resources**
Since the core story is about illiteracy, give parents tools to ensure their kid can actually read.

- Hook: How to know if your child is actually reading—or just faking it
- Substance: Free assessments, red flags, resources (phonics programs, reading milestones)
- Insight: You don't need a school to diagnose reading problems; you need to know what to look for
- Why it works: Directly responsive to the William A. story
- Best for: Parents worried about literacy

**Option 3 - Portfolio Assessment**
Reject both traditional grading AND no-accountability grading. Use what actually works: demonstrated competency.

- Hook: Neither 100-point scales nor "equitable grading" measure real learning. Here's what does.
- Substance: Portfolio examples, competency demonstrations, real-world applications
- Insight: Mastery isn't about points or equity; it's about "can you do the thing?"
- Why it works: Offers third option beyond the false choice
- Best for: Homeschoolers or parents considering alternatives

**Option 4 - When to Pull Your Kid**
Give parents concrete signs that it's time to remove their child from a failing system.

- Hook: Five signs your child's school has prioritized passing over learning
- Substance: Red flags (social promotion, grade inflation, resistance to honest feedback)
- Insight: You're not being overprotective; you're being appropriately protective
- Why it works: Permission + practical decision framework
- Best for: Parents on the fence about alternatives

### Recommended:

**Option 2 (Reading Assessment Resources)** — This connects most directly to the William A. story and addresses the most fundamental concern: Can my child actually read? Literacy is the foundation of all other learning. Give parents the tools to verify it themselves rather than trust inflated grades.

**Alternative consideration:** Option 3 (Portfolio Assessment) if we want to offer a structural solution rather than diagnostic tools. This positions OpenEd readers as solution-oriented parents who want better systems, not just to check compliance with broken ones.

## ORTHOGONALITY CHECK

- [X] Thought and Trend are distinct
  - Thought: Individual case study (William A.) reveals systemic failure
  - Trend: Policy shift (equitable grading) that could create more William A.s
  - Connection: Both show systems prioritizing appearance (graduation rates, "equity") over reality (actual learning)

- [X] Aligns with OpenEd beliefs
  - Question standardized systems that measure wrong things
  - Trust that real learning requires honest assessment
  - Local accountability > federal bureaucracy
  - Individual progress must be real, not performative

- [X] Would Sarah forward this?
  - Yes—combines investigative reporting (specific case) with policy analysis (broader trend)
  - Contrarian but grounded (not ideological)
  - Practical tool (reading assessment or mastery framework)
  - Empowering without cynicism

## SEGMENT STRUCTURE NOTES

**THOUGHT (100-120 words):** Lead with William A.'s 3.4 GPA and illiteracy. Reveal: the system worked exactly as designed—to pass students, not educate them. Insight: when institutions measure throughput instead of learning, this is the inevitable result.

**TREND (100-120 words):** While Tennessee deals with consequences, hundreds of districts are adopting "equitable grading" that removes the very mechanisms (homework completion, test scores, accountability) that would catch the next William A. Quote Clark County student and teachers pushing back. Insight: equity that enables failure isn't equity.

**TOOL (100-120 words):** Practical reading assessment resources OR mastery verification framework. Lead with benefit: "Here's how to know your kid is actually learning." Provide specific, actionable resources with links.
