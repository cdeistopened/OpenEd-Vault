**SUBJECT:** Reading is connected to everything

**PREVIEW:** When 66% of kids can't read at grade level, it's not just an academic problem. Here's why—and the solution gaining ground.

Good morning.

[We've reported before](link-to-william-a-story) about the Tennessee student who graduated with a 3.4 GPA but couldn't read his diploma. Today we're looking at why that matters more than you might think—and at schools that are proving there's a better way.

Let's dive in.

## READING IS CONNECTED TO EVERYTHING

Andrea Fife, our Chief Academic Officer, puts it simply: **"Reading is at the center of everything. If you can read, you can learn anything."**

That's not hyperbole. Reading isn't just an academic skill. It's the foundation of civilization.

When children struggle to read, it ripples everywhere. Social interactions suffer—they can't keep up with texts from friends, can't participate in group chats. Future career options narrow—most jobs require reading. Self-esteem takes a hit—they know they're behind. Even family relationships strain—one parent told us, "The improvement we've made on reading has improved my relationship with my daughter so much."

Right now, **66% of American children are behind on reading levels.** That's not a reading crisis. That's a civilization crisis.

Because when children can't access the written word, they can't access opportunity. They can't pursue careers that interest them. They can't engage as informed citizens. They can't fully participate in the world around them.

The good news? This is fixable. But it requires actually measuring whether kids are learning to read—not just whether they're advancing through grades.

## THE SCHOOLS DITCHING GRADES FOR MASTERY

While some districts eliminate accountability in the name of equity, others are doing something different: replacing grades with actual learning.

It's called competency-based education. The concept is simple: "mastered" or "not yet."

At Southern New Hampshire University's competency-based program, students demonstrate mastery through real-world projects instead of tests. In 2023, **70% of participating high school seniors graduated with college degrees before they even finished high school.**

Not because they were exceptionally gifted. Because they were allowed to learn at their own pace and demonstrate mastery in their own way.

Finland and New Zealand have adopted this nationally. The results? Students who actually understand what they're learning instead of cramming for tests and forgetting everything after.

The model is surprisingly straightforward:

**Students progress at their own pace** — spend more time when needed, accelerate when ready

**Expectations are clear from the start** — no mystery about what "mastery" means

**Multiple attempts are encouraged** — "not yet" converts to mastery through practice

**Real-world application matters** — demonstrate you can actually use what you've learned

This is the opposite of social promotion. In traditional schools, students advance with Cs and Ds, moving forward without mastering the material. In competency-based education, you either demonstrate mastery or keep working. No settling for "close enough."

One OpenEd student completed her associate degree in 14 months—not because she rushed, but because she could focus on truly mastering each concept before moving forward.

Here's what makes this work: when you remove arbitrary deadlines and let students prove they've actually learned something, most of them do. They're not trapped by the pace of the slowest learner or rushed past concepts they haven't grasped yet.

The system that graduated an illiterate student with a 3.4 GPA optimized for throughput. This optimizes for learning.

## WHEN TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES

If you're wondering whether your child's school has prioritized passing over learning, here are five signs:

**1. Social promotion is official policy** — Kids advance regardless of mastery

**2. Grade inflation is rampant** — Everyone's on honor roll, but can they demonstrate skills?

**3. Teachers resist honest feedback** — "We don't want to discourage them" becomes code for "we can't fail them"

**4. Tests dismissed as "just a number"** — While tests aren't everything, dismissing all objective measures is convenient when you're not teaching

**5. Good grades, no demonstrated mastery** — Your kid brings home As but can't explain what they learned

If you're seeing these signs, you're not being overprotective. You're responding to institutional failure with appropriate action.

The solution isn't more federal oversight. It's parents making informed local decisions about what's actually working for their kids.

That's all for today!

P.S. Andrea's point about reading hit me hard this week. My kids are all strong readers, but I realized I've been taking it for granted. If your child is struggling with reading, you're not alone—and there are programs that actually work. High-dosage tutoring, competency-based approaches, even just consistent daily practice with books they actually enjoy. The key is measuring real progress, not just checking boxes.
