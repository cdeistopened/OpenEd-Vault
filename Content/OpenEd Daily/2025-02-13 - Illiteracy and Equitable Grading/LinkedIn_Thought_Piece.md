## DRAFT

William A. graduated from a Tennessee high school last year with a 3.4 GPA.

He couldn't read the words on his diploma.

He couldn't spell his own name.

He's now suing Clarksville-Montgomery County Schools, claiming they denied him the "free appropriate education" guaranteed under federal law.

Here's what everyone's asking: How does a student pass twelve years of school without learning to read?

The uncomfortable answer: The system worked exactly as designed.

Schools aren't designed to ensure learning. They're designed to ensure throughput—to maintain enrollment numbers, graduation rates, and the appearance of success.

Learning is secondary.

**William A. isn't an anomaly. He's a feature of the system.**

And here's what makes this story even more concerning:

While Tennessee deals with the consequences of graduating an illiterate student, hundreds of school districts across the country are paying consultants to implement policies that could create more students like William A.

It's called "equitable grading."

Joe Feldman's company, Crescendo Education Group, charges six figures to train districts on a simple premise: eliminate penalties for late work, allow unlimited retakes, and don't grade homework, attendance, or participation. Grade only "mastery."

Sounds compassionate. But here's the question: Who's checking if students are actually mastering anything?

Santa Clara Unified paid Feldman's company $114,300 for one year of training.

Clark County, Nevada adopted the program district-wide.

A junior at Ed W. Clark High School said: **"Nothing has been standard about it at all. In a lot of ways, things have gotten worse."**

Teachers at Wakefield High School in Arlington, Virginia pushed back. They argued that eliminating accountability measures would hurt the very students the policy claims to help—kids without support at home who need structure to succeed.

Charleston teacher Jody Stallings put it more bluntly: **"Feldman's shtick is to inject a lucrative dose of race and class into the mix."**

Education reform has become a lucrative industry. Consultants profit whether outcomes improve or not.

**The pattern here is clear:**

When you optimize for the wrong metrics (graduation rates, "equity" optics), you get William A.—a student who passed every grade but learned nothing.

When you remove accountability in the name of compassion, you don't help struggling students. You enable the system to fail them more quietly.

The solution isn't more federal oversight. It isn't expensive consultants selling six-figure "reforms."

**It's parents making informed local decisions about what's actually working for their kids.**

Five signs your school has prioritized passing over learning:

1. Social promotion is official policy
2. Grade inflation is rampant
3. Teachers resist giving honest feedback
4. Standardized tests are dismissed entirely
5. Good grades, but no demonstrated mastery

If you're seeing these signs, you're not being overprotective.

You're responding to institutional failure with appropriate action.

## Alternative Shorter Version (250 words)

William A. graduated with a 3.4 GPA. He couldn't read his diploma.

How does this happen?

The system worked exactly as designed—just toward the wrong goals.

Schools optimize for throughput (graduation rates, enrollment numbers), not learning. William A. isn't an anomaly. He's a feature.

And now it's getting worse.

While Tennessee deals with this, hundreds of districts are paying consultants six figures to implement "equitable grading"—policies that eliminate late penalties, allow unlimited retakes, and don't grade homework or attendance.

Joe Feldman's Crescendo Education Group charged Santa Clara Unified $114,300 for one year.

A Clark County student said: "Things have gotten worse."

Teachers at Wakefield High pushed back, arguing that removing accountability hurts students who need structure most.

Education reform has become lucrative. Consultants profit whether outcomes improve or not.

Five signs your school prioritizes passing over learning:

1. Social promotion is policy
2. Grade inflation is rampant
3. Teachers resist honest feedback
4. Tests dismissed entirely
5. Good grades, no demonstrated mastery

If you see these signs, you're not overprotective. You're appropriately protective.

The solution isn't federal oversight or expensive consultants.

It's local decisions by informed parents.
