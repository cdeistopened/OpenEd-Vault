**SUBJECT:** Reading connects to everything

**PREVIEW:** 66% of kids can't read at grade level. When reading fails, everything fails. Here's what would force accountability.

Good morning.

Quick question: If you could only keep one superpower—flight or invisibility—which would you pick?

I ask because I recently realized reading is kind of both. It lets you go anywhere (flight) and understand what others can't see (invisibility). Anyway, that's my way of saying: today's about reading, and it matters more than you think.

Let's dive in.

## READING CONNECTS TO EVERYTHING

Andrea Fife, our Chief Academic Officer: **"If you can read, you can learn anything."**

When kids can't access the written word, it shows everywhere. They can't access opportunity. They can't pursue careers that interest them or participate as informed citizens. They can't fully engage with the world.

The reading crisis is better framed as a civilizational crisis.

**66% of American children are behind on reading levels.** The bottom tenth of 13-year-olds are hitting reading scores not seen since testing began in 1971. We've lost 50 years of progress.

## THE CASE FOR MASTERY

We've previously featured the story of William A.—the Tennessee student who graduated with a 3.4 GPA but couldn't read his own diploma. He sued the school that graduated him, which didn't do him any favors by moving him through the system without ever stopping to ask whether he'd learned.

[Education Next](https://www.educationnext.org/time-to-pull-plug-on-traditional-grading-supporters-say-mastery-based-grading-could-promote-equity/) provides additional context in an article about grading reform nationwide. [The Atlantic reports](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/america-sliding-toward-illiteracy-110000447.html) that 33% of eighth graders read "below basic"—highest since 1992. 40% of fourth graders reading "below basic"—highest since 2000.

Teachers are increasingly uncomfortable with a system that assigns numbers to students as a measure of their worth. But while some argue that the push for equitable grading erodes merit-based systems and eliminates standards, the answer might be surprisingly simple: **mastery-based grading.**

If you don't reach a certain level of understanding, you don't advance.

If schools actually implemented this? They couldn't graduate William A. with a 3.4 GPA. They couldn't pass 33% of eighth graders who can't follow the order of events in a passage. They couldn't advance 40% of fourth graders who struggle to summarize a main idea.

The system would have to confront what it's been hiding: it's failing these kids instead of pretending diplomas mean something.

Finland and New Zealand adopted mastery-based nationally. Southern New Hampshire University: 70% of high school seniors graduated with college degrees because they actually proved mastery.

Your child's uniqueness isn't a problem. It's the point. Some kids need more time for math. Some fly through reading. Mastery-based lets each child progress at their actual pace—not the pace that lets the system pretend everything's fine.

## SAVVY LEARNING: HIGH-DOSAGE TUTORING THAT WORKS

High-dosage tutoring has been proven 20 times more effective than traditional tutoring at closing these gaps.

Enter [Savvy Learning](https://savvylearning.com/): 25-minute sessions, four days per week, delivered online by qualified coaches. Small groups of 2-4 students work together in real time, building skills through the Science of Reading and Orton-Gillingham methods.

Why it works: Short sessions match children's attention spans. Frequent practice builds momentum. Kids stay engaged throughout—and actually look forward to logging on. As Tony Mickelsen from Savvy puts it: "What child is going to have fun learning to read for 60 minutes?"

The magic is in the frequency. Four 25-minute sessions beat one 60-minute session every time. It's the same principle as athletic training: sprint, rest, repeat.

For OpenEd families: Savvy is an approved vendor in our marketplace. You can use your education funds with zero out-of-pocket costs.

Yes, scaling high-dosage tutoring across entire districts remains challenging. But you don't need to wait for systemic change. Your kid can start today with [Savvy's free reading assessment](https://savvylearning.com/).

That's all for today!

P.S. The Atlantic piece includes a stat that stopped me cold: Only 12.9% of the U.S. population reads at the level needed to understand novels in the literary canon. Even English majors are graduating without being able to read Dickens. The crisis goes deeper than we think.
