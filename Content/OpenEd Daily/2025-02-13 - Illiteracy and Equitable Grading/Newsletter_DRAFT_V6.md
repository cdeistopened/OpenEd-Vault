**SUBJECT:** Reading connects to everything

**PREVIEW:** 66% of kids can't read at grade level. When reading fails, everything fails. Here's what would expose the truth.

Good morning.

[We've covered before](link) the Tennessee student who graduated with a 3.4 GPA but couldn't read his diploma. Today: why that matters more than you think, and what would happen if schools had to confront the truth.

Let's dive in.

## READING CONNECTS TO EVERYTHING

Andrea Fife, our Chief Academic Officer: **"If you can read, you can learn anything."**

That's not motivational speaking. That's civilizational fact.

When children can't read, it shows everywhere. They can't keep up in group chats with friends. Most careers close off. Self-esteem collapses. Family relationships strain.

One parent told Andrea: "The improvement we've made on reading has improved my relationship with my daughter so much."

**66% of American children are behind on reading levels.** The bottom tenth of 13-year-olds are hitting reading scores not seen since testing began in 1971. We've lost 50 years of progress.

This isn't a reading crisis. This is a civilization crisis. When children can't access the written word, they can't access opportunity. Can't pursue careers that interest them. Can't participate as informed citizens. Can't fully engage with the world.

The good news? This is fixable. But it requires measuring whether kids learn to read, not whether they advance through grades.

## WHAT MASTERY-BASED GRADING WOULD EXPOSE

[The Atlantic just reported](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/america-sliding-toward-illiteracy-110000447.html): 33% of eighth graders reading "below basic"—highest since 1992. 40% of fourth graders reading "below basic"—highest since 2000.

Here's what would happen if schools adopted real mastery-based grading:

The system would have to confront what it's been hiding.

Right now, schools advance students with Cs and Ds. Social promotion. Grade inflation. Pass them through regardless of whether they learned.

Mastery-based grading says: "mastered" or "not yet." Prove you learned it or keep working.

If schools actually implemented this? **They couldn't graduate William A. with a 3.4 GPA.** They couldn't pass 33% of eighth graders who can't follow the order of events in a passage. They couldn't advance 40% of fourth graders who struggle to summarize a main idea.

The system would have to admit it's failing these kids instead of pretending diplomas mean something.

Finland and New Zealand adopted this nationally. Southern New Hampshire University: 70% of high school seniors graduated with college degrees because they actually proved mastery.

The difference? Those systems measure learning. Ours measures throughput.

Your child's uniqueness isn't a problem. It's the point. Some kids need more time for math. Some fly through reading. Mastery-based lets each child progress at their actual pace—not the pace that lets the system pretend everything's fine.

## SAVVY LEARNING

After we featured Andrea Fife on the podcast talking about reading, we heard from parents looking for actual solutions.

[Savvy Learning](https://savvylearningco.com/) kept coming up.

Here's what caught our attention:

**High-dosage tutoring that works.** Research-backed approach that actually moves the needle on reading.

**Designed for struggling readers.** Not generic tutoring. Specific strategies for kids who are behind.

**Evidence-based results.** Parents report measurable improvement in weeks, not years.

The podcast episode with Andrea goes deep on why reading connects to everything—from social confidence to future career options. [Listen here](link).

**What's working for your struggling reader?** Reply and let us know. We're collecting what actually helps so other families don't have to figure it out alone.

That's all for today!

P.S. The Atlantic piece includes a stat that stopped me cold: Only 12.9% of the U.S. population reads at the level needed to understand novels in the literary canon. Even English majors are graduating without being able to read Dickens. The crisis goes deeper than we think.
