**SUBJECT:** He graduated with a 3.4 GPA. He couldn't spell his name.

**PREVIEW:** A Tennessee student graduated illiterate. Now schools are eliminating the tests that would catch it. Here's what's happening.

Good morning.

Today we're looking at two stories that seem unrelated but are actually the same problem. One graduated an illiterate student. The other charges six figures to help more schools do the same thing. Both claim they're helping underserved kids.

The system isn't broken. It's working exactly as designed—just toward the wrong goals.

Let's dive in.

## THE DIPLOMA HE COULDN'T READ

[William A. graduated](https://www.thefp.com/p/high-schooler-graduates-illiterate-sues-tennessee-school) from Clarksville-Montgomery County Schools in Tennessee last year with a 3.4 GPA. He couldn't read the words on his diploma. He couldn't spell his own name.

He's now suing the district, claiming teachers denied him the "free appropriate education" guaranteed under federal law.

Here's the question everyone's asking: How do you pass twelve years of school without learning to read?

The uncomfortable answer: Easy. When the system measures compliance instead of learning.

This isn't a bug. It's a feature. Schools are designed to pass students through—to maintain enrollment numbers, graduation rates, and the appearance of success. Learning is secondary to throughput.

**The system worked exactly as designed.** It just wasn't designed to educate William A. It was designed to graduate him.

And he's not alone. The Covid generation is [nearly eight IQ points](https://archive.ph/FltRZ) less intelligent than their slightly older peers. Reading and math scores are at their [lowest in decades](https://www.npr.org/2023/06/21/1183445544/u-s-reading-and-math-scores-drop-to-lowest-level-in-decades). Teachers on TikTok are [reporting mass illiteracy](https://www.buzzfeed.com/aglover/tiktok-says-kids-cant-read-teachers-weigh-in).

When institutions optimize for the wrong metrics, this is the inevitable result.

## THE SIX-FIGURE SOLUTION

Everyone's blaming Covid for falling literacy rates. But William A. graduated before the pandemic peaked. This was broken long before lockdowns.

And now? While Tennessee deals with the consequences of graduating an illiterate student, hundreds of school districts are paying consultants to implement policies that could create the next William A.

Enter Joe Feldman and his company, Crescendo Education Group.

Feldman's pitch: "[Equitable grading](https://www.educationnext.org/time-to-pull-plug-on-traditional-grading-supporters-say-mastery-based-grading-could-promote-equity/)" will close achievement gaps. How? Eliminate penalties for late work. Allow unlimited retakes. Don't grade homework, attendance, or participation. Grade only "mastery."

Sounds compassionate. There's one problem: Who's checking if they're actually mastering anything?

Crescendo charged Santa Clara Unified School District **$114,300** for one year of training. Clark County, Nevada—a district of 360,000 students—adopted the program in 2021.

Samuel Hwang, a junior at Ed W. Clark High School, [told Education Next](https://www.educationnext.org/time-to-pull-plug-on-traditional-grading-supporters-say-mastery-based-grading-could-promote-equity/): **"Nothing has been standard about it at all. Much has been left open to interpretation. In a lot of ways, things have gotten worse."**

Teachers at Wakefield High School in Arlington, Virginia, pushed back hard. In a letter to their superintendent, they argued that eliminating deadlines and accountability would hurt the very students the policy claims to help—kids without support at home who need structure to succeed.

Charleston teacher Jody Stallings was more direct: **"Feldman's shtick is to inject a lucrative dose of race and class into the mix."**

Education reform has become a lucrative industry. Consultants profit whether outcomes improve or not. When you get paid regardless of results, whose interests are you really serving?

## WHEN TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES

If you're wondering whether your child's school has prioritized passing over learning, here are five signs to watch for:

**1. Social promotion is official policy** — Kids advance to the next grade regardless of mastery

**2. Grade inflation is rampant** — Everyone's on honor roll, but can they demonstrate what they've learned?

**3. Teachers resist giving honest feedback** — "We don't want to discourage them" becomes code for "we can't fail them"

**4. Standardized tests are dismissed as "just a number"** — While tests aren't everything, dismissing all objective measures is convenient when you're not teaching

**5. Good grades, no demonstrated mastery** — Your kid brings home As but can't explain what they learned or apply it independently

If you're seeing these signs, you're not being overprotective. You're responding to institutional failure with appropriate action.

The solution to failing systems isn't more federal oversight or expensive consultants. It's parents making informed local decisions about what's actually working for their kids.

That's all for today!

P.S. Betsy DeVos [wrote in The Free Press](https://www.thefp.com/p/betsy-devos-shut-down-the-department-of-education-trump-elon) last week that the Department of Education "shuffles money around; adds unnecessary requirements and political agendas via its grants; and then passes the buck when it comes time to assess if any of that adds value." William A.'s story is Exhibit A. Local problems require local solutions—not $900 million in federal contracts.
