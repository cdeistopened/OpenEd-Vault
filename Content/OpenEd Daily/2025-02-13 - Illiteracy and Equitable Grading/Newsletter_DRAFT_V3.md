**SUBJECT:** Reading connects to everything

**PREVIEW:** 66% of kids can't read at grade level. When reading fails, everything fails. Here's what's working.

Good morning.

[We've covered before](link) the Tennessee student who graduated with a 3.4 GPA but couldn't read his diploma. Today: why that matters more than you think, and schools proving there's a better way.

Let's dive in.

## READING CONNECTS TO EVERYTHING

Andrea Fife, our Chief Academic Officer: **"If you can read, you can learn anything."**

That's not motivational speaking. That's civilizational fact.

When children can't read, it shows everywhere. They can't keep up in group chats with friends. Most careers close off. Self-esteem collapses. Family relationships strain.

One parent: "The improvement we've made on reading has improved my relationship with my daughter so much."

**66% of American children are behind on reading levels.**

This isn't a reading crisis. This is a civilization crisis. When children can't access the written word, they can't access opportunity. Can't pursue careers that interest them. Can't participate as informed citizens. Can't fully engage with the world.

The good news? This is fixable. But it requires measuring whether kids learn to read, not whether they advance through grades.

## MASTERED OR NOT YET

Some districts eliminate accountability and call it equity. Others are doing something different: ditching grades for learning.

Competency-based education. Simple concept: "mastered" or "not yet."

Southern New Hampshire University's competency-based program: students demonstrate mastery through projects, not tests. In 2023, **70% of high school seniors graduated with college degrees before finishing high school.**

Not because they were gifted. Because they learned at their own pace and proved mastery in their own way.

Finland and New Zealand adopted this nationally. Students understand what they're learning instead of cramming for tests and forgetting after.

The model:

**Progress at your own pace.** Spend more time when needed. Accelerate when ready.

**Clear expectations.** No mystery about what mastery means.

**Multiple attempts encouraged.** "Not yet" converts to mastery through practice.

**Real-world application.** Prove you can use what you learned.

This is the opposite of social promotion. Traditional schools advance students with Cs and Ds without mastering material. Competency-based education: demonstrate mastery or keep working. No "close enough."

One OpenEd student completed her associate degree in 14 months. Not by rushing. By mastering each concept before moving forward.

Remove arbitrary deadlines. Let students prove they learned something. Most of them do.

The system that graduated an illiterate student with a 3.4 GPA optimized for throughput. This optimizes for learning.

## FIVE SIGNS IT'S TIME

Your child's school has prioritized passing over learning if:

**1. Social promotion is policy** — kids advance regardless of mastery

**2. Grade inflation is everywhere** — everyone's on honor roll but can't demonstrate skills

**3. Teachers avoid honest feedback** — "we don't want to discourage them" means "we can't fail them"

**4. Tests dismissed as meaningless** — while tests aren't everything, dismissing all objective measures is convenient when you're not teaching

**5. Good grades, no mastery** — your kid brings home As but can't explain what they learned

You're not being overprotective. You're responding to institutional failure.

The solution isn't federal oversight. It's parents making informed local decisions about what works for their kids.

That's all for today!

P.S. Andrea's point hit me hard. My kids are strong readers. I've been taking it for granted. If your child struggles with reading, you're not alone. High-dosage tutoring works. Competency-based approaches work. Even consistent daily practice with books they enjoy works. The key: measure real progress, not checked boxes.
