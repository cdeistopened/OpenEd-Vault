**SUBJECT:** Reading connects to everything

**PREVIEW:** 66% of kids can't read at grade level. When reading fails, everything fails. Here's what's working.

Good morning.

[We've covered before](link) the Tennessee student who graduated with a 3.4 GPA but couldn't read his diploma. Today: why that matters more than you think, and what's working instead.

Let's dive in.

## READING CONNECTS TO EVERYTHING

Andrea Fife, our Chief Academic Officer: **"If you can read, you can learn anything."**

When children can't read, it shows everywhere. Most careers are closed off. Self-esteem collapses. Family relationships strain.

One parent: "The improvement we've made on reading has improved my relationship with my daughter so much."

**66% of American children are behind on reading levels.**

This isn't a reading crisis. This is a civilization crisis. When children can't access the written word, they can't access opportunity. Can't pursue careers that interest them. Can't participate as informed citizens. Can't fully engage with the world.

The good news? This is fixable. But it requires measuring whether kids learn to read, not whether they advance through grades.

## MASTERED OR NOT YET

[Education Next just published](https://www.educationnext.org/time-to-pull-plug-on-traditional-grading-supporters-say-mastery-based-grading-could-promote-equity/) a deep dive on grading reform. Buried in the article: schools replacing letter grades with something better.

Competency-based education. Simple: "mastered" or "not yet."

Southern New Hampshire University: students prove mastery through projects, not tests. In 2023, **70% of high school seniors graduated with college degrees before finishing high school.**

Not gifted kids. Kids who learned at their own pace and proved they learned it.

Finland and New Zealand adopted this nationally. Students understand what they're learning instead of cramming and forgetting.

This is the opposite of social promotion. Traditional schools advance students with Cs and Ds who didn't learn. Competency-based: demonstrate mastery or keep working.

One OpenEd student completed her associate degree in 14 months. Not rushing. Mastering each concept before moving forward.

**Your child's uniqueness isn't a problem. It's the point.** Some kids need more time for math. Some fly through reading. Competency-based education lets each child progress at their actual pace—not the pace of 30 other kids born the same year.

The system that graduated William A. optimized for throughput. This optimizes for learning.

## SUPERCHARGED SCIENCE

We recently published a deep dive on [best science curricula]. One mom wrote back disappointed we didn't include [Supercharged Science](https://superchargedscience.com/).

Here's what caught our attention:

**Taught by an actual rocket scientist.** Aurora Lipper—mechanical engineer, university instructor, pilot, astronomer, mom of four. Has taught over 10,000 kids since 1999.

**Self-guided for busy parents.** Kids can do it on their own. You don't need a science background.

**Actually hands-on.** Not reading about science. Doing science like scientists do in labs.

Aurora's promise: your kids will learn more science in 2 months than a typical year of traditional science education.

The curriculum includes step-by-step videos, student guidebooks, and materials you can find at home. [Try their free sample](https://superchargedscience.com/free-lessons) to see if it fits.

**What science curriculum works for your family?** Reply and let us know—we're building a running list of what's working for OpenEd families.

That's all for today!

P.S. Andrea's point hit me hard. My kids are strong readers. I've been taking it for granted. If your child struggles with reading, you're not alone. High-dosage tutoring works. Competency-based approaches work. Even consistent daily practice with books they enjoy works. The key: measure real progress, not checked boxes.
