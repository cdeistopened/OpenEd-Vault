Greetings Eddies!

What do you call it when your kid learns math online, history from a co-op, art at a local studio, and reading from their older sibling in the playroom?

We've got a few ideas.

Let's dive in.

## THE STREAMING MODEL FOR EDUCATION

Leo Linbeck III [laid out an analogy](https://leo3linbeck.substack.com/p/the-artists-formerly-known-as-homeschooler) that's been rattling around in my head:

**Traditional school** is like a DirecTV bundle. You get 132 channels. The media buyers decide what's included. Take it or leave it.

**Traditional homeschool** is like community theater. The material is great, but mom and dad are doing all the production themselves.

**Today's version?** It's more like Netflix plus a touring Broadway show. Professional quality. You choose what fits. No filler.

Parents aren't the instructors anymore. They're the curators.

## HOMESCHOOLING DOESN'T MEAN WHAT IT USED TO

The Texas Legislature defined "homeschool" in 2007 as instruction "provided by the parent" and delivered "in or through the child's home."

But [Linbeck points out](https://leo3linbeck.substack.com/p/the-artists-formerly-known-as-homeschooler) that today's families don't fit that definition. A kid might learn algebra from Khan Academy, history from Great Hearts Online, art at a local studio, and writing at a neighborhood microschool.

Little of the instruction is "provided by the parent." Much of it happens outside the home.

So what do you call it?

Linbeck proposes "Parent-Curated Education." (He admits he's an engineer who loves acronyms.)

We'd call it Open Education: parents as architects of a personalized learning journey, pulling from the best resources available—wherever they come from.

The term matters less than the shift. Mom doesn't have to master every subject. She finds the masters.

## BUILD YOUR OWN RESOURCE LIST

Linbeck mentions that ChatGPT can generate 50 learning resources in 20 seconds. But a generic list isn't as useful as one tailored to your family.

Here's a prompt you can copy into ChatGPT, Perplexity, or the increasingly popular Gemini (turn on deep research mode for best results):

> I'm looking for educational resources for my family. Here's our situation:
>
> **Location:** [Your county/city, state]
> **Kids' ages:** [e.g., 7 and 10]
> **Current interests:** [e.g., dinosaurs, Minecraft, gymnastics, drawing]
> **Learning preferences:** [e.g., hands-on, self-paced, social/group]
> **Budget:** [e.g., free only, up to $100/month, flexible]
>
> Please find me a mix of:
>
> - Local co-ops, microschools, or learning pods
> - Online courses or platforms matching their interests
> - Community classes (art, music, sports, STEM)
> - Field trip destinations within 30 miles
> - Tutors or specialists in our area
>
> For each, include: name, what it offers, cost (if known), and a link.

## TWEET OF THE WEEK

[Gena Gorlin on X](https://x.com/Gena_I_Gorlin/status/1990079374838648914):

> "Omg, you guys, 5yo has opened a 'Toddler School' in our playroom and is practicing her first lesson on me before teaching it to her 2yo brother. This might seriously be what gets him started on literacy."

This is what happens when learning isn't confined to a classroom schedule. Kids follow their interests... and bring others along with them.

That's all for today!
