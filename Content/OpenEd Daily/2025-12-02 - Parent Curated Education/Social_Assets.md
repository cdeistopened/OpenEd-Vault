### Post 1: Pattern Recognition Template (Tag Leo Linbeck)

**Framework:** "I've noticed a pattern" (LinkedIn Swipe File #48)

---

I've noticed a pattern:

The word "homeschooling" doesn't mean what it used to.

Leo Linbeck III pointed this out in a recent Substack piece that's been making the rounds.

Texas defined "homeschool" in 2007 as instruction "provided by the parent" and delivered "in or through the child's home."

But look at what families actually do now:

→ Algebra from Khan Academy
→ History from Great Hearts Online
→ Art at a local studio
→ Writing at a neighborhood microschool

Little of the instruction is "provided by the parent."
Much of it happens outside the home.

So what do you call it?

Linbeck proposes "Parent-Curated Education" (PCE).
We call it "Open Education" (OE).

Either way, the shift is the same:

Parents aren't the instructors anymore.
They're the curators.

Mom doesn't have to master every subject.
She finds the masters.

The term matters less than the shift.

What would you call this new model?

### Post 2: Analogies Template

**Framework:** Analogies (vivid comparison)

---

Traditional school is a DirecTV bundle.

You get 132 channels. The media buyers decide what's included. Take it or leave it.

Traditional homeschool is community theater.

The material might be Shakespeare, but mom and dad are handling the sets, costumes, and lighting themselves.

Today's version?

Netflix plus a touring Broadway show.

Professional production values. You choose what fits. No filler.

The shift: parents aren't the instructors anymore. They're the curators.

This analogy comes from Leo Linbeck III, and it's the clearest framing I've seen for what's happening in education right now.

### Post 3: This vs That Template

**Framework:** This vs That (LinkedIn Swipe File #55)

---

2007 Texas Legislature says:

"Homeschool is instruction provided by the parent, delivered in or through the child's home."

2025 families say:

"My kid learns math from Khan Academy, history from Great Hearts Online, art at a studio, and writing at a microschool. I didn't teach any of it. Half of it happens outside our house."

The definition is 18 years old.

The reality has changed.

Parents aren't instructors anymore. They're curators.

And that's not a bug. It's a feature.

### Post 4: "What If It Was Simpler" Template (AI Prompt Post)

**Framework:** What If It Was Simpler (Justin Welsh)

What if finding educational resources was simpler than you thought?

Copy this prompt into ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini (with deep research mode on):

---

"I'm looking for educational resources for my family.

Location: [Your county/city, state]
Kids' ages: [e.g., 7 and 10]
Current interests: [e.g., dinosaurs, Minecraft, gymnastics]
Learning preferences: [hands-on, self-paced, social/group]
Budget: [free only, up to $100/month, flexible]

Find me a mix of:
• Local co-ops, microschools, or learning pods
• Online courses matching their interests
• Community classes (art, music, sports, STEM)
• Field trip destinations within 30 miles
• Tutors or specialists in our area

For each, include: name, what it offers, cost (if known), and a link."

Try it. Reply with what you found.

**Framework:** Hook & Sinker + Link

What do you call it when your kid learns:

→ Math from Khan Academy
→ History from Great Hearts Online
→ Art at a local studio
→ Writing at a neighborhood microschool

...and little of the instruction comes from you, the parent?

Texas calls it "homeschooling." But that word is doing a lot of heavy lifting these days.

Leo Linbeck III wrote the best breakdown I've seen of this shift. He calls it "Parent-Curated Education."

We call it Open Education.

Either way—parents aren't the instructors anymore. They're the curators.

Traditional school = DirecTV bundle.
132 channels. Take it or leave it.

Traditional homeschool = Community theater.
Great material. Amateur production.

Today's version = Netflix + touring Broadway.
Professional quality. You choose what fits.

Parents aren't instructors anymore.
They're curators.

What do you call it when...

Your kid learns math online, history from a co-op, art at a studio, and writing at a microschool—

And you didn't teach any of it?

Is that still "homeschooling"?

## TWITTER/X THREAD

### Thread: The Streaming Model for Education

**Tweet 1:**
Traditional school is a DirecTV bundle.

132 channels. Media buyers decide what's included. Take it or leave it.

But education is unbundling. Here's what's replacing it:

**Tweet 2:**
Traditional homeschool is like community theater.

The material might be Shakespeare, but mom and dad are handling sets, costumes, and lighting themselves.

It works. But it's exhausting.

**Tweet 3:**
Today's version?

Netflix plus a touring Broadway show.

Professional production values. You choose what fits. No filler.

**Tweet 4:**
The shift:

Parents aren't the instructors anymore.

They're the curators.

Mom doesn't have to master every subject. She finds the masters.

**Tweet 5:**
Leo Linbeck III calls this "Parent-Curated Education."

We call it "Open Education."

The term matters less than the shift.
