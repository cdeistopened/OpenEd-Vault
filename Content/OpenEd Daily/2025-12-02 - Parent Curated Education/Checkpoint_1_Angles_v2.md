## OPENING LETTER OPTIONS (Revised)

The previous options (terminology question, streaming analogy) belong in the THOUGHT/TREND segments. Here are openers that tease without spoiling:

**A. Lead with the Toddler School moment:**
> Greetings Eddies!
>
> A tweet stopped me mid-scroll this week: a 5-year-old opened "Toddler School" in her playroom and started teaching her 2-year-old brother to read.
>
> No curriculum. No lesson plan. Just a kid who wanted to share what she knew.
>
> Let's dive in.

**B. Lead with "what do you call it?":**
> Greetings Eddies!
>
> What do you call it when your kid learns math online, history from a co-op, art at a local studio, and reading from their older sibling in the playroom?
>
> We've got a few ideas.
>
> Let's dive in.

**C. Quick and warm:**
> Greetings Eddies!
>
> Today: a reframe on what "homeschooling" actually means in 2025, and a 5-year-old who opened her own school.
>
> Let's dive in.

**D. Playful misdirect:**
> Greetings Eddies!
>
> New school just opened. Tuition: free. Class size: one. Lead instructor: age 5.
>
> Let's dive in.

## SEGMENT 1: THOUGHT - The Streaming Analogy

**Source:** Leo Linbeck III

No change from v1. The streaming comparison is the stickiest THOUGHT:

- Traditional school = DirecTV bundle (132 channels, take what they give you)
- Traditional homeschool = community theater (great material, amateur production)
- Open education = Netflix + touring Broadway (professional quality, you choose)

---

## SEGMENT 2: TREND - Parent as Curator

**Source:** https://leo3linbeck.substack.com/p/the-artists-formerly-known-as-homeschooler

No change from v1. Frame around:
- The outdated legal definition vs. today's reality
- Parents aren't instructors—they're curators
- He calls it "Parent-Curated Education." We call it Open Education.

---

## SEGMENT 3: TOOL OPTIONS (Expanded)

### Option A: Chalkboard + Sibling Teaching
**Frame:** Your older kid might be your best teaching tool.

Buy a small chalkboard. Hand it to your oldest. Watch what happens.

The Toddler School tweet is proof of concept. Kids naturally want to teach what they've learned. Give them the stage.

**Why it works:** Actionable, cheap, ties directly to the tweet. Parents can try this today.

---

### Option B: One of Linbeck's 50 Resources

Linbeck mentions ChatGPT generated a list of 50 PCE resources in 20 seconds. We could pick one and feature it:

**Potential picks from the article's implied list:**
- Khan Academy (free, self-paced math/science)
- Great Hearts Online (classical education, professional faculty)
- Outschool (live online classes on any topic)
- Local microschools or co-ops

**Frame:** One resource to try this week.

**Downside:** Less unique—we've featured these before.

---

### Option C: The "Curator's Toolkit" Frame

**Frame:** Three questions every parent-curator should ask:
1. What does my kid need right now?
2. Who's the best "artist" (teacher) for this subject?
3. What's the right format (online, in-person, self-paced)?

**Why it works:** Practical framework. Ties back to Linbeck's curator metaphor.

**Downside:** More abstract, less immediately actionable than the chalkboard.

---

### Option D: ESA/Funding Angle

Linbeck's piece is partly about Texas SB2 and ESAs. We could frame the TOOL as:
- Check if your state has an ESA program
- Link to OpenEd's funding resources

**Downside:** Less heartwarming, more administrative. Better for a different newsletter.

---

### Recommendation: Option A (Chalkboard + Sibling Teaching)

It's:
- Actionable (buy a chalkboard, try it today)
- Cheap ($15-20)
- Directly tied to the Toddler School tweet
- Warm and human

The tweet becomes the proof, the chalkboard becomes the tool.
