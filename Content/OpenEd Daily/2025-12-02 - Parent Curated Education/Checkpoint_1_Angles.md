# Checkpoint 1: Angles & Structure - December 2, 2025

---

## STRUCTURE DECISION

**Option A: Linbeck as TREND, pull THOUGHT from within it**
- THOUGHT: The streaming analogy or curator framing (from Linbeck)
- TREND: The full Linbeck piece ("homeschooling" is an outdated term)
- TOOL: Toddler School tweet

**Option B: Same-pace graphic as THOUGHT**
- THOUGHT: "Teaching everyone at the same pace is like..."
- TREND: Linbeck piece
- TOOL: Toddler School tweet

**Recommendation: Option A**

The Linbeck piece has multiple quotable moments that work better as a THOUGHT than the same-pace graphic. The streaming analogy is particularly sticky and original. Option B's THOUGHT is solid but generic—we've made similar points before.

## SUBJECT LINE OPTIONS (10 total)

### Curiosity-Based
1. Homeschooling doesn't mean what it used to

---

## PREVIEW TEXT OPTIONS

**A:** Parents aren't instructors anymore—they're curators. PLUS: A 5-year-old opens "Toddler School."

**B:** From cable bundles to streaming: the new model for education. PLUS: Learning between siblings.

**C:** Homeschooling in 2025 looks nothing like the legal definition. PLUS: A tweet that made us smile.

## SEGMENT 1: THOUGHT

### Angle Options

**A. The Streaming Analogy (Recommended)**
Lead with Leo Linbeck's comparison:
- Traditional school = DirecTV bundle (132 channels, you take what they give you)
- Traditional homeschool = community theater (amateur production, great material)
- Open education = Netflix + touring Broadway (professional quality, you choose)

This is sticky, original, and immediately graspable.

**B. Parent as Curator**
"A great curator knows their audience and looks for art and artists who speak to that audience. A curator does not need to be an artist."

Reframes the parent's role: you don't have to master every subject. You find the masters.

**C. The Outdated Definition**
Lead with the 2007 Texas definition vs. today's reality. Show the gap between law and practice.

**D. Craft Matters**
"It turns out that craft—that magical combination of talent and training—does matter to the audience experience."

Parents can now access professional-quality instruction for their kids.

### Recommended: Angle A (Streaming Analogy)

It's visual):, memorable, and hasn't been done to death. Pairs well with the TREND explaining where this insight comes from.

### Structure
- Hook: The DirecTV comparison (one line)
- Substance: Three-way comparison (bundle/community theater/streaming)
- Insight: This is what open education looks like

## SEGMENT 2: TREND - The Artists Formerly Known as Homeschooler

**Source:** https://leo3linbeck.substack.com/p/the-artists-formerly-known-as-homeschooler

### Angle Options

**A. The Term Is Outdated (Recommended)**
Leo Linbeck argues that "homeschooling" no longer describes what families are actually doing. Kids learn from Khan Academy, Great Hearts Online, microschools, co-ops—often outside the home, rarely with parents as primary instructors.

He proposes "Parent-Curated Education." We'd call it Open Education.

**B. The Teacher Liberation Angle**
Focus on his argument that ESAs and this model liberate teachers from bureaucracy, allowing them to practice their craft in human-scale settings.

**C. The Two Barriers**
Time + money. Curating education is like buying a house. ESAs solve the money problem.

**D. Nearbound Play**
Frame around the David Kirby email: someone else is seeing the same shift and calling it by a different name. Open Education is the better frame.

### Recommended: Angle A

The "term is outdated" framing is the most shareable and aligns directly with OpenEd's positioning. The nearbound angle (Angle D) could be a brief mention at the end.

### Structure
- Hook: What does "homeschooling" even mean anymore?
- Substance: Linbeck's argument (definition vs. reality)
- Insight: He calls it "Parent-Curated Education." We call it Open Education.

## SEGMENT 3: TOOL - Toddler School Tweet

**Source:** https://x.com/Gena_I_Gorlin/status/1990079374838648914

### Angle Options

**A. Learning Without Boundaries (Recommended)**
Frame around the tweet with your preferred caption: "This is what happens when learning isn't confined to a classroom schedule. Kids follow their interests… and bring others along with them."

The image speaks for itself. Minimal commentary needed.

**B. Tiny Leaders**
"Open education doesn't just teach skills. It builds leaders. Sometimes very tiny, very determined leaders."

**C. Sibling Learning**
Highlight the power of multi-age learning environments—something homeschool and microschools enable that age-segregated classrooms don't.

### Recommended: Angle A

Your instinct on the caption was right. Let the tweet do the work.

### Structure
- Hook: Tweet embed or screenshot
- Caption: "This is what happens when learning isn't confined to a classroom schedule..."
- Brief tie-back to the theme (optional)

## ORTHOGONALITY CHECK

- [x] Thought and Trend are distinct (Streaming analogy vs. Full Linbeck argument)
- [x] Aligns with OpenEd beliefs (Parents as architects, education adapts to child, learning is natural)
- [x] Would Sarah forward this? (Yes—the streaming analogy is shareable, the Linbeck piece validates her choices, the Toddler School tweet is heartwarming)

---

## OPENING LETTER DIRECTION

**Option A: Lead with the terminology question**
"What do you even call it when your kid learns math from Khan Academy, history from Great Hearts Online, art from a local studio, and writing from a neighborhood microschool? The Texas Legislature says that's 'homeschooling.' But is it?"

**Option B: Lead with the analogy**
"Traditional school is like a DirecTV bundle: 132 channels, take it or leave it. Today's families are streaming."

**Option C: Lead with the Toddler School tweet**
"A 5-year-old opened a school in her playroom this week. Her first student: her 2-year-old brother."

**Recommendation:** Option A or B—both tee up the THOUGHT and TREND nicely without spoiling the punchline.
