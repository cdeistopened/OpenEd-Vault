## TREND: The Artists Formerly Known as Homeschooler and Teacher

**Source:** https://leo3linbeck.substack.com/p/the-artists-formerly-known-as-homeschooler

**Author:** Leo Linbeck III (free-market conservative in Houston, potential nearbound partner)

**Context:** David Kirby forwarded this to Isaac, noting that Leo "nails the analysis for how COVID changed homeschooling" but coins a terrible name for it ("Parent-Curated Education" or PCE). David suggests "Open Education" is the better term.

### Key Arguments:

**1. The old definition of homeschooling is outdated:**
Texas Legislature (2007) defined homeschool as instruction "provided by the parent" delivered "in or through the child's home."

But today's homeschooling often involves:
- Khan Academy (Sal Khan is the instructor)
- Great Hearts Online (professional faculty)
- Microschools, co-ops, specialist classes
- Online programs, field trips, work-study

**"In today's homeschooling, kids may be taking a 'general elementary or secondary education program,' but little or none of the instruction 'is provided by the parent,' and a substantial amount of the content is not delivered 'in or through the child's home.'"**

**2. The streaming analogy:**
- Traditional schooling = DirecTV bundle (you buy all 132 channels, media buyers decide what you get)
- Traditional homeschooling = community theater Shakespeare (magical text, amateur production values)
- PCE/Open Education = Netflix + touring Broadway (pay for what you want, professional production values)

**3. Parents as curators, not instructors:**
"I call it Parent-Curated Education because I believe great education is like art: the best instructors are those who are passionate about their subject matter and craft, and the best curators know how to position a particular artist and work to resonate with their specific audience."

**4. Two barriers to PCE:**
- Time (curating education is like buying a house—complex, high-stakes)
- Money (professionals need to be paid; ESAs help solve this)

**5. Teachers can thrive in this model:**
"This de-institutionalization of the teaching profession could be a wonderful thing... restoring teaching as a human-scale enterprise where the secret ingredient of great teaching—love—can be deployed without the depersonalizing ethic of a centralized bureaucracy."

### Potential THOUGHT quotes from this article:

**Option A (Curator framing):**
"Parents can work with a variety of educators to find the best way to stimulate their kids' cognitive development... A great curator knows their audience and looks for art and artists who speak to that audience."

**Option B (Streaming analogy):**
"Traditional schooling is like purchasing a bundle of channels from DirecTV. You buy all 132 channels, and the professional media buyers decide what you get."

**Option C (Teacher liberation):**
"This de-institutionalization of the teaching profession could be a wonderful thing... restoring teaching as a human-scale enterprise where the secret ingredient of great teaching—love—can be deployed without the depersonalizing ethic of a centralized bureaucracy."

**Option D (Craft matters):**
"It turns out that craft—that magical combination of talent and training—does matter to the audience experience."

## THOUGHT: Teaching everyone at the same pace is like...

**Source:** OpenEd original graphic

Teaching everyone at the same pace is like:
- Making everyone eat at the same speed
- Forcing everyone to grow at the same rate
- Expecting everyone to sleep the same hours

Learning isn't one-size-fits-all.

## TOOL/TWEET OF THE WEEK: Gena Gorlin's "Toddler School"

**Source:** https://x.com/Gena_I_Gorlin/status/1990079374838648914

**Tweet:**
"Omg, you guys, 5yo has opened a 'Toddler School' in our playroom and is practicing her first lesson on me before teaching it to her 2yo brother. This might seriously be what gets him started on literacy."

**Caption options provided:**
1. "This is what happens when learning isn't confined to a classroom schedule. Kids follow their interests… and bring others along with them." (marked as top choice)
2. "Open education doesn't just teach skills. It builds leaders. Sometimes very tiny, very determined leaders."
3. "There's something magical about kids learning from each other. No pressure. No fear. Just connection, patience, and play."

## Notes

**Thematic connections:**
- Leo Linbeck's "parent as curator" → parents don't have to be the instructor
- Toddler School tweet → kids naturally teach each other when given space
- "Same pace" graphic → one-size-fits-all doesn't work

**Potential structures:**
1. THOUGHT: Streaming analogy or curator framing from Linbeck → TREND: Full Linbeck piece → TOOL: Toddler School tweet
2. THOUGHT: Same pace graphic → TREND: Linbeck piece → TOOL: Toddler School tweet

**User note:** There might be a better THOUGHT within the Linbeck article. The streaming analogy is particularly sticky.
