# DEEP DIVE: Two Versions for Approval

## VERSION 1: Conversational Third Person (Shorter)

**By Andrea Fife, Chief Academic Officer at OpenEd | Read in browser**

Andrea was 36 when her doctor confirmed what everyone apparently already knew: she had ADHD. Her oldest son was diagnosed at 8. Her youngest showed a completely different presentation—also ADHD. Understanding these different presentations changed how she approached parenting entirely.

Most people think ADHD is about not having enough attention. They're wrong. It's about not having control over where your attention goes. It's like having 50 channels on the TV and someone else controlling the remote. The prefrontal cortex—the part that controls executive function—is where the real issue lives.

Here's what they don't tell you: **kids with ADHD are approximately 30% behind their peers in executive function.** A 12-year-old has the executive function of an 8-year-old. By 18, heading to college, they still have the executive function of someone just starting middle school. The gap keeps growing.

So when your ADHD kid hyperfocuses for six hours on Minecraft but can't focus six minutes on math homework, that's not laziness. That's neurology. Their brain cannot access motivation through importance alone. Homeschooling becomes a superpower the moment you realize you're not locked into anything. If it's not working, you can change it.

## VERSION 2: More Observational/Narrative (Shorter)

**By Andrea Fife, Chief Academic Officer at OpenEd | Read in browser**

Andrea discovered her own ADHD at 36, the same year she was navigating two sons with completely different ADHD presentations. The realization changed everything about how she understood attention, focus, and what actually motivates kids with executive function challenges.

The misconception is that ADHD means not having enough attention. The reality is different: it's about having no control over where attention goes. Imagine 50 channels on the TV with someone else holding the remote. The prefrontal cortex—which controls executive function—is the part that's affected. And here's what research shows: **kids with ADHD are approximately 30% behind their peers in executive function development.** A 12-year-old has the executive function of an 8-year-old. By the time they're heading to college, they still have the executive function of someone just starting middle school.

That hyperfocus on Minecraft for six hours straight? Not laziness. That inability to focus six minutes on math homework? Neurology. Their brain literally cannot access motivation through importance alone.

The silver lining: homeschooling becomes a superpower the moment you realize nothing is locked in. If it's not working, you change it.
