## PARTING THOUGHT

**Format:** Bold quote + Attribution + Story moment + Action invitation

**Quote options:**

Option 1 (Ken Danford):
*"Have you considered not going to school?"*
**– Ken Danford, founder of North Star**

Story: 30 years ago, Ken was teaching 8th grade when he read "The Teenage Liberation Handbook" and discovered teens could leave school and thrive. Now, 70% of his students come from failing traditional schools (anxiety, bullying, neurodiversity pushing them out). The question isn't whether teens are ready for autonomy—it's why we assume they aren't.

Action: The infrastructure exists now. Liberated Learners network in multiple states. No more "either school or homeschool alone" false choice.

Option 2 (Andrea - ADHD article):
*"Don't judge the fish on its ability to climb. Build the fish a fishbowl, and carry that fish to the top of the tree yourself."*
**– Andrea, homeschooling parent of ADHD kids**

Story: Andrea was 36 when she realized she had ADHD. Her oldest son was diagnosed at 8 (climbed out of his crib to sleep in his dresser drawers—classic ADHD exploration). Her youngest showed totally different traits but also ADHD. Understanding the 30% executive function delay changed everything about how she parented.

Action: You don't need special curriculum. You need a curriculum you can change. Your job isn't to fix ADHD—it's to build the support system that lets your kid reach their potential exactly as they are.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Use Ken Danford quote - ties directly to current infrastructure expansion and resonates with parent readiness question. More action-oriented.
