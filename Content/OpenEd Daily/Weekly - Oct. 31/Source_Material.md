- Research citation: https://digitalcommons.csumb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1184&context=caps_thes_all

### Daily 2: Learning Gaps & AI
**URL:** https://opened.co/blog/the-5-real-gaps-homeschooling-creates

**THOUGHT:** The 5 Real Gaps Homeschooling Creates
- Source: Reddit post from actual homeschooler who attended Ivy League
- Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1nvcvt9/5_gaps_homeschooling_did_leave_in_my_education/
- The 5 gaps: Collaboration, handling repetitive content, giving feedback on presentations, meeting deadlines, separating school from rest of life
- Question posed: Are these gaps that matter? Or just school skills?
- Framing: One gap you can fix at the DMV, the other kind is more stubborn

**TREND:** What Makes You Irreplaceable?
- Ed Elson (Prof G Markets podcast host)
- Article: https://www.gettingsmart.com/2025/09/16/3-human-skills-that-make-you-irreplaceable-in-an-ai-world/
- The 3 C's: Curation, Curiosity, Connectivity
  - Curation: Selecting tone/frame, developing taste, reading widely/choosing narrowly
  - Curiosity: Building creative range, exploring outside your lane, connecting dots others don't see
  - Connectivity: Warmth, follow-through, trust, bringing groups together
- Connection to Open Education book: Similar to Choice, Competency, Connection
- Key insight: Schools teach what AI does best (standardized knowledge, recall, instructions); can't standardize the 3 C's

**TOOL:** Creation Beats Consumption
- Reddit post: Mom tried everything for teen's screen time (sports, clubs, art classes - nothing stuck)
- Solution: Bought 3D printer (Bambu Lab P1S) - son now spends 1-2 hours daily painting 3D models
- Shift: Not about removing tech, but redirecting it
- Isaac Morehouse rule: "Make a YouTube video before you watch YouTube" - create before consume
- Post URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1o0rgb5/how_a_3d_printer_surprisingly_helped_my_kid_spend/
- Product link: https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/p1s?srsltid=AfmBOoqfAwV8ZknbmjtSx96_LC_harOqQHH2U50-wuPsSt_wRrHWMTGl

## DEEP DIVE (Wednesday article - Required for Weekly)

### Homeschooling a Child with ADHD
**URL:** https://opened.co/blog/homeschooling-a-child-with-adhd (also linked from podcast episode Q&A)

**Author:** Andrea (late-diagnosed ADHD adult, teacher, parent of 2 sons with ADHD - different presentations)

**Key Sections & Data Points:**

**Opening Quote:**
"Everyone is a genius, but if you judge a fish on its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing it is stupid." - critiques this quote, wants people with ADHD to reach the top of the tree WITH support

**Understanding ADHD:**
- ADHD name is terrible - not "deficit of attention" but lack of CONTROL over attention (50 channels, someone else has remote)
- Prefrontal cortex controls executive function - the part impacted by ADHD
- Intelligence unaffected - can get 36 on ACT and still do stupid things (Dr. Russell Barkley reference)

**The 30% Rule (Critical data):**
- Executive function delay ~30% behind peers (about 1/3 behind)
- 12-year-old with ADHD has executive function of 8-year-old
- Gap gets BIGGER with age (by 15, they're 5 years behind; by 18, still middle-school executive function)
- Scaffolding needed longer than most think

**Interest-Based vs Importance-Based Nervous System:**
- Neurotypical: Can engage through importance ("this matters for your grade")
- ADHD: Brain cannot access motivation through importance alone
- ADHD needs ONE of four things: Interest, Urgency, Novelty, or Challenge
- Example: Can hyperfocus 6 hours on Minecraft, 6 minutes on math homework

**Strategies for Parents:**

1. **Build the Fishbowl** - You're external executive function while internal catches up (not forever, but longer than you think)

2. **Expect Executive Function Age, Not Chronological Age** - Adjust expectations for managing learning, not learning itself

3. **Understand the Wall of Awful** - Every failure = emotional wall to climb (by Brendan Mahan, ADHD Essentials)
   - For neurotypical: stepping over a curb
   - For ADHD: scaling 40-foot wall of past failures
   - Solutions: Body doubling, break into smallest steps, remove distractions, create novelty, acknowledge wall without judgment

4. **Simplify Everything** - Don't add more management tools, remove clutter. Post-its on mirror > digital planner

5. **Advocate for Accommodations** - Not cheating, leveling the playing field (like glasses for bad eyesight)

**Curriculum & Tools:**

**What to Look For (not "ADHD curriculum"):**
- Interest-based learning
- Hands-on and experiential
- Novelty and variety
- Shorter segments (15-20 min vs hour-long blocks)
- Choice within structure

**Freedom to Change:**
- If it's not working, switch it. This is homeschooling's superpower.
- Path doesn't matter - destination does

**Specific Tools:**
- Habitica (gamifies tasks/routines) - https://habitica.com/static/home
- Visual timers - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuiF-_3Cj51fQeIJ9IliMbg
- Post-it systems > digital planners
- Fidgets (not toys, focus tools)
- Body doubling
- Khan Academy - https://www.khanacademy.org/
- Teaching Textbooks - https://www.teachingtextbooks.com/
- Math-U-See - https://mathusee.com/
- Audiobooks paired with physical books

**How OpenEd Supports:**
- Complete curriculum freedom
- Personalized pacing
- Built-in support (tutoring, special ed services)
- Real-world learning (field trips, mentorships, project-based)

**Closing Quote:**
"Don't judge the fish on its ability to climb. Build the fish a fishbowl, and carry that fish to the top of the tree yourself."

**Podcast Connection:**
Also mentioned in OpenEd podcast episode Q&A on ADHD - https://opened.co/blog/episode-019-qa-adhd-social-skills-making-hard-choices-in-alternative-education

## PODCAST HIGHLIGHT (Thursday episode - Required for Weekly)

### "Have you considered not going to school?" | Ken Danford
**URL:** https://opened.co/blog/what-happens-when-a-teacher-tells-teens-to-stop-going-to-school

**Guest:** Ken Danford - Founded North Star 30 years ago

**Background:**
- Was teaching 8th grade U.S. history in public school (6 years)
- Read "The Teenage Liberation Handbook" (Grace Llewellyn, 1991)
- Found case studies of teens who left school and turned out fine
- Started North Star in 1996 - physical community center for homeschooling teens

**Core Message:**
**"Have you considered not going to school?"** - His opening question to struggling students

**Exit Ramp Model:**
- File homeschooling plan
- Use North Star as headquarters
- Keep weekly advisory for accountability
- Rebuild life around interests, jobs, college classes, or rest

**Key Stats:**
- 70% of North Star teens came directly from school (anxiety, bullying, neurodiversity, grade-stress breakdown)
- Wouldn't have homeschooled without an exit ramp
- Helped hundreds of teens trade hall passes for autonomy

**On Readiness for Autonomy:**
- Critics ask: "Are teens ready for that autonomy?"
- Ken flips it: "Why assume they aren't? That's insulting."

**School Refugees Need Infrastructure:**
- Homeschooling used to signal ideology
- Now it's one option in growing ecosystem: learning centers, mentors, programs
- Liberated Learners network: https://liberatedlearners.net/
  - Physical buildings (couches, kitchens, drop-in hours)
  - Centers: North Star, Launchpad (NY), Compass (VA), Lighthouse (NYC)
  - Expanding to Texas, Oregon, UK

**Two Paths for Families with No Alternative:**

Path 1: Stay for social piece, not grades
- Use school like community center
- Let child skip assignments that trigger panic
- Assume eventual GED/community college
- Treat as service provider, not master

Path 2: Build a patchwork week
- Use after-3pm activities: music, theater, church, jobs, volunteering, online classes
- Yes, relatives will judge
- Barometer: child's health and curiosity

**Ken's Advice:**
- Listen when teen says "This is hurting me"
- Assume they're right
- Celebrate them standing up for themselves

**Resources:**
- North Star: https://northstarteens.org/
- Book recommendation: "The Teenage Liberation Handbook: How to Quit School and Get a Real Life and Education" by Grace Llewellyn (1991) - https://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Liberation-Handbook-School-Education/dp/0962959170
