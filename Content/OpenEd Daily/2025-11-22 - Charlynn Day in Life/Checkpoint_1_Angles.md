## PREVIEW TEXT
Stop trying to be a classroom teacher. PLUS: The "hard stop" rule that saves sanity.

## SEGMENT 1: THE MENU METHOD (Thought)
**Source:** Charlynn's Interview (The shift from "Rigid Schedule" to "Weekly Menu")
**Angle Options:**
1.  **The Classroom Trap:** Why parents burn out trying to replicate "school at home" (bells, periods, daily subjects) vs. the flexibility of a weekly quota.
2.  **Structure vs. Freedom:** How the "Menu" allows for *both* structure (goals) and freedom (timing), solving the ADHD planning dilemma.
3.  **The "Good Enough" Bar:** Moving from "did we finish the lesson?" to "did we feed the brain this week?"
**Recommended:** Angle 1 (The Classroom Trap). It hits the core pain point of new homeschoolers (burnout from rigidity) and offers a distinct philosophical shift (Menu > Schedule).
**Structure:** The problem (Replicating school) -> The Shift (Weekly Menu/Quota) -> The Result (Sanity/Adaptability).

## SEGMENT 2: THE "APPRENTICESHIP" COMEBACK (Trend)
**Source:** Charlynn's Interview ("Dad Skills" section - rafters, canning, cars)
**Angle Options:**
1.  **Vocational is the New Academic:** While schools cut shop class, homeschoolers are bringing it back. It's not just "chores"; it's the return of the apprenticeship model (learning by doing alongside an expert).
2.  **Contextual Math:** Why learning geometry on a whiteboard fails, but learning it while building a shed sticks forever. The trend is "embedded learning."
3.  **The "Dad" factor:** The rising trend of fathers taking ownership of specific "practical" domains in homeschooling, moving beyond the "mom does everything" stereotype.
**Recommended:** Angle 1 (Vocational is the New Academic). It frames "Dad Skills" not just as a quirky family habit, but as part of a larger movement returning to apprenticeship-style learning, which contrasts sharply with the "test prep" model of schools.
**Structure:** The decline of shop class -> The rise of "Dad Skills" -> The result (Competence > Credentials).

## SEGMENT 3: THE "CLONE" PROTOCOL (Tool)
**Source:** Charlynn's Interview ("Subject Bins" & "Skylight")
**Angle Options:**
1.  **The "Sick Mom" Protocol (Subject Bins):** A low-tech system (magazine holders) for when the parent can't teach. "Build a system that works when you don't."
2.  **The Family Operating System (Skylight):** Moving the "mental load" from Mom's brain to a wall-mounted screen. It's not a calendar; it's an external executive function.
3.  **Gamified "Hard Stops":** Using the Skylight to enforce the 9:30 AM rule. The tool isn't the calendar; the tool is the *boundary* it enforces.
**Recommended:** Angle 2 (The Family Operating System / Skylight). It elevates the tool from "just a calendar" to a solution for the "Mental Load" crisis parents face. It fits the "Day in the Life" tech-enabled theme nicely alongside Brettani's Perplexity use.
**Structure:** The problem (Mom as the nagging bottleneck) -> The Tool (Skylight/External Brain) -> The Result (Autonomy).

## ORTHOGONALITY CHECK
- [x] Thought (Philosophy of Scheduling) and Trend (Vocational/Apprenticeship) are distinct
- [x] Tool (Tech/Systems) is distinct from the Philosophy
- [x] Aligns with OpenEd beliefs (Flexibility, Real-world skills, Parent sanity)
