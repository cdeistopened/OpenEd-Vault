**PREVIEW:** Stop trying to be a classroom teacher. PLUS: The "Dad Skills" revolution.

Greetings Eddies!

If you ask OpenEd ambassador Charlynn Chambers what her Tuesday schedule looks like, she'll tell you she doesn't have one.

Most parents burn out because they try to replicate "school" at home. They set an 8:00 AM bell for Math and a 9:00 AM bell for History. By Wednesday, they're exhausted.

Charlynn uses a different system: **The Menu.**

Instead of a rigid daily schedule, she has a weekly quota. "Did we feed the brain this week?" matters more than "Did we finish the lesson at 9:45?"

Today, we're looking at the "Menu Method," the return of "Dad Skills," and the digital tool that runs her entire household.

Let's dive in.

## THE MENU METHOD

The biggest mistake new homeschoolers make is trying to be a classroom teacher.

Schools need bells and rigid periods because they are managing 30 kids. You are managing three. You don't need a schedule; you need a **Menu**.

Charlynn's "Menu Method" is simple:
*   **The Goal:** Hit History twice a week. Hit Science twice a week.
*   **The Timing:** Flexible.

If Tuesday is chaos? Skip History. If Wednesday is rainy? Double up on Science.

"If we're in the mood to do history right now versus language arts, I don't really care as long as it gets done by the end of the week," Charlynn says.

Rigidity breaks when life happens. A menu gives you permission to pivot.

## THE DAD FACTOR

For decades, the stereotype of homeschooling was "Mom does everything."

That is shifting.

Charlynn has formalized a new subject called **"Dad Skills."** Once a week, the books close and her husband takes over for high-leverage vocational training.

In this class, they aren't just doing chores. They are building rafters (**Geometry**), canning apples (**Chemistry**), and fixing cars (**Physics**).

This is the return of the **Apprenticeship Model**. Schools have largely cut vocational training, but homeschoolers are bringing it back as a core subject.

It also solves a massive problem: It gives Mom a break while the kids learn that solving problems with your hands is just as prestigious as solving them with a pencil.

## SKYLIGHT

Managing the "Menu Method" requires a central nervous system.

For Charlynn, that is the [**Skylight Calendar**](https://www.skylightframe.com/).

Think of it as part digital calendar, part external brain for the entire family. It enforces her most important rule: **The 9:30 AM Hard Stop.**

Every morning, the kids check the Skylight for their "Morning List" (teeth, beds, animal chores).
*   Finish by 9:00? You get 30 minutes of play.
*   Finish by 9:30? You start school.
*   Finish at 9:31? You missed your window.

The screen becomes the "bad guy," not the parent. It tracks chores, displays the weekly "Menu," and even manages their reward system (stars for "Accent Day" or "Parkour Day").

When you offload the mental load to a wall-mounted screen, you stop being the nag and start being the guide.

That's all for today!
