**SUBJECT:** Counterfeit Empathy, Real Teachers, Actual Deployment

**PREVIEW:** The empathy trap. While others debate, Iceland is deploying. PLUS: Claude's refusal to do homework.

Everyone's talking about AI in schools these days. The question on most people's minds? Will it replace teachers?

Fewer are asking whether it's already replacing something more dangerous—but also more fragile: authentic human connection. The ability to discern real empathy from synthetic approximation. {this still makes no sense - it's fluff}

Let's dive in.

## COUNTERFEIT EMPATHY

Your kid's AI tutor is infinitely patient. It remembers her name. It celebrates her wins. It cares. Of course, it doesn't. But she might not know the difference.

While pundits worry about AI writing essays for students, the education researchers at [ed3world](https://ed3world.substack.com/p/counterfeit-humans-vs-real-teachers) argue that the greater risk is subtler: **"Ten years from now, students won't remember which AI model they used. They'll remember who taught them to think without one."**

The danger is cognitive confusion. Students who mistake algorithmic support for genuine care lose the ability to discern real empathy from synthetic approximation—and by then, it's too late to unlearn.

{let's make this a little less negative about AI - I've written very positively about AI in the past - let's just make it pro parent/teacher}

## ICELAND: TOO SMALL TO DEBATE, TOO FAST TO WAIT

This week, [Anthropic and Iceland's Ministry of Education announced](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-and-iceland-announce-one-of-the-world-s-first-national-ai-education-pilots) one of the world's first *national* AI deployments for education. Hundreds of teachers across every region—including remote villages—now have access to Claude, plus training, resources, and dedicated support.

Notice that Iceland isn't deploying AI to *students*, but rather *teachers*. Teachers get Claude for lesson planning and curriculum design. Students don't get a shortcut. Teachers get freed from busywork, which means they actually have time for the irreplaceable human part: guide, question, push.

Iceland's Minister of Education captured it simply: **"It is important to harness its power while at the same time preventing harm."** Not bad for a country you can drive across in a day. (Most countries are still writing white papers about this. Iceland is already halfway done.)

## CLAUDE FOR EDUCATION

[Claude for Education](https://www.claude.com/solutions/education) deliberately refuses to write your essays for you. Instead, it uses "Learning Mode"—Socratic questioning that makes you *do the thinking*. It asks questions. It highlights principles. It pushes back. The opposite of AI tutors that whisper answers.

This is what responsible AI in education *could* look like: not a tool that makes learning easier, but one that makes learning harder in the right way.

That's all for today!

P.S. If your school or institution has access to Claude, Learning Mode is in the settings. Turn it on. It changes everything.
