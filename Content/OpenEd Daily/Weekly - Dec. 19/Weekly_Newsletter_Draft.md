## OPENING LETTER

Greetings Eddies!

{Let's not tease so much here about this. We can maybe have one-line teaser but I think instead we should say how this is our last newsletter before we're signing off for until the new year}

The New York Times published a piece this week calling homeschooled kids "not all right." We had a response ready within 48 hours - and honestly, we'd been working on a deep dive into unschooling for weeks before their headline dropped. The timing was almost too perfect.

We go into all of it below. The author's pain is real. What he experienced wasn't unschooling - it was isolation and neglect. The difference matters, and we tried to explain why.

Meanwhile, January is shaping up. Once Upon a Time Week has events built around Nancy Drew, Percy Jackson, Harry Potter, and more. We're running our first-ever OpenEd Spelling Bees - three divisions, swag for the winners. And Apryl Stott, a New York Times bestselling author and illustrator, is joining us for a live event on the 28th. Details below.

One more thing: the OpenEd Store is live at [store.opened.co](https://store.opened.co/). Everything's sold at cost. We're not trying to make money off merch - we just want you to have cool stuff.

Let's dive in.

- Charlie (the OpenEd newsletter guy)

## DEEP DIVE: What the Times Missed About Unschooling

The New York Times just published "[The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/opinion/home-school-isolation.html)" - a sweeping title based on one author's painful experience. The essay describes a childhood of isolation, a struggling mother, emotional needs unmet. It calls for mandatory registration, assessments, and check-ins for all homeschoolers.

The author's pain is real. So are the points worth considering: isolation can harm children, some kids fall through the cracks, adults outside the home sometimes see what parents miss.

But the argument rests on a comparison between his homeschool experience and a school system that would have caught his pain. Teachers who would have noticed. Counselors who would have helped.

That school system doesn't exist.

Isaac Morehouse points out that this is the [Nirvana Fallacy](https://opened.co/blog/you-can-do-this-what-the-new-york-times-misses-about-unschooling): comparing a real situation to an imagined ideal. Three weeks before this essay, the same New York Times published "[America's Children Are Unwell. Are Schools Part of the Problem?](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/24/magazine/youth-mental-health-crisis-schools.html)" Their own data showed 1 in 4 teenage boys now diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety spiking as early as age 6.

[Peter Gray](https://petergray.substack.com/), a research professor at Boston College, has tracked this for years: every fall when school starts, teen mental health deteriorates. ER visits for anxiety spike. Psychiatric hospitalizations rise. Summer comes and it improves. When researchers asked teenagers what stresses them out, 83% cited school. Nothing else came close.

<furthermore, cite corey deangelis stat... 

<so what does unschooling look like when it's done right?

Amanda Schenkenberger, an OpenEd mom and homeschool coach [recently interviewed on Fox News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8jCQcIZQWc), put it simply: "Unschooling is pursuing a level of learning and following my kids' lead to what they're curious about and diving deeply into the subject as long as their curiosity is alive about it." Her boys take Oregon's required standardized tests. They score in the top 10 percent nationally.

The title of the Times essay acknowledges this is one person's experience. But the clear subtext is that homeschooling is a threat and parents can't be trusted. The data tells a different story.

## PODCAST HIGHLIGHT: She Did Everything Right - Her Daughter Still Couldn't Read

[Janssen Bradshaw](https://www.instagram.com/everydayreading/) (@everydayreading {add hyoerlink here} )had every advantage. Former librarian. English major. Read aloud to her kids daily. Between 2,000 and 5,000 books in her home.

Her first daughter tested at a 12th grade reading level in kindergarten.

Her second daughter? Barely grade level in first grade - and drifting lower.

"My second daughter is extremely bright," Janssen told Ela. "It was not like she was not smart. But learning to read is just really hard for some kids."

What followed was a transformation. Janssen discovered what researcher Benjamin Bloom called the "Two Sigma Problem" - students who receive one-on-one tutoring outperform 98% of students taught in conventional classrooms. The solution wasn't more hours or harder curriculum. It was 25-minute sessions, four times a week, meeting her daughter exactly where she was.

By fifth grade, her daughter was reading at an 11th grade level.

When Janssen asked her daughter if she was embarrassed about needing extra help, she said: "Why would I be embarrassed that something was hard for me? And then I worked really hard and now I'm awesome at it."

That approach became [Savvy Learning](https://savvylearning.com/) - now available in the OpenEd Marketplace.

Janssen also shared her family's favorite read-alouds. The [Penderwicks series](https://www.amazon.com/Penderwicks-Summer-Sisters-Rabbit-General/dp/0440420474) - five books about four sisters that her kids have listened to "15 or 20 times, maybe more." They call each other by the characters' names. [Nanny Piggins](https://www.amazon.com/Nanny-Piggins-R-Spratt/dp/0316068195) - an outrageously weird Australian series for kids who like Wayside School or Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle. And for screen-free listening, she recommends the [Yoto Player](https://us.yotoplay.com/).

## TRENDS WE'RE FOLLOWING

[**The Times Does a 180**](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/24/magazine/youth-mental-health-crisis-schools.html) - Three weeks before publishing their homeschool hit piece, the New York Times Magazine ran "America's Children Are Unwell. Are Schools Part of the Problem?" One in four seventeen-year-old boys now diagnosed with ADHD. Autism went from 1 in 2,500 in the 1980s to 1 in 31 today. Anxiety diagnoses in 32% of adolescents - median onset age of six. Peter Gray: "Instead of saying, 'We need to fix the schools,' the message is, 'We need to fix the kids.'" ([NYT Magazine](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/24/magazine/youth-mental-health-crisis-schools.html))

[**Readers Are Now the Minority**](https://x.com/paulg/status/2000671836992884746) - Essayist and venture capitalist Paul Graham shares data: "Readers used to outnumber non-readers 2 to 1. Now non-readers outnumber readers 3 to 1." That's a complete inversion of the ratio. Hard to imagine a shift that dramatic not showing up everywhere. ([Paul Graham](https://x.com/paulg/status/2000671836992884746))

[**Parents Want Skills, Not Just Scores**](https://www.edchoice.org/2026-fall-polling-finds-parents-value-durable-skills-development-in-schools/) - EdChoice polling finds 85% of parents rate "durable skills" - communication, critical thinking, teamwork, adaptability - as extremely or very important. 45% say a school's emphasis on these makes a "significant" impact on enrollment. Meanwhile, 73% of school parents now support Education Savings Accounts. The policy window is open. ([EdChoice](https://www.edchoice.org/2026-fall-polling-finds-parents-value-durable-skills-development-in-schools/))

[**Teachers and Students See Different Realities**](https://www.the74million.org/article/student-engagement-is-key-defining-and-measuring-it-is-the-challenge/) - 92% of students say engaging lessons make school more enjoyable, but only 63% say they feel "highly engaged." There's a 20-point gap between what students report and what teachers perceive. The report's conclusion: engagement isn't optional. It's a precondition for learning. ([The 74](https://www.the74million.org/article/student-engagement-is-key-defining-and-measuring-it-is-the-challenge/))

[**The 8-Hour Day Is Made Up**](https://x.com/AdamMGrant/status/2001354367807688856) - {The take here is that we talk a lot about how the six-hour school day is an artifact of the factory model. But could the same be true of the eight-hour work day? We don't need to quote Adam so much at full length Organizational psychologist Adam Grant: "The 8-hour work day was not ordained from above for all time. It was dreamed up by humans. We can be as productive and creative in 6 focused hours as in 8 unfocused hours." Anyone who's watched their kid finish "a full day of school" in two hours at home already knows this. ([Adam Grant](https://x.com/AdamMGrant/status/2001354367807688856))
