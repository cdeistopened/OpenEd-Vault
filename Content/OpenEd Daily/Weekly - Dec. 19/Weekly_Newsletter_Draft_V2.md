## OPENING LETTER

Greetings Eddies!

This is our last newsletter before we sign off for the holidays. We'll be back in January with fresh content, new events, and (probably) strong opinions about whatever the New York Times publishes next.

ICYMI, they dropped another homeschool piece this week. This one claimed that homeschooled kids are ["not all right."](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/opinion/home-school-isolation.html)

The timing was uncanny. We'd been working on a deep dive into unschooling for weeks before their headline landed. [More on that below.](#deep-dive-what-the-times-missed-about-unschooling)

Meanwhile, January community events are shaping up nicely. Once Upon a Time Week has events built around Nancy Drew, Percy Jackson, Harry Potter, and more. We're running our first-ever OpenEd Spelling Bees - three divisions, with swag for the winners.

**And mark your calendars:** Apryl Stott, a bestselling author and illustrator, is joining us for a live event on January 28th.

Have a great holiday. See you in the new year.

-Charlie (the OpenEd newsletter guy)

P.S. Wait - one more thing! The OpenEd Store is live at [store.opened.co](https://store.opened.co/). Everything is sold at cost. We're not trying to make money off merch - we just want you to have cool stuff.

DEEP DIVE: What the Times Missed About Unschooling

Last Sunday, the New York Times just published a guest essay titled, "The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right" - a pretty sweeping claim based on the author's (admittedly awful) experience. Stefan Merrill Block describes a childhood of isolation, a struggling mother, and unmet childhood needs. Understandably, he doesn't want other kids to go through that.

His pain is real. And he makes points worth hearing: isolation can harm children, some kids fall through the cracks, and adults outside the home sometimes see what parents miss.

But then he calls for mandatory registration, assessments, and check-ins for all homeschoolers. This argument rests on a comparison between his experience and a system that would have caught his pain. Teachers who would have noticed. Counselors who would have helped.

That school system doesn't exist.

In his response, Isaac Morehouse points out that this is a good example of the Nirvana Fallacy: comparing a real situation to an imagined ideal. It's worth noting that three weeks before this essay, the same New York Times published another article: "America's Children Are Unwell. Are Schools Part of the Problem?" Their own data showed 1 in 4 teenage boys now diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety spiking as early as age 6.

Peter Gray, a research professor at Boston College, has tracked this for years: every fall when school starts, teen mental health tanks. ER visits for anxiety spike. Psychiatric hospitalizations rise. Summer comes and it improves. When researchers asked teenagers what stresses them out, 83% cited school. Nothing else came close.

As Peter Gray puts it: "Instead of saying, 'We need to fix the schools,' the message is, 'We need to fix the kids.'"

Dr. Claire Honeycutt responded to the NY Times article saying, "The biggest problem in education today is the assumption that there is one perfect way to learn that suits all children everywhere under all conditions. That's never been true. No single school - or education model will fit all kids. The biggest gift we can give future generations is freedom. Freedom to not be confined to a single, failing system. The New York Times doesn't know my children or my neighbor's children. How can they possibly know what's best for my kids? They can't. We were a far better educated country before we tried to strip out all individuation and uniqueness out of our citizenry. Our best teachers leave because they are no longer allowed to fit the way they teach to their classrooms. If you want people to return to public school, make it something worth returning to. Until then, let the parents who are upending their entire lives to be with their children do their work in peace.
They are not the problem."

Our message to parents is simpler: you don't have to be a perfect parent to do better than the status quo if school is failing your kid.

If rigid one-size-fits-all schooling represents one end of the spectrum, unschooling represents the other. Like any approach, it can be done well or poorly. But with a safe, supportive environment, you might be surprised how little coercion and formal curriculum is required to let your kid thrive.

So what does unschooling look like when it's done right?

Amanda Schenkenberger, an OpenEd mom and homeschool coach recently interviewed on Fox News, put it simply: "Unschooling is pursuing a level of learning and following my kids' lead to what they're curious about and diving deeply into the subject as long as their curiosity is alive about it."

As OpenEd students, her boys take Oregon's required standardized tests and score in the top 10 percent nationally. But test scores aren't really the point. The real argument for unschooling is that kids who drive their own learning actually want to learn - and that changes everything.

PODCAST HIGHLIGHT: She Did Everything Right - Her Daughter Still Couldn't Read

Janssen Bradshaw (@everydayreading) had every advantage. Former librarian. English major. She read aloud to her kids daily and had thousands of books in her home.

Her first daughter tested at a 12th grade reading level in kindergarten.

Her second daughter was barely at grade level in first grade - and drifting lower.

"It was not like she was not smart," Janssen told Ela, "But learning to read is just really hard for some kids."

What followed was a transformation. Janssen discovered what researcher Benjamin Bloom called the "Two Sigma Problem" - students who receive one-on-one tutoring outperform 98% of students taught in regular classrooms. The solution wasn't more hours or harder curriculum. It was 25-minute sessions, four times a week, meeting her daughter exactly where she was.

By fifth grade, her daughter was reading at an 11th-grade level.

When Janssen asked her daughter if she was embarrassed about needing extra help, she said: "Why would I be embarrassed that something was hard for me? And then I worked really hard and now I'm awesome at it."

That approach became Savvy Learning - an intensive "high dosage" tutoring program (delivered in small doses) now available in the OpenEd Marketplace.

TRENDS WE'RE FOLLOWING

The Times Does a 180 - Three weeks before publishing their homeschool piece, the New York Times Magazine ran "America's Children Are Unwell. Are Schools Part of the Problem?" One in four seventeen-year-old boys now diagnosed with ADHD. Autism diagnoses went from 1 in 2,500 in the 1980s to 1 in 31 today. Anxiety diagnoses in 32% of adolescents - median onset age of six. Peter Gray, quoted in the piece: "Instead of saying, 'We need to fix the schools,' the message is, 'We need to fix the kids.'" (NYT Magazine)

Readers Are Now the Minority - Essayist Paul Graham shares data: "Readers used to outnumber non-readers 2 to 1. Now non-readers outnumber readers 3 to 1." That's a complete inversion. Hard to imagine a shift that big not showing up everywhere. (Paul Graham)

Parents Want Skills, Not Just Scores - EdChoice polling finds 85% of parents rate "durable skills" - communication, critical thinking, teamwork, adaptability - as extremely or very important. 45% say a school's emphasis on these makes a "significant" impact on enrollment. Meanwhile, 73% of school parents now support Education Savings Accounts. (EdChoice)

Teachers and Students See Different Realities - 92% of students say engaging lessons make school more enjoyable, but only 63% say they feel "highly engaged." There's a 20-point gap between what students report and what teachers perceive. The report's conclusion: engagement isn't optional - it's a precondition for learning. (The 74)

The 8-Hour Day Is Made Up - We talk a lot about how the six-hour school day is an artifact of the factory model. But what about the eight-hour workday? Organizational psychologist Adam Grant: "The 8-hour work day was not ordained from above for all time. It was dreamed up by humans. We can be as productive and creative in 6 focused hours as in 8 unfocused hours." Anyone who's watched their kid finish "a full day of school" in two hours at home already knows this. (Adam Grant)

Go back and study the parts you stumbled on. Then try again. Four steps: choose a topic, explain it simply, identify gaps, revise. Works for parents learning alongside their kids and for kids tackling something new. (Educated and Free)

From the Podcast: Janssen's Favorite Read-Alouds

The Penderwicks series - five books about four sisters that her kids have listened to "15 or 20 times, maybe more." They call each other by the characters' names. Nanny Piggins - an outrageously weird Australian series for kids who like Wayside School or Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle. And for screen-free listening, she recommends the Yoto Player.
