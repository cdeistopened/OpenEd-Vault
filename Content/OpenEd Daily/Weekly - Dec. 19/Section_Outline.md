## DEEP DIVE: What the Times Missed About Unschooling

**Two articles woven together:**
1. "Your Kids Will Be Alright (What the New York Times Misses About 'Unschooling')" - https://opened.co/blog/you-can-do-this-what-the-new-york-times-misses-about-unschooling
2. "Unschooling: A Guide to Child-Led, Interest-Driven Learning" (the definitive guide)

Key angles to weave:
- NYT published "Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right" - but conflated unschooling with neglect
- Stefan Merrill Block's experience was isolation and enmeshment, not child-led learning
- Real unschooling is about EXPANSION, not contraction
- Nirvana Fallacy: comparing real homeschool to idealized school system
- Data: legally homeschooled students 40% less likely to die by abuse/neglect (Williams 2017)
- Peter Gray research: teen mental health improves every May, crashes every August
- 83% of teens cite school as their top stressor
- John Holt's original vision vs. what Block experienced
- North Star Teens, Liberated Learners, microschools embracing self-directed learning
- Unschooling vs. Deschooling distinction
- Amanda Schenkenberger's kids: unschooled, test in top 10% nationally

Key quotes:
- "Children learn from anything and everything they see. They learn wherever they are, not just in special learning places." - John Holt
- "Unschooling is pursuing a level of learning and following my kids' lead to what they're curious about" - Amanda Schenkenberger
- "You don't like school? Don't go back. Don't ever go back in the building." - Kenneth Danford, North Star

## PODCAST HIGHLIGHT: She Did Everything Right - Her Daughter Still Couldn't Read

**Guest:** Janssen Bradshaw (Everyday Reading, Savvy Learning co-founder)
**URL:** https://opened.co/blog/child-struggling-to-read-what-actually-works

The moment: Janssen had every advantage - former librarian, 2,000-5,000 books at home, English major mom. First daughter tested 12th grade reading level in kindergarten. Second daughter? Barely grade level, drifting lower.

Key quotes:
- "My second daughter is extremely bright. It was not like she was not smart. But learning to read is just really hard for some kids."
- "Why would I be embarrassed that something was hard for me? And then I worked really hard and now I'm awesome at it." (daughter's response)
- Benjamin Bloom's "Two Sigma Problem": tutored students outperform 98% of classroom-taught students

Transformation: Barely grade level in 1st grade to 11th grade reading level by 5th grade

The solution: 25-minute sessions, 4x/week, consistent personalized instruction (became Savvy Learning)
