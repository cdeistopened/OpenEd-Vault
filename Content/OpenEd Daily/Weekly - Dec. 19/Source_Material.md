# The Definitive Guide to Unschooling

Preview: The New York Times showed us an example of unschooling gone wrong. But what does it look like when it’s done right?

Greetings Eddies!

On Tuesday we responded to the New York Times latest piece on homeschooling, “[The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/opinion/home-school-isolation.html).” Today, we go deeper.

The timing really was uncanny. We'd been working on this guide for weeks before the Times published their headline. But the confusion in that piece - between unschooling and neglect, between one person's story and millions of families' reality - made us realize how much this guide is needed.

The Times showed us what unschooling looks like when it goes wrong. Today we show you what it looks like when it's done right.

What is unschooling, actually? 

How is it different from deschooling? 

Is it just letting kids run wild, or is there something more deliberate going on? 

This deep dive covers all of it - from John Holt's original vision to what families are doing right now at places like North Star Teens in Massachusetts. 

We talk to former teachers, neuroscientists, and parents who've been in the trenches. 

Let's dive in.

# Unschooling: A Guide to Child-Led, Interest-Driven Learning

When Dr. Phil devoted an episode to what he called ["the fastest growing trend in American education"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S98fZa6Bh1Y), the comments section exploded.

<embed YT video>

The segment featured a family on a farm where children learn by building fairy villages, managing fires, and caring for livestock. No curriculum. No grades. No classroom.

"Educational neglect!" some viewers cried. "Save these children!"

But then the teachers started showing up.

"I'm a former public school teacher with a Master's Degree in Education," wrote one. "I left teaching in 2021... and I believe without a doubt that unschooling is the future of education."

Another: "We live in a day and age where information is free... It's up to us as parents to take our children's education into our own hands."

This is the debate millions of families are walking into. One side sees chaos and irresponsibility. The other sees freedom and common sense. The tension itself reveals how deeply our assumptions about education run - and how quickly they're being questioned.

This approach goes by many names - unschooling, deschooling, self-directed education, natural learning. At OpenEd, we use the term **open education** to describe the broader category: families stepping outside the industrial-conveyor-belt school model to build learning pathways that actually fit their children (using whatever combination of resources is available).

Unschooling is one powerful approach within that framework. To understand whether it's right for your family, it helps to distinguish between the philosophy, the transition process, and what it looks like in practice.

## What is Unschooling?

In the 1970s, an educator named John Holt noticed something that bothered him. The students who learned the most weren't the ones who sat still and followed instructions. They were the ones who couldn't stop asking questions - the "problem" kids, the ones who got bored, the ones who wanted to touch everything and wander off-topic.

Holt started to wonder if the problem wasn't the kids but rather the system. He spent the rest of his career advocating for what he called "unschooling" - an approach where children direct their own learning based on their natural interests, questions, and real-world experiences. As Holt wrote, "Children learn from anything and everything they see. They learn wherever they are, not just in special learning places."

Not every child struggles in traditional school. But for those who do, the data is striking. Dr. Peter Gray, a research professor at Boston College, has tracked a pattern: every year, teen mental health improves in late May when school ends. Emergency room visits for anxiety and mood disorders drop. Psychiatric hospitalizations decline. Then August hits, school starts, and it all comes roaring back. When researchers asked teenagers what stresses them out, 83% cited school. Nothing else came close.

Holt became one of the leading voices in the modern homeschooling movement, and unschooling flourished in that setting because parents have total freedom to follow their child's lead. But the philosophy is increasingly showing up in places traditionally associated with more structure.

Self-directed learning centers like [North Star Teens](https://northstarteens.org/) in Massachusetts have operated on unschooling principles for nearly 30 years. The [Liberated Learners](https://liberatedlearners.net/) network has spawned similar centers worldwide. Microschools are embracing child-led approaches too - from democratic [Sudbury schools](https://sudburyschool.com/) to entrepreneurial [Acton Academies](https://www.actonacademy.org/), from Montessori-inspired [Wildflower Schools](https://wildflowerschools.org/) to the micro-pod model of [Prenda](https://prendaschool.com/).

And within open education, families blend unschooling with other methods - following their child's lead in some areas while providing more structure in others.

The core premise: children are born curious. Given the right environment and support, they will learn what they need to know. Often more deeply, more enthusiastically, and more permanently than they would through forced instruction.

## Unschooling vs. Neglect

Critics sometimes conflate unschooling with educational neglect. [A December 2025 New York Times essay brought this confusion into sharp relief](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/opinion/home-school-isolation.html). The author, novelist Stefan Merrill Block, described being "unschooled" by his mother in the 1990s - but what he actually experienced was isolation and enmeshment with a parent in crisis, not child-led learning.

Block's mother kept him home alone while she processed her own struggles. He spent his days with her - not exploring interests, not engaging with community, not following curiosity into the world. He was isolated from peers, exposed to online predators, and used to fill his mother's emotional void.

This is a tragedy. But it's not unschooling.

John Holt's vision was the opposite of isolation. Holt advocated for *expanding* a child's world - connecting them with mentors, community, real-world experiences, and their own curiosity. "Children learn from anything and everything they see," he wrote. "They learn wherever they are, not just in special learning places."

Real unschooling looks like:

- A child obsessed with Minecraft discovering programming, which leads to math
- A teenager at North Star Teens designing courses and teaching them to peers
- A family following their daughter's passion for horses into biology, business, and writing

What Block experienced - a contracted world, a dependent relationship, no connection to community - is the opposite. His pain is real. But unschooling didn't cause it. A struggling parent did.

The distinction matters. Unschooling is about trusting children to direct their learning while *supporting* them with resources, mentors, and access to the world. It's about expansion, not contraction. Critics who conflate the two do a disservice to both the children who suffered genuine neglect and the families practicing genuine unschooling.

[Amanda Schenkenberger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8jCQcIZQWc), an OpenEd mom and homeschool coach in Oregon, put it simply: "Unschooling is pursuing a level of learning and following my kids' lead to what they're curious about and diving deeply into the subject as long as their curiosity is alive about it." 

<embed YT video>

Her boys do take standardized tests - Oregon requires them - and they score in the top 10 percent nationally. 

"It's very interesting," she says. "When you allow your child to lead their learning, what they're being tested on does come along with this."

## Unschooling vs. Deschooling

These terms get tangled together, but they describe different things.

**Unschooling** is an ongoing approach - how you educate long-term.

**Deschooling** is what happens first. It's the transition period when a child (and often their parents) unlearns the habits and assumptions picked up from traditional schooling.

The term comes from philosopher Ivan Illich's 1971 book *Deschooling Society*. But today, homeschooling families use it more practically: it's what happens when kids leave school and need time to decompress.

Kristin and Ginger, former teachers who now run [SKOLA](https://opened.co/podcast) - a nature-based microschool in Minnesota - discovered this applied to them too. "Just like there had to be some undoing for us, there is this undoing process" for students, they explain. Their rule of thumb: "For however many years you're in a system, it's going to take that many months to actually shed everything off before you can rebuild it back up." After 16 years of teaching, Kristin gave herself 18 months to unlearn her own assumptions about what education should look like.

John Taylor Gatto understood why this matters. He taught in New York City public schools for 30 years and won Teacher of the Year two years in a row. The second time he won, he accepted his nomination and resigned - in the pages of the New York Times. He wrote that he felt like he was doing more harm than good.

In his book *Dumbing Us Down*, Gatto identified the "secondary lessons" of schooling - the implicit curriculum baked into how school is structured, regardless of what's officially being taught. Your success depends on pleasing authority. You must wait for permission to speak, move, or use the bathroom. Your worth is measured by test scores. Learning happens in 50-minute increments - when the bell rings, stop thinking about math, start thinking about history.

[Hannah Frankman](https://opened.co/podcast), founder of Rebel Educator, calls deschooling "unlearning all the bad habits you picked up in school." Being passive instead of taking initiative. Waiting for permission instead of acting. Deferring to authority instead of trusting your own judgment. Learning to the test instead of learning to *do* something. Doing the bare minimum instead of caring about outcomes.

A common guideline in the homeschooling community: one month of deschooling for every year spent in traditional school. During this time, kids often sleep more, play more, and show zero interest in anything "academic." This terrifies parents. But advocates argue it's a necessary reset - the system has to clear before something new can grow.

Even kids who never set foot in a classroom absorb these lessons. "We live in a very schooled society," Frankman says. "I was homeschooled from first grade through 12th, and I still had all kinds of mindsets I had to unlearn."

## The Unschooling "Curriculum"

So what do unschoolers actually *do* all day? The honest answer: it depends on the kid. The "curriculum" is whatever captures their attention - a library card, a YouTube rabbit hole, a broken lawnmower engine, an obsession with ancient Rome. The learning emerges from living.

Some families do this entirely on their own. Others find community at self-directed learning centers - places that offer structure without coercion.

[Kenneth Danford](https://opened.co/podcast) has been running North Star Teens in western Massachusetts for 29 years. When a struggling teenager shows up at his door, he says something that shocks them:

"You don't like school? Don't go back. Don't ever go back in the building. Send someone in to get your books."

North Star functions like a gym or social club - attendance is encouraged but optional. There are no grades, no transcripts, no roll call, and no diploma. Members can take classes in history, math, writing, or the arts. They can get rigorous one-on-one tutoring. Or they can show up, grab a bowl of ramen, curl up on the couch, and read.

"You're accountable to yourself," Danford tells them. "Is this the life you want?"

Most who seek refuge at North Star have good reason. They might be on the autism spectrum and need a calmer environment. Perhaps they've been bullied, and don't feel safe at school. Or they're just your "non-conformist, skateboarder-poet-musician kids who roll their eyes at school," as Danford puts it. "We tend not to get your football player, cheerleader, sports team kids who want to be popular. But we get all the kids they pick on."

One recent arrival, Marley Bernstein, had missed 120 days of school the previous year due to bullying her school couldn't stop. At North Star, she found something different. "I feel better being here," she said. "You can walk around, you can kind of do whatever you want and not have to look over your shoulder every two minutes."

Beneath the apparent freedom, there's often quiet purpose. Students write and produce plays at local theaters. They take service learning trips to Washington, D.C. They design courses and teach them to each other - last year, young people taught three different classes on Dungeons & Dragons.

"Just take the year, breathe, wonder what you should be doing," Danford advises. "Meanwhile we're gonna unlock the door and give you a couch - and we'll be nice to you. Turns out that's really healthy and responsible."

## Is Unschooling Right for Your Family? Structure With Flexibility

Not everyone agrees that extended deschooling or radical unschooling is the answer.

Jean Lee is a neuroscientist who homeschools her own children and runs the Academy of Chaos, where she helps other families design their education. She's not anti-unschooling - but she's skeptical of long breaks.

"If you take too long of a break, it's a nightmare to get them back on track," Lee warns. "Everybody's fighting, and nobody wants to do the work. Kids function better when they have a schedule and clear expectations. They feel safer knowing their boundaries."

Lee advocates for what she calls "structure with flexibility." She plans out the entire year in one weekend, mapping every lesson - but builds in so much buffer that she can take spontaneous snow days without guilt. Her kids have their own logins to see their schedule and check off work. Even her four-year-old.

"It is your responsibility to own this, not your parents'," she tells her students. "They don't have the instructions - it's yours."

The apparent contradiction dissolves when you realize: unschooling and structure aren't opposites. The question is who's driving. In Lee's model, kids own their education - they just have a map.

When her daughter found an insect she needed to identify, they stopped everything. "This is not a life or death situation," Lee thought. They used Google Lens, inspected the bug, and talked about it the whole drive. That spontaneity is possible *because* of the structure, not despite it.

This flexibility matters when gaps appear. In our OpenEd Slack community recently, a teacher named Stacy asked: "Does anyone have a good recommendation for a spelling and writing curriculum for a 4th grader with ADHD, who has mostly been unschooled up until now?" Within minutes, other families and teachers weighed in with resources that had worked for their kids. Unschooling doesn't mean you can never add structure - it means you add it when *your child* needs it, not when the calendar says so.

## Unschooling Within Open Education

Most families don't adopt unschooling as a rigid philosophy. They treat it as one tool among many - following their child's lead in some areas while adding structure where it helps.

A child obsessed with Minecraft discovers programming, which leads to math. A child passionate about horses learns biology, business, and writing without anyone calling it "school." The academics emerge when children are engaged and supported.

OpenEd exists to remove the financial barriers that make this kind of learning hard. When your child's passion for astronomy leads to wanting a telescope - OpenEd can fund it. When their obsession with coding calls for a specialized tutor - covered. When they're ready for a pottery class, a robotics camp, or a trip to a living history museum - we're here. No requirement to follow a particular curriculum. No standardized testing mandates. Just support for building the education that fits your child.

## FAQ: The Practicalities

**Is unschooling legal?**
Yes. Unschooling is a form of homeschooling, which is legal in all 50 U.S. states. Regulations vary by state - some require portfolios and standardized testing, others require nothing. The [Home School Legal Defense Association](https://hslda.org/legal) maintains a state-by-state guide.

**How do unschoolers get into college?**
Many paths exist. Some pursue GEDs. Others build portfolios of projects and real-world experiences. Community college transcripts can demonstrate academic readiness. Colleges are increasingly seeking students who show genuine passion and initiative rather than just good grades. A [study by Peter Gray and Gina Riley](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/hc_pubs/480/) found that 83% of grown unschoolers said the approach gave them an advantage in higher education.

**Is this only for wealthy families?**
Historically, alternative education has had financial barriers. This is exactly the gap OpenEd was created to fill - providing funding so that interest-led learning is accessible to everyone, not just families who can afford to pay out of pocket.

## Your Kids Will Be Alright (What the New York Times Misses About ‘Unschooling’) | OpenEd (1)

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e31168e49f5b7e6f76f0e5/6941925e20d0e9e17742edc2_2.png)

The New York Times just published a new editorial piece on homeschooling. It's not surprising that they're paying attention. Homeschooling is the fastest-growing form of education in the United States, and shows no signs of slowing down.

We [previously responded](https://opened.co/blog/what-the-new-york-times-got-wrong-about-homeschooling) when the Times painted homeschoolers with a broad brush after attending the Great Homeschool Convention. Once again, the title of their latest piece makes a sweeping claim - "[Home-schooled Kids Are Not Alright](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/opinion/home-school-isolation.html?unlocked_article_code=1.808.Azdd.BZ3gmS5H8p0a&smid=nytcore-ios-share)" - based on one author's experience. The author likely didn't write that title, but the piece deserves a response—if only for the title itself.

The essay describes a painful childhood. The author was kept isolated at home by a struggling mother, with his emotional needs unmet. He calls for mandatory registration, assessments, and check-ins for all homeschoolers.

His pain is real. And he makes points worth considering: that isolation can harm children, that some kids fall through the cracks, and that adults outside the home can sometimes see what parents miss.

But when he compares his experience to an imagined school system where mandated reporters catch every struggling child, where teachers notice every cry for help, he's committing what philosophers call the Nirvana Fallacy. He's comparing a real situation to a non-existent ideal.

We went to our community for responses. But first, I want to share a bit of my own experience.

I was homeschooled in the 80s and 90s in Michigan, back when it still carried a strong stigma.

My mom wanted a highly structured, rigorous curriculum for us. She didn't manage it. She tried - who knows how many books she purchased at curriculum fairs - but she was raising three stubborn kids while caring for a disabled husband. Between the ages of 4 and 13, roughly half of my time was spent playing with LEGO. My mom felt guilty about this.

But at the same time, my world was expanding. I had church, sports, jobs starting at age 10, and a community around me. I wasn't isolated. I was engaged with the real world in ways my traditionally-schooled peers weren't. From the outside, it might have looked pretty unstructured academically. It was the best thing that could have happened to me.

## **Compared to What?**

When analyzing any system or outcome, the most important question is: compared to what?

Three weeks before this essay, the New York Times Magazine published a very different article titled, “[America's Children Are Unwell. Are Schools Part of the Problem?](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/24/magazine/youth-mental-health-crisis-schools.html)" Their own data showed that 1 in 4 teenage boys are now diagnosed with ADHD, and anxiety is spiking as early as age 6.

To their credit, they even quoted unschooling advocate [Peter Gray](https://www.petergray.org/), a research professor at Boston College, who diagnoses the problem: "What's happening is, instead of saying, 'We need to fix the schools,' the message is, 'We need to fix the kids.'"

[Gray has tracked a pattern for years](https://opened.co/blog/every-august-youth-mental-health-crises-spike-every-june-they-plummet-its-not-a-coincidence): every fall when school starts, teen mental health deteriorates. Emergency room visits for anxiety spike. Psychiatric hospitalizations rise. Then summer comes and it all improves. When researchers asked teenagers what stresses them out, 83% cited school. Nothing else came close.

My co-founder Matt Bowman watched his own daughter face this struggle. During her junior year at a traditional high school, she confided in her parents:

"My friends are all on anxiety medication for tests," she told them. "The pressure is crazy. I'm forgetting stuff."

She left school, enrolled in OpenEd's early college program, got an associate degree, kept playing three sports with her friends, and thrived.

The concern isn't just about mental health - it's about basic academic outcomes too. School choice advocate [Corey DeAngelis puts the real bar for comparison in perspective](https://opened.co/blog/fund-families-not-systems-corey-deangelis-on-the-parent-revolution): "Chicago has dozens of schools with zero percent math proficiency rates.”

In other words, the actual school system is failing millions of kids.

“You can do better than zero percent,” DeAngelis reminds parents who might be reluctant to attempt something outside the status quo.

However, the author's central concern about children falling through the cracks deserves a serious response. Abuse does happen in homeschool settings. It also happens in schools - at significant rates.

[Brian Ray](https://nheri.org/about/), founder of the National Home Education Research Institute, has [reviewed every major study on this question](https://nheri.org/homeschool-abuse-and-neglect-research/). His conclusion: "At this point, there is little evidence that public schooled or private schooled children are abused, neglected, or otherwise maltreated at any higher or lower rate than the homeschooled."

A [2022 study by Ray and Shakeel](https://nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/) using a nationally representative sample found that "demographics - not school type - explain differences in abuse and neglect." The maltreatment that did occur among homeschooled children mostly happened outside the home, not by family members.

Another study found that "legally homeschooled students are 40% less likely to die by child abuse or neglect than the average student nationally." ([Williams 2017](https://nheri.org/what-research-says-about-public-school-private-school-and-homeschool-child-abuse-neglect-and-fatalities/))

Ray also found [no relationship](https://nheri.org/what-research-says-about-public-school-private-school-and-homeschool-child-abuse-neglect-and-fatalities/) between the degree of state regulation of homeschooling and the rate of abuse or neglect. (2018)

Meanwhile, [education researcher Charol Shakeshaft](https://nheri.org/homeschool-abuse-and-neglect-research/) estimates that 5.6 million public and private school students experience sexual misconduct by a school employee sometime between kindergarten and 12th grade. A study this year by Williams et al. noted: "Despite the fact that students in public schools are surrounded daily by mandatory reporters of suspected abuse and neglect, there appears to be no protective effect."

We're not weighing in on what homeschool requirements should be - that's up to every state, and some already have stricter requirements than others. But the data don't support the assumption that more oversight of homeschooling automatically means safer kids.

In fact, the fear of oversight can itself become a barrier to good parenting. Peter Gray, writing in his Substack [Play Makes Us Human](https://petergray.substack.com/p/parents-fear-of-cps-is-a-major-deterrent), has documented how fear of Child Protective Services deters parents from giving their children healthy independence:

"As a parent of young kids, it's very disheartening," one parent told him. "I'm more afraid of random neighbors calling CPS than I am of actual kidnappers or car crashes."

When the default assumption is distrust - when parents feel watched - something predictable happens. They stop letting their kids play outside. They stop taking educational risks. They recreate school at home: the same curriculum, the same schedule, the same pressure. And that can have its own damaging effects.

## The Range of Options

Parents are usually in the best position to direct their children's education. It’s best to give families permission to think of education as a more open process of discovery - regardless of how it is delivered, and by whom.

Matt Beaudreau runs [Apogee](https://apogeestrong.com/), a network of microschools and mentors serving families who might traditionally have been classified as homeschoolers. Students attend anywhere from one to five days a week, with the rest of their learning happening at home or in the community.

"What's more likely," Beaudreau asks, "a stranger choosing what's best for somebody, a government choosing what's best, or that person's parent?"

Parents are the most incentivized party to get this right. You know your child better than any bureaucrat checking boxes on a form.

As Corey DeAngelis puts it: "You don't need a teaching degree to know what's best for your child's education."

Cassie Shepherd writes at [Home-Centered Learning](https://www.homecenteredlearning.com/), a blog that has inspired countless parents to take the leap. Her story plays out in millions of families across the country - a school that wasn't serving her children well, twins whose light was going out, and a family that didn't know alternatives existed.

"I was like, 'No way, that's not even what I'm considering'," [Cassie recalls when a neighbor first mentioned homeschooling](https://youtu.be/1bboqTABn9c?si=21QlshPPyRnCaxcM). But the neighbor walked her through the options, pulled curriculum off the shelves, and showed her what was possible. "It was this immense relief of - I see something that is a different path that might work for us."

She pulled her twins out of first grade in November 2019 after meeting with the principal. "They are good people and they're working and doing hard things," she says, "but there's a lot of needs and your child is one of many."

The principal told her directly: "I can't change what you want. I wish I could."

"The second we brought them home, their lights went back on and they've thrived ever since."

## **You're Not Alone**

But giving yourself permission doesn't mean doing this alone.

[Laura Feller, an OpenEd parent, remembers the early days:](https://youtu.be/1zfEhRJq_sI) "In the beginning it was overwhelming and scary. Can I help him? Do I have the ability? Do I have the resources? Am I enough?"

Her answer: "Yes. Yes, I am enough to help him. My husband is enough. As a family, we are enough - because we don't have to do it on our own. We have a community. We have resources in the community that can help us manage and find the pathway that's best for him."

The infrastructure for homeschooling has never been stronger. There are curricula that don't require much teaching. Co-ops where kids go a few days a week. Hybrid programs like OpenEd that work with public schools to provide standards without standardization - so a parent who feels overwhelmed can get help where they need it.

Michael B. Horn, a leading voice on education innovation, [describes what's happening across the country](https://youtu.be/3LawkB1Jkl8?si=xRPYzBLOzyMEEDgf): "Parents increasingly are not putting up with one size fits all. They're making lots of different choices. Some are going to the microschool for everything. Some are saying, 'We'll take a little bit from here, go here for the sports, take this tutor' - cobbling it together."

Meanwhile, there are an increasing number of virtual programs that combine instruction with community - like [Recess](https://recess.gg/).

[Ben Somers founded Recess after his own difficult experience in traditional school](https://opened.co/blog/the-school-to-prescription-pipeline-ben-somers-on-how-we-medicate-kids-who-dont-fit-the-mold). At age 11, he was put on 70 milligrams of stimulants because he was a "foot tapper and wiggler." Now he's building community infrastructure so homeschool families never have to feel isolated.

"I can imagine a version [of school] that's much better," he says.

So can we.

Not every parent will pull their kids out of school completely. But many are discovering they have more options than they realized.

Darryl Stinson, a transformation speaker whose [TED Talk](https://youtu.be/8yBfAeadqjI) has over 2 million views, [shared his first reaction when Matt Bowman suggested](https://opened.co/blog/kids-skipped-school) he could pull his kids out of school for educational travel.

"Is that even allowed?"

He couldn't wrap his mind around it. But he couldn't unhear it either.

"What if there was a different way?" he started asking.

His kids missed almost a hundred days of school that year. They still had good grades. They were still student council leaders. They traveled, listened to sales calls in the car, started thinking like entrepreneurs.

"Now my daughter starts a new business every 90 days," Darryl says. "They're expressed, they're learning, and they see that they have a say in their future."

I am sorry for the difficulties the author of the Times essay experienced as a child. I won't claim to know what his childhood did or didn't give him.

But I know what mine gave me.

If I could go back, the only change I'd make is doing even less "academic" stuff and even more of everything else - working, sports, building things. Those years of playing Lego and freedom that may have looked inadequate gave me skills that now help me run an education company serving thousands of families navigating this same journey.

His story matters. So do the stories of kids struggling in schools and their parents who are building something better.

To the millions of parents considering a more open approach to education: Your "home-school kids" will be fine. The resources exist. The community exists. And as long as you keep showing up for your kids, they will be more than alright.

**Greetings Eddies!**

I drafted today's "Trend" segment late last week, praising the New York Times for it's honest reporting and hard-hitting question in a magazine article, "[America's Children Are Unwell. Are Schools Part of the Problem?](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/24/magazine/youth-mental-health-crisis-schools.html)"

Then, yesterday, they published a guest essay titled, "[Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/opinion/home-school-isolation.html?unlocked_article_code=1.808.Azdd.BZ3gmS5H8p0a&smid=nytcore-ios-share)"

Three weeks apart, two very different perspectives.

We're working on a more detailed response to the new piece, collecting stories from our community about what open education truly looks like (stay tuned).

But in the meantime, let's talk about whiteboards.

Let's dive in.

**THOUGHT**: The Whiteboard Exercise
‍TR**END:** 1 in 2,500 to 1 in 31
‍TOOL**: Wr**itey the Whiteboard

# The Whiteboard Exercise

After being homeschooled his entire life, Isaac Morehouse's 16-year-old son said he wanted to try traditional school.

So Isaac got out a whiteboard and ask, "What do you actually want?"

His son listed it out:

- Make money
- Spend time with friends
- Freedom to explore

They mapped the options - homeschool, unschool, private school, public school - and tried to answer one question: where will you get the most of what you want? His son decided to try public school it for a semester. After that, he dropped out to work full-time.

What about college?

"My hope," Isaac said, "is that by the time they're that age, they don't need me making decisions for them."

# 1 in 2,500 to 1 in 31

Last month, The New York Times Magazine published "[America's Children Are Unwell. Are Schools Part of the Problem?](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/24/magazine/youth-mental-health-crisis-schools.html)" 

**The short answer to the title's question: yes.**

**The longer answer: The article traces how No Child Left Behind and Common Core narrowed what counts as "normal" - more testing, more accountability, less recess, less play. By 2016, only eight states required daily recess in elementary schools. The track got narrower. More kids didn't fit. And we called it a disorder.**

- 1 in 4 seventeen-year-old boys diagnosed with ADHD
- Autism diagnoses went from 1 in 2,500 in the 1980s to 1 in 31 today
- 32% of adolescents diagnosed with anxiety - median onset age: 6

The article even quotes Peter Gray saying something almost identical to what [he said recently on the OpenEd Podcast](https://opened.co/blog/every-august-youth-mental-health-crises-spike-every-june-they-plummet-its-not-a-coincidence):

“What’s happening is, instead of saying, ‘We need to fix the schools,’ the message is, ‘We need to fix the kids."

Ela Bass (00:00)
Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm your sometimes host Ela, and today we're joined by Janssen Bradshaw. You probably know her from Everyday Reading, the beloved blog that's become a go-to place for book recommendations and reading inspiration. She's also a mom and co-founder of Savvy Learning, which is live in the OpenEd marketplace.
I'm really curious—in today's world with screens competing for children's attention, how did you help your kids fall in love with reading?
Janssen Bradshaw (00:54)
I grew up with a strong love of reading, and that was really important to me with my own kids. Here's the answer nobody likes: if you have a lot of screens competing, it's hard for books to compete with the dopamine rush of a screen. I say that not just about kids, but for me personally—as phones and television become more part of our lives, I have to work harder to make time for reading.
From when my first child was born, I was thoughtful about screens in our family. I wanted books and reading first, with that strong foundation before they had to compete with screens. My oldest is now 15 and my youngest is almost nine. I love screens—my whole living is made online. I just want to ensure a strong balance, with books first before competing with everything else.
Ela Bass (02:37)
What was your environment like as a kid and now with your family?
Janssen Bradshaw (02:54)
We have a large TV in our basement, but not in our family room. Growing up, the TV wasn't on as background noise. I don't like that—it's overstimulating for me. We turn it on when actually watching something, almost always as a family, not much solo watching.
We have tons of books. Our kids have books in their rooms, a big library bookshelf in our living room, built-in bookshelves, and a huge floor-to-ceiling bookshelf in our playroom. We go to the library a lot. We're a huge audiobook family with Yoto players and Echo Dots for Audible books.
I read aloud to my kids almost every night. Part of our homeschool day—the last part before lunch—is family reading where everybody brings books to the living room and we all read for 30 minutes. That's my favorite part of the day, ensuring I get good reading time as my job has gotten busier.
I was homeschooled from kindergarten until high school. My mom was an English major and huge reader, my dad too. She read tons aloud and individually with all of us as part of our homeschool day. Even in high school, we'd get two copies of a book and read alternating pages—Pride and Prejudice, Picture of Dorian Gray, Tale of Two Cities, Huckleberry Finn. Books that if you hand to a 14-year-old, they might struggle. But with an adult to ensure reasonable pacing and highlight important details, it becomes a positive experience.
Ela Bass (05:42)
Did I hear you say you have a library bookshelf?
Janssen Bradshaw (05:45)
Yes! My husband really doesn't like losing library books. Having one place where they all live—when they come home, you know where they go, and when returning them, you know where they are.
Ela Bass (06:02)
That's brilliant. How many books do you have in your home?
Janssen Bradshaw (06:10)
Easily 2,000 to 5,000. But remember, I'm a book blogger and Instagrammer. I get books from publishers, was an elementary school librarian before kids, attend conferences. My book experience isn't typical because it's so much of my job.
Ela Bass (06:42)
That makes sense. What age did you start introducing books, and how do you handle distractions with multiple children?
Janssen Bradshaw (08:04)
When I read aloud at night, it's everybody together. I choose a book targeting my two middle kids—maybe a step down for my 15-year-old, a stretch for my youngest.
With multiple kids, embrace a little chaos—it won't be a Norman Rockwell painting. One of my best tricks: my kids are almost always doing something while I read. Legos, coloring, Play-Doh, to keep hands busy. I'm the same as an adult—I do dishes, fold laundry, work on puzzles, or walk while listening to audiobooks rather than just sitting. It's hard for kids and adults to just sit and listen.
Ela Bass (09:24)
Do you pair it with activities they already like?
Janssen Bradshaw (09:37)
Yes, like last night I asked, "Does anybody want to color? Get your coloring stuff. You guys do Legos, get them out and we'll clean up when we're done reading." I give them a few minutes to figure out what they'll do while I read.
Ela Bass (09:56)
Have you seen reading impact your family culture?
Janssen Bradshaw (10:03)
Absolutely. My kids have shared identity around specific books and series. The Penderwicks, a five-book series—my kids have listened maybe 15 or 20 times through. I have four girls, this series has four sisters, so they'll call each other by character names or use shorthand referencing characters or phrases.
Another series they love is Nanny Piggins—Australian, outrageously weird. When neighborhood kids play Taboo, they say, "You cannot use Nanny Piggins references because you can make any connection."
I saw similar things growing up with comic strips my family loved. Four or five years ago, my siblings and I visited my parents without spouses or grandkids, just the original six. At breakfast, my mom brought comic books we still had and we sat reading, "Do you remember this one?" Such a fun shared experience from childhood carried into adulthood. I love seeing that for my kids. Kids really love rereading, and audiobooks are great for revisiting favorite stories that become part of who they are, especially when shared with siblings.
Ela Bass (12:23)
I want to touch on your homeschool journey. You were homeschooled—why did you decide to homeschool your children?
Janssen Bradshaw (12:47)
We've done all variations over 10 years. My oldest went part-time to kindergarten—we'd homeschool mornings, she'd go afternoons. At Christmas, she didn't want to go anymore, so we finished the year homeschooling entirely. We did first grade homeschooling.
In second grade, I'd just had my fourth baby, my business was picking up, I felt underwater. We had a good STEM school in our open enrollment district, so she went there for second and third grade—really great experience. Then we moved out of state and all my kids went to public school.
In sixth grade, my oldest was ahead in math. Her teacher suggested an online math class she could do at the back of the classroom. After a few weeks, my daughter asked to do math at home because the timing wasn't syncing well. We got permission for her to go part of the day.
That opened the door to other options. She went part-time in sixth, seventh, and eighth grade, and now in 10th grade still goes part-time.
Two years ago, we lived in a neighborhood with many homeschool families. Over summer lunch, my kids asked, "Could we homeschool next year?" My husband and I felt we had bandwidth—I didn't have tiny babies, my business was more controlled. We're now in the second year and it's been a great fit.
One thing I love about homeschool, which my mom was good about: what you choose now doesn't have to be forever. Right now homeschool might seem like something you want but have no capacity for. You can make different decisions later. Or if you homeschool, you don't have to forever. What's right for one child might not be right for others.
I didn't graduate from high school—I went part-time, didn't get a diploma, took the ACT, went to college and grad school. Not a problem. But all my siblings went full-time and graduated. My mom didn't have an agenda. It was always what's the best fit for you right now, and that can change. I try to have that for our kids too.
Ela Bass (17:57)
What have your kids gotten from these different experiences?
Janssen Bradshaw (18:26)
The biggest thing is ownership of their education. When I was being homeschooled at 40, it was very fringe. Everybody went to the local public school—kindergarten through 12th grade, not much variation.
Now there are so many options. My kids can look around and say, what do I want out of school? What's valuable to me? Whatever you choose will be a lot of work, but we can find an option that's really good for you and pushes you where you are.
My husband and I discuss this constantly. Many people get to college and struggle because it's been lockstep the whole way. Suddenly they have to make decisions—pick a major, decide what to study, what they care about, what they want after school.
I love for my kids to practice making those decisions at a lower level. What do I want to learn this year in fifth or sixth grade? How hard am I going on this language? What AP tests? What careers to explore as a sophomore? So it's not jarring when they get to college with more decision-making control.
Ela Bass (20:18)
How did they become like that? What questions did you ask early on?
Janssen Bradshaw (21:01)
Much is our general family culture. My husband and I both have non-traditional jobs, we've done many things, moved many places. This is the 15th house we've lived in over 20 years of marriage. My husband isn't afraid of change. My job on social media—such a quick-changing landscape—has given me practice.
They see that. As we move, how do we make new friends? Explore new libraries? Learn what's cool about this place? Make it feel like home? That's part of our family culture.
When we talk about homeschool, it's not "the world is your oyster, pick anything." It's "we're doing science—what would you like to learn about in science?" Not "let's not do science." We're doing history—this is what we did last year, what would you like to change?
I have framework, but they have say within that framework. It's not "you're six, tell me your ideal curriculum"—too overwhelming. But they can have say in what interests them.
Just this week, two of my girls were interested in American Sign Language. A neighbor mentioned their niece is deaf and they're learning some sign language. My kids watched YouTube videos, got on the library website, requested books, and asked, "Can you take us to the library after dinner to pick these up? We want to practice more."
That's exactly what I want—for them to feel they have resources and understanding of how to learn more about interests, how to chase down interests. Their understanding that books are a great way to get knowledge to answer questions is part of their fundamental understanding of the world.
Ela Bass (23:27)
It sounds like you read together openly. Your kids grew up watching and benefiting from your love of reading.
Janssen Bradshaw (23:49)
Yes.
Ela Bass (23:54)
What does a day in the life look like now?
Janssen Bradshaw (24:30)
Because my kids are older, they have lots of autonomy. They have charts of things they do every day.
Early morning, they have scheduled classes—Mandarin tutoring because we were in a Mandarin immersion school. When we started homeschooling, I wanted them to keep up their immersion language, so they have a tutor over Zoom. My daughter has Savvy reading and math classes.
Then they have a block of time to figure out what they want to do—what order. When am I doing poetry? Typing practice? It's open-ended time to do things in any order they want, being the driver.
We finish with geography every other day with my husband or history with me, then family reading. So scheduled online things in the morning, free homeschool stuff, then family stuff to end the day.
Ela Bass (25:55)
Was that something you figured out works for your family, or something your mom did?
Janssen Bradshaw (26:12)
We did similar things growing up—"here are things you need to get done, but you drive when and how." Then "here are times I'll work with you."
That also works well because when they're doing their own things, I can work. I work from home, and I work a lot in the afternoon when they're done with school.
Ela Bass (26:37)
You mentioned Savvy, available in the OpenEd marketplace. Why did you start Savvy?
Janssen Bradshaw (26:56)
My oldest daughter learned to read early and well. In kindergarten, she tested at 12th grade reading level. She picked it up really easily. I assumed that's how it would be for all my kids.
My second daughter struggled a lot. I started working with her at two or three on letters and sounds, same as my oldest. It wasn't clicking. I thought, do I need to be worried? Is this too early? Is this normal? It's hard to tell when your other child was so far ahead.
In first grade, halfway through, her teacher said at parent-teacher conference, "She's barely at grade level, the very lowest we can call grade level. She's drifting farther down every time. At this trajectory, by year's end, she'll be quite a bit behind."
If you know about reading, those are crucial years. If you get to end of third grade and aren't a competent reader, most kids never catch up. The first couple years are "learn to read," then it's "read to learn." I thought, yikes.
Okay, someone who looks at lots of kids and knows benchmarks is saying there's a problem. That was a slap in the face—if we don't change something, this will become bigger.
I was already seeing that. My second daughter is extremely bright. It wasn't that she wasn't smart. Learning to read is just really hard for some kids. For her, it was difficult, making her feel dumb, which wasn't true. She was starting to disengage from school because it was hard.
The teacher recommended she work with a tutor—actually just an intern, a college student. She'd come in one-on-one for a bit each day. Within weeks, we saw major progress with individualized help.
Then COVID hit, everything shut down. The second week, the teacher emailed saying the intern still wanted hours and could do the same thing online.
My daughter was resistant to working with me or my husband—she'd get frustrated easily. But she'd get on with this young intern, maybe 19 or 22—this was not engaging or exciting, just a white screen with black words, practicing words. She'd get on with no complaint.
That summer at my parents', she was swimming. I said, "Come in, time to do this." She just got out of the pool and got on with her, no resistance. She was making so much progress so quickly.
I mentioned this online on Instagram—that we were doing this and she was making progress. People said, "Can you put me in contact with her? Would she take other students?" I said, this is so low level, I can't tell you how not exciting this is.
But as my husband and I saw what great progress she was making with someone not us—15 to 20 minutes a day, so consistent—she was making huge strides. We thought, there's something here and people are interested.
There's a guy my husband worked with at Intel. His wife was a reading instructor. During COVID she'd been helping neighborhood kids with reading. Jeremy, the husband, thought they could scale this. Both husbands were having similar experiences.
They'd get on calls every couple months to discuss startups and what seemed interesting. Jeremy said, "Amy's onto something. She has a master's, she's in teaching reading. If we could make this available to more kids." My husband said, "Actually, I have a vision because we're seeing these 20-25 minute classes with personalized instruction right at your level."
We started working on that in June 2020 and launched fall 2020. Within months. I got on my blog and Instagram saying, "We're launching this program, opening pre-sales." We thought if we get 10 people to sign up, it's probably worth doing. If 20 people, we're really in business.
We had more than 100 people sign up. We've done lots of businesses—most don't take off like that. We thought, whoa, there's real interest. Within weeks of launching, we got rave reviews like, "My kid cried and screamed about any reading practice, but they get on Savvy and love it. They're making progress, picking up books on their own for the first time, saying this is fun."
It was magical—we realized there's really something here. We've been running Savvy five years now. We have Savvy Math also. We've expanded grades.
I get lots of feedback, but no messages are like Savvy messages where people say, "This changed my child's life."
If you cannot read, all of school—you feel stupid, behind, like school isn't for you. You disengage. When you start feeling "I can do this, I can learn this"—that's life changing. To be part of that has been so special.
We saw that with our own daughter. A couple years ago, someone asked, "Does this embarrass your daughter for you to talk about her hard time reading?" I asked her—she was in fourth grade, eight or nine—"Is this embarrassing? Are you okay with me sharing this?"
She said, "Why would I be embarrassed that something was hard for me? And then I worked really hard and now I'm awesome at it."
That is what you want. Not that something hard crushes you, but you run into something hard and conquer it. It's one thing for a parent or teacher to say, "You're smart, you can do hard things." It's another for a child to know "This was really hard and I fully conquered it."
In fifth grade, she tested at 11th grade reading level. This isn't me telling her how smart she is. She knows 100% with certainty and proof she can do hard things. If things are hard, that doesn't mean she gives up or can never get good at it. She has more confidence than she'd have without that challenge.
To see that not just for her but for thousands and thousands of other kids—I mean, it's been so cool. I feel so lucky.
Ela Bass (36:04)
So rewarding.
Janssen Bradshaw (36:06)
Really is. What could I be doing that makes more difference than this, that affects the trajectory of your whole life?
Ela Bass (36:14)
So interesting and beautiful that you started with books, loved books, then had a daughter who struggled with reading, and now you build this company. Very full circle—you help her do what you love. It's so aligned with who you are.
What makes Savvy so good for students? What makes it different? This is usually one of those challenges—math and reading are the two areas where it's like, I just cannot get through this. What about Savvy breaks through?
Janssen Bradshaw (37:14)
Number one thing about Savvy: it meets you where you are. That's hard in a class. No matter how good the teacher, if you have 25 or 30 kids, it's almost impossible to meet every kid where they are. Every kid is at a different level.
For Savvy, you're having reading or math instruction right where you are. Our goal is to hit that perfect mark—if it's too easy, it's boring, you're checked out. If it's too hard, you're also checked out, too frustrated, you give up.
You want it just at that spot with just enough challenge. Think of skiing. If you're a medium skier, you don't want the bunny hill—boring. But don't put me on a double black diamond—no chance, probably going to die. I want just the hill giving me just enough challenge to feel fun, pushing myself a little, but easy enough I can do it without getting really hurt or frustrated.
Savvy does that really well—meeting you exactly where you are, always in that flow where it's engaging and you want to keep doing it without tapping out because you're bored or frustrated. That's number one.
Two, it's so interactive. Kids love attention. Having a teacher there in real time talking to you and engaging—humans are wired for connection. Not "go do this whole thing on your own for 30 minutes and then we'll check in."
Third thing is consistency. We're all like this, right? I want to go to the gym and work out two hours every six months. You're not getting anywhere. To have this four days a week, 25-minute classes—long enough for great instruction, not so long you check out.
It's like going to the gym five days a week. You don't have to be there three hours, but 45 minutes four or five days a week, you're going to make good progress.
Those are the three secret sauces. As a parent, especially homeschooling with other kids, that consistency can be really challenging. We hear constantly from people like, "I've watched you talk about Savvy for four years. I keep thinking I can do it myself and keep not, and keep falling farther behind." It's hard to manage consistency on your own.
Savvy provides that in a great way. For many public school or charter school kids doing Savvy, but especially with homeschool, it gives your child consistency and gives you a chance to work with another child while one child does Savvy. You can break up and get help many homeschool parents need balancing lots of kids and needs.
Ela Bass (41:06)
I love the point you made earlier because there's one school of thought that if a kid doesn't read, they'll read eventually. But if you can help a kid—if it's not the kid bucking against every possible thing you're doing—it is helpful in teaching other subjects, right?
As a homeschooler, you have more flexibility than public school students. But I love the emphasis that reading is a tool, especially at a certain point.
The longer a kid does not read, you prolong them having that tool in their toolkit. Is it detrimental to who they could become? Maybe eventually they'll learn and speed up. But as many tools as we can give our kids as early on—that's the sentiment from many OpenEd parents. I just want to open as many doors for my kids as possible.
I love that you're helping kids do that because it's so true. Kids love people who love them. That's something I've seen, especially in the microschool movement—kids who didn't love school are starting to love school because their teachers actually care about them personally. It sounds like you have people who make kids feel special, actually want to be there, are really amazing teachers excited when a kid learns something.
From the receiving end, that's so different. What has been the most rewarding thing for you in this whole journey of reading, all these book recommendations you've been doing consistently for the past 20 years, and now building Savvy?
Janssen Bradshaw (43:30)
Reading is just so magical and gives you experiences and views into the world. Sometimes that's great literature—you're part of the Pride and Prejudice or Animal Farm club. Sometimes it's just a fluffy romance reminding you of the sheer joy of getting lost in someone else's life. It can be that whole spectrum.
For Savvy, it's opening that world for kids where they get to experience that. For Everyday Reading, what I love most is when I get messages from people like, "I was a huge bookworm growing up" or "I never read growing up and now I'm 37 and I've just read 10 books this year and I haven't read a book for fun in 25 years."
Either they rediscover that part of them or for the first time get the door opened into the world. If I get a chance to open that door, whether they've been there before or not, is really magical. It's like you've given someone a whole new world to live in and I feel really lucky to get to do that.
Ela Bass (44:49)
That's beautiful. Many OpenEd marketplace parents have lots of options, which can be stifling at times. For reading help, there are 10 different providers. What makes Savvy Learning so good and who do you think it's most for?
Janssen Bradshaw (45:09)
Savvy works really well for three kinds of students. One is a struggling student who's like, "I hate it, I hate reading, I hate books, I hate math." For them to start having positive experiences is life changing. In a way that doesn't make them feel "I'm not smart, I'm behind." It's like, you are where you are.
Like I took up skiing. We moved to Utah. I hadn't grown up skiing at all. I thought, okay, if we're living in Utah, I better learn. None of the instructors were like, "I can't believe you're 35 and don't know how to ski." They're like, "Great. You're ready to learn, we're going to meet you where you are."
Savvy is great for that. If you're on a poor trajectory where you hate reading, hate books, hate math—that can change the trajectory.
Child number two that Savvy Reading works well for: kids that are competent but don't love reading. They can do it, they're fine, at grade level. The teacher says yes, fine. They're not struggling necessarily, but Savvy helps them discover a love of reading—making it fun and engaging.
I love seeing parents who say, "It was hard to decide if I wanted to do Savvy because they weren't so obviously..." If your child is nine and can barely read three-letter words, you know there's a problem. Less easy to see there's a problem if your child's basically on grade level but just kind of meh.
To circle back to what we said earlier about homeschool, one of my biggest goals is for kids to have a love of learning and to want to learn. Humans are wired to learn. Savvy really can help kids suddenly discover, "This is interesting, this is fun, this is engaging." Even if I knew basic fundamentals, now I can do it.
Third one is kids way ahead. Especially if you're in public school and checked out a little at school in reading or math—you're way ahead, bored by all this. Savvy can meet those kids where they are.
My second daughter was struggling, so Savvy helped her pull up from the bottom. My third daughter was very advanced in reading and math. She did Savvy while in public school. It gave her a challenge she wasn't having in public school—at her level, moving at a much faster, higher pace. For a child anxious to learn and loves learning, to have that fun engaging experience at their level instead of waiting all the time or like yeah, I know that—that's a great experience too.
Those are the three things. As a fourth one—we hear a lot from kids who are competent readers. Show them words and they can read it, but they struggle with comprehension. What was that about? I have no idea. I can't answer questions.
Savvy especially, about third through sixth grade levels, is very focused on comprehension. What good is it if you can read words on the page but can't make meaning out of them? I could read words in Italian because it uses the same alphabet. I could say those words, but they'd mean nothing to me. Savvy is really great for kids who need comprehension help too.
Ela Bass (49:14)
I've loved everything you've said. I'm going to hit you with a couple rapid fire questions. Then maybe we can do a part two.
Rapid fire number one: what is one reading habit you'd recommend for all OpenEd families?
Janssen Bradshaw (49:31)
Audiobooks. I feel like they're magical. You said rapid fire, I'm giving a long answer.
The best thing we did for my second daughter when struggling with reading: reading was hard for her, but she still loved books and stories. She had very high comprehension. She listened to tons of audiobooks. Even though she couldn't read words on the page well, she could listen and follow much more complicated stories.
When she did start getting reading help she needed, first with the individual intern then through Savvy, she could put those parts together pretty quickly because she understood fundamentals of how stories, words, and vocabulary work.
My kids listen to—we listen to audiobooks in the car as a family on road trips or just going to the grocery store. They listen at night and during the day while doing other projects. Audiobooks are such an underutilized tool that teach so many good reading skills that help with the actual mechanics of reading with your eyes on a page.
Ela Bass (50:45)
I love that recommendation. Second question: what is your current favorite series? I'm thinking about good gifts this season.
Janssen Bradshaw (51:21)
For 2025 reading for me, it's the Unselected Journals of Emma M. Lyon. Have you heard of these?
Ela Bass (51:28)
I have not.
Janssen Bradshaw (51:33)
They kind of have a Pride and Prejudice meets Anne of Green Gables meets Little Women feel, but they're new. An adult series, but my 12 and 15-year-olds are super into them, my 10-year-old's listened to quite a few, my husband's listened.
It's about this young woman who lives in London, an orphan, just ridiculous things in her life. 1880s London. It's witty, fun, has romance. Fully delightful. Slow start, especially on paper. Audiobooks are easier to get into. Took me a couple books to get into, but many people said, "This is the best series I've ever read." I thought, okay, I gotta keep going.
Then I finished it and went back and read the whole series again. Now I'm listening to the whole series again. Really fun.
Ela Bass (52:20)
Good to know. I know everybody's asking what are the best recommendations for gifts right now. Your Instagram is full of them. If families need more recommendations, go check that out.
Last rapid fire question: keeping up with reading as a busy mom is very difficult. What's your best recommendation?
Janssen Bradshaw (52:43)
One, same as the first question: audiobooks. I love audiobooks. They're a great way to engage with books when you don't have time to sit down.
I also am a huge Kindle lover. Being able to take a book on the go and pick it up anytime, get library books delivered in three seconds, really has helped my reading life.
Third suggestion: put your phone to bed in a different room if you can. I put my phone to bed in my office. Once I go into my bedroom at night, I'm not distracted by it. I can pick up my book. If my phone was sitting there—ask me how I know because I did this for 10 years—I read one page and think, I wonder if anything interesting happened on Instagram. I should text that, I should check that thing on Google. Having my phone in a different room in the evening is very helpful.
Ela Bass (53:34)
Great recommendation. Something I've been doing too is I got one of those bricks. I'll go to my phone and everything's locked and I'm like, oh my gosh, okay, I might as well read.
This has been amazing. Where can people find you if they want to learn more?
Janssen Bradshaw (53:57)
My Instagram is Everyday Reading and my blog is Everyday-Reading.com. Those are the two main places and I love talking about books. It's the dream job to connect with people all the time who want to ask, what series should I try out or how can I fit in more reading? Those are things I want to talk about all the time.
Ela Bass (54:20)
That's amazing. If you're an OpenEd family or not, definitely check out Savvy Learning. We'll link it in the description. It's an amazing tool. We've loved it and offering it to families. Tons of families have given us great feedback. Thank you so much for coming on the podcast. Hopefully we can do it again sometime.
Janssen Bradshaw (54:42)
Perfect, thanks for having me, this was so fun.

-

Janssen Bradshaw had every advantage a parent could want when it comes to raising readers.

She grew up in a home where her mom - an English major - read aloud every single day. Even in high school, they'd sit together with two copies of *Pride and Prejudice*, taking turns page by page. Janssen became an elementary school librarian. She started Everyday Reading, a blog and Instagram account dedicated to books. Her house has somewhere between 2,000 and 5,000 books in it.

When her first daughter tested at a 12th-grade reading level in kindergarten, Janssen figured this is just what happens when you surround kids with books from birth.

Then came her second daughter.

"I started working with her when she was like three - her letters, her sounds, all the same things I'd done with my oldest child," Janssen told me. "And it was just not clicking for her."

She kept at it. Same methods. Same environment. Same read-alouds and library trips and books everywhere. But by first grade, a teacher delivered the news at a parent-teacher conference: her daughter was barely at grade level - the very lowest they could call "at grade level" - and she was drifting lower with each assessment.

Same mom. Same books. Completely opposite outcomes.

"My second daughter is extremely bright," Janssen said. "It was not like she was not smart. But learning to read is just really hard for some kids. And for her, it was really difficult."

## Why Early Reading Struggles Matter So Much

If you're watching your child struggle with reading, you probably already sense that time matters. The research confirms it.

The shift happens around third grade. Before that, kids are "learning to read" - decoding words, building fluency, making the connection between sounds and symbols. After third grade, they're "reading to learn" - using reading as a tool to absorb everything else. History. Science. Math word problems. Instructions.

"If you get to third grade and you are not a competent reader, most kids never catch up after that," Janssen explained. "Because now you're not teaching reading, you're teaching everything else assuming you can read the assignments."

The [National Assessment of Educational Progress](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/) puts hard numbers on this: 66% of fourth graders read below proficiency level. And research consistently shows that roughly 70% of struggling readers who don't get effective intervention never catch up.

But what the statistics don't capture is how reading struggles become *identity* struggles.

Janssen watched it happen with her daughter. "That was making her feel like she was dumb, which was not true. It made her feel like she didn't like school. She was starting to disengage with school because it was hard for her."

A kid who can't read doesn't just fall behind academically. They start to believe something is wrong with them.

## Signs Your Child May Need Help

So what should parents actually watch for? Not vague "they're struggling" - but specific, observable patterns.

**Decoding difficulties:** They struggle to break apart longer words. They don't recognize the same word when it appears again a few sentences later. They guess at word endings instead of sounding them out.

**Comprehension gaps:** They can't remember or retell what they just read, even if they technically got through all the words.

**Avoidance and resistance:** "I hate reading." Meltdowns when it's time to practice. Elaborate strategies to get out of anything involving books.

**The bright-but-struggling pattern:** This was Janssen's daughter exactly. Sharp in conversation. Quick to understand concepts when they're explained verbally. But something wasn't connecting on the page.

If you're seeing these patterns, the answer is rarely "try harder." Something else is going on - and with the right help, it can change.

## Why 60-Minute Tutoring Sessions Don't Work

When parents see their child struggling, the natural instinct is more help. More time. More practice. And often, that means traditional tutoring: hour-long sessions, once or twice a week.

[Tony Mickelsen, CMO of Savvy Learning, puts it bluntly](https://youtu.be/6JOzVZEQ0Zk?si=06q_ggPeV5hlM_Af): "What child is going to have fun learning to read for 60 minutes? That's tough for me as an adult."

Most parents are putting in plenty of effort. They just need a different approach.

In 1984, educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom published research that became known as the "[Two Sigma Problem](https://opened.co/blog/einstein-had-a-tutor)." He found that students who received one-on-one tutoring performed two standard deviations better than students in conventional classrooms - meaning the average tutored student outperformed 98% of classroom-taught students.

We've known for 40 years that personalized instruction dramatically outperforms the standard model. Yet we've built most of our educational infrastructure around approaches that work for maybe half of kids.

There's another factor Janssen discovered firsthand: the parent problem.

Her daughter would resist and fight when mom or dad tried to practice reading with her. The emotional stakes were too high. She didn't want to disappoint them. She felt the pressure differently.

But when a college intern - not a parent, not a teacher with a classroom full of other kids - started working with her one-on-one at school, something shifted. Within weeks, Janssen was seeing major progress.

Then COVID hit and everything shut down.

## What 25-Minute Sessions Can Do

The school's reading tutor - actually just a college student doing an internship - reached out to Janssen. She wanted to finish her hours. Would Janssen's daughter be willing to continue working together online?

What happened next surprised Janssen.

"This was like a white screen with black words on it," she said. "'Let's just practice words.' That's it."

Nothing fancy. No gamification. No elaborate curriculum. Just consistent, focused, one-on-one practice.

And her daughter would get out of the pool - without complaint - to get on that Zoom call.

"I remember that summer we went down to visit my parents and she was swimming and I said, 'Come on in, it's time for you to do this.' And she just got out of the pool and got on with her and she just put up no resistance."

What made it work? A few things came together:

**Frequency over duration.** Short sessions - 20 to 25 minutes - multiple times per week. Think of it like exercise: four 30-minute gym sessions beat one two-hour marathon. Kids stay engaged instead of burning out. Progress compounds instead of resetting.

**Consistency builds momentum.** Harvard economist Roland Fryer's research on high-dosage tutoring found that it's not about total hours - it's about frequency and engagement. 130+ hours delivered in small, consistent doses outperforms sporadic longer sessions.

**The not-parent factor.** Someone outside the family dynamic. Lower emotional stakes. A relationship built purely around this one thing.

**Structured literacy approach.** Systematic, explicit phonics instruction - often called Orton-Gillingham based methods - that builds skills sequentially rather than expecting kids to just "pick it up."

Tony Mickelsen describes what happens at the end of a well-designed 25-minute session: "The kids are hyped. They want to come back."

That experience - Janssen watching her daughter transform through consistent, personalized, short-burst instruction - eventually became [Savvy Learning](https://savvylearning.com/), the company she co-founded with her husband and another couple. They launched in fall 2020, hoping for 10 sign-ups. They got over 100.

## From Barely at Grade Level to 11th Grade Reading

So what happened to Janssen's daughter?

She went from barely at grade level in first grade - drifting lower with each assessment - to testing at an 11th-grade reading level by fifth grade.

Years later, someone asked Janssen if her daughter was embarrassed that she talks publicly about those early struggles.

So Janssen asked her directly. Her daughter was eight or nine at the time.

"Why would I be embarrassed that something was hard for me?" she said. "And then I worked really hard and now I'm awesome at it."

Janssen's reflection: "It's one thing for your parent or your teacher to be like, 'You're smart, you can do hard things.' It is another thing for a child to know: this was really hard for me and I fully conquered it."

The struggle wasn't a setback. It became proof.

One more thing helped during those difficult years: audiobooks. Janssen's daughter still loved stories - she just couldn't decode them herself yet. Audiobooks kept her engaged with books, kept her vocabulary growing, kept her comprehension developing even while they worked on the mechanics.

"When she did start getting the reading help she needed, she could put those parts together pretty quickly," Janssen said. "Because she understood the fundamentals of how stories and words and vocabulary all work."

Don't underestimate the value of keeping a struggling reader connected to the joy of stories, even through a different medium.

## How to Help a Struggling Reader

If you're seeing the signs - the resistance, the frustration, the bright kid who just isn't clicking with reading - here's where to start:

**Get a baseline.** Know where your child actually stands. [Savvy Learning](https://savvylearning.com/) offers a free 15-minute reading assessment that shows exactly where kids are and what they need. It's a starting point, not a sales pitch - you'll get actionable information either way.

**Think frequency over duration.** If you're considering tutoring, look for programs that meet three to four times per week in focused, shorter sessions. The research is clear: this outperforms occasional longer sessions.

**Give yourself permission to get outside help.** Sometimes the best thing a parent can do is not be the teacher for this particular skill. That's not failure. That's strategy. Janssen had 5,000 books and a background as a school librarian - and her daughter still needed someone else.

Student engagement is critical to student success: The more deeply students connect with their learning, the more they see learning as relevant and motivating, and the more likely they are to succeed. But as Discovery Education’s *Education Insights 2025–2026* [report](https://www.discoveryeducation.com/education-insights/?utm_source=de_marketing&utm_medium=press_release&utm_campaign=2025_q3_k12_nat-ed-insights) reveals, [engagement](https://www.the74million.org/tag/student-engagement/) is not a simple concept — and often viewed differently depending on point of view and context. 

Drawing on the responses of 1,400 K–12 superintendents, principals, teachers, parents and students across the United States, the *Insights* report spotlights the promise and the challenge of keeping students connected to learning.

More than 90% of teachers, principals, and superintendents agree that engagement is one of the most important predictors of student success. Nearly all students (92%) say that engaging lessons make school more enjoyable. And 99% of superintendents rank engagement as one of the top indicators of achievement. 

But they don’t agree on how to measure engagement – or even how to define it. For example, students report higher levels of engagement than teachers do, but even then, only 63% of students say they feel “highly engaged” in class. There is an almost 20-point gap between students reporting being highly engaged and what teachers believe. 

And teachers overwhelmingly point to outward indicators of engagement, such as asking thoughtful questions or contributing to discussions. Less obvious signs, like persistence, are often overlooked. 

This gap in the perceptions between students and teachers is an essential challenge to address. When educators miss the signals of engagement, they may misinterpret students as being disengaged, even when they are fully vested in learning. 

Superintendents, unsurprisingly, view student engagement from a lens focused on student outcomes. Nearly all surveyed superintendents rate engagement as a top predictor of success and are far more likely than teachers to see test performance as a leading sign of engagement. 

These differences — leaders equating engagement with performance, teachers seeking observable behaviors and students experiencing quiet or compliance-based engagement — undercut the effectiveness of efforts to increase student engagement. Often, leaders’ emphasis on systems of measurement collides with teachers’ limited time and tools to enact engaging, personalized learning at scale. 

### [Report: Kids Check Out of School as They Get Older, and Parents Are in the Dark](https://www.the74million.org/article/report-kids-check-out-of-school-as-they-get-older-and-parents-are-in-the-dark/)

Students are clear about what fuels their motivation. They want relevance: learning that connects with their lives and future plans. Across all groups surveyed, relevance consistently ranked as one of the most critical factors impacting engagement. Students also seek challenge. Somewhat surprisingly, nearly four out of five say that school often feels easy, while wanting deeper, more meaningful work. Students report that challenging lessons can spark curiosity and engagement, which is consistent with teachers’ views.  

Educators are aware of the obstacles to greater student engagement. One of the biggest is that engagement can vary by learner, subject and even the day of the week. Teachers also point to the lack of time and resources as a barrier to creating the right conditions.  

In the *Insights* report, teachers identify a concern around the lack of tools to measure engagement. While nearly all superintendents say their district has a system for measuring it, only about 60% of teachers agree. This disconnect is a tall hurdle to overcome in fostering more engagement for all students.  

Alignment across teachers, principals and district leaders can create the clarity needed to recognize different forms of engagement and respond effectively. Students thrive when teachers have the time they need to prepare and personalize lessons.  

The report’s findings emphasize that engagement isn’t a “nice to have.” It is a precondition for student success. Without it, students may comply but not necessarily thrive. With it, they are more motivated, ready for challenges and more likely to succeed in the present and the future. 

It is imperative that districts build more coherent strategies that move beyond encouraging engagement to shared definitions, frameworks and measurement. The approach should recognize that quiet, reflective or multilingual learners may demonstrate engagement differently than more outwardly expressive students do. Districts should also provide the time, tools and training for teachers to design relevant, personalized lessons; and harness engaging multimodal content and digital tools to support, not distract from, engagement. 

Engagement is a prerequisite to learning. However, as the Insights eport shows, engagement doesn’t just happen, and it doesn’t have a widely or universally accepted definition or measurement. Instead, fostering and sustaining engagement requires clarity, alignment, intentional strategies and purposeful resources. Garnering widespread agreement on a definition — and adoption of that definition — will enable engaging and successful learning experiences for all students.

I’ve been helping my girlfriend study for graduate school using actual efficient study methods like retrieval practice, spaced repetition, questioning, Feynman Technique

She says to me last night:

“I’m just realizing, now that we study so much more effectively, I never did this in school growing up and we were never taught how to study properly”

I had the same experience as I’m sure most people reading this did as well

Why is that? Why aren’t we taught proper study methods in school?

Everyone I know and have met thinks studying is just re-reading your notes or maybe using flashcards

If you were taught how to study effectively during your K-12 schooling years, how did your teachers incorporate it?

## How to Learn Anything and REMEMBER It: Feynman's Technique

[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X8vQ!,f_auto,q_auto:best,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Feducatedandfree.substack.com%2Fapi%2Fv1%2Fpress_kit%2Fasset%2F61221402%2Foverlay%2Fcomposed%3FaspectRatio%3Dlink)

It's been a week since most of the major metro school systems have shut down. If you're freaking out because you think your kids are missing out on valuable learning, here we go.

Bottom line: if I can teach 40 kids at a time, you can handle one, especially the one that you love. And it doesn't take 6 hours a day -- [they can learn more at home](https://www.businessinsider.com/reasons-homeschooling-is-the-smartest-way-to-teach-kids-today-2018-1#students-can-learn-more-about-what-they-really-care-about-2) in two hours than all day at school (although you may need them off your back for six).

I'd like to introduce [the Feynman technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/) as the answer to the question: *how the Sam Hill am I going to keep these kids learning without a teacher, four walls, and locks on all the doors?*

You can use the Feynman technique for anything you're interested in learning.

Kids, if your parents tell you you're on your own but want you to produce something, you can follow in Feynman's footsteps to really nail a difficult concept or complex topic and then shout, "In yo' face, aged ones!" politely, of course.

Feynman's technique is brilliant in its simplicity. Not to get all high-falutin' on you, but had Einstein lived long enough he would've loved it. Einstein said, "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."

It's possible Einstein made that same comment in Feynman's presence. Einstein presided over some of Feynman's classes at Princeton and they met occasionally after Feynman moved on from the august New Jersey institution.

At any rate, Feynman created this workflow, and anyone can use it.

1. Choose a topic/concept.
2. Create an explanation of it that would work for a child.
3. Identify gaps in your understanding and go back to source material to fill them.
4. Revise your explanation from part 2 with the work from part 3 and, optionally, simplify it.

**Step 1: Choose a topic**

What is your kid interested in? Dinosaurs? Make-up? Horses? World War II German artillery? Drugs? Sex? Rock and roll?

Bring it on.

Take out a piece of paper and write the topic in large letters on the top of the page.

**Step 2: Teach it to a child**.

Next, they'll write down everything they know about the topic as simply and clearly as they can. They should imagine that they're explaining to someone a couple years younger than they are, with all the limitations of vocabulary and attention-span that entails.

For the sake of your sanity and getting things done, if your kid has chosen an enormous topic like, say, weapons of World War II (I work with lots of teenage boys), you may want to use the [Question Formulation technique](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OWO1WUTacTRzxinekrEg002woloVHYcq/view?usp=sharing) to help them narrow the scope of their work. This is actually a fun exercise to complete with your kids, but you need to follow the rules, mom and dad, or the final question will belong to you instead of your kid. If you're a student doing this on your own, this may be where FaceTiming your friends and geeking out on a topic you all love will pay dividends in terms of your learning (and getting your parents off your back).

**Step 3: Identify and fill gaps in your understanding.**

During step 2, they might realize there are things they don't know that they need to find out in order to thoroughly explain to their younger student.

This is where research skills can be built/improved, and also where supervision may be necessary. [Start here](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/technology/20-tips-use-google-search-efficiently.html) to learn how to search effectively: quotation marks, - signs, asterisks, etc. are little known search heroes.

Kids are going to have to find ways to fill in the gaps in their knowledge. The internet is going to be most people's go-to, and you can just leave it at that, but this is an excellent opportunity for you to discuss with them assessing the [credibility of sources](https://www.virtuallibrary.info/uploads/2/6/9/3/26930678/_7108009.png).

If they're young you're going to have to source the information to help them. I don't know that I would recommend YouTube for younger kids, just because they don't have the note-taking skills to make video work well as a method of direct instruction, but you could use it if you're able to supervise their screen time and stop the video for them periodically so they can record pertinent information.

It can be helpful to teach them to Google Search their topic with the phrase "for kids" in quotes at the end. This will generally find you [kid-friendly sources of information](https://www.safesearchkids.com/wikipedia-for-kids/#.XnMJABNKjOR). If you're willing to spend a little money, [Encyclopedia Britannica](https://kids.britannica.com/tour) has a beautiful site for kids for $8 a month ($75/year) for unlimited access. [Encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/) is comprehensive and well-laid out and free. [Brainpop](http://brainpop.com/) is pretty great, but may not be as specific as your kid needs to fill in the gaps in her knowledge on a specific topic.

Libraries aren't open right now, at least not in my metro or in many of my friends', but if you have a library card you can access a ton of digital research sources. For my high school students, this can be a boon or a headache, depending on their ability to navigate their city/county system. But if you need to do heavier research and don't like what Google is dishing out, try a trip to the digital resources page of your local library. Many school districts also pay for digital resource libraries; your school district office likely still has a librarian available to help you navigate these resources.

Remember, that for learning to happen, kids need to ***do something***. When it comes to filling in knowledge-gaps through research, I recommend note-taking, pretty much exclusively, unless your kid has a photographic memory (which many small children actually seem to have, or at least a sponge-like ability to recall discrete facts, so don't discount that).

Depending on your access to technology, your kids (or you) could be creating one-page sketch notes or diagrams in Adobe Illustrator as you listen to audio or watch a video. But if you're like most families, paper and pencil are going to be your go-to.

Notes don't have to be exhaustive. They should just fill in the blanks where your kid is/you are missing information.

For kids in 5th to 12th grade who want to just ingest content without processing it much, give them the gift of structure in the form of [Cornell Notes](http://coe.jmu.edu/learningtoolbox/cornellnotes.html). If they hate structure, or want to add creativity to note-taking structure or they want to use creativity to build a structure that makes sent to them, ([creativity is GREAT for memory](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/ulterior-motives/201510/creativity-is-memory), FYI) have your kid try [sketchnotes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNJyuJl5LKk).

Whichever way you or your child process information, it's important that you take the time to process it, because that makes finishing Feynman a lot easier.

**Step 4: Revise your explanation for simplicity.**

So now that we know what we didn't know before and we have a more complete understanding of our topic of choice, it's time to present our findings.

Can your kid just show you what they wrote and do a drawing and talk to you?

Sure. That's a legitimate way to show what they've learned.

But you know what's more fun?

Screencasting. YouTubing. Writing a letter... and sending it to an expert.

It's time to buck up, buttercup, and ask someone more knowledgeable than you what you could have done better. If you're super hardcore, you can see how you stand up under the withering criticism only YouTube commenters can provide.

If you need more ideas for how you/your kid can show learning authentically, [here you go](http://jfmueller.faculty.noctrl.edu/toolbox//tasks.htm), my lovelies. It [doesn't have to be a report](https://citl.indiana.edu/teaching-resources/assessing-student-learning/alternatives-traditional-exams-papers/index.html), mom and dad.

Give them a nudge, show that you care about what they care about, and let them show you what they can do. Then you can build on it, together.

**TL;DR**: You can use the Feynman technique to master anything.

**STUDENTS**: Take something you're interested in and try to explain it in a way a kid 4-6 years younger than you could understand. DO something, don't just think about it. Use [these tips](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/technology/20-tips-use-google-search-efficiently.html) to conduct effective research, but know that watching videos or reading about a concept isn't enough; to actually learn it you have to go [through the creative process](http://jfmueller.faculty.noctrl.edu/toolbox//tasks.htm) to nail down what you really know and what you don't. And you need to *put it all together*, whether it's written, drawn, acted out, etc.; the creative process turns information gathering into easily recalled knowledge, i.e., when you create something out of what you learned, you OWN the knowledge. It's not learning if you can't remember it a month from now.

**PARENTS**: Let your child choose a topic that floats their boat; [intrinsic motivation produces better results](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/53337/intrinsic-motivation-is-key-to-student-achievement-but-schools-can-crush-it). Support them in searching for relevant information. Let them choose the way they want to present the information. Periodically check their progress and give actionable feedback; try to keep your tone even and calm. Judge the work, not the kid. If you want to go next level, post their work on your social media and solicit helpful feedback and let your child revise their work until it's great.

**TEACHERS**: I get it, you have content standards. But within those, can you free your students, at least a little? Let them ask their own questions. Let them find their own answers. Let them present their answers in novel, beautiful ways that aren't in your wheelhouse. We're all looking for freedom. You have the power to give it to your students.

## Free kindergarten resources. : r/homeschool

At the beginning of the year I got my daughter a preschool book and I thought the following kindergarten book. However, I bought a kindergarten prep book.

We've worked through them all, and she's done really great. Definitely ready for the kindergarten step now.

Now my real issue. I can't afford her next book right now, especially with the holidays here... I don't know what to do. I'm looking for any free resources to piece together some sort of school until I can afford the books she needs.

I have a teacher's pay teachers acct but a lot of the free stuff isn't exactly what I'm looking for. Atleast that I've found.

Any help and advice would be great. She knows her uppercase/lowercase letters and sounds and numbers 1-20.shapes and colors. And has started blending cvc words,amazingly.

Thanks in advance!

## Navigating the Holidays with Intense and Sensitive Kids - Raising Lifelong Learners

![](https://raisinglifelonglearners.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Navigating-the-Holidays-with-Intense-and-Sensitive-Kids-fi.jpg)

https://play.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/39436020/height/192/theme/modern/size/large/thumbnail/yes/custom-color/2c354b/time-start/00:00:00/playlist-height/200/direction/backward/download/yes/font-color/FFFFFF

The days blur together, the calendar filling with colored markers—dinners, birthdays, recitals, potlucks, assemblies. The holidays hit, and suddenly, the energy in the home changes. Anticipation, anxiety, excitement, exhaustion—all collide, often erupting in outbursts or a complete emotional shutdown. For families homeschooling neurodivergent kids, this seasonal intensity isn’t just inconvenient; it can send everyone scraping rock bottom or running for cover.

You’re not alone in this. Holidays amplify the highs and lows, tossing routines into the air and expecting everyone to catch them gracefully. But when you’re raising kids with neurodiversity—giftedness, twice-exceptionality, sensory differences, anxiety—those routines aren’t just comfort, they’re lifelines.

Let’s talk openly about what really happens in these messy, magical, overstuffed weeks and how you can build a practical “holiday survival toolbox”—not just for your children, but for yourself.

You might like: [Intense Children and The Holidays: A Parent’s Guide](https://raisinglifelonglearners.com/intense-children-the-holidays/)

![](https://raisinglifelonglearners.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Navigating-the-Holidays-with-Intense-and-Sensitive-Kids-2.png)

### Why Are Holidays So Hard for Neurodivergent Kids?

Forget what you think you know about “normal” holiday challenges. When you’re homeschooling kids who experience the world intensely—whether through giftedness, sensory processing differences, or subtle emotional needs—the holidays magnify everything.

*Disrupted routines.* School (if you have it) gets flipped around, extracurriculars pile up, social gatherings abound, bedtime stretches later. The predictability kids rely on dissolves, replaced by spontaneous events and unpredictability.

*Heightened expectations.* Even joyful events bring pressure—performances, gifts, visits from relatives, elaborate meals. If your child already struggles with anxiety or sensory sensitivities, these seasonal routines can feel like a minefield.

*Sensory overload.* New lights, noises, textures… sweets and unfamiliar foods, crowded rooms and relatives’ hugs—a sensory buffet with too many choices and no exit sign.

Result? Meltdowns, hyperactivity, withdrawal, impulsive antics, or the kind of creative mischief that would have made Kevin in “Home Alone” look tame.

### You Aren’t a Bad Parent—and Your Child Isn’t Broken

It bears repeating: You didn’t cause this. Their intensity isn’t your failure. Holiday stress isn’t a sign that homeschooling (or parenting) has gone off the rails.

So many of us cringe when our kid sings “Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer” with a bit too much gusto, or see our child lead the charge in a living room wrestling match. Surrounded by stares—sometimes from those who should “get it” most—you may ache with embarrassment, frustration, or self-doubt.

Pause. Give yourself compassion. The experts, the books, the relatives—they don’t really get it unless they live it. Intensity is not instability. As support organizations for emotionally intense or gifted kids point out, what seems like “bad behavior” is often a sign of a rich emotional life. The same energy that fuels holiday outbursts is the engine for your child’s passion, curiosity, and creativity the rest of the year.

You get to let go of anyone else’s approval—full stop. Their judgment does not define you or your child.

### Real-Life Strategies for Managing Holiday Intensity

So where does that leave you? Bootstrapping together any plan you can, learning year by year what works. Let’s get real about what’s in the toolbox.

### 1. Get (and Stay) on the Same Team

Holidays come heavy with expectation and tradition from both sides. Maybe you and your partner were raised with very different holiday routines; maybe you’re navigating blended families.

Have the conversation before you walk into the gathering: What’s our plan if things go sideways? Can one of you tag out if a child needs to leave early or have some quiet time? Is it possible—and okay—to take separate cars, so one adult and one kid can retreat while the rest stay? Make support an active, ongoing part of your holiday plan.

### 2. Embrace Food Realities—Without Guilt

Food sensitivities and chemical triggers are real. If your child implodes after eating Red Dye 40, you’re not “picky” for packing safe cookies, special mac and cheese, or a familiar treat. This isn’t about spoiling holidays for others—this is about survival, and helping your child feel included.

Coming with “safe food” isn’t just about health; it’s about dignity and comfort. If one meal on the buffet is always a hit with your child, bring a double batch to share. Bring treats you know won’t be an issue. It’s one less battle in an otherwise unpredictable day.

### 3. Prepare for the Unstructured Abyss

Holiday gatherings mean “grown-ups talking while kids disappear to the basement” time. This is where chaos (and sometimes disaster) is born. Intense, creative, impulsive children need structured options—more than other kids.

Come armed: crafts, art kits, Lego or building toys, new books, card games. Don’t hesitate to bring technology if it helps your child decompress (with headphones and clear boundaries if needed). It’s not about being “antisocial”; it’s about self-regulation.

Resist the urge to compare. You’re not failing if your child needs an iPad break while the cousins play tag—the goal is to keep everyone regulated and happy, not to match someone else’s expectations of “engagement.”

### 4. Plan the Exit Strategy—and Use It

Sometimes the healthiest thing you can do is leave. Yes, really. You might have to walk out before dessert or slip away in the middle of a party. Your child’s needs are not a reflection of your failings, and there is zero shame in meeting them.

Working out a simple “signal” that your child can use to let you know they’re overwhelmed can be empowering for both of you. Maybe it’s a phrase, a gesture, or a code word. If your child says they’ve had enough, honor it—even if awkward glances follow you on the way out.

Go for a walk, find a quiet space, sit in the car and listen to music together—do whatever helps your child (and you) reset.

### 5. Let Go of the Need to Please

This is the hardest lesson for so many of us. Friends and family often won’t understand. They may never “get it.” That’s not your responsibility.

Refuse to apologize for your child’s intensity or your own choices. You don’t need to explain, justify, or shrink. “This is what we need right now”—that’s enough.

![](https://raisinglifelonglearners.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Navigating-the-Holidays-with-Intense-and-Sensitive-Kids-1.png)

### Building Positive Holiday Memories

Yes, holidays are about family, about memory, about love. The high standards and legendary stories of past years can tempt you to push yourself and your kids beyond their capacity.

Remember: you have permission to do things differently. To be together means being together with accommodations, with modifications, sometimes with extra screens or solo walks.

You’re building memories—not perfection, not Instagram moments, not the echoes of holidays past. You’re helping your children experience the season with joy instead of dread, excitement instead of fear.

### Your Toolbox, Your Family, Your Success

Gather what works—snacks, crafts, exit plans, code words, comfy clothes, honest conversations with your partner—and let the rest go.

There is no one-size-fits-all solution, no perfect answer. But you are the perfect parent for your child, and your child is exactly who they are meant to be.

The holidays are coming. Intensity is coming with them. But so is love, and laughter, and moments—big and small—that will stay with your family for a lifetime.

## RLL #301: Navigating the Holidays with Intense and Sensitive Kids

As the holidays approach, many families experience a swirl of excitement, chaos, and sometimes overwhelm. On the latest episode of the podcast, we dive deep into the realities of parenting and homeschooling neurodivergent kids during this season—and share practical strategies to help everyone thrive (not just survive).

Here are 3 key takeaways for parents and educators supporting neurodiverse learners over the holidays:

- **Proactive Planning is Essential:** From bringing favorite snacks and engaging activities to prepping for early exits from gatherings, thinking ahead can make all the difference for kids who struggle with disrupted schedules and sensory overload.
- **Let Go of Others’ Expectations:** Remember that it’s okay if our holiday experience looks different than others’. Prioritizing your child’s needs over others’ opinions is a powerful way to support both your child and your own well-being.
- **Teamwork Makes the Season Brighter:** Getting on the same page with your spouse, older siblings, and even relatives about plans, support, and backup strategies can help everyone feel included and respected during festivities.

Let’s embrace the season—intensity and all—and build meaningful, positive memories together.

### **Editor’s Note:** This is part one of a two-part series.

For many homeschooling families, the preschool years feel like a blur of playtime, snack breaks, and circle songs. While these things absolutely matter, there’s far more happening beneath the surface than most of us realize. 

Preschool isn’t only cute crafts and ABCs — it’s a pivotal season of mental, emotional, and spiritual development. And when approached with intention, it becomes a powerful foundation for a child’s lifelong learning journey.

![](https://www.abeka.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Abeka_2026_Cat5_Preschool_Part1_Blog-1.jpg)

As Cindy Quinlan, senior educational consultant for Abeka, and Maranatha Sweet, educational consultant for Abeka, share in a recent [three-part video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5lE3VdjoEE), the preschool years are not to be underestimated. This is the time when children’s brains are rapidly growing and forming connections. 

“Sometimes we have the tendency to think of preschool as ‘school light’ or, in some ways, just not quite as important,” said Quinlan. “And what we want to emphasize is just how crucial these young ages are in learning in all areas — spiritually, academically, socially. So as we think of preschool, I want us to feel the burden, to feel the intentionality of working with children this young.”

![](https://www.abeka.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Abeka_2026_Cat5_Preschool_Part1_Blog-2.jpg)

In order to make the most of these early learning opportunities, the Abeka preschool program focuses on four key areas: 

1. Bible 
2. Academics 
    1. Letters instruction 
    2. Numbers instruction 
3. Language development 
4. Skills development

Yet, as we unpack the importance of intentional learning in preschool, the focus isn’t on the instructional step-by-steps of each key area. Instead, Quinlan and Sweet offer homeschool parents and educators useful insights into a young child’s ability to learn at an early age. Even more, they’ll unpack how foundational these educational years are to subsequent learning and growth. 

“It’s purposeful instruction in those foundational concepts with plenty of play and other activities,” said Sweet.

## **More Than Play**

When some parents hear the word “preschool,” they may think: Isn’t preschool essentially babysitting and playtime, with an occasional lesson on a letter or number baked in? But as our [“Teacher Talk” series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYptoaDzn8HtcrIaw_ECsUBTyHMlYwPf8) highlights, a well-structured preschool experience can do far more than keep little ones busy—it lays the groundwork for reading, critical thinking, social interaction, and even spiritual understanding.

In fact, preschool becomes a time to introduce structure, habits, and rhythms that will serve students as they grow. Our belief is that preschool is also where we begin training a young child’s character — patience, obedience, attentiveness.

![](https://www.abeka.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Abeka_2026_Cat5_Preschool_Part1_Blog-4.jpg)

## **5 Lasting Benefits of a Strong Preschool Start**

A high-quality preschool experience provides more than an academic head start. It offers a launchpad for life. Here are five benefits to expect when homeschool parents approach preschool with an intentionality that emphasizes academics and learning:

- **Cognitive Development**: Exposure to language, numbers, and creative play helps the brain make critical connections.
- **Motor Skills**: From coloring to cutting and pasting, kids practice fine motor skills that prepare them for writing.
- **Social Readiness**: Learning to take turns, follow instructions, and collaborate are crucial skills for future group settings.
- **Spiritual Growth**: Bible stories, songs, and memory verses introduce God’s truth in a joyful, age-appropriate way.
- **Confidence**: Completing tasks and participating in structured activities builds self-assurance.

With Thanksgiving in the rearview mirror, parents and students are sprinting towards the end of the fall semester. This fall, [we surveyed](https://edchoice.mcdatahub.com/edchoice/Reports/Adults_Aug_Nov_25.pdf) thousands of Americans and school parents across the country on a handful of topics, including their opinions on school choice policies, technology in K-12 education, durable skills, debate and civil discourse classes, and much more.  

In partnership with Morning Consult, EdChoice surveyed a nationally representative sample of 2,250 adults and 1,300 school parents each month in August, September, October, and November. For those interested in the full report, it can be [found here](https://edchoice.mcdatahub.com/edchoice/Reports/Adults_Aug_Nov_25.pdf). 

Let’s break down some of the key findings: 

**Schooling and Experiences** 

1. **Private school parents are much more likely than public school parents to rate their child’s school an A for this school year**. When asked to grade their child’s school for this school year, nearly half (48%) of private school parents gave an A, compared to only one-third (33%) of public school parents who said the same. That said, an overwhelming majority of both private school (88%) and public school parents (77%) rated their child’s school either an A or B for this school year. Less than one in ten private school parents (4%) and public school parents (5%) rated their child’s school with a D or F grade, while 5% of public school parents responded, “Don’t know” or “No opinion.” 

![](https://www.edchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Chart-1-1520x856.png)

1. **Parents were most likely to say that their child’s academic progress (41%) and their child’s mental health and wellbeing (38%) were on their minds most often when thinking about the current school year**. Additionally, one-third (33%) of parents cited school safety, followed by curriculum and classroom content (26%). Issues like individualized attention for their child (17%), use of technology (12%), and attendance (11%) were less likely to be on the minds of parents this school year. 
2. **Just over half of parents are confident that their child’s school can address issues like mental health and wellbeing and school safety**. Parents signaled most confidence (selecting either “extremely” or “very” confident) that their child’s school can address issues of attendance (76%), child’s academic progress (74%), and use of technology (71%). On the other hand, parents are least confident in their child’s school’s ability to address issues like class size (45%) and transportation and start times (46%). Notably, just over half of parents express confidence in their child’s school’s ability to handle school safety (53%) and their child’s mental health and wellbeing (55%), leaving a large chunk of parents without high confidence that their child’s school can address such important issues.  

![](https://www.edchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Chart-2-1520x856.png)

**Durable Skills** 

1. **More than 80% of parents believe it is very important that their child’s school prioritizes durable skill development**. For this first time in our Public Opinion Tracker polling, we asked parents about their opinions on durable skill development. Durable skills (skills such as communication, critical thinking, teamwork, adaptability, and responsibility) are clearly valued by parents, as 85% said it is either “extremely” or “very” important that their child’s school prioritizes developing these skills.  

![](https://www.edchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Chart-3-1520x855.png)

1. **Nearly 60% of parents said their child’s school is “excellent” or “very good” at teaching durable skills**. On top of that, another 24% of parents said their child’s school does a “good” job at teaching durable skills. Only roughly 10% of parents say their child’s school does either a “fair” or “poor” job at teaching such skills.  
2. **Parents are most likely to believe that the responsibility for teaching students durable skills is shared across their community, including both parents and schools.** A plurality of parents (41%) said it should be a shared responsibility. One-fourth of parents (25%) said parents/guardians should be most responsible for teaching durable skills, while 18% of parents said schools should bear the load of responsibility. Another 9% of parents said either community organizations or employers (through internships or training) should be most responsible.  

![](https://www.edchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Chart-4-1520x857.png)

1. **A school’s emphasis on teaching durable skills has a high impact on parents’ schooling decisions for their child**. Nearly half (45%) said that how a school emphasizes durable skills would make a “significant” impact on their enrollment decision, while another 38% said it would make “some” impact on their decision. Roughly 10% of parents said it would make “not much” of an impact or no impact at all.  
2. **A majority of Americans and school parents consider it important for high school students to learn civil debate skills**. We debuted another new topic, this time asking both Americans and school parents about the value of learning civil debate skills (e.g. using evidence, turn-taking, arguing both sides) in schools. A majority of Americans (53%), as well as 65% of school parents, said it was at least very important that high school students learn civil debate skills. Both Americans (48%) and school parents (58%) were slightly less likely to say middle school students should learn civil debate skills, however. 
3. **Parents and Americans support teaching debate and civil discourse classes in both middle and high school.** For both middle and high school, Americans and school parents were mostly likely to support integrating debate skills across required classes like math, reading/English, social studies, and science. The next most popular approach was for debate and civil discourse to be a stand-alone elective course that students can choose to take. Only about one in five Americans and school parents signaled support for it to be a required stand-alone course that students must take to graduate, the third most popular approach. Finally, less than one in ten Americans and school parents said they would not support teaching debate and civil discourse in either middle or high school classes.  

![](https://www.edchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Chart-5-1520x857.png)

**Technology in K-12 Education** 

1. **One-third of school parents believe their children are using technology too much**. When asked how much time their child spends on technology, 34% said too much while more than half of parents (57%) say their child spends about the right amount of time. Only 3% of parents feel their child spends too little time on technology.  
2. **Parents are generally satisfied with their child’s use of technology in school.** More than 80% of parents are at least “somewhat” satisfied with their child’s use of technology in school, including 44% of parents that are “very” satisfied. Less than one in ten parents are dissatisfied with their child’s use of technology in school.  
3. **Nearly two-thirds of parents (63%) feel their child should be allowed to have their cell phone at school**. On the other hand, only one-third of parents feel their child should be allowed to have their cell phone in the classroom, highlighting a key distinction in parents’ opinions on cell phone use in school compared to the classroom. This pattern is in line with what we’ve observed in the past for this question.  

![](https://www.edchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Chart-6-1520x854.png)

**K-12 School Choice Policies** 

1. **Support for ESAs, school vouchers, charter schools, and open enrollment is higher when given a brief description of each policy.** More than two-thirds of Americans support ESAs (68%) and open enrollment (70%) when given a brief description of the policy. Support for school vouchers (62%) and charter schools (64%) are also high but lag slightly behind in terms of support when given a brief description. Support for these policies has changed slightly since the summer.  
2. **In November, nearly three-fourths of school parents supported ESAs**. Parents are even more supportive of the policy (73%) when given a description of the policy. Only 10% of parents oppose the policy, a consistent trend we’ve observed since we began tracking the question back in 2020. Some demographic groups that are especially supportive of ESAs include respondents that identify as progressive (77%), second-generation immigrants (77%), and respondents that identify as conservative (75%), highlighting the bipartisan support ESAs garner.  

![](https://www.edchoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Chart-7-1520x855.png)

1. **Nearly three-fourths of school parents believe ESAs should be available to all families regardless of income or special needs.** That is 14 points higher than the percentage of parents who want ESA eligibility to be determined by financial need.  
2. **Support for refundable tax credits in K-12 education is strong, especially among parents.** Both Americans (65% total support) and school parents (75% total support) are supportive of refundable tax credits in K-12 education, with parents (41% strongly support) being more likely than Americans (27% strongly support) to show strong support for the policy.  
3. **Nearly 80% of school parents support 529 plans for K-12 education expenses**. The public (71%) also overwhelmingly supports them. Diving deeper, we asked parents whether they’ve contributed to a 529 account in the past year and if they plan to do so in the future. Thinking about the past year, only 27% of parents signaled they have contributed to a 529 account for their child. That said, parents appear motivated to start contributing to a 529 in the coming year. Nearly half of parents (44%) said they are either “extremely” or “very” likely to contribute to a 529 for their child. Another 26% of parents say they are “somewhat” likely to contribute, while only 15% of parents say they are not likely to put money into a 529 plan in the next year.

## 11 Winter Nature Study Ideas to Hear · a humble place

![](https://ahumbleplace.com/uploads/2025/12/Things-to-Hear-for-Winter-Nature-Study-400x600.png)

> You should hear the three great silences of winter: the wide, sudden silence that falls at twilight on the coming of the first winter frost; the smothered hush that waits the breaking of a winter storm; the crystal stillness, the speech of the stars, that pervades earth and sky on a brilliant, stirless winter night. You should hear — or is it *feel?* — them all.
> 
> 
> Dallas Lore Sharp ([*Winter*](https://prf.hn/l/ZZBxWoO/))
> 

Over the last three years, I’ve been sharing the [wonderful lists](https://ahumbleplace.com/topics/homeschooling/charlotte-mason/nature-study/dallas-lore-sharp-lists/) of nature goals from Dallas Lore Sharp’s seasons books. I started with things to see, then moved on to things to do, and this year has been things to hear. In this post, I’m sharing the final list: things to hear from his [*Winter*](https://prf.hn/l/ZZBxWoO/) book.

I appreciate these lists, especially for those who are new to nature study. In this day and age of constant activity and always “doing,” nature study, in its purest form of simply being in nature and observing, can (like [Picture Study](https://ahumbleplace.com/topics/picture-study-series/)!) seem to be not enough, or too abstract. Sharp’s books offer simple goals that can start you down the path of making nature study a regular habit and allow you to see how simple it can be.

Even those of us who have been doing nature study for a while can find inspiration in them to, keep it simple. Charlotte Mason said:

> We are awaking to the use of nature-knowledge, but how we spoil things by teaching them! We are not content that children should know the things of nature as we know our friends, by their looks and ways, an unconscious comprehensive knowledge which sinks in by dint of much looking, but we set them to fragmentary scraps of scientific research. They intend investigation, and lose the joy of seeing. Their attention is concentrated upon this or that, and they lose the all-round alertness which is the chief equipment of the nature-student. We shall awake some day and find that nature-study, as we have taught it, adds not at all to the joy of life.
> 
> 
> Charlotte Mason ([*Formation of Character*](https://www.livingbookpress.com/product/formation-of-character/?lbp=2086), p. 395)

Sharp’s lists truly are so simple and allow us to keep the joy of seeing.

## 11 Things to Hear for Winter Nature Study

### I

YOU should hear the three great silences of winter: the wide, sudden silence that falls at twilight on the coming of the first winter frost; the smothered hush that waits the breaking of a winter storm; the crystal stillness, the speech of the stars, that pervades earth and sky on a brilliant, stirless winter night. You should hear — or is it *feel?* — them all.

### II

So should you hear the great voices of the winter: the voice of the north wind; the voice of a pine forest; the voice of the surf on a stormy shore. There is no music that I know like the wild mighty music of the winter winds in the winter woods. It will often happen that you can pass through a bare stretch of naked hardwoods immediately into a grove of thick-limbed spruces or pines. Never miss such an opportunity. Do not let the high winds of this winter blow on and away without your hearing them — at least once — as they sweep through the hardwoods on into the deep resounding pines.

### III

Did you ever hear the running, rumbling, [reverberating sound of the shore-to-shore split of a wide sheet of new ice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqXu4nRzlVk)? You will hear it as the sun rises over the pond, as the tide turns in the ice-bound river, and when the ice contracts with falling temperature, — a startling bolt of sound, a quake, that cleaves the ice across and splits its way into the heart of the frozen hills.

### IV

One of the most unnatural of all the sounds out-of-doors is the clashing, glassy rattle of trees ice-coated and shaken by the wind. It is as if you were in some weird china shop, where the curtains, the very clothes of the customers, were all of broken glass. It is the rattle of death, not of life; no, rather it is the rustle of the ermine robe of Winter, as he passes crystal-booted down his crystal halls.

### V

If winter is the season of large sounds, it is also the season of small sounds, for it is the season of wide silence when the slightest of stirrings can be heard. Three of these small sounds you must listen for this winter: the smothered *tinkle-tunkle* of water running under thin ice, as where the brook passes a pebbly shallow; then the *tick-tick-tick* of the first snowflakes hitting the brown leaves on a forest floor; then the fine sharp scratch of a curled and toothed beech leaf skating before a noiseless breath of wind over the crusty snow. Only he that hath ears will hear these sounds, speaking, as they do, for the vast voiceless moments of the winter world.

### VI

![](https://ahumbleplace.com/uploads/2025/12/quail-448x600.jpg)

I have not heard the [“covey call” of the quail](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Northern_Bobwhite/sounds) this winter. But there is not a quail left alive in all the fields and sprout-lands within sound of me. I used to hear them here on Mullein Hill; a covey used to roost down the wooded hillside in front of the house; but even they are gone — hunted out of life; shot and eaten off of my small world. What a horribly hungry animal man is!

But you may have the quail still in your fields. If so, then go out toward dusk on a quiet, snowy day, especially if you have heard shooting in the fields that day, and try to hear some one of the covey calling the flock together: *Whir-r-rl-ee! Whir-r-rl-ee! Whirl-ee-gee!* — the sweetest, softest, tenderest call you will ever hear!

### VII

And you certainly do have [chickadees](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Black-capped_Chickadee) in your woods. If so, then go out any time of day, but go on a cold, bleak, blustery day, when everything is a-shiver, and, as Uncle Remus would say, “meet up” with a chickadee. It is worth having a winter, just to meet a chickadee in the empty woods and hear him [call](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Black-capped_Chickadee/sounds) — a little pin-point of live sound, an undaunted, unnumbed voice interrupting the thick jargon of the winter to tell you that all this bluster and blow and biting cold can’t get at the heart of a bird that must weigh, all told, with all his winter feathers on, fully — an ounce or two!

### VIII

And then the [partridge](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/search/?q=partridge) — you must hear him, bursting like a bottled hurricane from the brown leaves at your feet!

### IX

Among the sweet winter sounds, that are as good to listen to as the songs of the summer birds, you should hear: the loud joyous cackling of the hens on a sunny January day; the munching of horses at night when the wild winds are whistling about the barn; the quiet hum about the hives, —

“When come the calm mild days, as still such days will come,
To call the squirrel and the bee from out their winter home.”

And then, the sound of the first rain on the shingles — the first February rain after a long frozen period! How it spatters the shingles with *spring — spring — spring!*

### X

It was in the latter end of December, upon a gloomy day that was heavy with the oppression of a coming storm. In the heart of the maple swamp all was still and cold and dead. Suddenly, as out of a tomb, I heard the small, thin cry of a tiny tree-frog. And how small and thin it sounded in the vast silences of that winter swamp! And yet how clear and ringing! A thrill of life tingling out through the numb, nerveless body of the woods that has ever since made a dead day for me impossible.

“After all,” says some one of our writers, “it is only a matter of which side of the tree you stand on, whether it is summer or winter.” Just so. But, after all, is it not a good thing to stand on the winter side during the winter? to have a winter while we have it, and then have spring? No shivering around on the spring side of the tree for me. I will button up my coat, brace my back against the winter side and shout to the hoary old monarch —

“And there ‘s a hand, my trusty fiere,
And gie ‘s a hand o’ thine ;”

and what a grip he has!

*Homeschooling is not the do-it-alone prospect it was in the 1980s, 90s, or early 2000’s, as resources–including co-ops, legal help, and curricula designed for homeschoolers–abound. Jodie Stanton (’98), Wendy Coykendall (’10), and Catherine Timmis. (’14), shared from a combined three decades of homeschooling experience during a recent webinar with Director of Alumni Engagement David Bassett. The [previous installment of this series](https://k12blog.hillsdale.edu/from-hillsdale-to-homeschooling-part-i-how-three-alumnae-are-bringing-up-the-next-generation/) highlighted philosophy, joys, and challenges of homeschooling. Below are a few aggregated practical recommendations Jodie, Wendy, and Catherine gave in answer to questions from the audience.*

**Tip #1: Network with other homeschoolers** 

It’s important to build a homeschool community. While conventions can be overwhelming, they can also be a way to learn about curricula or strike up a conversation with a fellow homeschooler about shared experiences and challenges. Networking can also take place through social media platforms where local homeschool groups often form a presence, or by means of a local library. Participation level in a co-op, such as whether you want your child taking classes from another adult, naturally will vary based on your goals for homeschooling. Just know that you’re not alone, that people who have a shared vision of education are out there. A co-op can be a helpful way to alleviate the pressure of “doing it all” for each of your children. As Wendy C. said, “A kid will say something like, ‘Oh, I wish we could just spend a week studying rocks,’ and you think, ‘I wish we could, too, but your brother still doesn’t know his times tables.’ But that’s what our homeschool co-op is for. We come up with ideas that the kids would love to learn about, and it’s a way to socialize them at the same time. They’ve done speech, writing classes for the older kids, and that sort of thing. The type of co-op you look for depends on your homeschooling style and what’s available in your area.” 

**Tip #2: Establish your calendar** 

Your calendar may align with the public school’s calendar, with school from September through May and a lengthy summer break. It may also look completely different, and that’s okay. It may even be a good thing for your family. You may end up doing science in the summer time, combining it with hikes, experiments, and observations you can’t do in the winter. You may decide to take off time during Advent or Lent as you allow a liturgical calendar to guide your year. In Catherine T.’s words, “We’re in Michigan, so there’s not as much sunlight, and it’s cold and dark. We kind of sit in that with Lenten family prayers and by going to church on Wednesdays. We feel it in the hymns that we sing and learn. And then Eastertide hits, and we stop school. That’s our big vacation. The garden is going, baby animals are being born, and it’s a time of rejoicing and celebrating after slogging through Lent. After the spring settles down, and everyone’s kind of restless in the summer, we finish some of our curriculum that we didn’t finish during the other parts of the year. For us, taking time to slow down and create a rhythm for our family has been a wonderful way to break away from the secular idea that you have to do nine months of school in a row. It’s more like six weeks on, a week off.”  

**Tip #3: Prayerfully discern between “can’t” and “won’t”** 

The massive amount of curriculum options or teaching methods can make it seem like you have to pick the right thing that works for your child, and if it doesn’t “work,” you have to keep searching. While it can be the case that a different curriculum will be a better fit, sometimes you are dealing not with a “can’t” issue (this curriculum just isn’t clicking) and a “won’t” issue, or issue of the child’s will. Prayerfully discern between the two, and be prepared to tell your child, “No, this is good for you. You’re going to do this.” In Jodie S.’s words: “You have to hold them accountable. But as a parent, it’s super important to observe whether you are pushing too hard. If you can tell that something isn’t inspiring them to try harder and it feels like it’s breaking them down, it’s not worth dying on that hill. It’s just not worth it. We have to show some grace and mercy and kindness. It requires prayer, observing your children, thinking about who they are, what they love, and what inspires them. It’s a lifetime of learning your kids and watching and loving them well.” 

**Tip #4: Remember it’s worth it** 

Days might be hard, but the years are full of joy. Homeschooling is a sanctifying work, showing us not only our children’s shortcomings but our own. In Wendy C.’s words, “It’s an education for everyone involved. It’s not just educating your children how to read and write and do math; it’s learning how to be a family and how to live in a community and how to recognize truth and beauty. And that’s something that we as parents definitely need to remember and work on. It is humbling and convicting and beautiful.”
