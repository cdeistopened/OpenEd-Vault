What were your open education/homeschool highlights of 2025?

Greetings Eddies!

This is our last newsletter before we sign off for the holidays. And what a year it's been.

The New York Times decided to close out the year with a piece about homeschoolers - and we have some thoughts. Neuroscientist and homeschool mom Claire Honeycutt put it well: "The biggest gift we can give future generations is freedom. Freedom to not be confined to a single, failing system."

More on that below - plus a recap of our most popular content from the year at the end.

Meanwhile, January community events are shaping up nicely. Once Upon a Time Week has events built around Nancy Drew, Percy Jackson, Harry Potter, and more. We're running our first-ever OpenEd Spelling Bees - three divisions, with swag for the winners.

**Mark your calendars:** Apryl Stott, a New York Times bestselling author and illustrator, is joining us for a live event on January 28th.

Have a great holiday. See you in the new year.

— Charlie *(the OpenEd newsletter guy)*

# DEEP DIVE: [What the Times Missed](https://opened.co/blog/you-can-do-this-what-the-new-york-times-misses-about-unschooling)

Last Sunday, the New York Times published a guest essay titled "[The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/opinion/home-school-isolation.html)." The author calls for mandatory registration and check-ins for all homeschoolers, based on his own painful childhood experience.

We went to our community for a response. This one, from [Dr. Claire Honeycutt](https://theclarifiedlife.substack.com/) - a neuroscientist turned homeschool mom - captures something essential about why open education is more than a trend:

> "The biggest problem in education today is the assumption that there is one perfect way to learn that suits all children everywhere under all conditions. That's never been true. No single school - or education model - will fit all kids.
>
> If you want people to return to public school, make it something worth returning to. Until then, let the parents who are upending their entire lives to be with their children do their work in peace. They are not the problem."

Open education works precisely because it refuses rigid adherence to any single approach. That flexibility lets us look clearly at what works and admit when something has flaws - whether that's unschooling, classical education, or traditional schooling itself.

Isaac's full response explores the [Nirvana Fallacy](https://opened.co/blog/you-can-do-this-what-the-new-york-times-misses-about-unschooling) at the heart of the essay - comparing a real situation to an imagined ideal. The school system that would have caught this author's pain doesn't exist. Three weeks earlier, the same New York Times published "[America's Children Are Unwell. Are Schools Part of the Problem?](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/24/magazine/youth-mental-health-crisis-schools.html)" - one in four teenage boys now diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety spiking as early as age six.

Our message to parents is simpler: you don't have to be perfect to do better than the status quo if school is failing your kid.

## PODCAST: [She Did Everything Right - Her Daughter Still Couldn't Read](https://opened.co/blog/child-struggling-to-read-what-actually-works)

[Janssen Bradshaw](https://www.instagram.com/everydayreading/) had every advantage. Former librarian. English major. Thousands of books in her home. Her first daughter tested at a 12th grade reading level in kindergarten.

Her second daughter was barely at grade level in first grade - and drifting lower.

"Learning to read is just really hard for some kids," Janssen told Ela.

She discovered what researcher Benjamin Bloom called the "[Two Sigma Problem](https://opened.co/blog/new-post-1b5f)" - students who receive one-on-one tutoring outperform 98% of students in regular classrooms. The solution wasn't more hours or harder curriculum. It was 25-minute sessions, four times a week, meeting her daughter exactly where she was.

By fifth grade, her daughter was reading at an 11th-grade level.

When Janssen asked if she was embarrassed about needing extra help, her daughter said: "Why would I be embarrassed that something was hard for me? And then I worked really hard and now I'm awesome at it."

That approach became [Savvy Learning](https://savvylearning.com/) - high-dosage tutoring delivered in small doses, now available in the OpenEd Marketplace.

# TRENDS

[Readers Are Now the Minority](https://x.com/paulg/status/2000671836992884746) - Paul Graham shares data that should alarm anyone who cares about literacy: "Readers used to outnumber non-readers 2 to 1. Now non-readers outnumber readers 3 to 1." A complete inversion within a generation.

[Parents Want Skills, Not Scores](https://www.edchoice.org/2026-fall-polling-finds-parents-value-durable-skills-development-in-schools/) - EdChoice finds 85% of parents rate "durable skills" - communication, critical thinking, adaptability - as extremely important. 45% say emphasis on these affects enrollment decisions. Meanwhile, 73% of school parents now support Education Savings Accounts.

[The Engagement Gap](https://www.the74million.org/article/student-engagement-is-key-defining-and-measuring-it-is-the-challenge/) - 92% of students say engaging lessons make school more enjoyable, but only 63% feel "highly engaged." There's a 20-point gap between what students report and what teachers perceive. Engagement is a precondition for learning - not a nice-to-have.

[The 8-Hour Day Is Made Up](https://x.com/AdamMGrant/status/1192198752527929345) - Organizational psychologist Adam Grant: "The 8-hour work day was not ordained from above for all time. It was dreamed up by humans. We can be as productive and creative in 6 focused hours as in 8 unfocused hours." Anyone who's watched their kid finish a full day of school in two hours at home already knows this.
