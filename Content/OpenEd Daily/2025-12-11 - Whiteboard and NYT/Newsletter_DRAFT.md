Greetings Eddies!

Isaac Morehouse went on The Minimalists Podcast a while back and dropped so many quotable moments that we're still working through the clips. This one involves a whiteboard, a 16-year-old, and a decision most parents would never let their kid make.

We're also covering a New York Times piece that asks a question OpenEd readers have been asking for years. The data is staggering. Preschoolers getting expelled. Kindergartners losing recess. And that's before you get to the part about autism diagnoses going from 1 in 2,500 to 1 in 31.

Let's dive in.

## A WHITEBOARD AND A DROPOUT

After being homeschooled his entire life, Isaac Morehouse's 16-year-old said he wanted to try school.

Isaac got out a whiteboard.

"What do you actually want?"

His son listed it out:

- Make money
- Spend time with friends
- Freedom to explore

They mapped the options - homeschool, unschool, private school, public school - and asked one question: where do you get the most of what you want?

He tried public school for a semester. Liked it okay. Then, he dropped out to work full-time. No diploma. No credential. No regrets.

So what about college?

"My hope," Isaac said, "is that by the time they're that age, they don't need me making decisions for them."

## 1 IN 2,500 TO 1 IN 31

The New York Times published "[America's Children Are Unwell. Are Schools Part of the Problem?](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/24/magazine/youth-mental-health-crisis-schools.html)" last month. Credit where it's due: they're being honest here.

The data:

- 1 in 4 seventeen-year-old boys diagnosed with ADHD
- Autism diagnoses went from 1 in 2,500 in the 1980s to 1 in 31 today
- 32% of adolescents diagnosed with anxiety - median onset age: 6

The article traces how No Child Left Behind and Common Core narrowed what counts as "normal" - more testing, more accountability, less recess, less play. By 2016, only eight states required daily recess in elementary schools. The track got narrower. More kids didn't fit. And we called it a disorder.

We covered this with Peter Gray on the OpenEd Podcast - how kids get depressed and anxious when they go back to school, how ER visits for mental health spike at the start of the school year.

Good to see the Times arriving at the same place.
