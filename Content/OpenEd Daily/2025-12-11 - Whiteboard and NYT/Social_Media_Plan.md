**On-Screen Text:** "My 16-year-old wanted school"

**Caption:**
His 16-year-old said he wanted to try school.

So they got out a whiteboard.

"What do you actually want?"

Money. Friends. Freedom.

They mapped where he'd get the most of what he wanted.

He tried it. Then dropped out to go work.

No diploma. No regrets.

**Post:**

His 16-year-old said he wanted to try public school.

Most parents would either say no or say yes and hope for the best.

Isaac Morehouse did something different. He got out a whiteboard.

"What do you actually want?"

His son listed:
→ Make money
→ Spend time with friends
→ Freedom to explore

They mapped out every option - homeschool, unschool, private school, public school - and asked one question:

Where do you get the most of what you want?

He tried public school for a semester. Liked it okay.

Then dropped out to work full-time.

No diploma. No credential. No regrets.

"My hope is that by the time they're that age, they don't need me making decisions for them."

The goal isn't to make the decision for them. It's to equip them to decide.

### Twitter/X - Thread

**Tweet 1:**
His 16-year-old wanted to try school.

Instead of saying no, Isaac Morehouse got out a whiteboard.

"What do you actually want?"

Here's what happened: 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
His son listed it out:

- Make money
- Spend time with friends
- Freedom to explore

They mapped every option against those desires.

Homeschool. Unschool. Private. Public.

One question: where do you get the most of what you want?

**Tweet 3:**
He tried public school for a semester.

Liked it okay.

Then dropped out to work full-time.

No diploma. No credential. No regrets.

**Tweet 4:**
"My hope is that by the time they're that age, they don't need me making decisions for them."

The whiteboard wasn't about finding the right answer.

It was about teaching him how to find his own.

### Twitter/X - Single Post Options

**Option A (Story hook):**
His 16-year-old said he wanted to try school.

Instead of saying no, he got out a whiteboard.

"What do you actually want?"

Money. Friends. Freedom.

He tried school for a semester. Then dropped out to work.

No diploma. No regrets.

**Option B (Quote-forward):**
"My hope is that by the time they're that age, they don't need me making decisions for them."

His son wanted to try school.

So they mapped it out on a whiteboard.

He tried it. Then dropped out.

The whiteboard wasn't about the answer. It was about the process.

**Option C (Contrarian hook):**
Most parents would never let their 16-year-old drop out.

Isaac Morehouse helped his son decide to.

The difference? A whiteboard and one question:

"What do you actually want?"

### LinkedIn

**Post:**

Autism diagnoses in the 1980s: 1 in 2,500

Autism diagnoses today: 1 in 31

The New York Times finally asked the question: Are schools part of the problem?

From the piece:

→ 1 in 4 seventeen-year-old boys diagnosed with ADHD
→ 32% of adolescents diagnosed with anxiety
→ Median age of anxiety "onset": 6 years old
→ By 2016, only 8 states required daily recess

Peter Gray, research professor at Boston College:

"What's happening is, instead of saying, 'We need to fix the schools,' the message is, 'We need to fix the kids.'"

No Child Left Behind. Common Core. More testing. Less play.

The track got narrower. More kids didn't fit.

And we called it a disorder.

Autism diagnoses:

1980s: 1 in 2,500

Maybe those two facts are related.
