# Weekly Oct. 23 - Social Media Suite

**Source:** Weekly newsletter on microschools movement and Dave Hoffman unschooling story

**Target:** 10-12 posts across LinkedIn (primary), Facebook, X/Twitter

**Strategy:** Focus on top 6 concepts with proven framework matches, generate 2 variations per concept where appropriate

---

## CONCEPT 1: Policy Failure → Grassroots Success

### Framework Matches Considered:
1. **Before/After Template** ✅ STRONG - Clear transformation, visual contrast
2. **Failure Story Template** ✅ STRONG - Celebrates loss that led to win
3. **Pattern Recognition** ⚠️ MODERATE - Could work but less emotional impact
4. **Reverse Framing** ✅ STRONG - "Losing became winning"

### SELECTED: Before/After + Failure Story (2 posts)

---

### POST 1A: Before/After (LinkedIn - Brand Voice)

**Before COVID:** Nevada's ESA program was blocked by courts. Not a single family could use it.

**After COVID:** 95,000 microschools serving 1.5 million students nationwide.

Sometimes losing the policy fight means winning something bigger.

When Nevada's universal education savings account died in 2015, Don Soifer and Ashley didn't pack up and go home. Families kept asking: "Can you help me start a microschool?"

They said yes.

Then yes again.

And again.

Today they support 20+ microschools across Nevada. North Las Vegas partnered with them to run microschools in rec centers and libraries.

The results?

→ Students arriving 2+ grade levels behind
→ Delivered 125% academic growth
→ At 1/4 to 1/3 of district per-pupil spending

Here's the lesson:

When policy fails, people build anyway.

And what they're building doesn't require anyone's permission.

### POST 1B: Failure Story (X/Twitter Thread)

**Tweet 1:**
In 2015, Nevada passed the nation's first universal education savings account.

The courts blocked it before a single family could use it.

That policy failure created space for something better.

**Tweet 2:**
Don Soifer and Ashley didn't go home when the ESA died.

Families kept asking: "Can you help me start a microschool?"

They said yes. Then yes again. And again.

**Tweet 3:**
Today: 20+ microschools across Nevada.

North Las Vegas runs them in rec centers and libraries.

Students arriving 2+ grade levels behind delivered 125% academic growth—at 1/4 to 1/3 the cost.

## CONCEPT 2: Credentials vs Community

### Framework Matches Considered:
1. **Pattern Recognition** ✅ STRONG - Clear pattern across founders
2. **Contrarian Truth** ✅ STRONG - Challenges credential assumption
3. **This vs That** ✅ STRONG - Traditional vs microschool contrast
4. **What If It Was Simpler** ✅ STRONG - Removes barriers
5. **Behavior Dichotomy** ⚠️ MODERATE - Less nuanced
6. **Shoutout Post** ✅ STRONG - For brand account tagging founders

### SELECTED: Pattern Recognition + This vs That (2 posts)

---

### POST 2A: Pattern Recognition (LinkedIn - Brand Voice)

We've noticed a pattern:

The most successful microschool founders don't start with credentials.

They start with community.

About half of Prenda's guides are parents without education degrees. No teaching credential required. Just a desire to create something better.

And it's working:

→ 18% increase in grade-level proficiency
→ Intrinsic motivation jumped from 27% to 62%
→ Kids who WANT to be there: 36% → 86%

The data backs it up. But numbers only tell half the story.

Here's what matters more: Students who used to drag themselves to school now actually want to be there. Parents who spent years advocating for their kids in broken systems finally feel heard.

You don't need permission.

You don't need a building.

You don't need millions in funding.

You need 8-12 families who want something different.

The rest? There are people ready to help you figure it out.

Tag someone who's been thinking about starting a microschool but doesn't think they're "qualified."

### POST 2B: This vs That (Facebook - Question Post)

What if starting a school was simpler than you thought?

**Traditional schools say:**
"You need certified teachers with degrees."

**Microschools say:**
"About half our guides are parents without credentials."

**Traditional schools say:**
"5 days a week, 180 days a year, everyone learns the same."

**Microschools say:**
"2-3 days/week, mixed ages, learn at your own pace."

**Traditional schools say:**
"It costs $15,000+ per student."

**Microschools say:**
"$2,000-15,000 with sliding scale."

Here's the result at Prenda:
→ 18% increase in grade-level proficiency
→ Intrinsic motivation: 27% → 62%
→ Kids who actually WANT to be there: 36% → 86%

The question isn't which is "better."

It's which is better for YOUR family.

## CONCEPT 3: Dave Hoffman (The Principal Who Broke Rules)

### Framework Matches Considered:
1. **Irony/Hypocrisy** ✅ STRONG - Enforcer who breaks rules for own kids
2. **Before/After** ✅ STRONG - Clear transformation
3. **Contrarian Truth** ✅ STRONG - Challenges school necessity
4. **Story Arc** ✅ STRONG - Compelling narrative

### SELECTED: Irony/Hypocrisy (1 long-form post)

---

### POST 3: Irony Post (LinkedIn - Brand Voice)

Dave Hoffman spent decades enforcing school rules as a public school administrator.

Then he broke every one for his own six kids.

His oldest daughter attended the local high school for just two hours a day—yet was still voted homecoming queen.

She toured with a choir. Competed in pageants. Did debate.

His sons played sports. Learned welding. Knocked out college math online.

The family moved repeatedly, treating geography like curriculum.

All of it counted as education.

When other parents warned that unschooling would leave "gaps," Dave had a stock answer:

"Everybody has gaps. The question is, can they learn and can they solve problems?"

His son wasn't great at textbook math.

Today, he calculates laser-level excavation for construction companies—slopes, grades, elevation to the inch. Real-world problem-solving that actually matters.

Meanwhile, Dave manages adults who can't think past, "What do you want me to do on this?" They were trained to check boxes, not create solutions.

None of Dave's six kids went to college.

All out-earn him now.

All are confident, independent problem-solvers.

The gap that matters isn't algebra.

It's initiative.

## CONCEPT 4: Real-World Math vs Textbook Math

### Framework Matches Considered:
1. **This vs That** ✅ STRONG - Clear contrast
2. **Behavior Dichotomy** ✅ STRONG - Box-checkers vs problem-solvers
3. **Contrarian Truth** ✅ STRONG - School measures wrong things
4. **Data/Numbers Story** ⚠️ MODERATE - Less applicable here

### POST 4: Behavior Dichotomy (LinkedIn - Individual Voice Option)

School measures textbook math.

The real world rewards problem-solving math.

Dave Hoffman's son wasn't great at algebra. Today he calculates laser-level excavation—slopes, grades, elevation to the inch—for construction companies.

Meanwhile, Dave manages adults with degrees who can't think past: "What do you want me to do on this?"

They were trained to check boxes, not create solutions.

The gap that matters isn't what equation you can solve on paper.

It's whether you can figure out what equation to use when there's no teacher standing over you.

That's the difference between education and credentialing.

## CONCEPT 5: Microschools Match Catholic Schools (Scale Story)

### Framework Matches Considered:
1. **Data Story** ✅ STRONG - Compelling numbers
2. **Pattern Recognition** ✅ STRONG - Movement at scale
3. **Trend Spotting** ✅ STRONG - "This isn't fringe anymore"
4. **Scale Story** ✅ STRONG - Legitimacy through numbers

### SELECTED: Data Story (1 post)

---

### POST 5: Data Story (LinkedIn - Brand Voice)

1.5 million students.

That's how many kids are enrolled in microschools nationwide.

The same number as Catholic schools.

This isn't fringe anymore.

95,000 microschools across the country. Some meet in vans that move around the city. Others use farms as their classroom. Many only gather 2-3 days per week.

You'll find classical academies teaching Latin next to nature-based Montessori pods. Faith communities next to secular project-based programs.

No two look exactly alike.

But the results look similar:

→ 76% of microschool parents are satisfied
→ 42% in traditional schools (a 25-year low)

The question isn't whether microschools "work."

It's whether one works for your family.

Because when policy fails, people build anyway.

And what they're building doesn't require anyone's permission.

## CONCEPT 6: Question the Fences, Default to Yes

### Framework Matches Considered:
1. **Philosophy Post** ✅ STRONG - Operating principle
2. **Story + Lesson** ✅ STRONG - Napkin philosophy + foster child
3. **Behavior Dichotomy** ✅ STRONG - World of no vs plane of yes
4. **Challenge/Call to Action** ✅ STRONG - Actionable wisdom

### SELECTED: Story + Lesson (1 post)

### POST 6: Philosophy Story (LinkedIn - Brand Voice)

"In a world full of no, we're a plane full of yes."

Dave Hoffman keeps this Southwest Airlines napkin on his desk at BYU Independent Study.

It reminds him that every fence has a reason—and sometimes the reason is weak.

Yesterday, he broke policy to give a 14-year-old foster child a scholarship for a university course they weren't technically eligible for.

"If this kid can take one class and feel confident, maybe they'll change their life."

Most systems are built on no.

No, you're not qualified.
No, you're not eligible.
No, you don't have the right credentials.
No, that's not how we do things.

But education should be a plane full of yes.

Yes, you can learn this.
Yes, there's a way.
Yes, we'll figure it out together.

Question the fences.
Build gates.
Default to yes.

What fence are you questioning today?

## CONCEPT 7: HR Doesn't Understand Homeschool Credentials

### Framework Matches Considered:
1. **Irony/Hypocrisy** ✅ STRONG - 81% value skills, HR asks for diploma
2. **System Failure** ✅ STRONG - Gap between employer needs and HR understanding
3. **Practical Warning** ✅ STRONG - Helpful for homeschool families
4. **This vs That** ⚠️ MODERATE - Less story

### SELECTED: System Failure (1 post)

---

### POST 7: System Failure (LinkedIn - Brand Voice)

81% of employers now prioritize skills over degrees.

But HR departments still don't understand homeschool credentials.

James Isabele had 15 years of manufacturing experience. Every certification required for the job. The interviewer loved him.

Then HR asked for his "state-issued homeschool diploma."

Spoiler alert: In most states, there's no such thing.

HSLDA had to send a letter explaining that parents issue diplomas.

James got the job.

But this shouldn't be hard.

The data is clear:
→ 81% of employers prioritize skills (LinkedIn Talent Trends)
→ But HR departments still filter for credentials that don't exist
→ Or credentials that don't matter

The gap isn't in homeschool graduates' qualifications.

It's in HR departments catching up to what their own employers already know:

Skills matter. Credentials are just paper.

If you're a homeschool grad hitting this wall: HSLDA can help. If you're an employer: train your HR department on what homeschool diplomas actually are (and aren't).

## BONUS CONCEPT: The Cost Advantage (Short-Form)

### POST 8: Data Snapshot (X/Twitter)

North Las Vegas microschools:

→ Students arrived 2+ grade levels behind
→ Delivered 125% academic growth
→ Cost: 1/4 to 1/3 of district spending

Better outcomes. Lower cost.

This is what happens when you prioritize learning over bureaucracy.
