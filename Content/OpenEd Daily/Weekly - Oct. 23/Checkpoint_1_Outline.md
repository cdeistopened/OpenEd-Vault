## Phase 2: Content Selection & Organization

### DEEP DIVE: Grant Hewitt's Microschool Primer (400-600 words)

**From Wednesday's article**: "Small Schools, Big Difference: A Primer on Microschools"

**Why this works:**
- Comprehensive, actionable guide
- Personal story (Grant's own learning disability, small school that changed his life)
- Nevada story (failed ESA → 20+ microschools built anyway)
- Diversity of models (Prenda, Acton, SKOLA, etc.)
- Data: 1.5M students, 76% satisfaction vs 42% traditional

**Structure:**
1. **Hook**: Grant's small school story (learning disability, church-funded, changed trajectory)
2. **The Nevada Turn**: Universal ESA blocked by courts → grassroots microschools thrived anyway
3. **What Makes Them Different**: Part-time schedules, mixed-age, guides not teachers
4. **The Diversity**: Van-based, farm-based, classical, Montessori, faith-based
5. **The Data**: 1.5M students, parent satisfaction, Prenda outcomes
6. **CTA**: Read full guide on finding/starting a microschool

### PODCAST HIGHLIGHT: Dave Hoffman (150-250 words)

**From Thursday's podcast/article**: "Why a Public School Principal Told Me to Homeschool My Kids"

**Key moments to feature:**
- Dave spent decades as teacher & administrator while unschooling all 6 kids
- His son: "bad at textbook math" → calculates laser-level excavation professionally
- The gap that matters: initiative and problem-solving, not algebra
- Southwest Airlines napkin philosophy: "In a world full of no, we're a plane full of yes"
- Breaking BYU policy to give 14-year-old foster kid a scholarship
- All 6 kids: no college, all out-earn him, all confident problem-solvers

**CTA**: Read full interview + listen to podcast

## TRENDS OF THE WEEK (5 items):

### 1. Employers Care More About Skills Than Diplomas—But HR Departments Don't Know It Yet
James Isabele had 15 years of manufacturing experience and every certification required for the job. The interviewer loved him—until HR asked for his "state-issued homeschool diploma." No such thing exists in most states. HSLDA sent a letter explaining that parents issue diplomas. James got the job, but the trend is clear: while 81% of employers now prioritize skills over degrees (LinkedIn), HR departments still don't understand homeschool credentials. (Source: HSLDA, LinkedIn Talent Trends)

### 2. Stop Measuring Teaching, Start Measuring Learning
Scott Ellis (MasteryTrack founder) built data dashboards that reveal uncomfortable truths. Teachers implementing mastery tracking discover they've been "wasting time"—students who passed tests have critical missing foundations, but can't get support because "the class needs to move on." Data shows where students actually are, not where the calendar says they should be. (Source: AEI interview with Rick Hess)

### 3. Microschools Now Match Catholic School Enrollment
1.5 million students are enrolled across 95,000 microschools nationwide—matching total Catholic school enrollment. Parent satisfaction: 76% in microschools vs. 42% in traditional schools (a 25-year low). Part-time schedules (2-3 days/week) are the norm, not the exception. (Source: EdChoice, Gallup)

### 4. When Policy Fails, Grassroots Succeeds—The Nevada Model
Nevada passed the nation's first universal education savings account in 2015. The Supreme Court blocked it before a single family could use it. But that policy failure created space for something different: Don Soifer and Ashley partnered with North Las Vegas to run microschools in rec centers and libraries. The city provides space, meals, and IT; nonprofits provide teaching. At the MLK Senior Center microschool, 75% of students arrived 2+ grade levels behind and delivered 125% academic growth—at one-quarter to one-third of district per-pupil spending. Now 20+ microschools across Nevada. (Source: National Microschooling Center, EdChoice podcast)

### 5. Half of Prenda Microschool Guides Have No Teaching Credentials
Prenda has helped over 1,000 adults start microschools serving nearly 10,000 students. About half are parents without education degrees. Results: 18-percentage-point increase in grade-level proficiency, student intrinsic motivation jumped from 27% to 62%, and positive feelings about school leaped from 36% to 86%.

## PARTING THOUGHT

**"In a world full of no, we're a plane full of yes."**
– Southwest Airlines napkin (Dave Hoffman's desk philosophy)

Dave Hoffman, a former public school administrator who now works at BYU Independent Study, keeps this napkin on his desk. It reminds him that every fence has a reason—and sometimes the reason is weak.

Yesterday, he broke policy to give a 14-year-old foster child a scholarship for a university course they weren't technically eligible for. "If this kid can take one class and feel confident, maybe they'll change their life."

Question the fences. Build gates. Default to yes.
