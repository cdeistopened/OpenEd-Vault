### Podcast Highlight:
- Lines 84-86: **Struck through** the Southwest napkin story (moving it elsewhere or removing from this section)
  ```
  ~~Dave keeps a Southwest Airlines napkin on his desk at BYU: "In a world full of no, we're a plane full of yes." Yesterday, he broke policy to give a 14-year-old foster child a scholarship for a university course they weren't technically eligible for. "If this kid can take one class and feel confident, maybe they'll change their life."

  Question the fences. Build gates. Default to yes.~~
  ```

### Tools - Mastery Platforms:
- Line 119: Added note `{everyone knows Khan academy - tell them something they don't know}`
- Line 125: Added query `{and reading?}` for Beast Academy

## Actions Needed:

1. **Subject line #4**: Confirm this is the preferred one (marked with ***)
2. **Opening letter "bandwagon" joke**: Needs destination filled in `<>`
3. **Deep Dive byline**: Add "by Grant Hewitt" and "Read in browser" link
4. **Podcast Southwest napkin**: Removed from this section (it's still in Parting Thought, so that's fine)
5. **Khan Academy description**: Need something more insightful/less obvious
6. **Beast Academy**: Confirm if it includes reading or just math
7. **MasteryTrack**: Add URL for MasteryTrack

8. **All URL placeholders**: Still need to populate from URL_Mappings.md

## Notes for Framework Update:
- User likes playful humor in opening letters ("bandwagon" bit)
- Bylines should include author name + "read in browser" link
- Southwest napkin story works better as Parting Thought only (not duplicated)
- Tool descriptions should avoid obvious statements ("everyone knows...")
