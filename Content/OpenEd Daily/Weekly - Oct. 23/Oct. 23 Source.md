‍**THOUGHT:** The 75% Foundation**TREND:** Stop Measuring Teaching, Start Measuring Learning**TOOL:** Tools for Mastery-Based Learning at Home

# The 75% Foundation

We don't build houses with 75% foundations. We don't fly planes with 75% safety checks. Sal Khan of [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) fame wonders why we advance students with 75% understanding:

_"Imagine if we built homes that way. You have two weeks. Do what you can. Inspector shows up, it's 75% complete. Great! That's a C+. Start the second floor, then the third floor.”_

What happens? The whole structure collapses.

Even for "A students," a 90% on a test may seem to indicate mastery. But what if they missed every question on one topic?

# Stop Measuring Teaching, Start Measuring Learning

Scott Ellis, founder of [MasteryTrack](https://masterytrack.org/), has a slogan:

**"Stop measuring teaching. Start measuring learning."**

And thanks to new data infrastructure, schools can now build dashboards  that show where students actually are—not where the calendar says they should be. But when schools implement mastery tracking, teachers often discover uncomfortable truths.

"[They're] always horrified to learn that they have been wasting time," [Ellis says in an interview with Rick Hess.](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/whatll-it-take-for-mastery-based-learning-to-deliver/)

Students who passed tests are revealed to have critical missing foundations. But they can't get support "because the class needs to move on."

Data alone is not enough for mastery-based grading to take hold.

# Tools for Mastery-Based Learning

While [MasteryTrack](https://masterytrack.org/) provides data dashboards for classrooms, there are a number of home-based curricula offering mastery tracking:

- [**Khan Academy**](https://www.khanacademy.org/) - Free adaptive practice that ensures mastery before advancement. Works beautifully alongside MasteryTrack for math and science concepts.
- [**IXL Learning**](https://www.ixl.com/) - Practice modules with a SmartScore system requiring consistent correct answers. A score of 100 represents complete mastery.
- [**Math-U-See**](https://mathusee.com/) - Mastery-based math curriculum perfect for parents who aren't math experts. Each concept is fully mastered before moving forward.
- [**Beast Academy**](https://beastacademy.com/) - Comic-based math for grades 2-5 that emphasizes deep conceptual understanding over memorization.
- [**ALEKS**](http://www.aleks.com/) - AI-driven math system that creates personalized knowledge maps, determining exactly what a student knows and is ready to learn next.

# TUYESDAY: The Diploma Dilemma | OpenEd

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e31168e49f5b7e6f76f0e5/68f7d48708febf30f4754bac_Blog%20Post%20Thumbnail%20\(26\).png)

Greetings!

A few months ago, an OpenEd parent reached out with a familiar dilemma. [Her student had done 9th grade on the diploma path, but she was switching to non-diploma-seeking status for more flexibility](https://opened.co/blog/to-diploma-or-not-to-diploma).

Yet she had still had some concerns. "I worry a lot about not following the traditional, earn a diploma and go to college path."

Society has pushed one linear path for so long: diploma → college → job → success.

Except that path is just one among many. This week, we came across a story that helps clarify the "diploma vs. no diploma" question.

Let's dive in.

**THOUGHT:** Education as a Canvas, Not a Checklist**TREND:** When Employers Don't Understand Homeschooling**TOOL:** How to Create a Valid Diploma

# Education as a Canvas, Not a Checklist

Here's what we've been told: Follow the traditional path or risk your child's future. Get the diploma. Check the box. Move to the next checkpoint.

But [sometimes seeking a diploma imposes limits that exceed its value](https://opened.co/blog/to-diploma-or-not-to-diploma).

What's more, the definition of a "traditional path" is becoming more and more slippery. Colleges and employers care more about demonstrated skills, portfolios of work, and real-world experience.

A diploma proves you can complete requirements. A portfolio proves you can do something useful. Approach education as a canvas for growth, not a checklist of requirements.

[**Read our full breakdown: To Diploma or Not to Diploma?**](https://opened.co/blog/to-diploma-or-not-to-diploma)

# When Employers Don't  Understand Homeschooling

James Isabele Jr. began working in manufacturing shortly after graduating high school. 15 years later, he had certifications in inventory management, shipping and receiving, and forklift operation—everything required for a new job opportunity that came up. The interviewer loved his experience and everything seemed to be going well... until they asked for his "state-issued homeschool diploma."

[James called the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), which sent a letter to the company noting that there's no such thing as a "state-issued homeschool diploma" in most states](https://hslda.org/post/employer-asks-homeschool-grad-for-state-issued-diploma-it-doesn-t-exist). Instead, _parents_ are empowered to issue diplomas.

Lucky for James, his mom had kept records and documented his entire high school program. Shortly after receiving HSLDA's letter with those documents attached, James got the job.

**The lesson**: Keep records. Keep transcripts. Even if your teen isn't going for a diploma now, these might come in handy!

[**Read HSLDA Breakdown**](https://hslda.org/post/employer-asks-homeschool-grad-for-state-issued-diploma-it-doesn-t-exist)

# How to Create a Valid Diploma

If you wish to issue a diploma yourself, here are some options:

**Quick DIY**: Canva (search "homeschool diploma"), Google Docs templates, Twinkl

**Professional print**: [HomeschoolDiploma.com](http://homeschooldiploma.com/) (starts at $34.99), DiplomaPrints

**What to include**: School name, student's full name, graduation statement & date, parent signatures, optional seal

**California note**: Most CA homeschoolers use a Private School Affidavit (PSA)—you're legally a private school and can issue diplomas.

**Need a notary?** Generally no. Transcripts and signatures matter more.

# WORD OF THE DAY

**Credentialism** (noun): The practice of overemphasizing credentials—especially academic degrees—in hiring and admissions, often at the expense of practical skills or real-world experience.

**Example**: "James had 15 years of proven manufacturing experience, but credentialism nearly cost him the job when compliance fixated on a diploma that doesn't exist."

# **PODCAST: Why a Public School Principal Told Me to Homeschool My Kids[Ela Richmond**October 23, 2025](https://opened.co/authors/ela-richmond)**View Transcript**

**From FBI Rejection to a Classroom Mission** Dave came to education almost by accident. He studied Spanish and communications because he wanted to join the FBI. He made it to the final interview with nine agents, failed, and suddenly had a degree with no plan. “I figured I’d teach while I waited,” he told me. “And I never reapplied. I started subbing in Salt Lake City, then we moved to Southern California so I could launch a full-time teaching career.” He fell in love with the classroom fast. “I couldn’t believe I got paid to do it,” he said. He coached basketball and water polo, ran peer tutoring, covered hospital-homebound instruction — anything the school needed. Teaching Spanish, he refused to march page by page with the textbook. He cracked jokes, slowed down when the class needed it, and created the kind of room where teenagers begged to stay. This is the part of Dave’s story that sounds familiar to every great teacher I know. They live to watch the lightbulb flicker on. **The Homeschooling Turn That Started in Kindergarten** The plot twist arrived with kindergarten. Dave and his wife, Diana, enrolled their oldest daughter in a charter school run by friends. Within weeks, their bubbly five-year-old turned sassy and distant. “We shadowed the class and thought, ‘There’s nothing happening here we couldn’t do at home,’” Dave said. “Her two younger sisters missed her like crazy. So we brought her back.” They tried first grade the next year; same result. Eventually the Hoffmans stopped trying to make conventional school fit. They joined local co-ops, stacked library cards, and slid toward full-time homeschooling. To be precise, they slid toward unschooling. “If it looked anything like school, we threw it out,” Dave said. “Schooling and education are different things.” They stopped worrying about grade-level benchmarks and started chasing curiosity. The kids picked their own homeschool curriculum piecemeal: a welding class at the district’s ALC here, a debate league there, water polo with the local high school, mock trial sponsored by OpenEd. “We mixed and matched everything,” Dave said. “If something stopped working, we quit. If something lit them up, we doubled down.” **Inside the Charter School Machine** Meanwhile, Dave climbed the administrative ladder. He wanted a bigger paycheck — six kids, one income — but he also wanted a larger impact. The reality was darker. “Half my time was discipline or damage control,” he said. “Parents came in hot. Teachers melted down in my office. I had the police on speed dial at supposedly ‘good’ charter schools. We dealt with theft, drugs, even staff affairs. The soap opera never stopped.” He loved assemblies, dances, and the rare hours spent observing great teachers. But the job made him an enforcer more than an educator. **School Choice as an Education Freedom Strategy** That’s when the dissonance between the system and his own family became impossible to ignore. Dave watched his kids thrive in a homeschool community built on choice, while his campuses fought to keep attendance from slipping. He describes himself as a market realist. “Choice is already reshaping everything, and that’s a good thing,” he told me. “Education Savings Accounts and vouchers force every school — public, charter, private — to become the place families actually choose. Once schools operate in a competitive environment instead of a monopoly, innovation follows.” Critics argue that school choice lets the privileged escape while everyone else stays stuck. Dave pushed back hard. “It’s limited thinking,” he said. “We had at least twenty percent special education students in every school I led — just like the neighborhood campuses. We took whoever came. We couldn’t turn them away even if we wanted to.” He pointed to the new wave of ESA programs leveling the financial playing field. “For decades I paid taxes into a system I never used because we homeschooled. Now those dollars can follow kids to micro-schools, pods, private campuses — whatever fits. Choice isn’t about skimming the cream. It’s about acknowledging families have different needs and letting them pursue them.” **Designing a Mobile Homeschool Curriculum** What does pursuing it look like? In the Hoffman house, it looked like packing up and moving — repeatedly. Because Dave could get a teaching or principal job in any district, he treated geography like a curriculum. The family lived on five acres with chickens one year, downtown in another state the next. “All of it counted as education,” he said. They Googled local homeschool groups, walked into curriculum stores, and let one introduction lead to a dozen more. “My oldest daughter only attended the local high school for two hours a day, but she was still homecoming queen,” he laughed. “She toured with a choir, competed in pageants, and did debate. The boys played sports, learned welding, knocked out college math online. We just kept asking, ‘What do you want to try next?’” **The Myth of Learning Gaps** If you’re a rule-following parent, you might break out in hives hearing this. I did. Dave and Diana decided their kids would learn to read when they were ready, not when a scope-and-sequence said so. “All their Sunday school teachers worried because they couldn’t read at six,” Dave remembered. “We’d say, ‘We’re good. They’ll read when they’re ready.’ They all started around seven or eight, and then they never stopped. They still devour books.” When other parents warned that unschooling would leave “gaps,” Dave had a stock answer: “Everybody has gaps. The question is, can they learn and can they solve problems?” That obsession with problem-solving might be the thread that ties Dave’s two lives together. “I work with grown adults who can’t think past, ‘What do you want me to do?’” he said. “They’ve been trained to wait for instructions.” His antidote is to let kids solve real problems early — build something, run an event, negotiate a schedule. That’s why he didn’t panic when his son struggled with algebra. “Now he does laser-leveled excavation for construction companies,” Dave said. “He calculates things that actually matter. None of my kids have gone to college. They all make more money than I do, and they’re happy.” **BYU Independent Study and the New Homeschool Tools** Dave’s day job now is at BYU Independent Study, where he helps families stitch together custom learning plans without surrendering structure. The program has 215 middle and high school courses — everything from STEM to nine different language tracks to niche PE like cycling. But the secret sauce is a design framework he calls KSA: Knowledge, Skills, Attributes. “In biology, for example, they still learn the standards, but they also practice critical thinking and explore resilience,” he explained. Students can even earn micro-credentials for going deeper, a digital badge they can attach to scholarship apps or resumes. It’s the opposite of conveyor-belt schooling. It’s an à la carte menu for families who want academic rigor without losing flexibility. And yes, he still breaks rules. “I work for a big institution — we’re not always agile,” he admitted. “We have set policies, and I buck them on behalf of the customer.” Last week he pushed through a scholarship for a fourteen-year-old foster student to take psychology. “Technically against policy,” he said. “But she’s about to age out. If she can take college classes now, she’ll see she’s smart enough to keep going. So I broke the policy, got her the scholarship, and she starts this year.” That, to me, is what real school leadership should look like: say yes first, then figure out the paperwork. **Parents as Education Designers** If Bari Weiss were ghostwriting this piece, she’d probably end on a manifesto: Parents, reclaim your children. I’m not quite that declarative — yet. But I am persuaded that the most interesting educators in America are the ones refusing to pick sides in the old wars of public versus private versus homeschool. Dave Hoffman is still in the building. He’s also at his kitchen table. He’s designing programs at BYU while telling parents to pull their kids out if that’s what the child needs. The surprise isn’t that a principal supports homeschooling. The surprise is how obvious he makes it sound. So here’s my invitation to you, especially if you feel your child is wilting in a classroom that was never built for them: become an education designer. Talk to the homeschool community down the street. Audit an online course. Ask for the exception. Bend the rule that isn’t serving your kid. The future Dave describes isn’t one where schools disappear; it’s one where they have to earn our trust every single day. That’s a future worth choosing — and it starts with parents willing to do what the Hoffmans did: follow curiosity, trust competence over compliance, and say yes to the adventure. ‍Ab**out the authorEla RichmondEl**a Richmond is the host of the OpenEd Podcast and In Bloom Podcast and a member of the Market Team at OpenEd, where she helps pioneer the “open education” movement—empowering families to design unique learning experiences by drawing from every available option.

[**Resources](https://opened.co/blog)[Daily’s](https://opened.co/blog/a-public-school-administrator-shares-the-truth-about-homeschooling) A public school administrator shares the truth about homeschooling[Ela Richmond**October 23, 2025](https://opened.co/authors/ela-richmond) Greetings! In this week's podcast, I talk with Dave Hoffman, who spent decades as a public school teacher and administrator before joining [**BYU Independent Study**](https://indstudy.byu.edu/). Meanwhile, all six of his own kids were mainly unschooled. They turned out just fine—better than fine, actually.  Let's dive in. **THOUGHT:** Mind the Gap**TREND:** Be a Plane Full of Yes**TOOL:** BYU Independent Study **Mind the Gap** Everyone worries about homeschool "gaps"—missing algebra, skipped geometry, incomplete transcripts. [**But Dave Hoffman, a former public school administrator who unschooled all six of his kids**](https://opened.co/blog/why-a-public-school-principal-told-me-to-homeschool-my-kids), noticed a different gap: schools teach kids to follow instructions, not solve problems. His son wasn't great at textbook math. Today, he calculates laser-level excavation for a living—slopes, grades, elevation to the inch. Real-world problem-solving that actually matters. Meanwhile, Dave manages adults who freeze when asked to strategize. "I can't get some of them to think past, 'What do you want me to do on this?'" They were trained to check boxes, not create solutions. None of Dave's kids went to college. All six out-earn him. All are confident, independent problem-solvers. Turns out the gap that matters isn't algebra. It's initiative. [**Watch the clip](https://x.com/OpenEdHQ/status/1981382474426159312) A Plane Full of Yes** Dave fights rigid policies constantly at BYU. Yesterday, he broke the rules to give a 14-year-old foster child a scholarship for a university course they weren't _technically_ eligible for. The kid was aging out of the system, convinced they weren't smart enough for college. "If this kid can take one class, just one, and feel confident, maybe they'll change their life." So he ignored the policy. What gave him the inspiration? A Southwest Airlines napkin: _"In a world full of no, we're a plane full of yes."_ That's his motto now. There's always a fence, Dave says—and you have to ask, "Why is it here?" If the reasoning is weak, build a gate. Decades inside "Big Education" taught him which fences to ignore. What if every parent approached learning this way? Default to yes. Question the arbitrary nos. Trust your instinct. [**Read the full conversation](https://opened.co/blog/why-a-public-school-principal-told-me-to-homeschool-my-kids) BYU Independent Study** [**BYU Independent Study**](https://indstudy.byu.edu/), where Dave works, is one of the most popular curriculum options among OpenEd families. **What makes it work:** You get university-backed curriculum without rigid schedules. Students can pick and choose courses that fit their needs, moving at their own pace. It's the best of both worlds—institutional credibility meets family autonomy. **The Math Program That Finally Clicked** If your kid says "I'm bad at math," try [**Teaching Textbooks**](https://www.teachingtextbooks.com/) before you believe them. Dave's son went from hating math to passing college algebra at 17—just by finding the right fit. You don't need to be a math expert. You need the right tool.**About the authorEla Richmond**Ela Richmond is the host of the OpenEd Podcast and In Bloom Podcast and a member of the Market Team at OpenEd, where she helps pioneer the “open education” movement—empowering families to design unique learning experiences by drawing from every available option.

[**Resources](https://opened.co/blog)[Articles](https://opened.co/blog/small-schools-big-difference-a-primer-on-microschools) Small Schools, Big Difference: A Primer on Microschools[Grant Hewitt**October 22, 2025](https://opened.co/authors/grant-hewitt) The small school that changed my life looked nothing like a typical school. I didn't know until my thirties that a church had paid for a large portion of my early education. I have a learning disability—nothing debilitating, but enough to make traditional classrooms really hard. My mother, a single mom, looked for something different. Then colleagues told her about a private school run by a local church that helped kids with special needs—what today might be called a microschool. I went. I thrived. That small school changed my trajectory. Years later, when I was working to help Nevada bring forward the first universal [**education savings account**](https://www.edchoice.org/school-choice/education-savings-account/) in the country, I was fighting for other families to have the choices my mother had found for me. The courts shut it down in 2015 before a single family could use it. But over the past decade, I've watched something bigger than any policy win emerge—a grassroots movement reshaping how millions of families think about education. And microschools are at the center of it. **What Is a Microschool?** At its most basic, a microschool is a small, intentionally-designed learning environment—typically serving between 5 and 150 students, with a [**median of 16 students**](https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/education/4574859-the-us-is-experiencing-a-boom-in-microschools-what-are-they/). But size may be the _least_ interesting thing about them. **Part-time schedules are common.** Most microschools meet 2-3 days per week. This isn't "partial" education—it's intentional design recognizing that learning happens everywhere, not just during designated school hours. Families can keep their kids connected to neighborhood activities, sports teams, or other programs while accessing high-quality, structured learning environments. **Mixed-age groupings are by design.** A microschool might have 4-year-olds learning alongside 12-year-olds. Age mixing creates natural mentorship and removes artificial pressure to keep everyone moving at the same pace. **Facilitators or guides instead of traditional teachers.** Microschools often embrace the "guide on the side" rather than the "sage on the stage." Adult guides facilitate learning, ask questions, and help students find answers rather than delivering lessons from the front. At [**Prenda**](https://www.prenda.com/), the nation's largest microschool network, about half their guides are parents without teaching credentials. **Each serves a specific community or philosophy.** Rather than trying to be all things to all people, microschools tend to have distinct identities—nature-based learning, classical education, project-based learning, or serving twice-exceptional students.  **Legally, most operate as independent study programs, learning centers, or enrichment programs** rather than traditional schools. This allows them to serve families with more flexibility and less red tape. **Why Now?** There are very few times in American history where everyone experienced the exact same pain point at the exact same time. Even 9/11, which sparked amazing patriotism across America, felt vastly different if you were in New York or Washington versus watching it unfold on the Today Show from somewhere else. But during COVID, almost every parent in America experienced the exact same school closures for two weeks... then two months... then longer. "Zoom school" wasn't working. Kids were struggling. Parents were drowning. And suddenly, millions of families who'd never questioned their local school were asking: _**"Is there another way?"**_ We might call it the "Great Education Migration." It started during COVID, but it hasn't stopped. My friend [**Kerry McDonald**](https://www.liberatedpodcast.com/), a leading voice in the microschooling movement, notes: "Early microschool classes—kindergarten and first grade—are now filling with students who've never been in a conventional classroom. These are parents choosing unconventional education right out of the gate." Today, there are as many students attending microschools as there are enrolled in Catholic schools—roughly [**1.5 million students spread out across 95,000 microschools nationwide**](https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/education/4574859-the-us-is-experiencing-a-boom-in-microschools-what-are-they/). **How It Happened: The Nevada Story** My home state shows exactly how this grassroots movement unfolded—and why it succeeded where top-down policy failed. Nevada was supposed to be the universal school choice story. In 2015, legislators passed the nation's first universal education savings account. Then the Nevada Supreme Court blocked the funding mechanism before a single family could use it. But that policy failure created space for something different. Don Soifer, a longtime education reformer, and his now-wife Ashley didn't pack up and go home.  "We started hearing from different folks saying, 'Hey, I'd really like to start a microschool. Can you help me?'" [**Ashley recalls**](https://www.edchoice.org/podcast/ep-275-25-years-with-michael-chartier-and-don-soifer-the-nevada-story/). What began as a one-off project became a hub supporting over 20 schools across Nevada. North Las Vegas partnered with Don’s organization, Nevada Action for School Options, to run microschools in rec centers and libraries. The city provided space, meals, and IT support. The nonprofit provided the teaching model and facilitators. Their organization evolved into the [**National Microschooling Center**](https://www.nationalmicroschooling.org/) in 2020 as a pandemic response partnership with North Las Vegas city leadership. One of those partnerships happened at the Martin Luther King Jr. Senior Center. A thriving community hub with unused space during school hours. The nonprofit provided the teaching model. Kids show up in the morning, work through self-paced curriculum on tablets, break for lunch provided by the city, then spend afternoons on projects, field trips, and social activities. The city isn't running the school. The school isn't competing with the district. It's just filling a need. Creating an option where one didn't exist. And the kids who attend? Most were already struggling in traditional settings. Three-quarters of students arrived two or more grade levels behind. The program delivered 125% academic growth compared to typical gains. The all-in cost? Between one-quarter and one-third of the district's per-pupil spending. I've called Nevada "the perfect storm"—families needing change, innovative educators, and a regulatory environment that made it possible. But it's also something more: a perfect example of how new models emerge when we move beyond partisan debates. The language of open education and public-private partnerships proved more inclusive and pragmatic than traditional battle lines. When we stop arguing about labels and start solving problems, innovation happens. And the solutions taking shape across the country look remarkably different from each other—which is exactly the point. **The Diversity of Models** What makes the microschool landscape so compelling is its diversity. There's no single "microschool model"—there are dozens of approaches, each serving different families and philosophies. [**Acton Academy**](https://www.actonacademy.org/), with over 300 schools globally, pioneered a distinctive approach. Students work on long-term projects called "quests"—deep dives lasting 5-7 weeks on topics like entrepreneurship, robotics, or filmmaking. There are no grades, ever. The classroom is organized as a "studio" where learners take different roles. Adults function as Socratic guides, asking questions rather than providing answers. A 12-year-old might spend mornings on adaptive math software, then afternoons building a business or studying the Roman Empire through primary sources. At [**Primer**](https://primer.com/) microschools, students spend 100 minutes each on math and reading each morning, working toward individualized five-week goals. Afternoons are for "earnest work"—passion projects where students design apps, start podcasts, or build businesses. At [**SKOLA**](https://skolamicroschool.com/) in Minnesota, three hours of daily outdoor time isn't just recess—it's where real learning happens. Eleyah Knight [**runs Connected Teens in California, a van-based microschool where the van is the classroom**](https://opened.co/blog/how-to-create-a-thriving-educational-micro-community-the-complete-guide-eleyah-knight). Her philosophy centers on holistic health over early career tracking. "If you address holistic health while they're young, they won't end up in their 30s with chronic diseases, wondering what happened to their childhood." The landscape is remarkably diverse: Montessori microschools bring child-led learning to small settings. Sudbury schools feature self-directed learning. [**Special needs microschools serve twice-exceptional and neurodivergent students**](https://specialneedsanswers.com/microschools-as-an-option-for-students-with-disabilities-20580). Faith-based microschools integrate religious instruction. Classical microschools teach Latin and great books. Hybrid models combine online curriculum with in-person facilitation. Farm and orchard-based microschools use agricultural land as the learning context. **Do Kids Actually Learn?** Many people assume that "different" means "lower standards." It doesn't. In fact, the data suggests the opposite. If this sounds loosey-goosey, here's what matters: many microschools don't position themselves as the sole source of academics. They recognize that core skills can often be delivered efficiently through online platforms or brief instruction—freeing in-person time for what humans do best: complex play, creative projects, mentorship, and community building. [**Prenda students show 18 percentage point increases in grade-level proficiency**](https://www.prenda.com/post/persist-progress-prenda-the-results-of-a-research-aligned-learning-model-and-culture) in both math and reading. Students' intrinsic motivation jumps from 27% to 62%. Positive feelings about school leap from 36% to 86%. Across microschools generally, [**76% of parents report being "very satisfied,"**](https://www.edchoice.org/2024-edchoice-share-exploring-where-americas-students-are-educated/) compared to [**just 42% for traditional schools**](https://news.gallup.com/poll/394784/satisfaction-k-12-education-low-second-straight-year.aspx) (a 25-year low). The data is admittedly limited—when you're not standardizing education, you're not standardizing measurement. The [**RAND Corporation's 2025 study**](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA3698-1.html) acknowledges both the promise and the challenge: outcomes data remains "unavailable, inconsistent, or unrepresentive." Quality varies dramatically across microschools. But what the data can't capture is what I see when I visit these spaces: kids who actually want to be there. Parents who feel heard. Families who've found something that works—not perfectly, but better than what they had before. **Finding and Joining a Microschool** Finding a microschool isn't like finding a traditional school—there's no district boundary or central directory. But the search is increasingly accessible. **Start local and specific.** Search "[your city] microschool" and "[your city] learning pod." Check the [**National Microschooling Center's directory**](https://www.nationalmicroschooling.org/). Join state and local homeschool Facebook groups, where many microschools market. **Ask the right questions.** Instead of "What's your curriculum?" ask "How do you handle kids at different levels?" Instead of "What's your teacher-student ratio?" ask "How do you handle conflicts?" Instead of "What are your test scores?" ask "What does a typical day look like?" **Visit during regular school hours,** not just polished open houses. Trust your gut. **Focus on values alignment.** What matters most? Religious or secular? Nature-based or academic? Structured or child-led? Two days or four? Costs typically range from $2,000-15,000 annually, though many offer sliding scale pricing and scholarships. In some states, support from programs that provide educational funding can make microschools more financially accessible. **Starting Your Own Microschool** The support infrastructure for starting a microschool has grown significantly. The [**National Microschooling Center**](https://www.nationalmicroschooling.org/) offers resources and networking without requiring you to adopt a specific model. They provide research, directory services, and connections to state incubators in places like Mississippi and Indiana that offer startup support and coaching. It's a valuable starting point for understanding the landscape and exploring different approaches. [**Prenda**](https://www.prenda.com/) provides one of the most comprehensive models. Founded by Kelly Smith (an MIT-trained engineer who started with seven kids around his kitchen table), Prenda has helped over 1,000 adults start microschools serving nearly 10,000 students. The model provides complete curriculum, training, and ongoing support—no education degree required. The program is built around four "modes" of learning each day: Connect Mode, Conquer Mode, Collaborate Mode, and Create Mode. Prenda handles the curriculum, learning management system, and guide training, letting you focus on creating a joyful learning environment. Guides typically run microschools of 5-10 students, 3-4 days per week. Dalena Wallace, a Kansas homeschooler-turned-microschooler and mother of six, had been homeschooling her kids when she realized, "This is hard. I need community." She opened a Prenda microschool in her home with three families. Within months, she had 16. Wallace [**captured what this shift meant**](https://opened.co/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-microschools-the-educational-trend-growing-faster-than-homeschooling): "We've realized we don't have to have traditional private school options. They don't have to be so expensive. They don't have to be five days a week. They don't have to be in a traditional brick and mortar school." Wallace went on to found Wichita Innovative Schools and Educators (WISE), as well as the AIM Educational Collaborative, which aims to help other parents do what she did. [**Primer**](https://www.withprimer.com/) takes a project-based approach where students spend mornings on core academics through personalized learning software, then afternoons on "earnest work"—passion projects where they design apps, start podcasts, or build businesses. Primer provides the full curriculum framework and guide training for schools that want to emphasize student agency and real-world application. [**KaiPod Learning**](https://www.kaipodlearning.com/) pairs online learning with in-person coaching. Rather than providing curriculum, KaiPod lets families choose their own while offering community and support. Through their Catalyst program, they've increased the success rate of aspiring founders from 10% to 60%. As founder Amar Kumar explains: "Sometimes just inertia gets in the way." [**Education Innovators**](https://www.educationinnovators.org/), founded by Jon England, empowers teachers to create their dream schools. After 14 years as a public school teacher and principal, England now supports educators in launching microschools where students excel and teachers rediscover their passion. The organization offers school launch guidance, fosters peer networks for innovators, and advocates for policies to eliminate barriers. England has supported over 100 schools, mentored 20+ founders, and leads a mastermind group for school growth. A minimum viable microschool typically needs 8-12 committed families, a part-time schedule of 2-3 days weekly, and a space to meet(often leased inexpensively from a church or community center) rather than a permanent facility. The psychological hurdle is often bigger than the logistical one. Letting go of what school "should" look like takes courage. The permission you're really seeking isn't from the state—it's from yourself. **Your Next Step** If you're considering a microschool, start by identifying your non-negotiables. Research local options. Visit during regular hours. Talk to current families. Consider starting part-time. Most importantly: remember that you're not abandoning everything else. You're not declaring war on your local school or your homeschool co-op or whatever else is working. You're just adding what's missing. The microschool landscape is diverse, growing, and increasingly accessible. Whether you're drawn to nature-based learning, classical academics, project-based approaches, or something else entirely, there's likely a model that aligns with your family's values. The question isn't whether you'll "choose microschooling" or stay in traditional school. The question is: what's the right mix for your family, right now? Take what you need. Leave what doesn't serve you. Build the educational approach that works for your family. That's open education. _Grant Hewitt is VP of Partnerships at OpenEd.
