# DEEP DIVE: Small Schools, Big Difference

{by grant hewitt | read in browser}

The small school that changed my life looked nothing like a typical school.

I didn't know until my thirties that a church had paid for a large portion of my early education. I have a learning disability—nothing debilitating, but enough to make traditional classrooms really hard. My mother, a single mom, looked for something different. Then colleagues told her about a private school run by a local church that helped kids with special needs—what today might be called a microschool.

I went. I thrived. That small school changed my trajectory.

Years later, when I was working to help Nevada bring forward the first universal education savings account in the country, I was fighting for other families to have the choices my mother had found for me. The courts shut it down in 2015 before a single family could use it.

But here's what I didn't expect: that policy failure created space for something better.

Don Soifer and his now-wife Ashley didn't pack up and go home when the ESA died. They started hearing from people asking, "Can you help me start a microschool?" What began as a one-off project became a hub supporting over 20 schools across Nevada. North Las Vegas partnered with their nonprofit to run microschools in rec centers and libraries—the city provides space, meals, and IT support while nonprofits provide the teaching model.

At the Martin Luther King Jr. Senior Center, most students arrived two or more grade levels behind. The program delivered 125% academic growth compared to typical gains. The all-in cost? **Between one-quarter and one-third of the district's per-pupil spending.**

Today, there are 1.5 million students attending microschools nationwide—the same number enrolled in Catholic schools. These schools all look wildly different from each other. Van-based schools where the classroom moves. Farm schools using agricultural land as learning context. Part-time models meeting 2-3 days per week. Classical academies teaching Latin. Montessori pods. Faith-based communities. Hybrid programs mixing online curriculum with in-person facilitation.

At Prenda, the nation's largest microschool network, about half their guides are parents without teaching credentials. Students show an 18-percentage-point increase in grade-level proficiency. Intrinsic motivation jumps from 27% to 62%. Positive feelings about school leap from 36% to 86%.

Parent satisfaction tells the story: 76% in microschools versus 42% in traditional schools (a 25-year low).

**The question isn't whether microschools "work." It's whether one works for your family.** Because when policy fails, people build anyway. And what they're building doesn't require anyone's permission.

# PODCAST HIGHLIGHT: The Principal Who Unschooled Six Kids

Dave Hoffman spent decades enforcing school rules as a public school teacher and administrator. Then he broke every one for his own kids.

His oldest daughter attended the local high school for just two hours a day—yet was still voted homecoming queen. She toured with a choir, competed in pageants, did debate. His sons played sports, learned welding, knocked out college math online. The family moved repeatedly, treating geography like curriculum. "All of it counted as education," Dave told me.

When other parents warned that unschooling would leave "gaps," Dave had a stock answer: "Everybody has gaps. The question is, can they learn and can they solve problems?"

His son wasn't great at textbook math. Today, he calculates laser-level excavation for construction companies—slopes, grades, elevation to the inch. Real-world problem-solving that actually matters.

Meanwhile, Dave manages adults at BYU Independent Study who can't think past, "What do you want me to do on this?" They were trained to check boxes, not create solutions.

None of Dave's six kids went to college. All out-earn him. All are confident, independent problem-solvers.

**The gap that matters isn't algebra. It's initiative.**

~~Dave keeps a Southwest Airlines napkin on his desk at BYU: "In a world full of no, we're a plane full of yes." Yesterday, he broke policy to give a 14-year-old foster child a scholarship for a university course they weren't technically eligible for. "If this kid can take one class and feel confident, maybe they'll change their life."

Question the fences. Build gates. Default to yes.~~

# TRENDS OF THE WEEK

### Employers Care More About Skills Than Diplomas—But HR Departments Haven't Caught Up
James Isabele had 15 years of manufacturing experience and every certification required for the job. The interviewer loved him—until HR asked for his "state-issued homeschool diploma." **Spoiler alert:** In most states, there's no such thing. HSLDA sent a letter explaining that parents issue diplomas. James got the job, but the trend is clear: while 81% of employers now prioritize skills over degrees (LinkedIn), HR departments still don't understand homeschool credentials. (Source: [HSLDA](NEED_HSLDA_LINK), LinkedIn Talent Trends)

### Stop Measuring Teaching, Start Measuring Learning

Scott Ellis (MasteryTrack {needs URL} founder) built data dashboards that reveal uncomfortable truths. Teachers implementing mastery tracking discover they've been "wasting time"—students who passed tests have critical missing foundations, but can't get support because "the class needs to move on." Data shows where students actually are, not where the calendar says they should be. (Source: [AEI interview with Rick Hess](NEED_AEI_LINK))

### Microschools Now Match Catholic School Enrollment

1.5 million students are enrolled across 95,000 microschools nationwide—matching total Catholic school enrollment. Parent satisfaction: 76% in microschools vs. 42% in traditional schools (a 25-year low). Part-time schedules (2-3 days/week) are the norm, not the exception. (Source: EdChoice, Gallup)

### When Policy Fails, Grassroots Succeeds—The Nevada Model

Nevada passed the nation's first universal education savings account in 2015. The Supreme Court blocked it before a single family could use it. But that policy failure created space for something different: Don Soifer and Ashley partnered with North Las Vegas to run microschools in rec centers and libraries. The city provides space, meals, and IT; nonprofits provide teaching. At the MLK Senior Center microschool, 75% of students arrived 2+ grade levels behind and delivered 125% academic growth—at one-quarter to one-third of district per-pupil spending. Now 20+ microschools across Nevada. (Source: National Microschooling Center, [EdChoice podcast](NEED_EDCHOICE_PODCAST_LINK))

### Half of Prenda Microschool Guides Have No Teaching Credentials

Prenda has helped over 1,000 adults start microschools serving nearly 10,000 students. About half are parents without education degrees. Results: 18-percentage-point increase in grade-level proficiency, student intrinsic motivation jumped from 27% to 62%, and positive feelings about school leaped from 36% to 86%.

# PARTING THOUGHT

**"In a world full of no, we're a plane full of yes."**
– Southwest Airlines napkin (Dave Hoffman's desk philosophy)

Dave Hoffman, a former public school administrator who now works at BYU Independent Study, keeps this napkin on his desk. It reminds him that every fence has a reason—and sometimes the reason is weak.

Yesterday, he broke policy to give a 14-year-old foster child a scholarship for a university course they weren't technically eligible for. "If this kid can take one class and feel confident, maybe they'll change their life."

Question the fences. Build gates. Default to yes.
