## PREVIEW TEXT
She hated mornings. So we stopped forcing them. PLUS: The AI tool replacing expensive textbooks.

## SEGMENT 1: THE 10AM START (Thought)
**Source:** Brettani Shannon's Day in the Life (Raw Transcript/Article)
**Angle Options:**
1. **Peace > Progress:** Why starting the day with conflict (waking a sleeping child) ruins education.
2. **The "Laziness" Myth:** Why sleeping in is actually strategic for neurodiverse kids.
3. **Fitting the Education to the Child:** The contrarian take that the schedule serves the child, not vice versa.
**Recommended:** Angle 1 (Peace > Progress). It challenges the Puritan work ethic of "early to rise" and validates parents who struggle with morning battles.
**Structure:** Story of the "morning battle" -> The pivot to 10am -> The result (relationship preserved).

## SEGMENT 2: THE DEATH OF THE TEXTBOOK (Trend)
**Source:** Brettani's "Secret Weapon: DIY Unit Studies"
**Angle Options:**
1. **AI as Curriculum Director:** How parents are bypassing publishers to build hyper-personalized units.
2. **Cost-Benefit:** Free AI tools vs. $500 boxed sets.
3. **Depth vs. Breadth:** Unit studies allow for "deep dives" (Selena, Pet Adoption) vs. skimming.
**Recommended:** Angle 1 (AI as Curriculum Director). It positions the reader at the forefront of a trend where they control the content using AI.
**Structure:** The old way (buying boxes) -> The new way (Perplexity prompts) -> The outcome (Engagement).

## SEGMENT 3: SYNTHESIS (Tool)
**Source:** Brettani's "The Tech Stack" section
**Angle Options:**
1. **Gamifying the Grind:** Using Synthesis for math facts so mom doesn't have to be the "bad guy".
2. **The "Village":** Outsourcing the subjects you hate (or argue over) to software.
3. **Agency:** "Pimples" the avatar and the power of choice in math.
**Recommended:** Angle 2 (The "Village"). It fits the theme of "preserving the relationship" found in the Thought segment.
**Structure:** The problem (hating math videos/drills) -> The solution (Synthesis) -> The benefit (Mastery without tears).

## ORTHOGONALITY CHECK
- [x] Thought (Philosophy/Schedule) and Trend (AI/Curriculum) are distinct
- [x] Aligns with OpenEd beliefs (Agency, Relationship-first, Tech-enabled)
- [x] Would Sarah forward this? (Yes, especially the permission to sleep in)
