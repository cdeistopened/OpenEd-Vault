**PREVIEW:** She hated mornings. So we stopped forcing them. PLUS: The AI tool replacing expensive textbooks.

Greetings Eddies!

We're launching a new series: **OpenEd Day in the Life**.

We're kicking it off with our Oregon parent ambassador and supermom, **Brettani Shannon**.

Brettani isn't just a homeschool parent. She's the founder of [**Options for Education**](https://www.optionsforeducation.com/), a non-profit that acts as a network of support and directory of resources for families navigating school choice.

But even supermoms have to figure out Tuesday mornings.

Brettani's approach to education is radically different. She doesn't start school until 10:00 AM. She uses AI to build custom unit studies on "Pet Adoption." And she knows exactly when to drop a math lesson to remodel a bathroom.

Today, we're looking at her "Life Happens" curriculum, the AI tool she uses to replace textbooks, and the math game that saved their sanity.

Let's dive in.

## THE 10AM START

"My daughter is not a morning person."

In a traditional school, that sentence is a diagnosis. It means 12 years of alarms, fights, rushing, and starting every single day with conflict.

Brettani Shannon chose a different path: **She waited.**

Instead of forcing a circadian rhythm that didn't exist, they sleep in. They stay in pajamas. They make tea. They read books. They don't open a laptop until 10:00 AM.

The result? By the time "school" starts, her daughter's brain is actually awake. The cortisol is low. The connection is high.

It turns out that "laziness" is often just **efficiency in disguise**. By skipping the two-hour morning battle, they get more done in four hours of focused, happy work than they ever did in six hours of resistance.

We don't have to fit the child to the schedule. We can fit the education to the child.

## THE DEATH OF THE TEXTBOOK

The old way to teach biology: Buy a $50 textbook, read Chapter 4, fill out a worksheet on mammals, forget it in two weeks.

The new way? **Ask AI to build it for you.**

Brettani uses [**Perplexity**](https://www.perplexity.ai/) to build custom "Unit Studies" based entirely on her daughter's obsessions. When her daughter got into animals, Brettani didn't buy a curriculum. She typed this prompt:

*"Create a 4-day-a-week unit study for a 4th grader who loves animals. Focus on Pet Adoption. Give me book lists, movie suggestions, and hands-on activities."*

The result wasn't a worksheet. It was a roadmap. They baked homemade dog treats (math), watched *Rescued by Ruby* (media literacy), and visited a local shelter to donate the treats (civics).

This is the shift: **Curriculum is no longer a product you buy. It's a service you generate.**

## SYNTHESIS

We can't teach everything. And sometimes, we *shouldn't* teach the things that cause the most friction.

For Brettani, that was math facts. Video lectures were boring. Worksheets caused tears.

Her solution was to outsource the "grind" to [**Synthesis**](https://www.synthesis.com/).

Synthesis turns the drudgery of mental math into a competitive, high-agency game. Her daughter named her avatar "Pimples," competes in mental math challenges, and is mastering division without a single lecture from Mom.

This is the "Village" concept of Open Education. You don't have to be the expert on everything. You just have to be the guide who finds the right tool.

When the software handles the drills, the parent gets to handle the relationship.

That's all for today!
