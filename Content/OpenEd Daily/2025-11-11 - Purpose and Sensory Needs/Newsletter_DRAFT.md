## THE BOY WHO WAS 'SUPPOSED TO' FAIL

We recently asked on Facebook: "What's a moment that reminded you why you homeschool?" The responses poured in. But one comment stood out.

Jean's son has Autism, ADHD, and severe Dyslexia. Teachers said he'd end up in the principal's office. Jean wondered if he'd ever read, ever function as an adult.

Then she got an email from a battery scientist. Her son had been working as his lab assistant. The scientist wanted to tell Jean what an awesome lab assistant her son was—and how he knew how to do things more experienced engineers couldn't. He also wanted to thank her for raising a good person.

Jean's response? "God gave him his talents. He worked hard to develop them. We just tried to stay out of the way."

In public school, Jean's son would have been pegged as disabled, forced into a square hole. Instead, homeschooling let him experiment. Let him grow where he grew best. Let him become a genius in electrical and mechanical engineering.

He never went to college. Jean even unenrolled him from MyTech High his senior year because he wouldn't do the assignments.

Now freelance engineers and YouTube creators fly him all over the country to work for them.

This is why people homeschool.

## RESEARCH CONFIRMS JEAN'S DISCOVERY

[According to Heather Malin at Stanford's Center on Adolescence](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/63532/tapping-into-the-power-of-purpose-to-engage-students), research confirms what Jean discovered: when students identify purpose in their learning, academic performance rises, persistence increases, and social belonging improves.

Malin studied how this works. She found that purposeful students explore who they are, look outward at the world beyond themselves, plan for the future, and take real action. Teen brains, she notes, are wired for exploration and impact. "If we can align school learning activity to that exploratory process," she says, "we have a powerful way to motivate teens."

Jean's son didn't need external motivation. He had purpose. Real work. Real stakes. Real people counting on him.

## THE MISSING PIECE: SAFETY FIRST

Purpose is powerful. But neurodivergent kids often can't access their purpose if their nervous system is in crisis.

[Colleen Kessler at Raising Lifelong Learners](https://raisinglifelonglearners.com/navigating-sensory-overload-actionable-strategies-for-kids-in-loud-environments/) tackles the sensory side of learning. Her core insight: participation grows from safety. You don't force a dysregulated kid to participate and hope they'll feel safe later. You build safety first.

Two key strategies stand out:

**Pre-visit recon.** Visit the space beforehand. Create a "noise map"—where are the calm zones, the watchful zones, the overwhelming zones? Identify exits and safe spots. Know the layout before asking your child to show up.

**Preload regulation.** Before entering, do 2-3 minutes of "heavy work"—wall push-ups, jumping jacks, deep breathing. Ground their nervous system first, so they can handle new input without falling apart.

The rest of her framework covers gear, signals, and celebrating every small step. [Read the full sensory support toolkit at Raising Lifelong Learners](https://raisinglifelonglearners.com/navigating-sensory-overload-actionable-strategies-for-kids-in-loud-environments/).

That's all for today!

P.S. Jean's son never needed fixing. He needed freedom. If you see yourself in this story, you're not alone.
