## THOUGHT: Jean Lambert's Story

**Source:** Facebook comment reply to "What's a moment recently that reminded you why you homeschool?"
**Author:** Jean Lambert
**Date:** Recent (2025)

### Full Story:

"I just got an email from a battery scientist my son was working for in CA last week. He wanted to tell me what an awesome lab assistant my son was, how knowledgeable he was about the equipment and how he knew how to do things much more experienced people in his field couldn't do. He also wanted to thank me for what a good person my son was. I, of course, told him God gave him his talents, and my son worked hard to develop those talents, and that my husband and I just tried to stay out of the way.

This is a son who has struggled with Autism, ADHD, and severe Dyslexia and many times during his childhood I was sure would have been in the principals office if we had put him in public school. Often times I wondered if he would ever read, or ever function as an adult.

If we hadn't homeschooled, he would have been pegged as disabled and been subjected to spending all his time being forced into a square hole, but instead he was free to experiment and grow where he grew best, and shine as the genius in electrical and mechanical engineering that he is.

This son has never gone to college and I actually unenrolled him from MyTech High his senior year because he wouldn't do any of the things on his learning plan (this was back when we reported for each subject) but now, freelance engineers and techy youtubers fly him all over the country to work for them. This is one reason I am glad we homeschool."

### Key Quotes:

1. "He wanted to tell me what an awesome lab assistant my son was... how he knew how to do things much more experienced people in his field couldn't do."
2. "If we hadn't homeschooled, he would have been pegged as disabled and been subjected to spending all his time being forced into a square hole."
3. "This son has never gone to college... but now, freelance engineers and techy youtubers fly him all over the country to work for them."

### Core Insight:

Neurodivergent child (Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia) with struggles that would have resulted in institutional labeling and punishment in traditional school. Through homeschooling freedom:
- Discovered his PURPOSE (electrical/mechanical engineering)
- Developed MASTERY through real-world work (battery scientist lab, freelance engineering)
- Bypassed college entirely, yet now works with top engineers/content creators
- Built confidence and real competence through doing what he was naturally drawn to

## TREND: Tapping Into the Power of Purpose to Engage Students

**Source:** KQED MindShift
**URL:** https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/63532/tapping-into-the-power-of-purpose-to-engage-students
**Author:** Heather Malin (Stanford Center on Adolescence + Open Future Institute's QUESTion Project)
**Date:** April 30, 2024

### Core Framework: Purpose Learning (4 Steps)

**Step 1: Self-Exploration**
- Students explore who they are, what they value
- Questions: "Are there any societal or cultural influences that have shaped your values?"
- Fosters deeper peer and teacher connections

**Step 2: Look Outward**
- Connect inner self to world beyond
- Social awareness and social responsibility exercises
- "Self-awareness is meaningless if we have no idea how to connect our inner self to the world beyond ourselves"

**Step 3: Future Planning**
- Forward thinking and goal setting
- Teens need scaffolding for this (it's neurologically challenging)
- "Mechanics of looking forward can be much more challenging for adolescents"

**Step 4: Action**
- Meaningful work outside classroom and in community
- Real opportunities to do things in the world
- "Teens need opportunities to reflect on how their actions impact others"

### Key Research Findings:

- **When students identify greater purpose in learning:** Academic performance rises, persistence increases, social belonging improves
- **Purpose and brain development:** Teen brains seek excitement, novelty, and social engagement. Aligning school learning to exploratory process is "powerful way to motivate teens"
- **Most purposeful people:** Have many meaningful intentions and "seem to get boundless energy" from them

### Three Dimensions of Purpose (Teachers Can Facilitate):

1. **Generalized and meaningful intention** — Understanding who they want to be in world, informs goal-setting
2. **Beyond-the-self motivation** — Engaging students in issues outside their lived experiences, empowering them with skills/mindset for purposeful life
3. **Goal-directed action** — Supporting teens in learning to set and work toward goals

### Key Quote:

**"If we want to really motivate students in school, we need to be giving them opportunities to have an impact beyond the classroom."** — Heather Malin

## TOOL: Navigating Sensory Overload: Actionable Strategies

**Author:** Colleen Kessler (RLL)

### Core Framework: Sensory Support Plan

**Why It Matters:**
- Sensory challenges are not bad behavior—they're hardwired needs for safety and regulation
- Participation grows from safety (not vice versa)
- "Making a plan to protect your child's nervous system comes before any events, any expectations, any social 'shoulds.'"

### Practical Strategies:

**1. Pre-Visit Recon Mission**
- Visit venues ahead of time (or preview via pictures/social stories)
- Walk the space, label sounds
- Create a "noise map" with green zones (calm), yellow zones (watch out), red zones (limit time, high stimulation)
- Identify safe spaces, exits, problem areas
- Ask organizers: Are movement breaks allowed? Can headphones be used? Is there a quiet room?

**2. Preload Regulation Before Arrival**
- 2-3 minutes of "heavy work" before entering (wall push-ups, jumping jacks, deep breathing)
- Grounds nervous system, makes easier to handle new input

**3. Gear to Soothe**
- **Free/low-cost:** Hand-over-ears signal, soft hats, hoodies, tissue as filter, sunglasses
- **Budget-friendly:** Passive ear muffs, musicians' earplugs, white noise apps
- **Mid-range:** Active noise-cancelling headphones, Loop earplugs
- Key: Normalize gear at home in fun, low-stress situations first

**4. Signals and Scripts**
- Agree on cue beforehand (hands over ears, tapping, thumbs up/down)
- When signaled, exit to predetermined spot, breathe, regroup
- Practice re-entry: peek in, stand at doorway, work up to full participation
- Praise the PROCESS, not just the outcome

**5. End with a Win—Not a Meltdown**
- Celebrate every step in self-advocacy, even if child sits out for the day
- End with praise for effort, snack, cuddle, low demands
- Regulation matters more than participation

**"What we're learning (daily) is that our kids' sensory challenges are not bad behavior—they're hardwired needs for safety and regulation."** — Colleen Kessler

## Orthogonality & Connection

**THOUGHT (Jean Lambert):**
- Neurodivergent kid thrives when freed from institutional box
- Found PURPOSE (engineering) and developed mastery through real-world work
- Never followed traditional path (no college) yet achieved professional success

**TREND (KQED/Purpose Learning):**
- When students identify purpose, academic performance and belonging increase
- Purpose requires self-exploration, looking outward, future planning, and action
- Teen brains respond to exploratory, meaningful opportunities

**TOOL (Sensory Strategies):**
- Neurodivergent kids need sensory support to access purpose-driven learning
- Practical framework for managing nervous system so kids CAN participate
- Recon → preload → gear → signals → celebration = pathway to engagement

**The Connection:**
Jean's son thrived because:
1. He was freed to EXPLORE his purpose (engineering interest)
2. He had REAL-WORLD opportunities to develop that purpose (lab work, freelance engineering)
3. His SENSORY/NEUROLOGICAL needs weren't being weaponized against him (no forced compliance)

The purpose framework explains WHY Jean's approach worked. The sensory strategies explain HOW to support kids like her son so they can access that purposeful learning.

## Notes for Newsletter

This is a powerful constellation:
- **Lived experience** (Jean's story) proves it works
- **Research** (Heather Malin) validates why it works
- **Practical toolkit** (Colleen Kessler) shows how to make it work for kids with sensory needs

All three point to the same truth: **neurodivergent kids don't need fixing. They need freedom, purpose, and their nervous systems protected.**
