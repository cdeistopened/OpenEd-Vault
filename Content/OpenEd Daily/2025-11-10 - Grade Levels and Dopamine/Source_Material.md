## THOUGHT: Teach the Child, Not the Grade Level

**Source:** Simply Charlotte Mason
**URL:** https://www.simplycharlottemason.com/teach-child-not-grade-level/
**Author:** Sonya Shafer

### Key Quotes:

1. **On age-grading's origins:**
   - "Age grading was set up in the 1800s, first in Prussia and then brought over to the United States by a man named Horace Mann. He wanted to implement age grading here because he thought it would be an efficient system for handling large groups of children."
   - "The goal was not finding the best way to help each child grow and become the best version of herself that she can be. No, the reasoning behind combining children according to age and teaching them all together was efficiency."

2. **On skill-based vs. topic-based subjects:**
   - "There are basically only two skill-based subjects: math and language arts... Everything else is topic-based: history, geography, Bible, art, music, poetry, nature study."
   - "It's very common for a child to be ready for, say, third-grade math skills while at the same time be working on second-grade or even first-grade reading skills. That's fine!"

3. **On individual pace:**
   - "Rather than thinking 'What grade?' it might be more helpful to start thinking 'What's next?'"
   - "Your child can grow at her own pace in the skill-based subjects and not worry about grade labels or staying lock-step with other kids her age."

4. **The stove burner analogy:**
   - "Working with grade labels in math and language arts is like cooking on a stove top. You might have pasta boiling on one burner and sauce simmering on another burner, and you are giving each dish what it needs to be its best."

## TREND: Screen Time & Academic Achievement Study

**Source:** Newsweek / JAMA Network Open
**URL:** https://www.newsweek.com/children-kids-parents-screens-hampering-learning-10869823
**Primary Research:** Li et al., 2025 - TARGet Kids! Cohort Study (Ontario, Canada)

### Key Findings:

1. **The data:**
   - Study tracked 5,400+ children from early childhood through grades 3 and 6
   - Every additional hour of daily screen time = 9-10% lower likelihood of higher test scores
   - Children with high screen use scored lower on reading and math tests

2. **The mechanism (two theories from Dr. Sanjeev Kothare):**
   - "Too engrossed in screen time, so they're not paying attention to the learning process"
   - "Their neurons are getting reprogrammed; the process of learning is being hampered or reduced"

3. **The specific impact:**
   - TV and digital media directly linked to lower reading/math scores
   - Video games linked to lower reading achievement (especially girls)
   - Not all screen time is equal (educational vs. high-stimulation)

4. **The call:**
   - Dr. Kothare: "Go to the conventional old times where we read them stories and did more work on actual books"
   - "These platforms may be hampering their development"
   - AAP needs to restrict screen time in "vulnerable population" during critical brain development

### Connection to TOOL segment:
This research validates what Emily Phillips is actually doing—replacing dopamine-hijacking screens with "boring" content that builds capacity instead of degrading it.

### Key Concepts:

1. **The dopamine problem:**
   - "Once you've sampled those extreme forms of 'fun'... everything else starts to look a lot more boring."
   - "I do have concern for my children developing an allergy to 'boring' activities which have been the staple of childhood for centuries, if not millennia."

2. **Modern fun vs. traditional fun:**
   - "Most of modern day fun falls into the aforementioned 'dopamine bomb' category."
   - "Up until very recently, children (and adults) were content to entertain themselves with simple (or complex) crafts, handwork, books and games."

3. **Screen time management:**
   - "Screens are an inescapable part of our world, but we made a policy early in parenthood to extend the same principles of 'fun management' to screen time as well."
   - "So much is designed now to catch the attention, to form habits and desires to the point of addiction."

4. **The solution - slow content:**
   - Focus on "calmer, slower-paced, more (but not all) learning-based shows and movies."
   - Examples: Beatrix Potter, David Macaulay, Roy Underhill's Woodwright's Shop, Irish Hands, The Snowman, My Neighbor Totoro, Mr. Rogers, Thomas the Tank Engine, Winnie the Pooh, etc.

5. **The philosophy:**
   - "I don't think small children's brains are very equipped to handle [fast-paced movies, loud music, flashy visuals] well."
   - Teaching children to appreciate subtlety and craft (handmade items, natural materials, slower narratives).

## TOOL: Dopamine Management Framework

**Conceptual source:** Both articles
**Angle:** Practical framework for evaluating whether activities/content are "dopamine bombs" or developmentally appropriate

### Framework Elements:

1. **The Three Questions Test:**
   - Does this activity/content require sustained attention or exploit rapid-fire stimulus?
   - Would a child naturally return to this, or does it require escalation to stay interesting?
   - Does this activity develop capacity or hijack it?

2. **The Capacity vs. Hijacking Spectrum:**
   - **Capacity builders:** Activities that expand what a child can tolerate, appreciate, and pursue (reading, crafting, slow play)
   - **Capacity hijackers:** Activities designed to maximize stimulus/dopamine (most modern games, Cocomelon, high-adrenaline fun)

3. **The "Boring Allergy" Prevention:**
   - Intentionally expose children to slower-paced content
   - Mix high and low stimulus (not all dopamine bombs)
   - Build tolerance for subtlety

## Orthogonality Check:

- **THOUGHT** (Charlotte Mason): Age-grading is artificial; teach individual children at their pace
- **TREND** (Withyweather): Modern dopamine hijacking creates "boring allergy"; return to slower content
- **TOOL** (Framework): How to evaluate whether activities build or hijack capacity

**Connection:** Both articles challenge modern assumptions (grades + dopamine-driven fun) and return to older, more individualized/intentional approaches.

**Does NOT repeat:** Thought is about learning pace; Trend is about stimulation management; Tool is about evaluation.
