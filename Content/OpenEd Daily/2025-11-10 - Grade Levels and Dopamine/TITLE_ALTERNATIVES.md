# Title Alternatives

## SEGMENT 1: TEACHING THE CHILD (THOUGHT)

**Current:** "TEACHING THE CHILD, NOT THE GRADE"

### Alternative Options:

**Option A:** "THE SYSTEM THAT'S STILL RUNNING"
- Focuses on the persistence and inertia of age-grading
- More provocative, "you're stuck in this" energy
- Length: Better for call-to-action feel

**Option B:** "WAREHOUSES AREN'T CLASSROOMS"
- Direct comparison, more metaphorical
- Emphasis on industrial vs. educational
- Shorter, punchier

**Option C:** "WHEN DIFFERENT ISN'T BEHIND"
- Positive reframe (we use this language)
- Directly challenges the guilt/comparison angle
- Most OpenEd-aligned

## SEGMENT 2: SCREEN TIME & BRAIN DEVELOPMENT (TREND)

**Current:** "THE BRAIN ISN'T BUILT FOR THIS"

### Alternative Options:

**Option A:** "EVERY HOUR COSTS THEM"
- From your original checkpoint—emphasizes the research/data angle
- Urgent, specific, numerical focus
- More "wake up call" energy

**Option B:** "NEURONS DON'T CATCH UP"
- Scientific/mechanism-focused
- "Reprogramming" language from Dr. Kothare
- More credentialing through neurology

**Option C:** "HOW SCREENS HIJACK LEARNING"
- Clear causal language
- Active voice (screens ARE doing something)
- More direct about intentional design

## SEGMENT 3: BORING TV (TOOL)

**Current:** "ACTUALLY GOOD TV"

### Alternative Options:

**Option A:** "WHAT ACTUALLY BUILDS CAPACITY"
- From your checkpoint—emphasizes the philosophy over the list
- More OpenEd-aligned (capacity, not compliance)
- Positions as principle, not just recommendations

**Option B:** "THE TV THAT PROTECTS BOREDOM"
- Inverts expectations (boredom is GOOD)
- More philosophical, less prescriptive
- Stickier/more memorable

**Option C:** "SLOW TV, ACTUAL LEARNING"
- Contrast-based (slow vs. fast)
- Direct correlation stated
- Short, parallel structure

## Recommendations:

**SEGMENT 1:** I'd lean toward **Option C: "WHEN DIFFERENT ISN'T BEHIND"** — it's most aligned with OpenEd's identity and reframes parent anxiety directly.

**SEGMENT 2:** I'd lean toward **Option A: "EVERY HOUR COSTS THEM"** — data-forward, urgent, and directly supports the research angle.

**SEGMENT 3:** I'd lean toward **Option A: "WHAT ACTUALLY BUILDS CAPACITY"** — this was your original recommendation and it's strongest because it frames the TOOL segment as principle-based (capacity building) rather than just a list.

**Your call on which resonates.**
