**SUBJECT:** Why 'bored' kids are winning

**PREVIEW:** Grade levels were invented for efficiency. Screen time was designed for dopamine. Here's what actually works.

Quick reminder: if you're thinking about OpenEd Daily this year, today is the midyear enrollment deadline. (Don't worry—we'll still be here when you decide. Unlike grade levels, we don't have arbitrary cutoffs.)

Today we're connecting two things that seem unrelated but are actually the same problem. Both were designed for efficiency, not kids. One came from 1800s Prussia. One came from Silicon Valley. Both are doing damage.

We've got three pieces for you today that all point at the same truth.

Let's dive in.

## WHEN DIFFERENT ISN'T BEHIND

From Simply Charlotte Mason: **"It's very common for a child to be ready for, say, third-grade math skills while at the same time be working on second-grade or even first-grade reading skills. That's fine!"**

That's the whole thing, really. A Prussian educator named Horace Mann invented age-grading in the 1800s to solve a simple problem: too many kids, one room, warehouse-scale efficiency. It worked. We're still running it.

But age-grading persists not because it's good for kids—it persists because it's efficient for institutions. Charlotte Mason understood this over a century ago. Kids don't develop in lockstep. Your kid doesn't have to be "third grade" in everything.

## EVERY HOUR COSTS THEM

[Newsweek reports](https://www.newsweek.com/children-kids-parents-screens-hampering-learning-10869823) on a new study that tracked 5,400 kids from early childhood through grade six: **every additional hour of daily screen time was associated with a 9-10% lower likelihood of achieving higher test scores in reading and math.**

That's not marginal. Nine to ten percent. Per hour.

Modern entertainment is engineered for hijacking attention. TikTok's algorithm, games' variable rewards, rapid-fire cuts in kids' shows—it's not accidental. These platforms capture and hold focus, which means they prevent the deep focus that learning requires.

Of course, not all screen time is created equal. Doomscrolling isn't the same as focused time in an adaptive learning app or creating worlds in Minecraft.

## WHAT ACTUALLY BUILDS CAPACITY

Here's what slower, intentional content actually looks like:

1. **[Beatrix Potter animations](https://amzn.to/3QtWtK3)** — Beautiful, zero manipulation.

2. **[Roy Underhill's Woodwright's Shop](https://amzn.to/3XaUgqO)** — Watch craftsmanship happen slowly.

3. **[Irish Hands](https://benchcrafted.com/products/hands-video-series)** — Traditional craftspeople at work.

4. **[David Macaulay's architectural histories](https://amzn.to/4gP81lN)** — Learning built into stories.

5. **[My Neighbor Totoro](https://amzn.to/45Ldx6O)** — Magic without manipulation.

These aren't designed to be "engaging" in the modern sense. They're the opposite. They require attention without hijacking it.

A child watching Roy Underhill spend 45 minutes shaping wood learns something about patience and craft that no algorithm can teach. When kids have watched enough "boring" content, regular activities become interesting again.

That's all for today!

P.S. I've been procrastinating on the Ed the Horse "chalkboard" reel format for ages. Think Dude with Sign, but with a freaky horse. [Here's the first one.](https://www.instagram.com/p/DQ4srwcku5Z/) If you're on IG, show it some love—or let me know what you hate about it.
