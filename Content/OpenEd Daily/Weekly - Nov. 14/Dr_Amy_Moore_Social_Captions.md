### VIDEO CAPTION OPTION 1: Auditory Exclusion Hook
**Platform Fit:** TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts

**On-Screen Text (First 3 Seconds):**
"You're yelling. They're ignoring you. Actually, they can't hear you."

**TikTok Caption:**
You're yelling and it looks like they're ignoring you.

Actually, they're in fight or flight mode. Their brain literally can't process your voice.

It's called auditory exclusion, and Dr. Amy Moore explains why it's not defiance—it's neurology.

The fix? Lower your voice. Soften everything. Then invite problem-solving.

This changes how you respond to your ADHD kid forever.

### VIDEO CAPTION OPTION 2: Emotional Regulation Hook
**Platform Fit:** Instagram Reels, TikTok

**On-Screen Text:**
"Everything you say either strengthens or weakens your connection"

**Instagram Reels Caption:**
Here's the hard truth:

Everything that comes out of your mouth either strengthens or weakens the connection with your child.

When you yell, you weaken it. When you regulate your own emotions first, you help them do the same.

Dr. Amy Moore on why co-regulation is the real parenting superpower. 🧠

This is from her groundbreaking work on ADHD neurology. Save this for the moment you need it most.

### VIDEO CAPTION OPTION 3: The Name It To Tame It Hook
**Platform Fit:** All short-form platforms

**On-Screen Text:**
"Name it to tame it—it works for kids AND parents"

**TikTok Caption:**
Your kid is frustrated. You're frustrated.

Both of you need the same thing: a name for what you're feeling.

"Hey, I notice you seem frustrated. Yeah, I get frustrated when things are hard too. Here's what I do."

Naming the emotion activates the language center, pulling you BOTH out of amygdala hijack.

Your fight-or-flight response drops immediately.

This is neuroscience-backed, not mom magic.

### VIDEO CAPTION OPTION 5: Return to Mastery Hook
**Platform Fit:** Instagram Reels, TikTok

**On-Screen Text:**
"Go back a step. Master it. Then move forward."

**Instagram Reels Caption:**
Your kid is stuck on a concept. Frustrated. Shutting down.

Here's what Dr. Amy Moore recommends:

Go back to yesterday's mastery moment. "Yesterday you nailed this. Let's start there."

Build slowly from mastery, not from failure.

This reframes the entire conversation from "you can't" to "here's what we do when it gets hard."

### LINKEDIN OPTION 1: The Emotional Intelligence Angle
**Format:** Personal Realization + Insight (High engagement on LinkedIn)

The hardest parenting lesson I've learned:

Everything I say either strengthens or weakens my connection with my child.

When I yell, I weaken it. When I regulate my own emotions first, I give my child something far more valuable than compliance—I give them a model of emotional regulation.

Dr. Amy Moore (@[LinkedIn handle] if available) calls it "co-regulation," and it's the real superpower in parenting ADHD kids.

The science is clear: mirror neurons mean our emotions are contagious to our kids. If I'm dysregulated, they will be too.

So the real work isn't fixing the kid. It's fixing ourselves first.

### LINKEDIN OPTION 2: The Auditory Exclusion Insight
**Format:** Problem Recognition + Solution (Authority-building)

I was yelling at my kid about not listening.

Turns out, they literally couldn't hear me.

It's called auditory exclusion. When the brain enters fight-or-flight mode, it's hardwired to only hear low-frequency survival sounds—like a tiger rustling in the bush—not a parent's voice.

Dr. Amy Moore's research on ADHD neurology changed how I respond to my kids:

**Lower your voice.**
**Soften your expression.**
**Remove excess noise.**
**Then invite problem-solving.**

The shift from control to curiosity changes everything.

And it's backed by neuroscience, not guesswork.

This is one of the core frameworks we explore in the OpenEd podcast on ADHD and cognitive training: https://opened.co/blog/why-your-adhd-kid-wont-listen-its-not-what-you-think

### LINKEDIN OPTION 3: The Regulation-First Framework
**Format:** Thread-Style (Numbered list, LinkedIn favorite)

What I learned from Dr. Amy Moore about parenting ADHD kids:

**1. Your emotional regulation comes first.**
Not their behavior. Not their grades. YOU.

If you're dysregulated, they will be too. It's mirror neurons. Your stress is contagious.

**2. Go into problem-solving mode, not control mode.**
"I notice this seems hard. I wonder what we could do to make it easier."

This invitation (not demand) lets them safely say "yes, it's too hard."

**3. Return to mastery, not struggle.**
"Yesterday you mastered this. Let's go back to what we talked about yesterday, then build slowly on what's hard."

**4. Name the emotion to tame it.**
"You seem frustrated. Yeah, I get frustrated when things are hard too. Here's what I do."

Naming activates the language center, pulling both of you out of amygdala hijack.

**5. The vagus nerve hack.**
Can't calm down? Vibrate your vagus nerve. Frozen eye mask for 30 seconds. Cold water on your face.

These aren't parenting tricks. They're neuroscience.

Dr. Amy Moore explains all of this (with evidence) on the latest OpenEd podcast episode.
