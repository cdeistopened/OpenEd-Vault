- "The best science curricula flip the order: wonder first, explanation later."
- "What your homeschool lacks in large lab equipment and specialized facilities, it can make up in time for deep projects, and the flexibility to go off-script when curiosity takes you somewhere unexpected."

### Key Quotes & Moments

**On Normal Attention:**
"Our brains shift attention four times a second. That's normal. Your brain focuses on a task, scans the environment for threats, comes back to the task. It's designed for survival—checking for tigers while working."

**On ADHD Brains:**
"The ADHD brain struggles to distinguish between minor inconveniences and crises. Everything feels important."

**On Defiance:**
"What we interpret as defiance is typically not defiance. 'I'm not doing this' isn't willful. It's 'this is too hard and I'm frustrated, and I don't know how to communicate that.'"

**On Auditory Exclusion:**
"The brain is intelligently designed to only hear low-frequency sounds—like a tiger rustling in the bush behind us—not mom's voice yelling. So when you yell at your child, it looks like they're ignoring you, but they're struggling to hear the words because they're in fight-or-flight."

**On Emotional Regulation:**
"Emotions are contagious. We have smart cells in our brains called mirror neurons. Their effect is strongest between people with close relationships. So my emotions as a mom are contagious to my child."

**On Sleep & Brain Health:**
"During sleep, the brain shrinks slightly to allow the glymphatic system to release cerebrospinal fluid that literally washes the brain—like a car wash rinsing garbage and toxins left behind during the day."

### Dr. Amy Moore Bio
- PhD in Psychology
- 10 years as child development specialist with Air Force programs
- Classroom teaching experience

- Bridges psychology and education spaces

### Key Resources Mentioned
- **Homeschool OT** (Sarah Collins) - Podcast & website on sensory issues

### Critical Themes
1. **Defiance is not willful** - It's stress response
2. **Emotional regulation of parent is contagious** - Co-regulation matters
3. **Sleep is foundational** - Without it, emotional regulation fails
4. **Sensory awareness matters** - Seekers vs avoiders have different needs
5. **Brain differences deserve empathy** - Real measurable differences in ADHD brains

## Trends We're Following

### 1. Screen Time & Academic Achievement
**Source:** Newsweek (citing new study tracking 5,400 kids from early childhood through grade 6)
**Data:** Every additional hour of daily screen time = 9-10% lower likelihood of achieving higher test scores in reading and math
**Context:** Quality matters (adaptive learning app ≠ doomscrolling)
**Angle:** Headline data-driven
**URL:** https://www.newsweek.com/children-kids-parents-screens-hampering-learning-10869823

### 2. Curiosity & Testing Culture
**Source:** Austin Scholar citing Susan Engel research (Williams College)
**Data:** Curiosity drops dramatically around 3rd grade (when standardized testing kicks in)
**Key Finding:** Steepest drops happen in households where parents frequently ask about grades and rarely ask about interests
**Insight:** Kids pursue their own questions more persistently than assigned ones
**Solution:** The Question Project - kids pose one real question per week
**Angle:** Parent behavior shapes curiosity
**X/Social Link:** https://x.com/flowidealism/status/1794541962055315951

### 3. Homeschooling Growth by State (2017-Present)
**Source:** Visualization tracking state-by-state growth since 2017-2018
**Narrative:** "Families voting with their feet" - enrollment growth varies significantly by region
**Significance:** Shows fundamental shift in education preferences
**Angle:** Quiet revolution in education
**Link:** https://x.com/OpenEdHQ/status/1989387979509617067 (@rebeleducator)

### 4. Grade Levels Don't Match Individual Development
**Source:** Simply Charlotte Mason
**Key Quote:** "It's very common for a child to be ready for, say, third-grade math skills while at the same time be working on second-grade or even first-grade reading skills. That's fine!"
**Historical Context:** Grade levels persist for institutional efficiency, not child development (copied from Prussian factory model in 1800s by Horace Mann)
**Philosophy:** "Teach the child, not the grade level" - Charlotte Mason's century-old insight still relevant
**Angle:** Schooling structure doesn't fit child development
