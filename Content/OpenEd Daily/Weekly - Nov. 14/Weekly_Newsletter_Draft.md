# OpenEd Weekly | November 14, 2025

## Opening Letter

Greetings Eddies!

We're excited to announce this week's winner of the Daylight Computer giveaway: Diana Sackett from Utah, whose kids are enrolled with OpenEd.

What made Diana's entry special? She didn't just enter once—she referred a friend who also entered the giveaway. Diana beat out over 300 other people, which means if you're reading this with a slight frown, you're in good company.

I should also note that we have a winner in the Daylight Computer giveaway. That means, if you don't already know, it's not you. But don't despair! I'm working on a few sweet consolation prizes for the top-referrers from the campaign. We are grateful to everyone who took the time to spread the word.

Also, just in case you suspect foul play or favoritism, I wrote a Python script to randomly select Diana from the 300+ entrants. No bias. No gut feeling. Just cold, hard code. (And yes, I vibe-coded it, but the algorithm doesn't know that.)learning

If you've been thinking about entering, today is your last day. Yes, literally today. Head over to the [Daylight giveaway](https://open-ed.notion.site/daylight) to enter, and remember: every friend you refer gets you another entry into the draw for this remarkable tablet designed to prevent overstimulation in an age when overstimulation is the default.

## DEEP DIVE: Best Homeschool Science Curriculum

Science is the study of how the world works—it should be the most exciting subject of all. So why do so many students find it boring?

Adam Savage, the former MythBusters host, [diagnosed the disconnect](https://www.tiktok.com/@openedhq/video/7493709540093971754) (in our most viral social media post ever):

"When we teach kids that science and math and engineering are all things to memorize, we're missing the point. These are unfettered landscapes of the untried and the untested."

In an analogy that Ed the Horse would love, Savage reminds us that we call math and science "fields of knowledge" because they're open-ended—ripe for curious minds to explore.

At [OpenEd](https://www.notion.so/OED-Tues-Nov-11-2a7afe52ef5980c8bce8dc5dd9e7d490?pvs=21), we've watched thousands of families rebuild their relationship with science. This guide gathers the most-loved recommendations from our teachers and families—tested, hands-on programs organized by type and grade level, honest trade-offs, and high-quality free resources. Our goal: not to get through the material, but to keep *wonder* alive.

Schools often teach science backwards—theory first, hoping curiosity follows. Natural learning does the opposite. Kids are born scientists. Every toddler dropping their spoon is running an experiment. The best curricula flip the order: wonder first, explanation later.

What your homeschool lacks in lab equipment, it makes up in time for deep projects and flexibility to follow curiosity wherever it leads. Most school 'lab work' is performative anyway—following recipes to get expected results, often fudging observations to match the textbook.

Stop trying to replicate the traditional science classroom when you can do something *better*.

## PODCAST HIGHLIGHT: Why Your ADHD Kid "Won't Listen" (It's Not What You Think)

Dr. Amy Moore joined Ela Richmond on the OpenEd podcast to unpack something that frustrates countless families: a child who seems to ignore you the moment you raise your voice. Turns out that's not a coincidence. It's not always defiance, either. Sometimes it's just neurology.

Dr. Moore explains that when we yell, our kids' brains literally can't hear us the way we think they can. There's something called auditory exclusion that kicks in during fight-or-flight. The brain is designed to hear low-frequency survival sounds—like a tiger rustling in the bush—not mom's voice. So when you think your child is ignoring you, consider the fact that they're struggling to process the words at all.

What can you do instead? Lower your voice. Soften your posture. Remove the noise. Then invite problem-solving: "I notice this seems really hard for you. I wonder what we could do to make it easier."

## Trends We're Following

**Every Hour Costs Them**

A new study tracking 5,400 kids from early childhood through grade six found that **every additional hour of daily screen time was associated with a 9-10% lower likelihood of achieving higher test scores in reading and math**. Of course, not all screen time is created equal. Doomscrolling isn't the same as focused work in an adaptive learning app or creating worlds in Minecraft. But the data is clear: quantity matters, and quality matters more. ([Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/children-kids-parents-screens-hampering-learning-10869823))

**Curiosity Doesn't Die from Lack of Enrichment**

Austin Scholar breaks down the real culprit behind dead-eyed teenagers who only care if something's "on the test": parents who light up about report cards but yawn through explanations of how ant colonies work. Research from Susan Engel at Williams College shows curiosity drops dramatically around third grade (right when standardized testing kicks in). But the *steepest* drops happen in households where parents frequently ask about grades and rarely ask about interests. **The same kid will endure significantly more failure and frustration when pursuing answers to their own questions versus assigned ones.** She suggests a "Question Project" as one solution, in which kids pose one real question per week and explore it like actual researchers. ([Austin Scholar](https://x.com/flowidealism/status/1794541962055315951))

**Homeschooling Growth by State Since 2017**

This [visualization tracking homeschool growth state by state](https://x.com/OpenEdHQ/status/1989387979509617067) since 2017-2018 shows which states are experiencing the fastest growth in homeschooling. What color is your state? Chime in on Facebook. ([@rebeleducator](https://x.com/OpenEdHQ/status/1989387979509617067))

**Teach the Child, Not the Grade Level**

From Simply Charlotte Mason: **"It's very common for a child to be ready for, say, third-grade math skills while at the same time be working on second-grade or even first-grade reading skills. That's fine!"** Grade levels persist not because they're good for kids but because they're efficient for institutions. Charlotte Mason understood this over a century ago: Kids don't develop like cogs on an assembly line. Yet we still force them into boxes.

(LearningRx)

**[Cold Emailing as a Superpower](https://x.com/Henrik_wes/status/1981707094593343578)** — Henrik noticed a pattern among 15-17 year olds who've come further in life than most university graduates: they get really good at cold emailing. Check out his post for a real example of what a successful cold email looks like. This is already replacing the resume in some industries. (X @Henrik_wes)

## Ed's Stable

Did you know OpenEd is on Instagram? While we may not be able to compete with top-tier influencer homeschool moms, we're having fun testing what sticks. This week we've been playing with a chalkboard, a horse trailer, and a slightly unsettling horse mask to see what resonates.

ICYMI, follow us so you don’t miss out on any gems such as:

- Teach the CHILD not the grade level
- Your kid’s “weird” is their superpower

Or my personal favorite:

- Ed’s escape from detention

Stay tuned for more equine antics...

That's all for this week!

– Charlie (the OpenEd newsletter guy)
