### TWEET 2 (SCIENCE CURRICULUM - Direct Quote/Authority)

"When we teach science as memorization, we're missing the point. These are unfettered landscapes of the untried and the untested."

— Adam Savage (MythBusters)

That quote started a conversation about why wonder matters more than worksheets.

### TWEET 3 (ADHD & NEUROLOGY - Problem Diagnosis)

The reason your kid won't listen when you yell?

It's not defiance. It's neurology.

When stressed, their brain enters auditory exclusion. They literally can't process your voice.

The fix changes everything.

Dr. Amy Moore explains: https://opened.co/blog/why-your-adhd-kid-wont-listen-its-not-what-you-think

### TWEET 4 (CURIOSITY & GRADES - Observation/Common Sense)

One pattern we noticed in homes with curious kids:

Parents rarely ask about grades.

They ask: "What are you interested in?"

Research from Susan Engel shows curiosity drops hardest in homes where the opposite happens.

### TWEET 5 (HOMESCHOOL GROWTH DATA - Comparison/Numbers)

1.5M students are now in microschools.

That's the same as Catholic schools.

Same enrollment.

Different satisfaction rates.

### TWEET 6 (COLD EMAILING - Observation/Success Habit)

Successful young people do something most won't:

They cold email everyone.

Not strategically. Just constantly.

It's replacing the resume in some industries.

@Henrik_wes on why initiative beats credentials:

### TWEET 7 (GRADE LEVELS - Contrarian Truth)

Unpopular opinion: Grade levels are a factory model, not a development model.

A kid can be:

- 3rd grade math
- 1st grade reading

That's not failure. That's how humans develop.

Charlotte Mason knew this 100+ years ago.

### TWEET 9 (BORING TV - Novel Concept Hook)

What if kids watched content that demands attention instead of hijacking it?

Beatrix Potter.
Roy Underhill's woodworking.
David Macaulay's architecture.

Emily Phillips on why "boring" might be the most powerful parenting tool:

### TWEET 10 (SCREEN TIME DATA - Numbers/Perspective)

5,400 kids tracked.

Every 1 hour of daily screen time = 9-10% lower test scores.

Not all screen time = same.
Doomscrolling ≠ Problem-solving apps.

Quality matters more than quantity.

### TWEET 11 (BRAIN TRAINING - Solution Format)

Brain training isn't tutoring.

It's fixing the skill that makes learning possible:

- Processing speed
- Working memory
- Attention

### TWEET 12 (COMMUNITY TOOLS - Specific Tip)

Sometimes memorization just needs the right format.

State capitals song by @marblesthebrainstore:

Music hooks memory better than flashcards.

Simple. Effective. Less painful.
