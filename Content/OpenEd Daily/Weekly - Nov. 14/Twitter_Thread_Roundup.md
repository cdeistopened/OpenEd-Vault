### TWEET 2 (SCIENCE CURRICULUM)
First up, @AdamSavage (MythBusters) diagnoses why science class fails kids to inspire:

"When we teach science as memorization, we're missing the point. These are unfettered landscapes of the untried and the untested."

### TWEET 3 (ADHD & NEUROLOGY)
**Dr. Amy Moore** unpacked why kids "won't listen" (spoiler: it's auditory exclusion, not defiance).

When you yell, your kid's brain literally can't hear you the way you think. The science changes everything about how you respond.

### TWEET 4 (CURIOSITY & GRADES)
📊 **Austin Scholar** (@tag) shared Susan Engel's research on why curiosity dies in school.

Spoiler: The steepest drops are in homes where parents ask about grades, not interests.

Kids push harder on their own questions than assigned ones.

### TWEET 9 (BORING TV)
📺 **Emily Phillips** (Withyweather Farm & School) created a "boring TV" list for kids.

Shows that demand attention without hijacking it: Beatrix Potter, Roy Underhill's woodworking, David Macaulay's architecture.

The philosophy: Once kids watch calm content, regular activities become interesting.

### TWEET 10 (SCREEN TIME DATA)
📱 A new Newsweek study tracked 5,400 kids and found: every additional hour of daily screen time = 9-10% lower likelihood of higher test scores.

Quality matters. Doomscrolling ≠ Minecraft.
