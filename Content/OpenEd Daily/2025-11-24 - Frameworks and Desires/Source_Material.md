**Quote:**
“Parents who understand their children's desires have a much better chance of influencing them, and the only way to actually understand their desires is to start to get curious about what they want, why they want it, and what they think it's going to do for them.”

🧱 The Framework Problem

The longer I’ve been around education, the more convinced I am of one thing: Our biggest challenge isn’t in our models — it’s in our mindset.

Every few years, we build something new:
Charters.
Vouchers.
ESAs.
Microschools.
Private academies.

Each one designed to “fix” what came before. And each one, in its own way, still running on the same core operating system.

We call it innovation, but most of it is iteration.
Because even when the names change, the framework doesn’t.

We keep designing systems that assume people can’t be trusted —
so we create more rules, more oversight, more metrics, and more middlemen.

We talk about “freedom” and “flexibility,” but we wrap it all in a blanket of compliance before it ever leaves the ground.

And this isn’t just a public school problem. It’s a culture problem — one that runs through every corner of education. Private schools feel it. ESA programs feel it. Even microschool founders feel it when government dollars show up with invisible strings.

I think often about what my friend, Brian Hooks has said — that lasting change doesn’t come from new programs or more funding, but from believing in people.

It’s a simple idea, but a radical one.
Because when you believe in people, you build with them — not for them.
And that shift changes everything.

Leaders like Meredith Olson and the VELA team have been proving it for years — trusting families and educators to innovate without permission.
And Ashley Soifer has shown what happens when you let trust lead in the microschool space — small, local communities of learning that grow because they’re free, not because they’re funded.

They all point toward the same truth:
We’ve built an ecosystem that keeps trying to program progress instead of believing in people.
And if we’re being honest — we’ve all played a part.
Myself included.

So maybe it’s time to stop asking, “What model will fix education?” and start asking,
“What kind of mindset will free it?”

Until we rebuild the foundation — the way we think about trust, accountability, and the role of people in the process — we’ll just keep building new rooms on the same cracked slab.

It’s not about schools versus systems anymore. It’s about whether we have the courage to build something human again.
