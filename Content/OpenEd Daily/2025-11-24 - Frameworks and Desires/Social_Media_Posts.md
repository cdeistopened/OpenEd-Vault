# Social Media Post Options: The Trust Deficit

## Source Material
**Core Concept:** "The Framework Problem" vs. "The Trust Deficit" (based on Grant Hewitt's LinkedIn post).
**Key Insight:** We keep building new educational models (charters, vouchers, microschools) on a broken foundation of distrust. We wrap "freedom" in compliance because we don't trust people.
**Metaphor:** Building new rooms on a cracked slab.
**Goal:** Lean into the controversy, invite engagement, use the "Lego" analogy (building new structures on bad foundations).

## Framework 1: The "Contrarian Video" Post (Adapted for Text/Image)
**Template:** #3 Contrarian Video / #10 The "Controversial Hot Take"
**Concept:** Challenge the idea that "innovation" is the solution.
**Fit:** Strong. Attacks the common belief that we just need a "better model."

**Draft:**
We have an obsession with "fixing" education.

Every few years, we build something new:
Charters.
Vouchers.
ESAs.
Microschools.

We call it innovation.
**It’s actually just iteration.**

Why? Because we keep building new rooms on the same cracked slab.

The "core operating system" of education is built on a lack of trust.
We design systems assuming people—educators and families—can't be trusted.
So we wrap every "freedom" in a suffocating blanket of compliance.

It’s not a model problem. It’s a mindset problem.

Until we fix the foundation—the way we view human agency—we’re just rearranging deck chairs.

Real innovation looks like believing in people enough to let them build without permission.

Agree or disagree?

## Framework 2: The "This vs That" Post
**Template:** #55 The "This vs That" Post
**Concept:** Innovation vs. Iteration (or Trust vs. Control).
**Fit:** High. Sets up a clear binary choice for the reader.

**Draft:**
Most education reform is **Iteration**, not **Innovation**.

Here’s the difference:

**Iteration** builds a new room on the same cracked foundation.
It changes the name (Charter, Voucher, ESA) but keeps the rules.
It says "You have freedom, but first fill out these 50 forms."
It assumes people need to be managed.

**Innovation** fixes the foundation.
It changes the operating system from control to trust.
It says "We trust you to know what's best for your child."
It assumes people are capable.

We have enough new models.
We have a deficit of trust.

Which one are you building for?

## Framework 3: The "LEGO" Analogy (Visual/Metaphor)
**Template:** #43 The Flow Chart Post (Adapted for visual metaphor) / #95 Make a Sports Analogy (Adapted to Lego)
**Concept:** You can't build a stable Lego tower on a wobbly table.
**Fit:** Requested specifically. Good for visualization.

**Draft:**
Imagine trying to build a massive LEGO tower.
You have the best bricks. The coolest designs. The most talented builders.

But you’re building it on a table with one broken leg.

Every time you get a few levels high, the whole thing wobbles.
So you add more supports (regulations).
You tape the base (compliance).
You yell at the builders (accountability).

But the tower keeps shaking.

This is the state of education reform.
The "new models" (ESAs, microschools) are the cool LEGO sets.
The "broken table" is our fundamental lack of trust in families.

You can’t policy your way out of a trust deficit.
You have to fix the table.

## Framework 4: The "One Sentence" Hook (Curiosity)
**Template:** #25 The "Curiosity" Post
**Concept:** The root cause of failure.
**Fit:** High engagement potential by withholding the answer slightly.

**Draft:**
I’ve figured out why most education reforms fail.

It’s not because of funding.
It’s not because of bad curriculum.
It’s not even because of politics.

It’s because of a "Trust Deficit."

We talk about "freedom" and "flexibility," but we wrap it all in a blanket of compliance before it ever leaves the ground.

We are terrified of what might happen if we actually let people choose.

So we build new cages and call them "innovation."

True innovation is terrifying.
It requires believing that people can build better than the system can plan.

## Framework 5: The "I Call BS" Post
**Template:** #42 I call BS Post
**Concept:** Calling out the "innovation" theater.
**Fit:** Very strong for Grant/OpenEd's contrarian voice.

**Draft:**
"We're innovating education."

I call BS.

Most of what we call "innovation" is just "iteration" with better branding.

Charters? Iteration.
Vouchers? Iteration.
ESAs with 100 pages of regulations? Iteration.

If the underlying framework assumes that parents can't be trusted and schools must be measured by standardized metrics, **you haven't changed anything.**

You’ve just painted the prison walls a nicer color.

Real innovation is permissionless.
Real innovation runs on trust.

Everything else is just noise.
