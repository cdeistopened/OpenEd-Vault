Greetings Eddies!

There is a subtle but pervasive lie in education reform: the idea that if we just find the right *structure*—the perfect voucher system, the ideal microschool regulation, the flawless charter policy—everything will work.

But what if the problem isn't the structure? What if we're building beautiful new houses on a cracked foundation?

Today, we’re looking at a parenting hack from The Minimalists about "directing the river," the "trust deficit" that undermines even the best educational models, and a tool that turns music practice into a video game.

Let's dive in.

## DIRECTING THE RIVER

Most parents want to influence their children. We want them to be healthy, happy, and wise. But often, our attempt to *influence* looks a lot like an attempt to *control*.

**Joshua Fields Millburn** (of [The Minimalists](https://www.instagram.com/joshuafieldsmillburn/)) offers a different metaphor: You can't direct a river if you don't know which way it flows.

“Parents who understand their children's desires have a much better chance of influencing them," he says. "And the only way to actually understand their desires is to start to get curious about **what they want, why they want it, and what they think it's going to do for them.**"

Control tries to build a dam. Curiosity maps the current. Once you know where the energy is going, you can guide it. But you have to get in the water first.

*P.S. Speaking of The Minimalists, our own Isaac Morehouse previously joined them to discuss [Schooling the World](https://www.theminimalists.com/p/schooling/). Worth a listen.*

## THE TRUST DEFICIT

We have an obsession with "fixing" education. Every few years, a new wave of solutions arrives: Charters. Vouchers. ESAs. Microschools.

We call this innovation. **Grant Hewitt (VP of Partnerships at OpenEducation)** calls it iteration.

In a recent [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7397722283420602368/), Hewitt argues that while we change the names, we rarely change the "core operating system." That OS is built on a lack of trust. We design systems assuming people—educators and families—can't be trusted, so we wrap every "freedom" in a suffocating blanket of compliance, metrics, and oversight.

**It’s not a model problem. It’s a mindset problem.**

Until we fix the foundation—the way we view human agency and trust—we are just "building new rooms on the same cracked slab." Real innovation doesn't look like a new rulebook. It looks like believing in people enough to let them build without permission.

## GUITAR HERO FOR REAL LIFE

Learning an instrument usually starts with the boring stuff: scales, theory, and clumsy fumbling. It’s high-friction and low-dopamine.

**[Yousician](https://yousician.com/)** flips the script.

Think of it as *Guitar Hero* for real instruments. You play along to songs you actually like, and the app listens to your real guitar, piano, or ukulele, giving you instant feedback on timing and accuracy. It gamifies the hardest part of learning music: the practice.

By replacing the "eat your vegetables" approach with immediate wins, it helps you build the habit first. The theory can wait. Just play.
