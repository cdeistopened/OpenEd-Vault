# Framework 3: The "LEGO" Analogy (Visual/Metaphor) - REVISED
**Template:** #43 The Flow Chart Post (Adapted for visual metaphor) / #95 Make a Sports Analogy (Adapted to Lego)
**Concept:** You can't build a stable Lego tower on a wobbly table.
**Fit:** Visual, sticky metaphor that complements Grant's "cracked slab" without repeating it word-for-word.

**Draft:**
Imagine trying to build a massive LEGO tower.

You have the best bricks. The coolest designs. The most talented builders.

But you’re building it on a table with one broken leg.

Every time you get a few levels high, the whole thing wobbles.
So you add more supports (regulations).
You tape the base (compliance).
You yell at the builders (accountability).

But the tower keeps shaking.

Our VP of Partnerships, Grant Hewitt, calls this the "Framework Problem."

While everyone else is arguing about which bricks to use (Charters? Vouchers? ESAs?), Grant points out that we're building on a broken foundation: **a deficit of trust.**

The "new models" are just cool LEGO sets.
The "broken table" is our refusal to trust families without strings attached.

You can’t policy your way out of a trust deficit.
You have to fix the table.

Check out Grant's full breakdown of why we need a new mindset, not just a new model. (Link in comments)
