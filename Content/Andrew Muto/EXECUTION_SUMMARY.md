## 🚨 BLOCKERS / DECISIONS NEEDED

### Questions to Answer:
1. **Should we finish all meeting audits first** or build skills as we go?
   - **Recommendation:** Finish audits first (3-4 hours) to capture all insights before skill building

2. **Should `youtube-show-notes-guide.md` become its own skill** or reference in `podcast-asset-planner`?
   - **Recommendation:** Reference in `podcast-asset-planner` (not standalone skill)

3. **Do we want a master `podcast-producer` orchestrator skill** that calls all sub-skills?
   - **Recommendation:** Build after Tier 1+2 complete, only if orchestration adds value

4. **Should Andrew Muto insights stay in their own files** OR get fully integrated into skills?
   - **Recommendation:** Keep `1_Social_Media_Principles.md` and `2_Video_Formats_and_Concepts.md` as reference material, integrate specific insights into skill `/references/` folders

### What to Keep in Mind:
- Avoid "first-match bias" when creating framework references
- Test each skill on actual content before moving to next
- Keep skill-creator patterns consistent
- Examples are critical - don't skip them
