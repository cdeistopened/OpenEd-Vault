## Chapter 1: The Fundamentals of Social Media Marketing

### Traditional Marketing Pillars Reimagined

Historically, marketing has been built on two core pillars:

- **Storytelling**: The narrative and message you communicate
- **Reach**: How many people will hear your message

### The Social Media Revolution

Traditional marketing was characterized by:

- Expensive content creation
- Astronomical media buying costs
- Limited ability to reach target audiences

**Social Media Transformation:**

- Democratized content creation
- Algorithmic content distribution
- Ability to "earn awareness" without massive budgets

### The Interest Graph Paradigm

**Key Insight:** Modern social media platforms prioritize interest-based content distribution over follower-based models.

### Platform Evolution

- **Old Model:** Content shown primarily to followers
- **New Model (TikTok's Innovation):** Content distributed to like-minded individuals based on:
    - Topic relevance
    - User interests
    - Content characteristics

## Chapter 2: Understanding Platform Algorithms

### Content Identification Strategies

Platforms use multiple methods to understand and categorize content:

### 1. On-Screen Text

- Deliberately use relevant keywords
- Think of it like SEO for social media
- Be specific and intentional about language

### 2. Description Copy

- Stuff descriptions with relevant topic keywords
- Create copy that helps algorithms understand content
- Don't rely solely on natural language

### 3. Hashtags

- Use strategically (around 12 hashtags)
- Help guide algorithmic understanding
- Choose hashtags that accurately represent content

### 4. Audio/Spoken Content

- Platforms transcribe and analyze audio
- Speak keywords and topics explicitly
- Use audio as another layer of content identification

### Watch Time and Retention Mechanics

### Critical Metrics

- **Watch Time:** How long users watch your content
- **Retention Rate:** Percentage of content watched

### Capturing Audience Attention

**The 2-Second Rule:**

- First 1-2 seconds are crucial
- Create immediate, compelling hooks
- Prevent viewers from scrolling away

**Strategies for High Retention:**

- Start with drama or intrigue

## Chapter 4: Content Production and Publishing Strategy

The Publishing Philosophy**Core Principle:** Post as often as possible - ideally daily content, Monday through Sunday.

Why Frequent Publishing Works

1. **Social Media as Focus Group**
    - Each post tests audience preferences
    - Immediate feedback on messaging and strategy
    - Rapid iteration and learning cycles
2. **The Home Run Strategy**
    - Most growth comes from viral hits, not consistent base hits
    - More at-bats = more opportunities for breakthrough content
    - Compound effect when viral content drives archive exploration
3. **Archive Building Benefits**
    - New followers explore past content
    - Compounding views across entire catalog
    - Creates sustainable content ecosystem

Optimal Posting Strategy**Timing Considerations:**

- Identify peak audience activity times through platform analytics
- Post 1-2 hours before peak times to allow algorithmic processing
- Allow platforms time to understand and categorize content

**Content Testing Approach:**

- Publish quickly when content is ready
- Don't over-schedule - stay engaged with real-time response
- Monitor engagement velocity in first 15 minutes
- Be present in comments immediately after posting

Platform Focus Strategy**Primary Platforms (Same Content, Multiple Channels):**

- Instagram Reels
- TikTok
- YouTube Shorts
- Facebook Reels

**Why These Platforms:**

- Strong algorithmic promotion for video content
- Similar content requirements across platforms
- Maximum reach with minimal additional effort

## Chapter 5: Production Methodology and Asset Management

Production Asset Audit**Key Questions to Answer:**

- What human resources are available?
- What technical capabilities exist?
- What content archives can be leveraged?
- What are the friction points in current processes?

Available Asset Categories

1. **Human Resources**
    - Organizational thought leaders
    - Happy customers and testimonials
    - Employee families
    - Subject matter experts
2. **Content Archives**
    - Podcast episodes (aim for 20-30 clips per episode)
    - Previous media appearances
    - Speaking engagements
    - Customer success stories
3. **Technical Resources**
    - AI voice tools
    - Stock footage libraries
    - Editing capabilities
    - Recording equipment

Friction Elimination Strategy**Core Philosophy:** Speed and consistency trump technical perfection.

**Friction Reduction Tactics:**

- Identify and eliminate production bottlenecks
- Optimize for daily publishing capability
- Choose tools and processes that minimize resistance
- Prioritize content volume over production value

The Podcast-to-Clips Pipeline**Strategic Approach:** Podcasts exist primarily to feed short-form content.

**Process Framework:**

1. **Pre-Recording Preparation**
    - Develop talking points focused on clip-worthy moments
    - Brief speakers on creating quotable, energetic segments
    - Plan for multiple topic areas per session
2. **Recording Optimization**
    - Capture both audio and video when possible
    - Use portable recording equipment for flexibility
    - Encourage passionate, quotable delivery
3. **Content Extraction**
    - Target 15-30 second clips for maximum impact
    - Look for emotional peaks and key insights
    - Create multiple clips per podcast episode

## Chapter 6: Brand Integration and Multi-Property Strategy

Subliminal Branding Techniques**Verbal Branding:**

- Consistently mention brand names in content
- Create natural integration opportunities
- Build brand recognition through repetition

**Visual Branding:**

- Subtle logo placement in backgrounds
- Consistent color schemes and aesthetics
- Branded clothing in video appearances

Multi-Property Content Strategy**Unified Brand Approach:**

- Focus on building primary brand recognition
- Integrate sub-brands and offerings naturally
- Maintain consistent messaging across all properties

**Content Distribution for Multiple Offerings:**

- Use algorithmic targeting to reach different audience segments
- Create content that serves multiple business lines
- Let platform algorithms determine optimal audience matching

Avoiding Over-Segmentation**Key Principle:** Don't create separate social media accounts unless absolutely necessary.

**Benefits of Unified Approach:**

- Consolidated audience building
- Simplified content production
- Cross-pollination between different offerings
- Stronger overall brand presence

Technical and Creative Balance**Technical Requirements:**

- Prioritize watch time and retention
- Maximize engagement signals (shares, saves, comments)
- Ensure content is easily identifiable by algorithms
- Post at optimal times for audience

**Creative Requirements:**

- Think like an influencer, not a big brand
- Create platform-native content
- Always prioritize audience entertainment and value
- Make content production as easy as possible

The key to success lies in balancing these technical and creative elements while maintaining consistency and frequency in publishing.

## Chapter 7: Advanced Content Optimization Techniques

The "Junk Food for Information" Philosophy**Core Principle:** Content must be perfectly consumable, not pixel perfect.

**The Twinkie Analogy:**

- Focus on designed consumption over perfect ingredients
- Prioritize message clarity over cinematic aesthetics
- Choose tools and techniques that "get out of their own way"

Rapid-Fire Editing Strategies**The Ruthless Cut Approach:**

- Remove every awkward start, breath, and pause
- Cut out redundant sentences and filler words
- Eliminate anything that doesn't drive the narrative forward
- Be willing to make 75+ cuts in a single video

**Exercise for Mastery:**

1. Take any piece of content
2. Cut it down as aggressively as possible (don't plan to publish)
3. Remove every blink, stumble, and "um"
4. Push beyond your comfort zone
5. Dial back slightly for the final version

**Advanced Cutting Techniques:**

- Cut between different zoom levels on the same shot
- Add subtle background music to maintain energy
- Use jump cuts to create urgency and momentum
- Make content move too fast to fully comprehend on first viewing (encouraging rewatches)

Text-Based Hook Strategies**Hook Categories:**

1. **Teaser Hooks**
    - "Her boyfriend freaked out..."
    - "What happened next will shock you..."
    - "The third tip will blow your mind..."
2. **Promise Hooks**
    - "5 tips for perfect homeschooling"
    - "Three things every homeschool mom needs"
    - "The secret schools don't want you to know"
3. **Context Hooks**
    - Set up the topic immediately
    - Help viewers understand what they're watching
    - Bridge any gaps in opening content

**Text Hook Development Process:**

- Write 15 different potential titles/hooks
- Choose the most compelling options
- Test different approaches systematically
- Apply YouTube thumbnail/title psychology to short-form content

Chapter 8: Platform-Specific Technical Implementation

Instagram Collaboration Features**Collaboration vs. Tagging:**

- **Tagging:** Simple mention, no approval needed
- **Collaboration:** Shared post requiring acceptance

**Collaboration Best Practices:**

- Coordinate acceptance within 60 seconds of posting
- Have collaborator ready to accept immediately
- If timing fails, default to simple tagging
- Late acceptance can hurt algorithmic performance

Trending Audio Discovery**Effective Audio Research Method:**

1. Scroll through your platform's feed (Instagram Reels, TikTok, etc.)
2. Look for trending indicators (up arrows, trend markers)
3. Save audio that appears in your demographic's content
4. Avoid generic trending audio lists (often not audience-appropriate)

**Community-Specific Trending:**

- Different communities see different trending content
- Use accounts that match your target demographic
- Wedding industry trends differ from photography trends
- Stay within your content ecosystem for relevant audio

Advanced Production Techniques**Single-Camera Enhancement:**

- Cut out all unnecessary content first
- Use zoom variations to create visual interest
- Add supporting background music tracks
- Match music mood to content tone (solemn, heartfelt, energetic)

**Music Selection Strategy:**

- Browse content similar to yours for audio inspiration
- Choose tracks that enhance rather than distract
- Consider emotional undertones of your message
- Test different audio styles for performance differences

## Chapter 9: Quality vs. Speed Balance

The Production Hierarchy**Priority Order:**

1. Speed of publication
2. Message clarity
3. Audience engagement
4. Technical quality

**"Good Enough" Standards:**

- Readable fonts over designer fonts
- Clear message over perfect aesthetics
- Fast production over Hollywood quality
- Consistent publishing over sporadic perfection

Content Enhancement Without Bottlenecks**Low-Friction Improvements:**

- Quick background music addition
- Simple zoom changes during cuts
- Text overlays for context/hooks
- Fast-paced editing to maintain energy

**High-Friction Activities to Avoid:**

- Sourcing extensive B-roll footage
- Complex motion graphics
- Time-intensive color correction
- Elaborate visual effects

The Frankenbite Philosophy**Advanced Editing Permissions:**

- Cut and rearrange sentences for clarity
- Remove redundant information
- Construct improved narratives from raw footage
- Use AI tools (like Descript's overdub) for seamless transitions

**Ethical Boundaries:**

- Maintain original message intent
- Don't create misleading statements
- Enhance clarity without changing meaning
- Focus on better communication, not deception

Testing and Iteration Framework**A/B Testing Approach:**

- Create multiple versions of successful content
- Test different editing styles on same audio
- Compare stock footage vs. original content performance
- Measure fast-cut vs. standard-paced editing results

**Performance Indicators:**

- Engagement velocity in first 15 minutes
- Watch time retention rates
- Share and save ratios
- Comment quality and quantity

Key Takeaway: Master the art of ruthless editing while maintaining authentic messaging. Speed and consistenc

  

# Social Media Caption Optimization Prompt

## The Challenge

Transform weak, generic on-screen captions into compelling hooks that make viewers stop scrolling and watch your content.

## Core Principles

### The McDonald's Test

**Rule**: Someone who works at McDonald's should be able to read and understand your headline instantly.

- Avoid fancy vocabulary ("quadratic formula" vs "stop raising entitled kids")
- Choose accessible language over impressive terminology
- Wider net = better performance, not worse quality

### Hook Psychology

Your on-screen text serves three critical functions:

1. **Immediate Context** - Tell viewers what they're watching from frame one
2. **Drama Injection** - Add tension when the opening lacks punch
3. **Search Optimization** - Help algorithms understand your content

## The Transformation Framework

### Before: Generic/Weak Captions

- "Adulting 101"
- "Fastest way to get kids interested in learning"
- "When schools don't trust parents to know their kids"
- "Important parenting advice"

### After: Compelling Hooks

- "My son's first job sucked. Perfect."
- "Your kid's Minecraft addiction is actually genius"
- "Stop raising kids who wait for permission"
- "Never give up on the weird kid"

## Hook Categories That Work

### 1. Polarizing Statements

- "Your kid's [negative thing] is actually genius"
- "Stop raising [undesirable trait] kids"
- "[Institution] operates like prisons"

### 2. Counter-Intuitive Reveals

- "My son's first job sucked. Perfect."
- "The worst experiences are the best teachers"
- "Every kid has genius hiding somewhere"

### 3. Direct Challenges

- "Never give up on the weird kid"
- "Don't judge the trench coat kid"
- "Make your kids love learning again"

### 4. Curiosity Gaps

- "Her boyfriend freaked out..." (for dramatic content)
- "The third tip will blow your mind"
- "Why can't kids go to the bathroom?" (use carefully - can create confusion)

## Optimization Process

### Step 1: Identify the Core Message

- What's the most compelling idea in this content?
- What would make someone stop scrolling?
- What's the "quiet part" we can say out loud?

### Step 2: Apply the Transformation

**From**: Technical/Educational → **To**: Emotional/Dramatic**From**: Long Explanation → **To**: Punchy Statement**From**: Inside Baseball → **To**: Universal Truth

### Step 3: Test for Accessibility

- Would this hook work for wealthy people AND working-class people?
- Can someone understand it in 2 seconds?
- Does it create immediate curiosity or emotion?

## Real Examples from Practice

### Minecraft Education Content

- **Weak**: "Fastest way to get kids interested in Minecraft"
- **Strong**: "Your kid's Minecraft addiction is actually genius"
- **Why it works**: Takes something parents worry about and reframes it positively

### Underdog Story Content

- **Weak**: "Student success story"
- **Strong**: "Never give up on the weird kid"
- **Why it works**: Every parent fears their kid might be the "weird one"

### Job Failure Story

- **Weak**: "Learning from bad experiences"
- **Strong**: "My son's first job sucked. Perfect."
- **Why it works**: Completely unexpected positive reaction to negative outcome

## Warning Signs of Weak Captions

- Uses industry jargon or fancy vocabulary
- Explains rather than intrigues
- Generic phrases everyone uses
- Too long to read quickly
- Doesn't create immediate emotional response

## The Ultimate Test

Before publishing, ask yourself:

1. Would this make ME stop scrolling if I saw it in my feed?
2. Does this create curiosity or emotion in the first 2 seconds?
3. Can my grandmother understand what this is about instantly?
4. Does this hint at the payoff without giving it away?

[Andrew Muto] 10:01:07
Okay, so this is a presentation, a version of the presentation that I used to give at Hoover to both, um.

[Andrew Muto] 10:01:16
Here we go. Yeah, man. Yeah, no rock and roll. So this isâ€¦ this is a version of a presentation I gave at Hoover to both executives to kind of explain, like, the lay of the land.

[Charlie Deist] 10:01:17
If that's cool, I'll just add that, then I don't have to think about notes.

[Andrew Muto] 10:01:29
And then also to my team to kind of get them on the same page as me as to how I look at this.

[Andrew Muto] 10:01:35
And by all means, jump in at any point if you have questions or want to dig a little deeper.

[Andrew Muto] 10:01:40
Um, because each one of these slides could be an hour.

[Andrew Muto] 10:01:44
So, um, let's just get into it. But basically, there's always been two pillars of marketing. Storytelling.

[Andrew Muto] 10:01:51
And reach. Basically, what you've got to say. And how many people will hear it.

[Andrew Muto] 10:01:57
And in the past, this has been both expensive to create.

[Andrew Muto] 10:02:03
And the media buys have been astronomical, and you had to buy every eyeball, whether it was a billboard, or a banner ad, or whatever it was.

[Andrew Muto] 10:02:10
And social media has changed that game. Organic social media has changed that game.

[Andrew Muto] 10:02:16
But the reasons, I don't think, are, like, super well understood. A lot of people willâ€¦ attribute these things toâ€¦ You know, it's on everybody's phone, this is what people are watching these days, TV is dying, kids love it, that kind of stuff.

[Andrew Muto] 10:02:31
And while that stuff is true, the real benefit, the real power that's going on behind the scenes is mostly technical. Around the idea that creative is nowâ€¦ that, like, the quality of the creative is now something that you can

[Andrew Muto] 10:02:47
Earn awareness. And that's never been true before. Like, when I went to film school.

[Andrew Muto] 10:02:53
Myâ€¦ I had to ask permission to get into a film festival. I had to buy my way in, or I had to pitch to Paramount and beg for budget.

[Andrew Muto] 10:03:03
And that's just not the case anymore. And the technical underpinnings, I think, are what make this, like, crazy interesting to me.

[Andrew Muto] 10:03:11
And you've probably heard this before, given your background and how deep you've gone on this, but, like, social media hasn't existed for years. That social media, the concept of social media was, you as a person.

[Andrew Muto] 10:03:23
Have connections, and you build up followers, and those followers are the people that see your content. So there were, years ago, maybe almost a decade at this point.

[Andrew Muto] 10:03:33
Uh, a strong emphasis in getting followers. You needed followers to see your content, and then you fed them what you wanted to feed them.

[Andrew Muto] 10:03:44
But TikTok changed the game, in that TikTok's ideology was, we're not going to send this to their friends. We're going to setâ€¦ we're going to understand what this content is.

[Andrew Muto] 10:03:56
And we are going to send it to like-minded individuals, and that's interest media.

[Andrew Muto] 10:04:02
So the idea that content these days is built around an interest, or a topic some people call it the interest graph. But, like, if you're about cooking.

[Andrew Muto] 10:04:11
You're making cooking content, and that goes to cooking content lovers, or shoes, or beauty, or cameras, or education, whatever that is.

[Andrew Muto] 10:04:22
And once you internalize that, like, that's something I'm sure you've heard before.

[Andrew Muto] 10:04:27
But how do you explain to a box a computer, whatâ€¦ It is you have made, right? Like, how wouldâ€¦ Instagram or TikTok understand that this piece of content is cooking content, and that piece of content is homeschool content.

[Andrew Muto] 10:04:45
And that is what you want to endeavor to get very, very good at, because you're not making content for your brand.

[Andrew Muto] 10:04:54
You're not making content for your customers. You're not making content for the CEO.

[Andrew Muto] 10:05:00
You're making content for the topic. Andâ€¦ you know, you could say, listen, I'm gonna be highâ€¦ I'm gonna niche down. I'm gonna be about like, homeschool education. Fuck and roll.

[Andrew Muto] 10:05:13
That makes sense. But you could also imagine how you can be about mom life.

[Andrew Muto] 10:05:18
Right? Adjacent to that. I had this conversation with aâ€¦ cannabis brand recently. And they're like, you know, we're in bad trouble because we can'tâ€¦ really talk about cannabis on Instagram or TikTok, and even some of, like, the trigger words of, like, gardening and stuff.

[Andrew Muto] 10:05:32
That's all being attacked, and they suppress it And I was like, yeah, cool. Why do you need to be about cannabis? Why can't you be about munchies?

[Andrew Muto] 10:05:41
Like, why can't it just be about snack culture, right? Like, thatâ€¦ that's what you wantâ€¦ you don't have to take it so literally.

[Charlie Deist] 10:05:43
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:05:47
That you're gonna be about your thing, you just want to be really good at topic identification, and one person can do a bunch. Like, for Velvet Alfredo. Am I a camera review account?

[Andrew Muto] 10:06:00
On YouTube, or am I a social media tips and tricks account, or am I a street photo POV, come with me and watch me do my thing. I could be all those things, theoretically.

[Andrew Muto] 10:06:13
Because I just need to make sure that every video is properly positioned to that target topic.

[Charlie Deist] 10:06:13
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:06:19
And then the algo does the rest. Andâ€¦ what these platforms wantâ€¦ is for you to stay in the app. Like, that's their mission.

[Andrew Muto] 10:06:30
And so they do not want to serve you 3 or 4 or 5 pieces of content in a row, and you're like, you keep swiping, you're like, I'm done. I'm gonna goâ€¦ Get some coffee or something. And that happens on TikTok every once in a while. I think TikToks, like, razor edge. I think they really try to push the envelope of trying to get you into different communities.

[Charlie Deist] 10:06:46
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:06:47
Because I'll be in bed, and I'll beâ€¦ and I'll be, what's going on? I just got 10 pieces of content. I hate.

[Andrew Muto] 10:06:53
Andâ€¦ but that's what they're trying to avoid. They want to be able to identify the best content in every single category, so that you stay in the app.

[Andrew Muto] 10:07:04
Watching. And likewise, you don't want to do things that will intentionally have someone leave.

[Andrew Muto] 10:07:11
For instance, if you were to make a, um, Instagram story that's like, yo, I got this awesome thing on Amazon.

[Charlie Deist] 10:07:19
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:07:20
That's aâ€¦ you're gonna leave. And so, you know, that's something that Instagram wants to suppress, and at the same time, obviously, they are building their shop platform. Tiktok's shop is massive.

[Andrew Muto] 10:07:31
Um, so you want to, you know, it isâ€¦ In our best interest to think about the self-serving goals that these platforms have. And When people talk about the ALGO, really all they're talking about is audience satisfaction. And honest to God

[Charlie Deist] 10:07:47
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:07:48
All of the horrible things about social media aside. All social media companies are about is customer sat. That's all they care about. They want themâ€¦ they want you in the app all the time, so just deliver the highest quality content. Andâ€¦

[Andrew Muto] 10:08:04
What defines the highest quality content? Well, that isâ€¦ a question for the ages of, like, it doesn't need to be the best camera.

[Andrew Muto] 10:08:11
It doesn't need to be the funniest thing. It just needs to be interesting in its own sake, and, you know, 15 seconds.

[Andrew Muto] 10:08:19
But don't let it get boring. You have to finish this piece of content.

[Charlie Deist] 10:08:24
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:08:24
Um, and that gets us to this other idea. You'll hear often with the older set, dare I say boomers.

[Andrew Muto] 10:08:33
We want to go viral. And it's like, Iâ€¦ listen, I don't think I've everâ€¦ I may beâ€¦ maybe with Fantastic Data, you're aware of that. Maybe virally-ish.

[Andrew Muto] 10:08:42
But, like, I've never gone viral. What I doâ€¦ is I trend. So, viral is just like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:08:48
Word-of-mouth sharing. I think it would be fair to say No matter how you feel about the guy, that Trump is maybe the king of viral media. Like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:08:57
This guy, he says a thing, and it's incendiary, often, and it fucking goes to the moon. And, like, that's virality.

[Charlie Deist] 10:08:57
Interesting.

[Andrew Muto] 10:09:05
And we have seen content creators through the ages do that.

[Andrew Muto] 10:09:08
Trending is just, like, capitalizing on the algorithmic promotion. That the platform wants to understand, like, this is good content that goes to the people who want to see it. And that's what most influencers capitalize on on a daily basis. That they just want to trend.

[Andrew Muto] 10:09:26
And so trending is what we are chasing. Virality is another thing that I'm not even sure it's often very good.

[Andrew Muto] 10:09:33
Right? Like, I wouldn't even go near that. And I doâ€¦ in my past, I've tried to push back on the idea of virality, because I don't think it's good. It is entirely lightning in a bottle.

[Charlie Deist] 10:09:34
Right, right.

[Charlie Deist] 10:09:43
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:09:44
Um, and trending is algorithmic. Trending is something that you can plan on. Trending, you can have systems behind trending.

[Charlie Deist] 10:09:51
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:09:53
So what makes content trend? And it's relatively basic in that it is watch time slash retention, which can sometimes be thought of as the same things, depending on how deep you want to go in analytics, but watch time retention.

[Andrew Muto] 10:10:07
And engagement will equal views. And that's what you're trying to do. When you make a piece of content, like, so how long should my piece of content be on short-form media?

[Andrew Muto] 10:10:18
Well, as long as you can possibly make it. While making sure that people finish it.

[Charlie Deist] 10:10:22
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:10:22
Right? Like, that's the magic. So, there is no special sauce. It is like, yo, if you can do 90 seconds on Instagram.

[Andrew Muto] 10:10:30
God bless you, but that's tough work. If you look at my content, it's anywhere between 15 and, like, 29 seconds.

[Charlie Deist] 10:10:37
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:10:38
And Facebook loves reminding me that my sub-30 second content always does better.

[Charlie Deist] 10:10:44
Uh-huh.

[Andrew Muto] 10:10:44
And it's like, okay, so that's what I'm trying to do. But go with God. If you can make content longer, do it, because you want to increase that watch time.

[Andrew Muto] 10:10:54
Kind of similarly, on YouTube. There is this desire to be above 10 minutes long, because thatâ€¦ you can pack more ads into that, so you'reâ€¦ Your CPMs will be higher, you'll get more ad revenue on YouTube if you're above 10 minutes.

[Andrew Muto] 10:11:08
But, you can't be bad above 10 minutes, it actually has to be something that you finish, and so there is that tug of war as a creator.

[Charlie Deist] 10:11:12
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:11:18
If you've got a banger 5 minutes. And then you're like, but should I pad it to 10?

[Andrew Muto] 10:11:24
That is theâ€¦ that's a devil's bargain. You're gonna have to figure out what you know, which direction you're gonna go with that, and kind of what your intentions are.

[Charlie Deist] 10:11:26
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:11:33
And then engagement is something we're going to talk about later, but, like, engagement matters. I can tell, so I have all of my notifications go to my watch.

[Andrew Muto] 10:11:41
Every like, every comment, it all comes through. Instagram, uh, kind of throttles the likes, but every comment, for sure.

[Charlie Deist] 10:11:41
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:11:49
And I can see, like, because it'll say, like, 100, uh, your post just got 100 likes, and I can see, like, after how many minutes I posted.

[Andrew Muto] 10:11:57
Like, the velocity of the engagement. And if the velocity of the engagement is high, the video goes to the moon. And yesterday was a great example of the opposite.

[Andrew Muto] 10:12:07
That it was, like, 15 minutes in, and I hadn't gotten 100 likes yet. I was like, uh-oh.

[Charlie Deist] 10:12:12
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:12:12
Not good. And sure enough, video did poorly. And it's like, okay, rock and roll, that'sâ€¦ that was, you know, those are good understandings, good learnings. And so, engagement is a big part of that, and you want to do both of those things at the same time, ideally, and when you do those well together.

[Andrew Muto] 10:12:32
That's when your views will generally skyrocket. So, um, I want to talk a little bit about, like, watch time and retention real quick, because I think this is, like, a really good practical lesson that I went through.

[Andrew Muto] 10:12:43
But we're gonna watch this first video. Let me know if you can't hear it. You should be able to hear it, but this is video 1.

[Andrew Muto] 10:12:53
What's up, dude? How are you, man? Dude, good, man, good! Dude, you look awesome, man! Do you mind if I take your photo? Can I take his photo right here? Is that cool?

[Andrew Muto] 10:13:02
You guys look great! Look at you! Fantastic! Let's get a little closer here. Look at you, yeah, man, you're a star, buddy, I see it.

[Andrew Muto] 10:13:14
That's great, man! How are you? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Alright, buddy, look at you looking good. Look at that!

[Andrew Muto] 10:13:22
Okay, video one, right? Um, and I assume you can hear that.

[Charlie Deist] 10:13:27
Yep.

[Andrew Muto] 10:13:27
Okay, so this is video 2.

[Andrew Muto] 10:13:30
I dig that shirt, dude. Fuck yeah, man. Dude, can I take your photo real quick? Absolutely. Fuck yeah, man, you look great. Dude, you just got a vibe about you. Hold up, you friends wanna get in? You guys wanna get in? Come on, get in! There we go, hell yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:13:43
That's great! Fuck, you guys rock, man, thank you so much! My Instagram's VelvetAlfredo, so say hi on there.

[Andrew Muto] 10:13:51
Okay, so there's two things going on in that contrast that I'm gonna show you in a second, but the difference between those two videos 18,000 views on the first one, 5.2 million on the other.

[Charlie Deist] 10:14:02
Right, right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:14:04
And, you know, when you watch them back-to-back like that, it's pretty obvious that, like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:14:08
The first one is slow. Like, it is, like, we're, like, 2 seconds before I think I even say anything, right? Like, I'm coming in the door, I thought I was being cute with a title sequence.

[Andrew Muto] 10:14:17
And then it's kind of lower energy. The second one, I'm in it right away.

[Andrew Muto] 10:14:22
There's, like, a drama of, clearly, I don't know this person, but I'm talking to this person, and like, what's gonna happen?

[Charlie Deist] 10:14:27
Right, right. Uh-huh.

[Andrew Muto] 10:14:28
And it also moves way faster, and there's just more of an energy.

[Andrew Muto] 10:14:32
And that's the difference, like, just, like, there's noâ€¦ those were posted very close to each other. Those were not, likeâ€¦ it wasn't like my account was really big on the one with 5.2 million.

[Andrew Muto] 10:14:43
No, it's like, these were, like, reallyâ€¦ these were peers. And it demonstrates, like, when you're slow in the beginning.

[Andrew Muto] 10:14:50
It's over. Andâ€¦ Here's an example of a graph.

[Charlie Deist] 10:14:51
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:14:54
That, like, the only difference between these two videos, fundamentally. Is thatâ€¦ the retention time was 1 second for the one on the right, or the left here, and 2 seconds on the one on the right.

[Charlie Deist] 10:15:07
Yep. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:15:10
So the retention rate is really, really, really low. Onâ€¦ on the bad one, and the retention rate is above 25%.

[Andrew Muto] 10:15:17
And you can see that where all the traffic is coming from is from 4U. That's like It's being recommended, as opposed to all the traffic for the others. It's like, oh, the people that follow you, sure.

[Charlie Deist] 10:15:22
Yep.

[Charlie Deist] 10:15:28
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:15:28
Sure, but, like, that'sâ€¦ that's not the mission, especially when you're starting and you only have you know, a handful of followers, that's just not super helpful. You want the algo to do the work for you. Make a banger, the algo sends it out.

[Charlie Deist] 10:15:38
Yeah. Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:15:40
So, like, one second! Is the thing that changed the game here. And so, something to think about when you're making creative.

[Andrew Muto] 10:15:49
You have to be your absolute worst critic. Right? That, like, manâ€¦ get really introspective.

[Andrew Muto] 10:15:57
About what's this beginning like? And I sometimes I push away from the table, like, this content's not good enough, I don't publish it, or sometimes, like, I really try to tweak it, or I'm cognizant of it, and I'm trying to amp it up artificially, whether it's music

[Andrew Muto] 10:16:11
Some cut or something. Every once in a while, I'll even do, like, something for me at the desk to, like, kind of just kick it, but that first second is so important. It's what people consider the hook.

[Charlie Deist] 10:16:23
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:16:24
But people think about the hook like it's programmatic, like you have figured it out, and like, just do the hook. And it's like, well, all that really means is, like, make the first second or two a banger.

[Charlie Deist] 10:16:34
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:16:34
And it needs to keepâ€¦ and what defines a banger Surely some of that is a matter of taste.

[Andrew Muto] 10:16:40
I think that questions are helpful. I thinkâ€¦ Fundamentally, what makes my account work.

[Andrew Muto] 10:16:47
Is, uh, the question, the drama in the question of, can I take your photo?

[Andrew Muto] 10:16:52
I think everybody's like, what's gonna happen? Like, is thisâ€¦ you're gonna get punched in the face. And I'm doing this collab with Samsung right now, and I have talked them into making sure that's in the beginning, because they want to

[Charlie Deist] 10:16:53
Yeah. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:04
They want to do something with a phone to start. And it's like, yeah, I get it. I understand, and I'm taking your money, so rock and roll.

[Charlie Deist] 10:17:07
Yep.

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:11
I think I should do the thing that I do. And because that is what makes this go to the moon.

[Charlie Deist] 10:17:14
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:19
Now, their priorities aren't exactly, like. Viewâ€¦ they don't want toâ€¦ Weirdly, they don't care about the views as much as they care about some other things, soâ€¦ That's where the wiggle has come in. But, like, that is the mission of how do you get somebody to keep watching? And then.

[Charlie Deist] 10:17:30
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:36
How do you get them to finish it? But it's that beginning. If you can get over that first 2 or 3 seconds.

[Charlie Deist] 10:17:39
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:42
Your home, and people will stick with you. Especially if you've done the other stuff right. Oh, go ahead.

[Charlie Deist] 10:17:44
For sure. No. I think about my other client, the 85-year-old psychologist, and in his videos.

[Charlie Deist] 10:17:53
For a long time, all it took was, I'm an 85-year-old clinical psychologist, andâ€¦ you know, and that got people. For a while. It didn't work forever. It still works, actually, but just not quite as well as it did initially.

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:59
Yup. Yeah. Thatâ€¦

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:06
Yeah, that's great. I mean, it's aâ€¦ like, when you find your thing.

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:09
It's really, really helpful. But it really is a shortcut to this conceptual thing of, I need someone in it from the jump. I need someone committed.

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:20
And when you do the next part really well. Then it is all magic. And the next part is, like I said, you're talking to a box. You can call it AI, though. Ai is not a part of modern social media platforms. The compute is way too expensive, there's no fucking way that that's going on.

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:38
Um, what is happening, though, is just some, like, algorithmic pattern recognition stuff.

[Charlie Deist] 10:18:38
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:44
It's doing a handful of things to identify what is this content?

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:48
One of the things at the jump is that Even though they don't state this, this isâ€¦ I don't think anybody's ever said this out loud, but I do think that they categorize accounts more specifically than we self-identify. I think it knows I have a photo account of some kind.

[Charlie Deist] 10:19:03
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:19:06
I think it knows that my wife is about weddings or florals.

[Andrew Muto] 10:19:11
But after that, it's really up to us to decide how do I identify this individual piece of content?

[Andrew Muto] 10:19:18
And, um, and an example there would be that, like, aâ€¦ a tattooed, dancing thirst trap girl.

[Charlie Deist] 10:19:29
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:19:29
Isn't necessarily sent to people who love dancing. It's sent to the historical group of people who want to watch that.

[Charlie Deist] 10:19:40
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:19:40
And so that's why, like, if somebody self-identifies as a dancer or whatever on their account, the way I identify as a photographer, the way that, you know, OpenEd uh, is an education platform.

[Andrew Muto] 10:19:51
That's why that doesn't go far enough. So, like, it's not enough to be like, yo, I've said it in my bio.

[Andrew Muto] 10:19:56
But what it's doing is it's looking at all the relevant areas that it can evaluate to understand what the content is about. So, there are, like, 3 key places just on screen.

[Andrew Muto] 10:20:09
There's the on-screen text that you can type in. Obviously, it is looking at what you type. So if you type in something.

[Andrew Muto] 10:20:18
Nonsensical or kind of Gen Z adjacent, like, it might not know what you mean, but if you're talking about photography, you want to damn well make sure that you're adding the words photo in there.

[Andrew Muto] 10:20:29
Or fashion in there, or, right, like. Like, the words, think about it like SEO, that, like, the words that you're adding on screen through its platform.

[Andrew Muto] 10:20:40
Because it's not necessarily OCRing everything. But through its platform, if you're typing in in the on-screen text, you know, love taking this photo with this baddie.

[Charlie Deist] 10:20:42
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:20:51
You know, short hair forever, whatever. That's, you know, that'sâ€¦ it understands now, okay, so photos, baddie, short hair.

[Andrew Muto] 10:21:00
Okay, got it. And then there's description copy, right? Classic stuff, and Iâ€¦ if you ever look at mine, mine is, like, I stuff it.

[Andrew Muto] 10:21:08
Full of, like, important words. I try to make itâ€¦ I write it all, I don't use any AI, but some of it is vaguely nonsensical and not exactly how I speak, because I'm trying to say words like streetwear, like fashion, like street portrait.

[Charlie Deist] 10:21:21
Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:21:21
Street food. I'm saying all the stuff in there so it can, you knowâ€¦ and you're going for the triple word score here, that hashtags as well. That.

[Andrew Muto] 10:21:29
There's a big brouhaha about how hashtags don't work. Okay, cool, don't use them then.

[Andrew Muto] 10:21:33
But, like, there is no harm in trying toâ€¦ making sure that, like, you don't want to have, like, 50, but Iâ€¦ I put, like 12 in there, andâ€¦ It's just like, listen, if the algo gets confused.

[Charlie Deist] 10:21:42
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:21:46
I'm trying to help steer it in the right direction. And, you know, over time, you can start to derive what hashtags you feel work for you.

[Andrew Muto] 10:21:56
Um, but that'sâ€¦ those are the threeâ€¦ that's the triple word score of on-screen text.

[Andrew Muto] 10:22:01
That you can doâ€¦ you can use to communicate to the platform, this is what my content's about. But there's another one.

[Andrew Muto] 10:22:10
And that's audio. So, when you're talking.

[Andrew Muto] 10:22:14
It'sâ€¦ you could just press a button in Instagram or TikTok or YouTube Shorts, and it'll caption it for you. It's already listened to the audio and transcribed that, whether youâ€¦ the button just puts it on screen.

[Charlie Deist] 10:22:24
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:22:26
It's already doing that, and that's how it derives whether or not you're saying curse words, you're saying inappropriate things, but it's also doing that for SEO, and I don't think people really understand the value of that.

[Andrew Muto] 10:22:38
That, like, if you're about street portraits, you want to say that out loud. You want to say, hey, I just take street portals on the street of interesting people, and you're so fashionable, and, like, all that stuff matters. It is understanding all that, and that goes into the SEO soup.

[Andrew Muto] 10:22:56
And so, if you have the opportunity. You want to make sure you're saying the words.

[Charlie Deist] 10:23:02
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:23:03
Because the words matter. Umâ€¦ Greg is a great example of who I've tried to explain this to, of, like, he's a CFO. He's talking about business.

[Andrew Muto] 10:23:12
Don't shorthand this too much. Try to say the words, because the algo is listening to the words, and the more you can say.

[Andrew Muto] 10:23:21
This is about derivatives, or this is about blah blah blah. It's like, okay, it understands all these things.

[Charlie Deist] 10:23:25
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:23:27
And it's gonna send it to people who are looking for a fund manager, or a derivative strategy, or whatever.

[Andrew Muto] 10:23:33
That's part of the mix. Becauseâ€¦ the platform is aware of the gamesmanship that happens inâ€¦ like, I can write anything I want in the description. I can write anything I want in the hashtags. So it's trying to, like, what is this actually about?

[Andrew Muto] 10:23:47
And so the audio is a really great place to get that information.

[Charlie Deist] 10:23:52
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:23:53
So that is, like, the technical part of how you like, identified to the algo what your content is about. And when you do that, and do the watch time retention.

[Andrew Muto] 10:24:05
You'reâ€¦ you're halfway there. The other half is how you do that on a creative, personal note.

[Andrew Muto] 10:24:10
That you want to make sure that the audience knows, even if the algo is like, listen.

[Andrew Muto] 10:24:16
This is cooking content, and you love cooking content, but if you don't start it off.

[Andrew Muto] 10:24:22
About cooking content. The audience is like, I don't know if I should trust this. I've been served monster truck videos in the past, and I don't want that.

[Charlie Deist] 10:24:27
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:24:30
It's like, okay, cool. So, we have a responsibility as content creators to make sure that we're doing it for the humans, too. And this is an example, and we'll just watch a couple seconds of this, but, like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:24:48
Like, you know what this is about, right? This is a recipe video. And it would be easy for the guy on camera to be bad at this, and start with him talking. One time I was in Las Vegas, and I was like, okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:24:59
Done. And it's like the genius of this guy in particular, I don't know if you've seen him before, but he basically kind of, like, invented this whole, like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:25:07
Theâ€¦ it starts with the end ofâ€¦ this, like, the cross-section.

[Charlie Deist] 10:25:09
Right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:25:13
And it's like, that is genius, because you're like, you're seeing the end, you understand how, like, what you're into.

[Andrew Muto] 10:25:20
It looks delicious, and now you're kind of retroactively looking at the construction. It's like, oh, mwah, that's just such a great format.

[Charlie Deist] 10:25:27
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:25:28
But that's our responsibility, to make sure that both the ALGO and the humans know at the jump, what is this about?

[Andrew Muto] 10:25:38
Andâ€¦ Iâ€¦ it's hard to imagine anything being more important.

[Andrew Muto] 10:25:43
That there isn't the slow burn in social media, in lots of art. And where I get into arguments with like, creatives who have been in, like, the video space, like, yeah, but I want to, like, work upâ€¦ there's no working up to it.

[Andrew Muto] 10:25:55
I mean, if you've even noticed in movie trailers, they'll do the 5-second, like, recap of the whole trailer in the beginning.

[Andrew Muto] 10:26:03
And then it'll cut to the slow burn of Tom Cruise and Mission Impossible. And it's like, okay, yeah, because Even Mission Impossible movie trailers.

[Andrew Muto] 10:26:12
Can't have the patience. You have to jump in from the beginning, like, this is what you're about to watch.

[Charlie Deist] 10:26:18
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:26:18
And so that is a core creative concept. And that's why, just, like, a little behind the scenes, why I don't really think my account is for photographers. I think my account is for people who like to see street interactions.

[Andrew Muto] 10:26:31
Because there's no indication, necessarily, that peopleâ€¦ that I'm gonna even take a photo in the beginning.

[Charlie Deist] 10:26:32
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:26:37
The photos are kind of just like a reason for me to talk to somebody.

[Andrew Muto] 10:26:39
It's really about how do you start a street interaction, and how is that going to go poorly?

[Charlie Deist] 10:26:45
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:26:47
Um, okay, so then, next. Is, like, posting time. This is some, like, the technicals.

[Charlie Deist] 10:26:52
I was gonna ask. Yep.

[Andrew Muto] 10:26:53
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, you know, thisâ€¦ you can make yourself crazy about this, for sure.

[Andrew Muto] 10:26:59
Um, but on Instagram and TikTok, I think it's pretty well understood.

[Andrew Muto] 10:27:04
That you need to publish on or around your peak time frame for your account.

[Andrew Muto] 10:27:11
And so how do you derive that? Well, inside of your analytics onâ€¦ in both of those platforms, and in YouTube Shorts.

[Andrew Muto] 10:27:18
You can see, like, the peak times. You can see a graph. This one's from Instagram. Youtube has a version, TikTok has a version.

[Andrew Muto] 10:27:26
You can see the peak times of, like, when your accounts are active, when the people who follow your accounts are generally active And what I do is I find that peak. In my case, it's been 3PM. This screen grab is from a couple months back, but this is 3PM.

[Andrew Muto] 10:27:42
And then I go one or two hours into the past, and soâ€¦ and my philosophy there is, I want to give the algos something.

[Andrew Muto] 10:27:50
I don't expect it to churn and compute on my video in 10 seconds, that I think that there's a time that it takes for them to do it. I generally think it's in between 1 and 2 hours that it's like, oh, I understand what this content is, and thenâ€¦ And then it shoots it out. And soâ€¦

[Andrew Muto] 10:28:08
I find my peak, and I back it up about 1-2 hours. And you can startâ€¦ I played with that for months to kind of figure it out. And that's what works for me.

[Andrew Muto] 10:28:18
And in your case, I think we look at what your peak time is.

[Andrew Muto] 10:28:22
There isn't so much data there, and we're going to continue to evaluate it over time.

[Andrew Muto] 10:28:26
But let's figure out the peak. And let's back up a little bit, say, an hour or two, and that's when we're going to post.

[Andrew Muto] 10:28:34
And this makes sense when you think about how the platforms work. The platforms are constantly testing content in smaller cohorts. So, like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:28:44
It'll go to, like, some followers in your region, and then if that does well, it'll expand the circles of, like, the geographic areas of, like, who gets served this content, bigger and bigger and bigger in different areas, I think based off of your peak

[Andrew Muto] 10:29:01
Um, the areas where you're most popular. In my case, it's all the metropolitan areas. But, like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:29:07
Youâ€¦ it's rolling this out, and if you continue to perform, it continues rolling this out wider and wider and wider, until some pieces of content are so widely sent out that it's notâ€¦ it's just like, this is just pop culture at this point, right? That, like, everybody saw the kid fall off the scooter because you had to see that video.

[Charlie Deist] 10:29:27
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:29:27
And so, what you're doing, though, if you were to post at 2AM, And all of your followers are not on.

[Andrew Muto] 10:29:36
Then it's gonna be like, well, we sent it to them.

[Andrew Muto] 10:29:38
Because that's what we normally do, and no one was there.

[Andrew Muto] 10:29:42
And the retention rate is low, and the, uh, there's no engagement, and it's like, okay, cool, so you need to post when like, your followers are ready to go to bat for you And that's generally the peak.

[Charlie Deist] 10:29:57
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:29:57
Um, and I back it up a little bit. Umâ€¦ and this is somethingâ€¦ this isn'tâ€¦ this is very much voodoo, in that, like, you really do have to look at your account, and really try to derive, like, what the peak is, and even, like, why does that make sense?

[Andrew Muto] 10:30:14
And then back it up. For Hoover, as an example, it was, like, 9 AM.

[Charlie Deist] 10:30:15
Right. Yep.

[Andrew Muto] 10:30:20
And so we would sometimes publish it, like, 6 AM. Because, like, okay, so if the peak is 9 AM, the logic kind of stood that, like, they're watching this at their desk.

[Charlie Deist] 10:30:23
Uh-huh.

[Andrew Muto] 10:30:30
Okay, or, like, on their couch after the kids have gone to school.

[Andrew Muto] 10:30:35
But there's probably a group of those people that are also watching content in the morning, so we have to hit them while they're still laying in bed waking up.

[Andrew Muto] 10:30:42
Because they wake up, they grab their phone, they spend a couple minutes before the shower. So, like, let's get there. Let's get that window And for you, you know, it could be lunch with moms, or it could be, you know.

[Charlie Deist] 10:30:45
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:30:54
10 a.m. And whatever, but that'sâ€¦ this is something that we have to work out. And you have to watch it over time, becauseâ€¦ I found this on Fantastic Daily. To a lesser extent, I found this on my account, that, like, when you get some big hits, and we're gonna talk about big hits later, when you get some big hits, your demographic can change quickly.

[Charlie Deist] 10:31:10
Yep.

[Andrew Muto] 10:31:10
Like, you know, a million view video may change the dynamic of your account very quickly, so you kind of have toâ€¦ re-evaluate every once in a while, pop in once a month to this particular graph across the platforms.

[Andrew Muto] 10:31:24
And try to understand, like, is it the same? The one caveat to this is YouTube swears up and down that long-form publishing, it doesn't matter when you post.

[Charlie Deist] 10:31:27
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:31:36
Andâ€¦ I think a lot of people have tested different things, and that's one where I'm a little loosey-goosey.

[Andrew Muto] 10:31:43
I have never been able to find a time that was different for me. It was always based on the topicality and the thumbnail.

[Andrew Muto] 10:31:52
And I never published at 2 in the morning, but the difference between 9am and 4.30 PM. I could never derive a difference, and Iâ€¦ because I think thatâ€¦ U2 has a slower, long form, has a slower roll.

[Charlie Deist] 10:32:00
Didn't make a bigâ€¦

[Andrew Muto] 10:32:06
That it publishes, and then it kind of sits on it for a while, and it's testing it a little bit.

[Charlie Deist] 10:32:07
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:32:12
And, like, I have one video that I published yesterday. It's at a 2 out of 10 rank on me, so it's, like, one of the highest like, rated videos I've done in a long time.

[Andrew Muto] 10:32:20
And itâ€¦ I can tell it's gonna go to the moon, it just hasn'tâ€¦ it hasn't taken off yet, but it's working. And it's like, man, I bet in, like, 7 days.

[Andrew Muto] 10:32:30
This is gonna be up. And I think it wouldn't have mattered, really, when I posted. And I posted that at a random time at, like, it was, like, 4.30pm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:32:37
Yesterday. Umâ€¦

[Charlie Deist] 10:32:38
Yeah. It's interesting, I'm just looking at TikTok right now, and it seems like most active times. I canâ€¦ I'm just seeing, like, scrolling back a week, it's all around.

[Charlie Deist] 10:32:47
Like, 4, 5, 6 p.m. Small sample size.

[Andrew Muto] 10:32:49
Interesting. Okay, and those times are usually local. Those are usually local for you, yeah. So.

[Charlie Deist] 10:32:54
Right, right, yeah. Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:32:56
Even going into the evening is interesting. Okay? That's, I mean, that's good to know.

[Andrew Muto] 10:33:03
This also takes a bit of the stress off of it, too, that, like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:33:05
At Hoover, we had some debates with the team of, like, who's waking up at 6 to do this.

[Charlie Deist] 10:33:09
Oh, yeah. You couldn'tâ€¦ you couldn't just schedule it.

[Andrew Muto] 10:33:11
The other thingâ€¦ Well, so, Iâ€¦ I drove a pretty hard line to my team, and to myself. I don'tâ€¦ do any kind of scheduling, because I want to be in the comments, and I want to watch the response, and I want to be Johnny on the spot with that.

[Andrew Muto] 10:33:26
And it felt like, listen guys, maybe when we're home run hitters.

[Charlie Deist] 10:33:30
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:33:31
We can automate this, but right now. We have an obligation to be, like, in the trenches.

[Andrew Muto] 10:33:37
An analogy I always use is, like, I want to be the spider on the web.

[Andrew Muto] 10:33:42
That can feel when something has happened to the web, because it vibrates ever so slightly. I can tell.

[Andrew Muto] 10:33:47
When something's up in my community onâ€¦ on Velvet. That, like, when there's a little bit of controversy, or some commenters going off the rails, like, I can feel it, because I'm in there every day. It is not a moonlighting thing. It's like, oh, stop him once a day. I am always in it, and I can

[Andrew Muto] 10:34:04
Feel it, and I think that has a benefit of, like, I know what they want to see tomorrow, or I know what I haven't posted in a while, or I feel like I've posted too many gay guys in a row.

[Charlie Deist] 10:34:11
Yep.

[Andrew Muto] 10:34:14
Like, I should poâ€¦ you know, like, I have this vibe of, like, I needâ€¦ I can tell what the audience wants.

[Andrew Muto] 10:34:20
And so, okay, that's what I need toâ€¦ I need toâ€¦ so I don't automate any of that.

[Andrew Muto] 10:34:24
No shame for anybody who does. But I do think there's a benefit of getting as deep as you possibly can.

[Charlie Deist] 10:34:27
Yep.

[Charlie Deist] 10:34:32
Right, right. That makes sense. And I can see that that would workâ€¦ you know, focusing on one or two platforms, you can be in it.

[Charlie Deist] 10:34:41
If you try to do it on all 6 or whatever that we're on, five.

[Andrew Muto] 10:34:42
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:34:47
Um, you're probably gonna fall flat.

[Andrew Muto] 10:34:49
Yeah, yeah. Um, okay, so then let's getâ€¦ let's talk about engagement here.

[Andrew Muto] 10:34:54
For a bit. Soâ€¦ you want people to start talking. I mean, fundamentally, that's what engagement is. Likesâ€¦ So each piece of engagement, whether it is a like.

[Charlie Deist] 10:35:05
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:35:07
A share, a save, a comment. They're all different signals to the algo, and the common belief is that they're weighted differently.

[Andrew Muto] 10:35:15
That a like is, like, the least valuable. And something like a share or a save is the most valuable. And the reason for that is that a like does not in any way invite a new person to watch the video and keep them in the platform any longer, right? It's a very passive, just indication that it's a good video.

[Charlie Deist] 10:35:34
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:35:34
But a share is like, not only did I watch it, but I brought somebody else into Instagram to watch it too, so now I've just increased the watch time for you, Mr. Platform.

[Charlie Deist] 10:35:43
Right, yep.

[Andrew Muto] 10:35:44
Same with the save, except the save isâ€¦ self-serving, in that, like, I watched it, I want to watch it again.

[Andrew Muto] 10:35:51
So I'm gonna save it. And that means it's an indication that they're gonna come back and watch again. A comment isn't necessarily the most powerful signal either, but I think it is stronger than a like. So I would go share save at the top.

[Andrew Muto] 10:36:08
Comment in the middle, a At the bottom. So, really, you want to get people talking and acting.

[Andrew Muto] 10:36:16
And I think the way to do this is you have two options. You're either informative.

[Andrew Muto] 10:36:22
Or you're polarizing. And polarizing doesn't need to be burn the world down political stuff. It can just be entertaining or dramatic.

[Charlie Deist] 10:36:28
Right, right. Yep.

[Andrew Muto] 10:36:31
Right? When a kid falls off a scooter, that is polarizing. When you're learning something that's informative. A recipe video is informative.

[Andrew Muto] 10:36:40
And I think they deliver different things. Informative of shares, saves, and they increase your following because you want more of it. A polarizing piece of content generally doesn't increase your following.

[Andrew Muto] 10:36:55
But it leads to higher engagesâ€¦ there's comments, there's likes, and there's repeat viewings, and there is a chance that people will send that to other people, like, you gottaâ€¦ you gotta listen to this, this is crazy. Right? Like, and I think podcast stuff is fundamentally polarizing information, and so people send

[Charlie Deist] 10:37:07
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:37:14
Those clips to each other. Um, but these are the two ways. And, andâ€¦ I'm sure that intrinsically you have a sense of what this is, but I have some examples for you. Um, this first one is this designer, and this is, like, to me, informative content at its core.

[Charlie Deist] 10:37:28
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:37:29
Um, but let's just watch real quick.

[Charlie Deist] 10:37:39
Oh, yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:37:52
So good.

[Andrew Muto] 10:37:53
So good. So, I mean, that's the kind of stuff where you're watching the whole thing.

[Andrew Muto] 10:37:58
It's veryâ€¦ if youâ€¦ if you gotâ€¦ if you got served a second one of those guys, that guy there, you're following them.

[Charlie Deist] 10:38:04
Yep.

[Andrew Muto] 10:38:04
Right? Like, it's like, okay, I dig it, and it builds this, like, community thought leadership, the whole thing.

[Andrew Muto] 10:38:10
Um, and it also is likely something that is worth either saving or sending to somebody else.

[Charlie Deist] 10:38:10
Mm-hmm.

[Charlie Deist] 10:38:16
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:38:17
And then there is the polarizing stuff, and I know you love GaryVee, I love GaryVee.

[Andrew Muto] 10:38:22
Um, well, I don't want to say it. You've mentioned GaryVee. I get theâ€¦ I get theâ€¦

[Charlie Deist] 10:38:25
Yeah, I likeâ€¦ I'm a fan. I've sort of studied him a little bit, not in super, super depth, but his, sort of.

[Charlie Deist] 10:38:32
His, like, inverted content pyramid, the pillar pieces, the derivative stuff.

[Charlie Deist] 10:38:37
Um, and like podcast clips, that's sort of, you know, something thatâ€¦ I think I probably derived from him.

[Andrew Muto] 10:38:42
Yeah, what I think's great about him is that, like, I remember watching him when he was on Wine Library TV, that he was, like, with the Dig Boys.

[Charlie Deist] 10:38:48
Uh-huh.

[Andrew Muto] 10:38:50
And the Dignation guys, Kevin Rose and Alex Albrecht. Um, and it was, like, watching him kind of, like, figure this out in real time, and then the no-bullshit approach of, like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:38:59
Madison Avenue is stealing your money, and it really is just about creative. It really is just like, if you make a banger.

[Andrew Muto] 10:39:08
For the first time ever, social media is the place where you can just get free awareness, just but make a banger.

[Charlie Deist] 10:39:12
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:39:13
And, like, nobody else wanted to talk about that. And he wasâ€¦ I think he's, like, really led that charge.

[Charlie Deist] 10:39:18
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:39:19
Um, but polarizing is what it sounds like, you know, unexpected opinions, hot takes.

[Andrew Muto] 10:39:23
Controversial ideas in your industry, right? So they don't need to beâ€¦ about abortion rights, obviously, it wouldâ€¦ like, my wife, in her floral stuff, she talks about fake flowers, and how she's very anti-fake flowers.

[Charlie Deist] 10:39:26
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:39:39
In her industry. That is a controversial hot take. And it gets people arguing. Orâ€¦ in the wedding universe. Umâ€¦ the responsibility of bridesmaids.

[Charlie Deist] 10:39:43
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:39:51
And it's like, boy, oh boy, if she wants a million view video.

[Andrew Muto] 10:39:55
She need only mention. The responsibility of bridesmaids, and that thing goes to the moon.

[Andrew Muto] 10:40:00
And people get arguing in the comments, they, you know, flame wars, the whole thing. My wife isâ€¦ unfortunately very susceptible to being self-conscious about Like, she feels like she has to defend herself. It's like, no, no, no.

[Andrew Muto] 10:40:13
Let them fight it out. I never respond negatively to comments, I never take comments down unless they're hate speech to somebody, some other commenter.

[Charlie Deist] 10:40:19
Yeah. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:40:21
Letâ€¦ you want them to go crazy, because The algo doesn't understand, uhâ€¦ context. So, a positive comment and a negative comment is just a comment.

[Charlie Deist] 10:40:29
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:40:34
And it doesn't care. It just wants, like, whoa, this video is hot. Like, even though comments are, like, not rated as high for us as, say, a share or save there's 10,000 of them, so something's going on.

[Charlie Deist] 10:40:46
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:40:46
And the retention rate on the video is great, so rock and roll. Like, they canâ€¦ the creator can figure out whether or not this is good or bad for them.

[Andrew Muto] 10:40:54
But here's an example. I mean, you probably don't even need to play this, but it willâ€¦

[Andrew Muto] 10:40:58
Who gives a shit if you're losing when you're in college? You got 80 fucking years to stick it to them, bro! If you're scared of other people's opinion, fuck up on purpose, then everybody thinks you suck shit, then it's all upside!

[Andrew Muto] 10:41:08
I'm telling you, I'm not joking! Maybe the advice I'm giving you, man, is based on what happened to me, which was, because I sucked so bad at school, and that's the only way that we were graded back then, that all expectations were goose egg for me.

[Andrew Muto] 10:41:22
And all of it was upside, so I was liberated to play in the fucking machine, and just went on straight fucking offense and fucking won. So go fuck up.

[Andrew Muto] 10:41:32
And I think, you know, hisâ€¦ style of speaking, and the fact that he's so quick to curse.

[Charlie Deist] 10:41:36
Yeah. Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:41:39
Adds polarity. Where even there isn't any. Like, if you couldâ€¦ there's a version, there's a polite version of the way heâ€¦ you could say that.

[Charlie Deist] 10:41:42
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:41:47
And it wouldn't be quite as hot. And it's like, yeah, you can bringâ€¦ and, you know, umâ€¦ uhâ€¦ opinion news articles, or TV magazines, right? Like.

[Charlie Deist] 10:41:49
Nope.

[Andrew Muto] 10:42:00
They're really good at this. They'll take one little idea, and then there'll be incendiary about it for 48 hours, and it's like, okay, well, that's the polarizing. That really, really works. Human nature loves to see, like, oh my god, I can't believe ex-politician did this, and it's like, okay.

[Charlie Deist] 10:42:05
Yeah, yeah. Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:42:14
Well, that's what's going on. It's addictive.

[Charlie Deist] 10:42:16
No. Yeah, butâ€¦ and there'sâ€¦ The positive frame, I'm thinking of a newsletter, the only newsletter that I actually read daily when I happen to be in my inbox is called Pirate Wires.

[Charlie Deist] 10:42:27
And they do 3 quick takes, and they have this very irreverent sort of style with, you know, with some cursing and a little bit ofâ€¦ they'll use very imprecise language to say things that are like, when they say them, it's just like, oh, of course that's true, so they'll talk about, you know, meanwhile, China is installing

[Charlie Deist] 10:42:45
Literally, you know, hella gigawatts of this, andâ€¦ Somehow, it justâ€¦ it cuts through all the noise and bullshit, and makes it fun.

[Andrew Muto] 10:42:52
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:42:54
I'd like to do more of that in my own, you know, the written content, especially And it's hard because, you know, families, moms, there's certain things where I can't go into, like, the cursing andâ€¦ taking stances. It's alwaysâ€¦ Tempting to just play the safest possible path on the newsletter, but Iâ€¦

[Andrew Muto] 10:43:11
Sure.

[Charlie Deist] 10:43:13
Um, I know thatâ€¦ if I try to serve everybody, then I end up serving nobody. It just turns into the lowest common denominator of bland boilerplate.

[Andrew Muto] 10:43:19
Yeah. And I think, you know, we canâ€¦ run some exercises as to, like, identifying areas that areâ€¦ ripe for polarization in the open ed universe. Like, I think you guys are already dangerously close. The idea that one would leave public schools

[Charlie Deist] 10:43:31
Yep. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:43:39
That's already, likeâ€¦ you're already there.

[Charlie Deist] 10:43:43
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:43:44
Um, it's just a matter of, like, how do you make thisâ€¦ feel like, oh, wow, that's like aâ€¦ it feels, when it comesâ€¦ when it's served in a polarizing style, it feels electric.

[Andrew Muto] 10:43:54
It feels like, wow! I'm gonna keep watching, at a minimum. I am going toâ€¦ send it to somebody, I am going to take action.

[Andrew Muto] 10:44:04
All of this isn't even really about any kind of CTA.

[Andrew Muto] 10:44:08
There is kind of, like, a companion concept to everything I'm showing here.

[Andrew Muto] 10:44:13
That is like, this is actually just the best lead generation engine on planet Earth.

[Charlie Deist] 10:44:18
Yep.

[Andrew Muto] 10:44:18
But all I'm solving for for myself and for you right now, is how do we just make the social media great?

[Andrew Muto] 10:44:25
Right? And we will figure out how to convert this later, but how do we just try to build this audience?

[Charlie Deist] 10:44:30
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:44:31
Um, let meâ€¦ let's keep going here. So, next isâ€¦ kind of creative ideas. So I've taken the liberty here to kind of, like, jump into a few ideas.

[Andrew Muto] 10:44:41
Um, and these areâ€¦ Topics, not necessarily the way you'd go about them. Like, you won't see any podcast material in this, but you can kind of see how, like, alright, I'm gonnaâ€¦ I'm gonna attach this idea to podcast, and now we've got it. But, like.

[Charlie Deist] 10:44:54
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:45:02
You know, I chose these mantras, which I'm going to show you.

[Andrew Muto] 10:45:06
Emotional stuff, kind of science-slash-psychology stuff, and then kind of how-to.

[Charlie Deist] 10:45:11
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:45:11
I shouldn't even be so specific in homeschool, but the idea of how to homeschool, or how to do this thing, you're offering them the opportunity to step out of the public school education system, and the obvious next question is, alright, so what's next? And so you can imagine an entire series of content based on that.

[Andrew Muto] 10:45:29
But let's watch these, andâ€¦ They are both similar.

[Andrew Muto] 10:45:33
Um, and different at the same time.

[Andrew Muto] 10:45:37
That's the way I like it. And that's the way I like it.

[Andrew Muto] 10:45:44
That's the way I like it. I'm 30 for 30, I'm 30 for 30, I'm 30 for 30, I'm 30 for 30.

[Andrew Muto] 10:45:54
Can they fold that bitch no yoga mat?

[Charlie Deist] 10:46:03
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:46:03
So, polarizing. Right? But very simple, right? Like, this is a piece of trending audio.

[Andrew Muto] 10:46:09
Um, that has no relationship. To the video in any way.

[Charlie Deist] 10:46:09
Yep.

[Andrew Muto] 10:46:14
It is just like, yo, got it, it's a beat, it's a banger, and theâ€¦ Sure.

[Charlie Deist] 10:46:17
But it's the right mood, too. It's likeâ€¦ it's kind of like, screw you, I'm doing my own thing.

[Andrew Muto] 10:46:22
Fair, yeah, but I can imagine it beingâ€¦ I think the value is just like, yo, we're gonna play in the same game as this other trending audio spots, and, like, the algoâ€¦ you know, that's something the algo takes into consideration, too, of like, well, this trending audio, people love this audio, so I'm gonna send it to people who love this audio, and we'll see how it goes. I think often.

[Charlie Deist] 10:46:29
Yeah, yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:46:37
Quick, quick tactic, quick kind of tactical question. Um, so this one's onâ€¦ that's on Instagram there.

[Andrew Muto] 10:46:38
Oh, go ahead. Yep.

[Charlie Deist] 10:46:44
Um, and, uh, if I insert audio in my own editor, I use Descript for the most part for podcasts, and I also use it for clips.

[Charlie Deist] 10:46:52
Does Instagram detect what the track is and display it like that, or do I need to add that inside of Instagram's editor? Or if you did this in CapCut or something like that.

[Charlie Deist] 10:47:03
Would it recognize the audio, and as part of its, like, DRM library?

[Andrew Muto] 10:47:08
Got it. Um, so I have had people tell me that it does. I've never seen that work.

[Andrew Muto] 10:47:14
So, what I do is I overcut, like, I'll download a clip like this. In this case, I screen-recorded it, and I would take that in, and I would go to the very first frame of where this audio starts. You canâ€¦ it's pretty easy to derive, right?

[Charlie Deist] 10:47:19
Yep.

[Charlie Deist] 10:47:24
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:47:26
And then I would overcut on top of, like, the sample. Like, I would find a video that I'm kind of, like, imitating, right? I'd overcut.

[Andrew Muto] 10:47:33
I'd export, and if it was just the audio, then I would go back up and I would find that trending audio that I've already saved, apply that video, and turn down my video audio, right? So that now it has the right one.

[Charlie Deist] 10:47:34
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:47:45
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:47:47
If you're gonna do it with somebody talking in the background, let's say, then you have to export it without the audio, but you already know it's already lined up.

[Charlie Deist] 10:47:52
Uh-huh. Yep.

[Andrew Muto] 10:47:56
And so, you got it. That's how I do it to guarantee, because whatâ€¦ so I have a friend who runs a content agency, and he told me that he doesn't do it that way, he just uploads it raw from where he ripped it, and he said after a certain amount of time.

[Andrew Muto] 10:48:13
It understands the trending part. To me, it doesn't make any sense. I'm not waitingâ€¦ I don't even want to wait a minute for the ALGO to understand The benefit of the trending audio is not creative The benefit of the trending audio is algorithmic, and so I don't want there to be a delay.

[Charlie Deist] 10:48:25
I see.

[Andrew Muto] 10:48:26
For it to understand. It definitely doesn't understand in an instant.

[Andrew Muto] 10:48:30
Um, so that'sâ€¦ that's what I do. I overcut, and I just realign it.

[Charlie Deist] 10:48:33
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:48:35
Um, and it's super simple. Once you do 4 of them, it's like, okay, this is baby simple.

[Andrew Muto] 10:48:42
Um, okay, but, oh, you mentioned CapCut, though. Capcut and Instagram edits will do this for you now, though.

[Andrew Muto] 10:48:50
So, if you work inside those platforms, you can, like, log in with your TikTok information, say, I'm gonna use that, and then it'll do that for you.

[Charlie Deist] 10:48:55
Yeah. Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:48:59
Um, so that'sâ€¦ I don't do that way either. I edit it all in Premiere because I'mâ€¦ 44 years old, and I had been trained on Premiere for years. So, likeâ€¦ Um, okay, soâ€¦ Next is emotional.

[Charlie Deist] 10:49:06
Hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:49:12
I wish I'd known this decades ago, when my kids were small. If we get the first 3 years right, we're basically okay. And if we don't, we're gonna spend the rest of our lives doing remedial parenting. And the most important dynamic in those first 3 years, first 5 years, is the attachment relationship. Soâ€¦ you may be an entrepreneur, and you may have all these ambitions and responsibilities, but if you decide that the attachment relationship with your child is primary, you're gonna make sure that every day you do owe time to it. Every day you hang out with that kid, not for the purpose of instructing them.

[Charlie Deist] 10:49:23
That's Lex Friedman.

[Charlie Deist] 10:49:29
O Gabor Mate, Gabor Mate. That's funny, okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:49:30
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:49:35
Yeah, I know him.

[Andrew Muto] 10:49:47
Or, um, watching TV together, or everybody's sitting there on their cell phones, isolated, but to relate to each other in a warm, playful way. You're gonna find time every day to do that.

[Andrew Muto] 10:49:57
And you can see how that's adjacent toâ€¦ open ed, right? It's not open ed, like, if you showed this to the CFO, he'd be like, but it's notâ€¦ Why are we not talking about homeschooling, or whatever? Like, yeah, yeah, yeah, but we'reâ€¦ we're supporting the ideology of our

[Charlie Deist] 10:50:00
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:50:09
Yeah, yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:50:16
No, totally, totally.

[Andrew Muto] 10:50:16
Likely customers. And so, this is the kind of stuff where, likeâ€¦ and that is informational, right? That feels like I've just been delivered a bunch of information in a really captivating way.

[Andrew Muto] 10:50:27
Andâ€¦ infinitely reproducible. Which we will talk about later.

[Charlie Deist] 10:50:30
Yep, yep. I'm getting some ideas here.

[Andrew Muto] 10:50:34
Um, and then now we've got science slash psychology, which I'm using loosely, but you'll see.

[Andrew Muto] 10:50:41
Little boys who are between 3 and 5 years old have surges of testosterone.

[Andrew Muto] 10:50:47
Almost as much as an adolescent's. And so they need to run and jump And push and explore, and they're not getting to do that. Instead, they're sitting quietly, and they're going crazy.

[Andrew Muto] 10:51:00
And so, another one, we're like, I'm just assuming, based on the poise of her voice, she seemed professional to me. But she could also be a mom.

[Andrew Muto] 10:51:08
And it's like, okay, cool, so now we're talking a bit of the underpinnings, and again.

[Charlie Deist] 10:51:08
Yep, yep.

[Andrew Muto] 10:51:13
These are kind of, like, the triggers that I think your community would love to hear, and the content is not necessarily very difficult to make.

[Andrew Muto] 10:51:21
And then this homeschool one, this video was actually really long. I can'tâ€¦ I clipped it, so we don't only have to listen to a few seconds of this, but you're gonna get it.

[Charlie Deist] 10:51:27
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:51:28
What do you think about this? I love it!

[Andrew Muto] 10:51:31
So, this is the meme one. I've got another one where a woman walks through her entire room that she built into a, umâ€¦ like a homeschool classroom, and all the steps, and she went through every little item, and how she did it, and the whole thing, but it's all voiceover.

[Andrew Muto] 10:51:47
And filmed, you know, with an iPhone. I'll dig it up and I'll send it to you. Sorry, I put the wrong one in. But this is a meme, which I'm gonna get to the next, on the next page here.

[Charlie Deist] 10:51:52
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:51:56
They're like, these are the creative tactics that I would go after. In this case, these all represent, I think.

[Charlie Deist] 10:51:58
Yeah. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:52:03
The easiest possible version. Of, I have nothing, and I need to start, which is, alright, so we're gonna write it.

[Andrew Muto] 10:52:09
We're gonna find a voice to record it. It could be different voices. It could be your voice, it could be another employee's voice, it could beâ€¦ we could find professionals, it could be whatever.

[Andrew Muto] 10:52:18
And then we're gonna marry it up with some video footage that we're gonna have to collect, and how we collect will talk about. But, like, you can start to derive, like, how this isâ€¦ makeable.

[Charlie Deist] 10:52:23
Yeah. Yep.

[Andrew Muto] 10:52:31
And we would do theseâ€¦ with aâ€¦ in a variety of different ways. Like, each oneâ€¦ each one of those mantras, emotional.

[Andrew Muto] 10:52:40
How-to, science, me. That could also be from podcast perspective. That could also be, um, through, like, just text on screen, like.

[Charlie Deist] 10:52:45
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:52:50
Trending audio. Like, there's a billion ways to do this, but, like, those are kind of the categories I would go after.

[Andrew Muto] 10:52:56
And then, as the initial volley of, like, what is and is not going to work.

[Andrew Muto] 10:53:02
And you do many of them, and then you're looking for the peaks.

[Andrew Muto] 10:53:08
We'll talk about that in a second, too. But, um, lastly, I just added this one. This oneâ€¦ I think is highly underrated.

[Andrew Muto] 10:53:15
I think one of the number one ways that my account has gone well beyond what it deserves is that, like, people don't know a lot of street photo photographers. But people know me, I've got recognized in LA, New York.

[Andrew Muto] 10:53:33
Um, and it's because I always say my name. I always say Velvet Alfredo.

[Charlie Deist] 10:53:38
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:53:39
And people will be in the comments and be like, yo, why don't you have business cards? I said, because I don't care about the person I'm talking to!

[Andrew Muto] 10:53:45
I care about the audience listening! Velvet Alfredo, I'm saying it out loud. Now, that's just a verbal.

[Andrew Muto] 10:53:51
Subliminal CTA. But, like, Hermosi here, this is the first guy I can think of.

[Charlie Deist] 10:53:56
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:53:57
He can't be in a podcast without wearing Acquisition.com on his shirt.

[Andrew Muto] 10:54:01
Right? Like, if every single podcast that your team is on We need to suit them up. Like, we need to make sure that, like, there needs to be subliminal branding in all of it.

[Andrew Muto] 10:54:12
Because that is all, like, earned media that they deserve for the brand. And so it's like, this cannot be a J.Crew sweater. Like, we gottaâ€¦ That's, like, I would put that as a high priority, like, we need to figure out how to brand

[Charlie Deist] 10:54:26
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:54:29
Every moment, so that people don't just walk away from, hey, that was a great bit ofâ€¦ Um, that was a great mantra, or I loved the meme.

[Charlie Deist] 10:54:39
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:54:39
But we need credit. The bad way is to put the logo on screen, right? Like, that's not what we're trying to do. We're trying to do this in a way that feels organic, to the point where people are arguing with you. They're like, yo, dude, get business cards. Yo, Alex, is that the only shirt you've got? It's like, yeahâ€¦

[Andrew Muto] 10:54:56
Okay, rock and roll. So, then let's get to publishing. And this is an idea that, like.

[Charlie Deist] 10:54:58
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:55:05
I have been increasingly obsessed about, I just made a YouTube video about this that I'm either publishing tomorrow.

[Andrew Muto] 10:55:10
Or tonight or tomorrow. But, like, this, to me, is how you win.

[Andrew Muto] 10:55:17
Like, this entireâ€¦ this is the only screen that if all you did was this.

[Andrew Muto] 10:55:23
You would win on your own accord. Post as often as possible. Now, why? Why would you do that? It hasâ€¦ people will be like, oh, because the algo, like, if youâ€¦ if you don't post for too long, the algo forgets you, and it's like, oh, there's benefitsâ€¦ I don't know, I don't even know if that's true.

[Andrew Muto] 10:55:38
What I know is true is that social media, at its core.

[Andrew Muto] 10:55:42
Is just the most incredible focus group of all time, that you can Press the upload button, and your piece of content gets served to people, and they either like it or they don't. So any questions you have.

[Andrew Muto] 10:55:55
About the content you should be making, your messaging, what your business is about.

[Andrew Muto] 10:56:01
Your strategy, all of that can be distilled down into a piece of content that explores whether or not That is or is not true.

[Charlie Deist] 10:56:09
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:56:09
The audience told me that they liked positive content. They liked how lightweight and happy my content was.

[Andrew Muto] 10:56:18
And Iâ€¦ well, you know, I was in the back of my mind, but it could have been a lot of things, right? I could have had bad street encounters. I could have made videos about people yelling at me, which has happened on rare occasion, but if I knew it was a banger, I could do it more.

[Andrew Muto] 10:56:31
The audienceâ€¦ this is how any question that you've got about the business, the audience can answer.

[Andrew Muto] 10:56:37
And so, you needâ€¦ to publish as often as possible to get that information. And really, it isn'tâ€¦ the deep dive into analytics that a lot of people think it is. It's not about video completion rates, it's not about CTR, it's not about any of that.

[Andrew Muto] 10:56:54
It's the simple metric that is publicly available, like, that video got 100 views, that video got a million, what did you do on that video?

[Andrew Muto] 10:57:02
And then having an introspective, no-ego looking, like, what is good about that video?

[Andrew Muto] 10:57:07
Is it the guy's shirt that says, defund the IRS? Is it the fact that he has a bit of, like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:57:13
Jake Galifianakis in him. Was I particularly interesting? Probably not. Was it justâ€¦ fast? Yes. Like, what is it? And then you start to test those assumptions over time.

[Charlie Deist] 10:57:14
Yeah, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:57:25
And you start to be, like, reallyâ€¦ becauseâ€¦ as an artist, um, I have opinions about the content I want to make.

[Andrew Muto] 10:57:33
But at my best, I put that aside, like, listen, I gotta prove it, though. I gotta make sure this works, because I have done the thing where I've made content no one sees. And it hurts. And I want to make content that everybody loves. And so I need to test my assumptions.

[Andrew Muto] 10:57:48
And the only way to do that, if I published once a week.

[Andrew Muto] 10:57:53
I guess I'd figure it out when I'm 90. Right? If I publish every day, I get that data quicker, and the cycle is quicker.

[Andrew Muto] 10:58:02
And then there's the more at-bats thing. How my account got as big as it got in terms of follower count and viewership, is fundamentally the home runs.

[Andrew Muto] 10:58:11
It wasn't like I stacked together. A bunch of 1,600 view videos. I hadâ€¦ I was doing great, and then I had 50,000. Oh, okay, wow, that's dramatically more than I'd ever seen before, and then I got, you know, an extra thousand followers, because I was like, cool. Then I had a million view videos, like, wow, I just got

[Andrew Muto] 10:58:30
15,000 additional followers. I'm shopping for home runs.

[Andrew Muto] 10:58:35
The bass hits are great, you learn a lot of things in the bass hits, but the home runs are what move the needle, and that's what you want. If you're trying to hit home runs.

[Andrew Muto] 10:58:45
It doesn't make sense to show up once a week. It doesn't make sense to show up you know, twice a month.

[Andrew Muto] 10:58:52
You need to show up as often as possible, because it's just more opportunities.

[Charlie Deist] 10:58:57
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:58:58
And then this last part, that no one talks about, but I've seen it happen on my account, on Fantastic Daily, on Hoover, on my wife's account.

[Andrew Muto] 10:59:07
Building your archive. Has crazy compounding effects. Because when you do get those home runs.

[Andrew Muto] 10:59:15
It's not like those people disappear. They go back into your stuff, like, I love this guy.

[Andrew Muto] 10:59:21
And I'm sure you've felt this before, you find somebody you like, and you're like, oh, I'm gonna go back into the archive, right? And you watch everything.

[Charlie Deist] 10:59:23
Hmm. Right. Binge watch. Yep, yep.

[Andrew Muto] 10:59:28
And it compounds, right? So it's like now, instead of getting a million views.

[Andrew Muto] 10:59:33
You got the million views, but then all of this got bigger, too. And it's like, holy God, imagine, there's this guy I followâ€¦ are you familiar with Van Nystad, Casey Neistat's brother?

[Charlie Deist] 10:59:43
No, I know Casey Neistat, though.

[Andrew Muto] 10:59:45
Okay, so he has a brother, Van, who is kind of moreâ€¦ handy and granola crunching, and he lives in the forest of Topanga in California.

[Andrew Muto] 10:59:55
And he's just a wacky guy. I love his content. He only publishes once or twice a month now.

[Andrew Muto] 11:00:00
And it's like, man, imagine if when I find him. He had daily content.

[Charlie Deist] 11:00:01
Okay.

[Charlie Deist] 11:00:07
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:00:09
Through the moon, he would be! He wouldâ€¦ 10X his money if he, likeâ€¦ And that's justâ€¦ that's just the ad revenue, but imagine the views. Imagine, like, everything works really well. When you're archive exists, and people watch all of it, it's like.

[Andrew Muto] 11:00:24
The compounding effects are crazy. And so, fundamentally.

[Andrew Muto] 11:00:30
I think daily is the goal, and I know that's overwhelming to a lot of people.

[Andrew Muto] 11:00:34
But, like, I think that's the high watermark. Some people like GaryVee say more than that.

[Andrew Muto] 11:00:40
I think that's crazy. I think you have to have a machine going of teams of people doing it, and it's like, I've never been in a situation, even with a team of people, to want to do it that way.

[Andrew Muto] 11:00:50
But daily felt right. Monday through Sunday, if possible. And then, if the answer is it's not possible, rock and roll.

[Charlie Deist] 11:00:55
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 11:00:58
Let's work to that, but let's try to figure out a way to get it out as quickly as possible.

[Andrew Muto] 11:01:04
Andâ€¦ people say consistency. On YouTube, to a certain extent, I understand why, like, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, I can, like, tune into your video, I'm glad it's here.

[Andrew Muto] 11:01:14
Okay, but I'm not sure, I don't think I've ever set my clock to, like, content creators showed up Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

[Charlie Deist] 11:01:18
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:01:20
So my thing is, like, when it's ready, publish. Find your best time and publish. So just publish as often as you can. If you can't publish today because you're, like, 3 hours behind, cool.

[Charlie Deist] 11:01:24
Hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 11:01:30
Published tomorrow. But, like, publish, publish, publish as often as you possibly can. Because All of this exists in just a flywheel of make something. Actually, I'm going to talk about this later. So, yeah, hold on, we'll get to that.

[Andrew Muto] 11:01:46
Um, this is basically, though, the summary, that there'sâ€¦ technical side of leveraging the algorithm, and there's a creative side to leveraging the algorithm.

[Andrew Muto] 11:01:56
And the technical side, you have to prioritize watch time. Like, you needâ€¦ like, butts in seats watching your content. They can't leave your content.

[Andrew Muto] 11:02:07
You want to try to increase the engagement signals as strongly as you can, and you want to prioritize shares and saves, if you can, and then comments, and then likes.

[Charlie Deist] 11:02:15
Hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 11:02:16
You want to make sure that your content is easily identifiable by the platform, both algorithmically, that the AI, whatever's controlling this, understands This is what this content is about.

[Andrew Muto] 11:02:28
And a human being could tell at a glance. And then you want to make sure that you're publishing at peak times, that you'reâ€¦ you're not just publishing in the middle of the night.

[Andrew Muto] 11:02:37
Then, creatively, you want to think like an influencer and not a big brand, and what that means is, like.

[Andrew Muto] 11:02:44
Brand-style guidelines, and that'sâ€¦ none of that matters, because it doesn't matter to the audience. Youâ€¦ an influencer is laser-focused on the fact that the audience is all that matters.

[Charlie Deist] 11:02:50
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:02:58
You want to create content that's native to the platform. This used to be a big thing two years ago.

[Andrew Muto] 11:03:03
Where, like, you wouldâ€¦ you'd have to talk really strongly to Kraft macaroni and cheese and be like, listen.

[Andrew Muto] 11:03:09
You cannot put your Super Bowl onâ€¦ Instagram. Like, that doesn't make any sense. It's all handmade stuff. Now, there's been a bit more mix of it, and I think it's aâ€¦ but basically, you want to be smart. You don't putâ€¦

[Charlie Deist] 11:03:16
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:03:22
An entire podcast on TikTok. You cut it up, right? Because you're trying to maximize what the platform wants.

[Andrew Muto] 11:03:29
You don't put a radio ad inside of Instagram. So, like, you just want to play to, like, what Instagramâ€¦ if your stuff looks too different than everything else on the platform.

[Andrew Muto] 11:03:39
That's not benefit, that's cost. Like, you want to make sure that, like, this feels like everything else I'm watching, like, it fits right in.

[Andrew Muto] 11:03:47
And thankfully, these days, TikTok and Instagram and YouTube Shorts are kinda all the same mix, with slightly different graphics. So it's notâ€¦ it's not too weird.

[Charlie Deist] 11:03:52
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:03:56
Um, and, you know, prioritizing the audience, entertaining the audience is like.

[Andrew Muto] 11:04:01
That's the reason to show up. Thatâ€¦ if you're here to move product. If you're here to satisfy the ego of an executive team, that kind ofâ€¦ that never works. It's likeâ€¦ And those are the battles I was at with Hoover, that, like.

[Andrew Muto] 11:04:16
It would talk about the brush roll. It's like, no one cares about the brush roll. Like, we've tried to talk about the brush roll, no one cares. What they care about is cleaning up their white carpet. So when I make white carpet videos, it goes to the moon.

[Charlie Deist] 11:04:19
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 11:04:24
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:04:26
They don't care. So, like, those are the type of things that always prioritize the audience.

[Andrew Muto] 11:04:32
And then, and we're gonna get into this nextâ€¦ Making content should be very easy.

[Andrew Muto] 11:04:40
To produce, because of the scale of which we need it.

[Andrew Muto] 11:04:44
Right? That, of course you and I could make a banger if we spent 3 weeks on it.

[Andrew Muto] 11:04:50
Wrote it, cast it, whatever. Putting the money aside.

[Charlie Deist] 11:04:50
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:04:54
You need to do that every day. Soâ€¦ how do youâ€¦ does one plan to do it? This is the part that no one thinks about.

[Andrew Muto] 11:05:01
That they always say, like, so, what is my niche, and what content should I be making, and how do I edit, and, like, where do I get the music? And it's like, okay, cool. How areâ€¦ even if you answer all those questions.

[Charlie Deist] 11:05:09
Right.

[Charlie Deist] 11:05:14
Yeah. Yeah. No, I thought about this quite a lot.

[Andrew Muto] 11:05:14
How are you gonna do this every day? And Iâ€¦ Yeah, and I think this isâ€¦ and I still think about it. I still think about it every single day.

[Charlie Deist] 11:05:25
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:05:25
That, like, how do I minimize the friction? Because I know how to do all this stuff. If you need me to, like, audio edit a musical track, I could do it. It's gonna take me a bit.

[Charlie Deist] 11:05:34
Right, right. Yep.

[Andrew Muto] 11:05:35
And it's like, it's not practical to bring you know, Hollywood production techniques into a daily platform. There's a reason why newspapers are written the way they are.

[Andrew Muto] 11:05:44
And that, like, nightly news is only so extravagant, because it needs to be produced every day.

[Andrew Muto] 11:05:51
And so you need to work at what you're comfortable with, and that's okay. Speed.

[Andrew Muto] 11:05:57
The ability to publish is dramatically more important than Um, technical quality.

[Andrew Muto] 11:06:04
There's no indication that technical quality leads to success. Um, this is an argument I get into with my wife all the time. She's like, I want beautiful portfolio photos of my flowers. Like, yes, I understand why you want it, but no one else is asking for that. If you can do that and publish all the time, rock and roll.

[Charlie Deist] 11:06:06
Yep. Right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:06:20
But you know you can't, that's why you're asking my help.

[Andrew Muto] 11:06:22
To photograph it. It's like, you need to figure out how to do this every single day.

[Andrew Muto] 11:06:27
So, that's an important concept. So, next steps here. Umâ€¦ I feel like Iâ€¦ I changed around mine.

[Andrew Muto] 11:06:38
Well, we'll keepâ€¦ we'll keep going. Umâ€¦ So, production methodology.

[Andrew Muto] 11:06:42
What do you have at your disposal? Is somethingâ€¦ and these are questions, you don't need to answer these now.

[Andrew Muto] 11:06:47
Necessarily. Um, but these are questions to take away, and that we can revisit either later in this week, or next week, or whenever you feel comfortable.

[Andrew Muto] 11:06:56
But an audit of what do you have at your disposal. If I had to answer this question, I would say.

[Andrew Muto] 11:07:02
I have an incredibly powerful computer system that I can do motion graphics, 3D, whatever I want. I've got microphones, I've got unlimited camera gear, andâ€¦ I have all of my time.

[Andrew Muto] 11:07:15
What I don't have are actors. What I don't have are, um, like, visual effects.

[Charlie Deist] 11:07:23
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 11:07:23
Um, what I don't have is a music composer. What I don't have You know, that's what I try to understand, like, what am I making?

[Andrew Muto] 11:07:30
And thatâ€¦ these are the things that I think we need to figure out of, like.

[Andrew Muto] 11:07:35
What do you have at your disposal that you can be making content every single day?

[Andrew Muto] 11:07:40
And if there are big gaps, then we can work to fix those gaps.

[Andrew Muto] 11:07:44
And I just toss up some idea here, like, you know, you've got organizational thought leaders, whether they are the CEO or the previous founder.

[Andrew Muto] 11:07:52
Potentially happy customers. Um, then there's, like, a whole universe of AI voice tools and stock footage, then there's employees and their families. Um, I don't think I know whether or not you have a family, um, but, like, that too, like, for Hoover.

[Charlie Deist] 11:07:57
Yep.

[Andrew Muto] 11:08:05
In the beginning, I was shooting my boys, and like, you know, they wouldâ€¦ I would have them spill things on the carpet, and I would clean it up. But it was, like, the easiestâ€¦ pack in the world, because I could just, like, you guys, give me 4 minutes of your time.

[Charlie Deist] 11:08:12
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 11:08:17
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:08:17
And it's like, okay, cool. And, like, it can be that scrappy, but it's not helpful If you then came back and be like, yo.

[Andrew Muto] 11:08:24
I get in a lot ofâ€¦ I get a lot of grief when I do it. It's like, okay, so that's not really at your disposal, thatâ€¦ Fair. And I got to that point with my wife, where sheâ€¦ I was getting so much grief, she's like, we don't want to do this. I was like, okay, got it.

[Charlie Deist] 11:08:30
Yep.

[Charlie Deist] 11:08:37
Yeah, it's funny, I mean, I've got a whole bunch of thoughts on this, but I'll just mention, because you brought it up, I do have I have 3 kids, and actually a fourth one on the way. They're all underâ€¦ they're all under 5. Well, the oldest is 5.

[Andrew Muto] 11:08:46
Oh, congrats, man! Okay.

[Charlie Deist] 11:08:50
So they're kind of younger than the school age, but I can do the cottagecoreâ€¦ we live on a homestead, too, so we can do the kind of, like.

[Andrew Muto] 11:08:55
Oh, very cool.

[Charlie Deist] 11:08:56
Cottagecore, homeschool, uhâ€¦ you know, kids playing outdoors in the creek, barefoot, you know.

[Andrew Muto] 11:09:03
You could probably do that all day. I mean, like, that's the kind of stuff where, like, you can imagine an entire universe of that content.

[Charlie Deist] 11:09:10
Yeah, that's just one of the options. We've got, yeah, lots of parentâ€¦ parent moms.

[Andrew Muto] 11:09:12
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 11:09:16
Um, you know, staff moms, teacher moms. Uh, every mom you want, we've got binders full of moms, uh, to paraphrase Mitt Romney.

[Charlie Deist] 11:09:23
And, uh, what else? The podcast archive, I'm realizing, especially with the idea of putting different footage on top of it.

[Andrew Muto] 11:09:26
Ha!

[Charlie Deist] 11:09:32
Um, I reallyâ€¦ I can pull out some good, solid rants and sort of motivational, emotionalâ€¦

[Andrew Muto] 11:09:38
Can you see my screen? That's one of my slides, the podcast archive. Did youâ€¦ I've gotâ€¦ Uh, okay, well, that's coming up. The podcast, that's a whole other thing.

[Charlie Deist] 11:09:43
No, no, no, that's too small for me to read that stuff, soâ€¦ But uhâ€¦ cool, cool.

[Charlie Deist] 11:09:50
Awesome, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 11:09:51
Okay, um, so Iâ€¦ that'sâ€¦ that'sâ€¦ Here, so, like, the asset collection ofâ€¦ previous media. How many 15- and 30 second clips could you farm from old media appearances?

[Charlie Deist] 11:09:55
Yep. Yep.

[Andrew Muto] 11:10:04
And again, not something I need an answer for now. But, like, that, there's a whole universe of that, of likeâ€¦ every clipâ€¦ Great, so, like, that's the stuff. I meanâ€¦ If getting access to that, and having that on the ready, you can imagine how you can use the audio over top of footage that

[Charlie Deist] 11:10:07
Yeah. Right, right. Easily dozens.

[Charlie Deist] 11:10:13
If not hundreds.

[Charlie Deist] 11:10:20
Mm-hmm. Right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:10:23
You shoot. Or you're actually using the video of it. There's, like, any number of ways to remix this.

[Charlie Deist] 11:10:30
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:10:30
And so, getting all of that stuff together and repurâ€¦ and using it once doesn't mean you're done with it, right? We could use that same piece multiple times.

[Charlie Deist] 11:10:36
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:10:39
And we can even think potentially beyond podcasts. Like, have they been on TV shows in some way, speaking engagements?

[Andrew Muto] 11:10:48
Customer testimonials, that kind of stuff. Anytime anybody's talking about our universe.

[Andrew Muto] 11:10:53
Is there media that exists that you would have access to that we can clip-out bits. And I think that would be a missionâ€¦ we get into as well.

[Charlie Deist] 11:11:03
Yep.

[Andrew Muto] 11:11:04
And then the next one's about media planning. That, like, what creative processes exist for podcast experience, uh, podcast appearances currently?

[Andrew Muto] 11:11:14
So, umâ€¦ there's, you know, topic generation talking points, booking appearances on external media.

[Andrew Muto] 11:11:21
That, like, my hot takeâ€¦ would be that podcasts exist for one reason.

[Andrew Muto] 11:11:29
To feed the short form. That, likeâ€¦ Yes, I understand the value of a podcast and all of that, but, like, right now, when you're building.

[Andrew Muto] 11:11:38
It's like, all that is, is a way of getting 67 clips every time they hit the record button.

[Andrew Muto] 11:11:44
Like, that is the secret sauce. And you can see all of the podcasters and comedians who have utilized this, where it's like, we don't even make content anymore.

[Andrew Muto] 11:11:56
All we do is record the podcast. And that's it! And we record the podcast 3 times a week.

[Charlie Deist] 11:11:57
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:12:03
So, we're drowning in content. Like, we can get 20 to 50 little clips from every podcast, and we do it 3 times a week. I mean, they'reâ€¦ That's an absurd amount of content that, like, you can't help but win in that case.

[Andrew Muto] 11:12:19
Like, that's exactly how you win. And I've kind of proposed what the pipeline could look like.

[Andrew Muto] 11:12:26
We, theoretically. Could have a strong presence in the figuring out what we want the messaging to be for any given appearance.

[Andrew Muto] 11:12:36
And then building talking points, a handful of things that whoever's on is like, you know.

[Andrew Muto] 11:12:41
Cover these. And they're written. You know, they're like, here's aâ€¦ here'sâ€¦ I mean that there's a bullet point.

[Andrew Muto] 11:12:46
When they see the bullet point, they're like, I know exactly the terror I'm gonna go off on.

[Charlie Deist] 11:12:49
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:12:49
Cool. And it's not likeâ€¦ there's nothing word for word on this. It is like, you know, I want you to talk about X, I want you to talk about Y, and it's like, just go on a rant.

[Andrew Muto] 11:12:57
And we'll find 15 seconds in there. Then there's the recording, and then there's the farming of that.

[Charlie Deist] 11:12:59
Oh, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 11:13:02
But what it isn'tâ€¦ Ideally, isâ€¦ We find out someone was on a podcast, and then we go back and see what we can pull. And it's like, okay, that's the way to do it, if you have to do it.

[Andrew Muto] 11:13:13
But if there's any way to be a part of the process, like, listen, this podcast exists!

[Charlie Deist] 11:13:13
Right.

[Charlie Deist] 11:13:19
Right, right. Yep.

[Andrew Muto] 11:13:19
To feed the short form. So, that is aâ€¦ if that isn't the current operational logic, I think it would be good for us to try to get people on the same page.

[Andrew Muto] 11:13:32
I know it's difficult talking to executives and getting them to see the world slightly differently, but Okay.

[Charlie Deist] 11:13:32
Right. No, not at all. In this case, it's super easy. The company culture is one of, like, very, very open feedback, and you know, Isaac, the incoming CEO, he has a marketing background, he totally gets this, he's trying to drive clips, um, and it might not always be top of mind, just because he's not always thinking about it.

[Andrew Muto] 11:13:49
Okay.

[Charlie Deist] 11:13:53
But I can tell that it's there in his subconscious, and he's done a lot of this over the years, soâ€¦ I think even going into the archive, we'll find a lot of good stuff.

[Andrew Muto] 11:13:58
Great.

[Charlie Deist] 11:14:02
But I'm gonna come up with some way to, you know, even if it's like.

[Charlie Deist] 11:14:06
Auto-scheduling a text or an email before every podcast episode so that they recite the the mantra, you know, that this podcast exists for clips, this podcast exists for clips.

[Andrew Muto] 11:14:15
Yes. That's exactly right. Um, and I think, you know, every pieceâ€¦ every podcast, like, it's whether it'sâ€¦ I toss that out 30 pieces, but, like, that seems reasonable to me.

[Charlie Deist] 11:14:25
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 11:14:25
But Iâ€¦ if I were talking for an hour, I was on a podcast recently, I bet if I was challenged, I could find 30, 15-second moments where I said something interesting.

[Charlie Deist] 11:14:34
Yeah, 15-second moments is really kind of one of the revelations here, because I've been doing, you know, under a minute, butâ€¦ still, I think we're losing probably most people in the first 2 seconds.

[Andrew Muto] 11:14:35
And it's likeâ€¦

[Andrew Muto] 11:14:47
Yeah, yeah, and there's an art to that, too, that you can see GaryVee has knocked that out of the park.

[Andrew Muto] 11:14:54
Um, I think someone clever, like Isaac, might be hip to that, of like, listen, I have to beâ€¦ I have to be hot on this. Not necessarily angry.

[Andrew Muto] 11:15:02
Not, you know, polarizing in a negative way, but, like. This needs to be delivered, right? It is notâ€¦ it isn't, you know, this is not a seminar. This is not a lecture.

[Charlie Deist] 11:15:06
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 11:15:11
This isâ€¦ this is delivered. And I think that behooves him too, right? I think that anybody who's on there, if you're electric.

[Andrew Muto] 11:15:17
Man, you're coming back. Like, you're getting booked again, you know? Likeâ€¦ really fantastic, so I think itâ€¦ everybody wins.

[Charlie Deist] 11:15:21
Right, right. No, that's so true, that's so true. And we're gearing up, Matt Bowman, the founder, is doing the book tour, Isaac will be doing a few of those, too, but getting booked on a lot of podcasts, soâ€¦ We'll put that in a memo to him so thatâ€¦

[Andrew Muto] 11:15:35
Yeah. And video is kind of assumed in this, but they don't need to be connected. You know, like, if it is a strictly audio-only thing, rock and roll.

[Andrew Muto] 11:15:44
If somebody's on a book tour and there's video opportunity there, or if we got them one of those little DJI mics, I don't think I have one here, butâ€¦ you know, there's these little ones, and they'reâ€¦ they self-record, so you could just hit record and put it right here, and you're good.

[Charlie Deist] 11:15:45
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 11:15:57
Yep.

[Andrew Muto] 11:15:57
So, like, if that's, like, the worst case scenario. Um, so that, that'sâ€¦ that's how I would try to look at podcasts.

[Andrew Muto] 11:16:05
And let me be, like, super transparent about if I were very specifically in your shoes, what I would very specifically do.

[Charlie Deist] 11:16:12
Uh-huh. Okay, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 11:16:12
The podcast thing seems like the win. To me. That, like, it seemedâ€¦ like, the universe has already said this entire subculture is great.

[Andrew Muto] 11:16:24
So, like, just get in. And ifâ€¦ If you already have two executives who routinely are talking, I would say, how do I get them to talk more often?

[Andrew Muto] 11:16:34
Can we do it once a week? And then prime that pump with video and talking points.

[Andrew Muto] 11:16:41
And you're golden. Like, that isâ€¦ that has to be guaranteed to work.

[Charlie Deist] 11:16:48
Question. We have kind of diluted the hosts of the podcast. Um, we started off with a kind of stable of hosts, and that's even expanded with our, uh.

[Charlie Deist] 11:17:02
Vp of Learning coming in, now she's doing more podcasts. Isaac and Matt are still doing a good number.

[Charlie Deist] 11:17:09
Um, when they have a personal connection with the guest, and then we also have just someone else on our marketing team who does a reasonable job, but she's younger, she's not a mom herself.

[Charlie Deist] 11:17:19
Um, and I think that there's gonna be less material Oftentimes, we can get good stuff from her guests.

[Charlie Deist] 11:17:24
But, uh, you know, you mentioned, like, with Hoover, you had certain some gals that became known by your audience, um, andâ€¦ you know, do you recommend maybe trying to pare down and just focus on a couple of people who become

[Andrew Muto] 11:17:31
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 11:17:40
Or maybe play with it and see initially in the short form.

[Charlie Deist] 11:17:44
Who does better, and then just sort of subtly lean towards those ones as

[Andrew Muto] 11:17:45
Yeah. My instinct is always to do all. Like, my instinct is like, you know what?

[Charlie Deist] 11:17:51
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 11:17:54
Don'tâ€¦ I wouldn't bench anybody. I would say, listen, let's tryâ€¦ let's figure this out. And in my gut reaction was, there might be some people that are better at parts than others, and you almost variety show it.

[Andrew Muto] 11:18:05
Right? Of, like, okay, so the marketing girl, who's, you know, she's got her vibe. And then Isaac has his vibe, and it's like, okay, so now I've got a, like, a kaleidoscope of different people, different clips, sometimes they're together, you know, likeâ€¦ And then people start to fall in love with their version. It's like every, you know, the Powerpuff Girls, everybody likes a different one.

[Andrew Muto] 11:18:25
And it's like, oh, I like that, I love when she's on. Or vice versa. And I think youâ€¦ the way I would describe this is.

[Charlie Deist] 11:18:28
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:18:32
Howard Stern, for years, it wasn't just Howard. There wereâ€¦ there was a group of people, and everybody had a different vibe, and podcasters now do the same thing, where they'reâ€¦ the engineer booth, they're all mic'd, and we know that Mike, the guy who runs the board, who's producing the show.

[Andrew Muto] 11:18:48
He has his own perspective, right? And so, they're all characters in the show that you own.

[Charlie Deist] 11:18:53
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:18:54
That's how I would look at it. I would always say that if somebody is a wet blanket in it, that you know, again, back to, like, the podcast exists for a reason. You wantâ€¦ high performers. You want people who are going to get the job done.

[Andrew Muto] 11:19:08
But the job doesn't necessarily need to be. You heard some of those voiceovers. They don't need to beâ€¦ GaryVee. They could be, like, wow, she sounds like a mom.

[Andrew Muto] 11:19:18
And you neverâ€¦ and let the audience tell you you like her or not.

[Charlie Deist] 11:19:22
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, myâ€¦ the one that I think doesn't fit that mold is just my colleague who's younger and a little bit too much in, like, the girlboss mode, I feel like.

[Charlie Deist] 11:19:33
But that's just between you and me. I'm gonna edit that out of the transcript.

[Andrew Muto] 11:19:33
No worries, no worries. Well, I thinkâ€¦ You know, that's another thing that, like, assuming that, thatâ€¦ assumptions right, that, like.

[Andrew Muto] 11:19:46
You never knowâ€¦ you don't need to find oneâ€¦ customer or one audience. You can have a lot, and, like, it's possible that somebody would relate to that person and be like.

[Andrew Muto] 11:19:56
You know what? I justâ€¦ I love when theyâ€¦ they have a perspective that I fall in love with. You don't need everybody to fall in love with the same four people.

[Andrew Muto] 11:20:04
It's possible that everybody has theirâ€¦ strength, right? And so.

[Andrew Muto] 11:20:09
I kind of am like. I feel supportive of the idea that, like.

[Andrew Muto] 11:20:15
There can be a group of people And they're all pulling different weights, assuming they are hitting this minimum quality of interesting.

[Charlie Deist] 11:20:22
Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 11:20:24
Um, and then, you know, there's alsoâ€¦ is someone very off-brand, is the opposite. Like, there can be polarizing people who are like.

[Andrew Muto] 11:20:32
I fucking hate that person. Um, and that can be a thing, too, where it's like, yeah, you gotta be careful about that.

[Andrew Muto] 11:20:39
Um, but that's everything. Um, okay, and then, so, the takeaways here, um, are just basically the last three things we talked about, that, like.

[Charlie Deist] 11:20:41
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:20:48
Let's figure outâ€¦ who and what production assets you have available at your disposal, and thatâ€¦ you may need to take stock on that months on your own, of just, like.

[Andrew Muto] 11:20:59
Because you may say right now, I have X, Y, and Z, but it turns out, like, Y is a pain in the ass. And, like, you need to beâ€¦ It is not about you making your life easy for, umâ€¦

[Charlie Deist] 11:21:05
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 11:21:12
Work-life balance reasons. It's about if there's friction, you will slow down.

[Andrew Muto] 11:21:18
You cannot slow down. That's what you're optimizing for. So be selfish of, like.

[Charlie Deist] 11:21:18
For sure. Yep.

[Andrew Muto] 11:21:22
I can't stand using this camera, I can't stand editing this style of video, or I don't like working with this person. Those are all completely fair things that you need to self-identify, of, like, you want to eliminate every grain of sand from your friction.

[Charlie Deist] 11:21:33
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 11:21:36
Even if you're like, but that's how everybody does it, it's like, I don't care. Just do whatâ€¦ how do you wake up and you're moving at the speed of thought?

[Andrew Muto] 11:21:44
That's what you want to optimize for. I'm goingâ€¦ by the way, justâ€¦ I'm going through the same thing on YouTube.

[Andrew Muto] 11:21:50
I know how to make a high-quality 10-minute video. It takes me a week and a half, minimum.

[Charlie Deist] 11:21:53
Yeah. Right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:21:55
I know that is not gonna be good enough. I want to see what happens if, for the next 30 to 60 days, I publish as often as possible, ideally daily, even though that seems crazy.

[Andrew Muto] 11:22:06
Of me just, like, looking at the camera and going, and just talking. Minimum graphics, minimum everything, and it's like, I know why this shouldn't work, but I also know why it would, why it could, and I can find analogies of different creators who work like this. And I just want to eliminate every reason

[Andrew Muto] 11:22:23
Not to make a video. And I thinkâ€¦ so, beâ€¦ hyper selfish about things that are getting in your way to make content.

[Charlie Deist] 11:22:26
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 11:22:36
And let'sâ€¦ and you could identify them to me. Um, and I can help you work on them, but, like, it's an okay feeling. If you're like, yo, I hate editing these videos.

[Charlie Deist] 11:22:37
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 11:22:47
Totally okay.

[Charlie Deist] 11:22:49
No, Iâ€¦ well, there's a couple things. I do some of it myself. I do someâ€¦ the podcast clips, I usually have my VA do a first cut.

[Charlie Deist] 11:22:57
And then I also, more recently with theâ€¦ videos that I pull externally from just YouTube, you know, kind of famous people.

[Charlie Deist] 11:23:04
Those I send to a guy, I think he's based in Pakistan, but forâ€¦ and he charges about $15 per video.

[Charlie Deist] 11:23:10
Um, and they'reâ€¦ they're a little higher quality in terms of putting some of the video on top of it. I have some thoughts, based on your the ones that you curated, um, for playing around with the aesthetics, because there's a very distinct, I'll call it, like, Pinterest homeschool mom, or it's sort of the cottagecore, like.

[Charlie Deist] 11:23:28
Um, a little bit, you know, softer, softer lighting, you know, a lot of, like, whites and beige and cream with Uh, Garamond font, you know, attractive font, not theâ€¦ Um, not the, like, big blocky yellow background, umâ€¦ And I'd like to play around with some of that. One question is, what do you think are the advantages of using our own voices over.

[Andrew Muto] 11:23:34
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 11:23:51
Um, I've been skewing a little heavier towards some of these just well-known people, because right now we're not as well-known And I've gotten more traction with theâ€¦ you know, Adam Savage from Mythbusters, Richard Feynman, um, these people that have a little bit of, kind of, notoriety, and then they'reâ€¦ they've got that GaryVee.

[Andrew Muto] 11:23:55
Sure.

[Andrew Muto] 11:24:02
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 11:24:09
In the successful ones, they've got the GaryVee energy. And you have it too, actually. When you talk.

[Charlie Deist] 11:24:15
There's a certainâ€¦ it lands because of the way you say it. It's not just what you're saying.

[Andrew Muto] 11:24:19
Sure. Sure.

[Charlie Deist] 11:24:21
Um, and it's contagious, too. It's, it's, uh, energy is contagious.

[Andrew Muto] 11:24:24
Well, this is fun stuff. I mean, this isâ€¦ this is a blast, right? Like, this is, umâ€¦ I feel like I'm the right guy in the rightâ€¦ like, social media could have been about anything, man. It could have been about, like, architecture, and it's like, I went to video school, right? Like, I went to film school.

[Charlie Deist] 11:24:34
Right, right. Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 11:24:38
It's like, I'm, like, perfectly positioned, I can't believe I've been gifted this thing that, like, just publishes my content.

[Charlie Deist] 11:24:43
Uh-huh.

[Andrew Muto] 11:24:43
Because I remember the nightmare of, like, I guess, so what do Iâ€¦ I have to put a pitch book together for Warner Brothers? Like, what? Like, it's just a nightmare. Like, howâ€¦ So, umâ€¦ youâ€¦ Yeah, soâ€¦ Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 11:24:51
Yeah, yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 11:24:55
But the question is, our own people versus this other strategy, because I can do both. We have both assets at our disposal. I've got a database full of video ideas and, you know, past transcripts and clips.

[Charlie Deist] 11:25:08
Um.

[Andrew Muto] 11:25:09
Yeah, so thisâ€¦ It is very Gen Z.

[Andrew Muto] 11:25:13
To think of, like, content you don't own as something that you can deploy on your own behalf. That'sâ€¦ I have grown to be like, whoa.

[Andrew Muto] 11:25:22
Respect. But, like, I came from a universe of, like, it's content I own or it's not. I think The downside of using it is that you don't get anything from it.

[Charlie Deist] 11:25:32
Hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 11:25:32
That, like, it isn't yours. It's why I say to people who ask if I can help them. Do you want me to make you content, or do you want to learn how to do it?

[Andrew Muto] 11:25:43
Because if you want to hire an agency to do this stuff, rock and roll, I'm not that guy, but you're never gonna get good at it. And God forbid.

[Andrew Muto] 11:25:51
It blows up. Now, what, are you beholden to this agency?

[Charlie Deist] 11:25:55
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:25:55
Likeâ€¦ like, so what happens ifâ€¦ your GaryVee clip goes to the moon, let's say, or Adam Savage, or whatever. It's like, shit.

[Andrew Muto] 11:26:02
Now, am I in the business of finding GaryVee clips? You want something you control.

[Andrew Muto] 11:26:08
To be going to the moon. And, ideally, you're personally responsible for that. Then in a universe where you get deleted.

[Charlie Deist] 11:26:10
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:26:17
This doesn'tâ€¦ this isn't possible. And it's like, that's how This shouldâ€¦ this isâ€¦ this should be, like, a core competency.

[Andrew Muto] 11:26:25
And it's not complicated. And so, I think it's in your personal best interest Um, to be very good at it personally.

[Andrew Muto] 11:26:34
Andâ€¦ my instinct would be to not use thatâ€¦ or not rely on it anyway. It's fine. You know, it's how I feel aboutâ€¦ the other thing, I didn't say this out loud, I guess, but Iâ€¦ maybe I mentioned to you before, I'm only ever talking about video.

[Charlie Deist] 11:26:40
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 11:26:48
On Instagram, there's an opportunity to post photos and blah blah.

[Andrew Muto] 11:26:52
No, no, everything's video. So, I'm not againstâ€¦ I have a client who has an apparel brand. And he is like, well, I'm gonna post some photos. I'm like, dude, post the photos. They're not gonna do anything for you, but if it makes you feel good and you want the portfolio on the page, and blah blah blah.

[Andrew Muto] 11:27:07
I get it, it's not gonna hurt you, but it's not gonna grow you.

[Andrew Muto] 11:27:10
So, um, I think that youâ€¦ you could post that stuff, um, no harm, no foul, and it might work, but I wouldâ€¦ it would be a real shame if that was the stuff that took off.

[Andrew Muto] 11:27:20
Because it's like, damn it, nowâ€¦ It's not even my stuff. It's not evenâ€¦ you know, it's not even myâ€¦ work. It is a cut-down of somebody else's thing, so it's not building the brand I need it to build.

[Andrew Muto] 11:27:34
Andy!

[Charlie Deist] 11:27:34
No, that makes sense, that makes sense. I mean, we got basically all of our TikTok followers from one video.

[Charlie Deist] 11:27:40
Practically, whichâ€¦ butâ€¦ andâ€¦ Now, our other videos get more views, they get, you know.

[Andrew Muto] 11:27:40
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 11:27:46
At least a few hundred to a couple thousand, whereas previously we were just still in the basement.

[Charlie Deist] 11:27:52
So I guess that's where I'm thinking of it kind of as, like, a bootstrappingâ€¦ approach, but not the long term.

[Andrew Muto] 11:27:57
It's pretty guerrilla. I mean, I gotta say, like, even for a brand, like, God, Hoover was very, very strict about copyright stuff. So there was that whole universe, too.

[Charlie Deist] 11:28:04
Uh-huh. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:28:06
That I'm not even, you know, that's not even an issue for us.

[Andrew Muto] 11:28:10
As much, but, like, umâ€¦ I mean, I definitely buy the bootstrap thing, but I really don't think that there's any shortcut for it being yours anyway. It's all the same work.

[Charlie Deist] 11:28:20
Okay. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 11:28:22
And so, you know, finding a podcast clip of one of your folks fromâ€¦ like, letâ€¦ Finding bangersâ€¦ from other people, Adam Savage, or whatever, and using that as reference to your executive team or public speakers, whoever, and be like, it's like that.

[Andrew Muto] 11:28:39
Do you see? That is where it's like. Or, just say what he said!

[Andrew Muto] 11:28:44
Like, say, you know, what's your version of what he just said? Because that's the thing I want to post.

[Charlie Deist] 11:28:46
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:28:51
But wait, it's not ours! You say it. Person. And it's like, rock and roll, that's a great idea.

[Andrew Muto] 11:28:57
Like, um, I can imagine them as reference. But I am also, like.

[Andrew Muto] 11:29:03
Empathetic to the idea of bootstrapping, like, when you do find a tactic that works, it's, like, very hard.

[Andrew Muto] 11:29:09
To, like, walk away and be like, I'm just gonna turn those views down. It's like, yeah, I get it.

[Andrew Muto] 11:29:13
So, I don't think that there is any creative harm or account harm, short of copyright issues that are, who knows? Like, one day, TikTok could just be like, yo, everybody uses this clip, it's toast.

[Charlie Deist] 11:29:24
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:29:26
Um, other than that. Um, there's no harm, but I just wouldn't hang your hat on it, because you don't want it to getâ€¦ you don't want it to work.

[Andrew Muto] 11:29:33
You know, like, if it works too well. That couldâ€¦ that could backfire.

[Charlie Deist] 11:29:38
Then you're kind of pigeonholed. Okay, that's good to know.

[Andrew Muto] 11:29:39
Yeah. Yeah. And that's just how I would handle it, umâ€¦ Also, Instagram has a, umâ€¦ There is a mechanism in which Instagram identifies previously uploaded content.

[Andrew Muto] 11:29:56
And gives the original uploader credit. It's happened to me a handful of times, where, like, I get a notification to be like.

[Andrew Muto] 11:30:02
So-and-so, you know, uploaded your video, but you're getting the views. And it's like, cool, I guess. And I could look at his video, and it's not exactly the same.

[Andrew Muto] 11:30:10
There's text on it, and there's weird stuff, but it's likeâ€¦ Instagram has identified it as being mine.

[Andrew Muto] 11:30:16
So, um, I don't even know how that works on other platforms, but on Instagram, they've beenâ€¦ pretty bullish on that.

[Charlie Deist] 11:30:22
Interesting, okay.

[Andrew Muto] 11:30:24
Um, so, like we said, collecting all the 15 to 30 second clips from previous media appearances, I thinkâ€¦ I feel like those two things, those top two.

[Andrew Muto] 11:30:33
Are, like, as immediate as we can make them. Um, because I think ifâ€¦ let's just say you showed up with a folder of content tomorrow, then we'd start thinking about, let's take a look at this. What's good in here? How do we make this into something? What's the framework?

[Charlie Deist] 11:30:37
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 11:30:45
Yep. I can do that.

[Andrew Muto] 11:30:47
And then lastly, the Develop and Align on podcast appearances. So this is something that may take you slightly more time, but just kind of, like, starting to see the idea of, like, listen guys.

[Andrew Muto] 11:30:56
These podcasts exist for the short form. And so, we need a few stakeholders in the room at least participating.

[Andrew Muto] 11:31:05
In what the conversation is going to be. And it doesn't mean, necessarily, that, like, the social media team is leading the brand strategy, but it's like, what do you guysâ€¦ what's important?

[Andrew Muto] 11:31:14
This week. Like, what do we want to talk about as a company?

[Andrew Muto] 11:31:18
And it's like, cool, let's talk about that. And, like, what are, like.

[Andrew Muto] 11:31:22
15 to 30 salient points of, like, that you could bring up, and all you have to do is hear the first two words, and you're like, I know exactly what that is, and you can riff.

[Andrew Muto] 11:31:29
Like, that's what we need, and we need that as often as possible.

[Andrew Muto] 11:31:33
Um, at a minimum, we need it. 7 times a week. Like, we need 7 of those moments a week.

[Andrew Muto] 11:31:39
Can you generate that every day, or can you generate that every week?

[Charlie Deist] 11:31:39
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 11:31:43
Whatever that is.

[Charlie Deist] 11:31:45
Yeah, I'm going to be curious to look back at the backlog with this perspective of, sort of, shorter, and I know what I'm looking for, and I know how to find it, um, and to seeâ€¦ because we've got maybe 60 podcast episodes from the last year.

[Andrew Muto] 11:32:00
Great.

[Charlie Deist] 11:32:00
Um, andâ€¦ andâ€¦ I can imagine having a backlog of, you know, 50 to 100 pieces pretty good content, and then 10 to 20 right off the bat that we're like, okay, well then that only gets us 3 weeks, so we do need to keep a steady supply.

[Andrew Muto] 11:32:15
But you can reuse, you know, you can reuse. If something worked really well, you know, you changed the text on it, you go again.

[Charlie Deist] 11:32:15
Um, I guess oneâ€¦ we can reâ€¦ right, right. Yeah, and, andâ€¦ What was I gonna say? Oh yeah, I guess, like, when we do a podcast, I've sort of had thisâ€¦ it's partly a mismatch or, like, a matching problem, where I don't necessarily want to put out

[Charlie Deist] 11:32:32
Three consecutive days, three podcastsâ€¦ clips from that same guest, because it just starts to feel repetitive. Or, like, in the newsletters.

[Charlie Deist] 11:32:40
So that'sâ€¦ Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 11:32:40
Oh! Oh, that's interesting. Well, let me chime in on that. So, the newsletter maybe is a different beast for a second, but.

[Charlie Deist] 11:32:46
Yep. Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 11:32:46
I wouldn't think of social media as sequential. It is servedâ€¦ You know, Instagram is not serving it in the order in which they were uploaded, they're serving it in the order in which they perform.

[Charlie Deist] 11:32:57
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 11:32:58
So, like, if it has already served you my best, it's going down the ranking of, like, what's his next best?

[Andrew Muto] 11:33:04
And soâ€¦ Iâ€¦ and even your feed does not work Um, in chronological order anymore. So even an audience member, like, a viewer, a follower, is not really consuming it, like, oh, that's yesterday's, that's today's.

[Andrew Muto] 11:33:20
Like, they're notâ€¦ they'd have to actually go into the feed and scroll through, and that's so rare. Like, your grid and your profile is so rarely, like.

[Andrew Muto] 11:33:29
Consumed in that way. That I wouldâ€¦ I would make that the least of your concerns. That I would say, don't worry about it. If youâ€¦ I mean, you could say that about my accountant.

[Andrew Muto] 11:33:40
In the beginning. You could say, well, listen, you posted a street interaction yesterday.

[Charlie Deist] 11:33:44
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:33:44
They're all streetâ€¦ but they're all street interactions, right? And it's like I have found my ownâ€¦ like, there are beautiful women, there are attractive men, there's funny guys, there's fat guys. I have kind of, like, different tranches of stuff, and I wouldn't post, like, 12 fat guys in a row, I have that in my head.

[Andrew Muto] 11:34:02
But, like, on the other hand, if I had unlimited beautiful women, I probably would post that every day.

[Charlie Deist] 11:34:08
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 11:34:08
I just don't have it. So, I would play to what wins. Like, ifâ€¦ A podcast clip starts winning, and you're like, yo, if I post podcast clips like this every day, Iâ€¦ it just goes to the moon?

[Andrew Muto] 11:34:20
I don't know. I mean, this isâ€¦ this is the struggle of art andâ€¦ commercial success. Or it's likeâ€¦ it feels kind of cheating, but, like, I kind of want to win.

[Andrew Muto] 11:34:31
And so, like, I would triple down on the win, personally, if, like, if you found something that works, I would go for it.

[Charlie Deist] 11:34:37
Yeah, yeah. Well, and so, I'm inspired byâ€¦ like, thatâ€¦ that first clip you shared, where it's just aâ€¦ mom braiding the hair, and you have what I call, sort of like, heavy-hitting one-liners, or mantras, um, was your term copy for that, no problem. Um, footage and visuals for that. Is there a placeâ€¦

[Andrew Muto] 11:34:46
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 11:34:59
Where I can go, where I can safelyâ€¦ and I'mâ€¦ I'm sort of going for, like.

[Charlie Deist] 11:35:03
A little bit user-generated feel, notâ€¦ not, like. Cheesy stock footage too much, unless itâ€¦ some of those videos actually did have, you know, did look like almost just stock footage. A little more on the authentic side.

[Andrew Muto] 11:35:05
Sure. Sure.

[Charlie Deist] 11:35:15
But, uh, if we wanted to play around with that, orâ€¦ would you say, you know, save that for after we've picked this low-hanging fruit of our ownâ€¦

[Andrew Muto] 11:35:23
I would do both, and it really comes down toâ€¦ if you said to me, Andrew, I haveâ€¦ we have a stock photo account that has unlimitedâ€¦ a stock video account that has unlimited credits.

[Andrew Muto] 11:35:34
Because, to me, the issue with stock footage is not anything other than it's often expensive, and there's, like, limits to how much you can use it, and it's a pain in the ass.

[Andrew Muto] 11:35:42
But if you're like, yo, I gotâ€¦ you know, 50 terabytes worth of stock footage access.

[Charlie Deist] 11:35:42
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 11:35:48
I can do whatever I want. I'd be like, oh, shit, that's awesome.

[Andrew Muto] 11:35:51
Okay, um, I wouldn'tâ€¦ I wouldn't pay the quality issue any mind. I would say, like, we can figure this out. We could put filters on the video to make it look a little handmade.

[Andrew Muto] 11:36:00
Like, I would only optimize for what works. And so, I would say we're not gonna find out in the firstâ€¦ 15 days, or 30 days even, that, like, that the podcasts go to the moon. It's gonna take longer than that, soâ€¦

[Andrew Muto] 11:36:13
Like, that's why we mix it up. But if there is a point in the future where you're like.

[Andrew Muto] 11:36:17
Clearly, podcast clips work. Or clearly, cottagecore works, and nothing else works.

[Andrew Muto] 11:36:23
Personally, I would triple down on Cottagecore. I would be like, Iâ€¦ while working to find other categories of success.

[Andrew Muto] 11:36:30
I would always publish the stuff that works. Because the audience is saying, this is what we like.

[Andrew Muto] 11:36:36
I don't need to sell pizza and burgers and sushi. I'm a pizza joint.

[Andrew Muto] 11:36:40
People love pizza.

[Charlie Deist] 11:36:44
Right on, okay. That makes sense.

[Andrew Muto] 11:36:46
Cool. So that's what I got. That's kind of the walkthrough, um, and there'sâ€¦ there'sâ€¦ you know, I can chat about anything you've got questions about, or you've had some really good questions.

[Andrew Muto] 11:36:59
So far, so I'm not sure if you've got others.

[Charlie Deist] 11:37:02
Let me think for a second. Umâ€¦

[Andrew Muto] 11:37:08
I'm gonna stop sharing here.

[Charlie Deist] 11:37:17
Give me one second.

[Andrew Muto] 11:37:18
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 11:37:23
Yeah, so, um, I know one question that will come up with, uh.

[Charlie Deist] 11:37:28
With the marketing director, like. Obviously, you know, we justâ€¦ the CEO especially, like, he wants to grow the audience. He's not hyper-concerned withâ€¦ I mean, like, we have a focus in the next few months of driving applications and getting people into the program.

[Charlie Deist] 11:37:45
But we sort of had this division between, you know, the media property, the open-end daily.

[Charlie Deist] 11:37:50
And the program, and then to complicate it even further, we just launched a virtual private school for states that don't have this sort of loophole where we can get the money from the public schools Instead, it's like aâ€¦ low tuition, virtual private school that's infinitely customizable.

[Charlie Deist] 11:38:08
So, same general offering, same sort of strategic narrative. Um, but uh, these, these kind of 3 different entities, um, one being just a daily newsletter offering that keeps us top of mind for people that want to kind of come into our funnel, umâ€¦

[Charlie Deist] 11:38:25
Howâ€¦ how would you think about our, sort of. Positioning, umâ€¦ with respect to those offerings, and maybe an unrelated question is, um, like, our positioning in each channel, and do we basically just want to say.

[Charlie Deist] 11:38:41
Like, our focus is Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Reels, uh, YouTube Shorts, rather, Instagram Reels, and TikTok.

[Charlie Deist] 11:38:49
Um, and kind ofâ€¦ put the others aside. That's my instinct, is to say, you know, I can keep doing a little bit just to keep Twitter and, uhâ€¦ I guess Facebook is one where I haven'tâ€¦ I know you can post videos as Reels on Facebook.

[Charlie Deist] 11:39:07
Um, and maybe that's basically another one of these carbon copies ofâ€¦ the other platforms, but now I've definitely asked two different questions here. So let's takeâ€¦ let's take the last question first. Basically, platform strategy, like Should we define, sort of, what our focus is on these channels?

[Andrew Muto] 11:39:22
Yeah, I mean, I thinkâ€¦ um, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and I am surprisingly bullish on Facebook.

[Charlie Deist] 11:39:29
Okay. Yep.

[Andrew Muto] 11:39:30
Um, but it's all the same content, at least to start.

[Andrew Muto] 11:39:34
That it's all the same video, what we would consider a reel is the same thing you publish to TikTok, you publish to YouTube Shorts, you publish to Facebook Reels, um, and then you start to see which one does better.

[Charlie Deist] 11:39:38
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 11:39:48
Um, and try to figure out why. Iâ€¦ and mostly because that algorithmic promotion for video works the strongest on those platforms. It is not as strong on LinkedIn.

[Charlie Deist] 11:39:51
Right.

[Charlie Deist] 11:40:00
Right. Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 11:40:02
Though it's getting there, you, if you're on LinkedIn, can see, often it is articles, and there's a lot of stuff.

[Charlie Deist] 11:40:08
Right. Humble braggingâ€¦

[Andrew Muto] 11:40:09
And then, um, on Twitter. Exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah. And Twitter is this other soup ofâ€¦ the polarityâ€¦ you know, if you're good at Twitter, you understand how it works, but it isâ€¦ it doesn't have the same promotion engine.

[Andrew Muto] 11:40:22
That, like, the modern social media platforms have. So I think it is his own beast.

[Charlie Deist] 11:40:26
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:40:27
And to be transparent, not a beast I have ever had dramatic success in. Any success I've had in those kind of, like, microblogging platforms.

[Andrew Muto] 11:40:34
Has been by virtue of my brand somewhere else, likeâ€¦ I have, I don't know, 10 or 15,000 followers on threads because of Instagram, not becauseâ€¦ Um, and so, it's not likeâ€¦ I don'tâ€¦ and I don't think many people have a strategy for TikTok or threads, because it's justâ€¦

[Charlie Deist] 11:40:39
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 11:40:44
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:40:54
You know, it is its own thing. Um, so that would be my advice, is that, like, stick to the well-understood short-form video platforms.

[Charlie Deist] 11:40:56
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 11:41:05
Um, especially as a brand. Because that's where youâ€¦ because all this is, is a way of getting free awareness. That everybody's problem every single day is they don't know who you are. I have that problem.

[Andrew Muto] 11:41:17
Openend has that problem, everybody has that problem. So how do you get people to know who you are.

[Andrew Muto] 11:41:22
Social media has presented an opportunity to get it for free. That just do the thing, and more people will learn about you.

[Andrew Muto] 11:41:28
And that's where a CFO gets confused, because they're like, well, then how do you convert that? Well, that's a different conversation. That's a whole different thing.

[Andrew Muto] 11:41:35
Let's buildâ€¦ let's get people to know about us first. And then we can figure out how toâ€¦ convert that into some kind of, uhâ€¦ Um, transaction.

[Andrew Muto] 11:41:45
And I think you were asking before, like, how do you think about the different properties as OpenEd, and there's the private school stuff?

[Andrew Muto] 11:41:51
Is the private school stuff under Open Ed, or is it branded differently?

[Charlie Deist] 11:41:56
Slightly differently is that, like, the OpenEd Academy, and for legal purposes, it's under a non-profit.

[Andrew Muto] 11:42:02
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 11:42:02
Um, to be, like, a certified, butâ€¦ but pretty much the same branding. It'sâ€¦ it's all, you know, still open ed, it's the sameâ€¦ same messaging.

[Charlie Deist] 11:42:10
Same colors.

[Andrew Muto] 11:42:10
So Iâ€¦ I think a questionâ€¦ that you could ask. So, basically, what we are doing is we are building OpenEd the brand. We are trying to get people to know about the brand, identify it with homeschooling, and all of the ideas that you sent over last night

[Charlie Deist] 11:42:19
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 11:42:25
That, like, theseâ€¦ this is what OpenEd is about. Consider us.

[Charlie Deist] 11:42:30
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 11:42:30
Know about us. It is plausible that, like, the sub-brands can be in there, too.

[Andrew Muto] 11:42:38
Right? Like, open ed, private education could theoreticâ€¦ if there are no legal issues with that on your side.

[Andrew Muto] 11:42:44
There's no reason why you couldn't also talk about those things, because it's gonna work the same way that you talking about Cottagecore, and you talking about podcasts is gonna work. The ALGO is gonna understand, or try to understand, who this is right for, and it's our job to make sure that that's true.

[Andrew Muto] 11:42:59
With a private school one, you know, we would properly identify that creatively, that this is private school stuff, and, like, if people are shopping for that, maybe.

[Andrew Muto] 11:43:07
Itâ€¦ that goes to different people. There isn't a problem with that.

[Andrew Muto] 11:43:13
Um. On the other hand, the techniques that we're building for Open Ed are easily deployed to a whole nother social media account if that's the road you guys wanted to go down, for either legal reasons, or, like, brand reasons

[Charlie Deist] 11:43:22
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:43:25
We don't want to put them together, it's super cool, but understanding this is gonna allow you to understand that. And it's just doubling the work, theoretically.

[Charlie Deist] 11:43:32
Yep.

[Andrew Muto] 11:43:35
Um, but if I had a sub-brand. Um, I would talk about it on my normal brand.

[Andrew Muto] 11:43:43
If they were the same, right? I don't talk about my consulting stuff on Velvet Alfredo, because it is entirely different, right? So, it doesn't make sense.

[Charlie Deist] 11:43:45
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 11:43:50
Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 11:43:52
But if I had, like, velvet Alfredo photo vacations, I'd talk about it on Velvet Alfredo, probably, right? Even though, like, yeah, technically it's a different LLC, and blah blah blah. I would be like, alright, cool, I'm gonna do that, because that just makes sense.

[Charlie Deist] 11:44:04
Right, right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 11:44:05
Um. That'sâ€¦ that's how I would do it.

[Charlie Deist] 11:44:08
And then I guess the la- it does, it does, yeah. The last question is just around, um paid and the, um, paid ads, you know, this is obviously our organic, uhâ€¦ primarily an organic strategy, but as you were saying in our last call, or one of our calls, it was, uh.

[Andrew Muto] 11:44:09
Does that answer your question?

[Charlie Deist] 11:44:27
Just, you know, sort of thatâ€¦ the learnings carry over if you give a banger, you canâ€¦ you can adapt that andâ€¦ Um, I don't know if you have anything toâ€¦ anything more to say onâ€¦

[Andrew Muto] 11:44:31
Oh, yeah. Yes. Yes.

[Andrew Muto] 11:44:37
Oh, man, I'll talk your ear off about this. I mean, this isâ€¦ this is the juice, right? So this is whereâ€¦ Um, you get really dangerous withâ€¦ paid ads on social media platforms. Because what it's giving you the opportunity to do

[Charlie Deist] 11:44:47
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:44:52
Is test out that creative So, if you've been around the marketing world in any way, it never has worked like that.

[Andrew Muto] 11:44:59
It's always been, like, creative director has an idea. You make it, it goes out the door, the brand people have a perspective, it gets tinkered with, sometimes it gets averaged into the middle of vanilla paste, blah blah blah, out the door.

[Andrew Muto] 11:45:10
And everybody pretends like it does well until someone gets fired.

[Andrew Muto] 11:45:14
And it's like, now, I can test anything I want. And when something works.

[Andrew Muto] 11:45:21
I can just put dollars behind it. Now, not literally the boost button that many of us see, it means, no, you're gonna take that same piece of video creative, and you're gonna put it into the Facebook ad manager, and you're gonna upload it in the proper way, and you're gonna have all the targeting specifics that your ad team understands, blah blah blah. Butâ€¦

[Charlie Deist] 11:45:23
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 11:45:39
You may adjust the creative ever so slightly, and it might just
