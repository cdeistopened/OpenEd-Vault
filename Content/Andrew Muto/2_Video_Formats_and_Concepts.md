VO: "Today, Minecraft is used in classrooms in over 115 countries. Not in spite of the chaos—because of it."

[Closing shot]

## Production Scaling Strategy (August 1)

### Goal: 2 Videos Per Day

**Fast Formats (Under 5 minutes)**:
- Pointing videos: 90 seconds
- Caption-heavy loops: 3-5 minutes
- Hot takes: 5-10 minutes
- iPhone notes: 60-90 seconds

**Template Formats (10-15 minutes after setup)**:
- Canva list videos
- "What Kind of Kids" series
- Mastercard parodies

**Testing Protocol**:
- Test different elements systematically
- Example: Background images vs. no background
- Example: Different locations for pointing videos
- Understand what drives performance through isolation

**First 3 Seconds Rule**:
- Hook must tightly connect to main content
- Minimize audience "bump" (confusion/drop-off)
- Critical for retention
