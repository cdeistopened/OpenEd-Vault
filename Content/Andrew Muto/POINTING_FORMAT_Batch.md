## OPTIMIZATION NOTES

### Test These Variables:

**Headline Styles:**
- Bold statements vs. Questions vs. Stats
- Short (5 words) vs. Medium (10 words)
- Provocative vs. Educational

**Visual Variations:**
- Tablet vs. Easel
- Indoor vs. Outdoor background
- Kids visible vs. Not visible

**Metrics to Track:**
- CTR (target: 6%+)
- Watch time % (target: 80%+)
- Shares (validation/permission = high shares)
- Comments (provocative = high comments)

### Iteration Plan:

**Week 1**: Film 20, test variety
**Week 2**: Double down on top 3 performing styles
**Week 3**: Create variations of winners
**Week 4**: Refine and scale to 2-3/day

## REMEMBER

**Andrew Muto's Rule**: If you're working longer than 15 minutes on short-form, you're overthinking.

**Pointing Format Rule**: 90 seconds per video. No exceptions.

**Volume > Perfection**: The algorithm needs at-bats. Give it 20. See what hits.

**Your homestead background is the secret sauce.** Authenticity + bold statement = scroll-stopper.
