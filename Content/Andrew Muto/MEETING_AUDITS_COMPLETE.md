## Key Patterns Across All Meetings

### Title & Thumbnail Strategy
1. **Universalization** (July 8) - Remove filters that narrow audience
2. **Complementarity** (July 1, 8) - Title + thumbnail work together, don't repeat
3. **CTR Benchmarks** (June 3) - 4% needs work, 6%+ strong
4. **Dial to 11** (July 11) - Most extreme version of the title
5. **Packaging ≠ Content** (July 1) - Restaurant with bad sign analogy

### Production Philosophy
1. **Sponge → Blade** (June 10) - Explore mode, then scale what works
2. **15-Minute Rule** (July 11) - Fast prototyping, don't overthink
3. **Volume > Selectivity** (July 8) - "I don't have bad clips, I publish everything"
4. **R&D Mindset** (June 10) - Short form tests, long form only if proven
5. **90% Rule** (July 11) - Last 10% takes 2.5 hours, ship at 90%

### Hook Development
1. **2-Second Rule** (July 8) - First 1-2 seconds determine everything
2. **McDonald's Test** (July 8) - McDonald's worker should understand instantly
3. **Hook vs Gimmick** (June 10, 13) - Concept vs repeatable delivery mechanism
4. **Punchline First** (July 1) - Start with payoff, add context after
5. **Visual Hooks** (June 13) - Magnets, crayons, typewriter gimmicks

### Format Types Identified
1. **Pointing Format** (July 22) - 5-7 seconds, "Here's how" simple text
2. **Podcast Supercuts** (June 13) - 5 guests on one theme
3. **6-8 Minute Mid-Form** (July 1) - Additional ad breaks = algorithmic priority
4. **List Format** (July 1) - Visual numbering with sound effects
5. **Split-Screen "Oddly Satisfying"** (July 8) - Engagement hack
6. **Charlie the Newsletter Guy** (July 22) - Character-driven content
7. **Graph Paper/Easel** (July 22) - Educational reveal format

### Publishing Strategy
1. **4-5 Clips Daily** (July 8) - More at-bats = more home runs
2. **Same Video, Different Titles** (July 8) - A/B testing approach
3. **Multi-Platform Simultaneous** (June 3) - Instagram/TikTok/YouTube/Facebook
4. **Incomplete Clips** (July 8) - "Check description for resolution" strategy
5. **Revise Old Videos** (July 11) - YouTube allows months-later revisions

- "Jump in mindlessly"
- Blank page creation is hardest
- "Almost everybody is a better editor than blank page creator"

- Examples: "children at weddings", "62% of parents wish TikTok was never invented"

**Recommendation**: Add new section to `2_Video_Formats_and_Concepts.md`
