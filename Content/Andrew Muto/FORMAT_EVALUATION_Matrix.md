---

## TIER 3: SKIP FOR NOW

These are easy to produce but don't pass the "quality" test:

- **Generic Listicles**: "10 Best Homeschool Apps" (no personality, commoditized)
- **Basic Tool Reviews**: Can be done but lacks unique angle
- **Simple Q&A**: Doesn't leverage your unique setup

**Why Skip**: Produces content but doesn't build brand recognition or leverage your advantages

---

## TIER 4: AVOID

These are hard AND don't fit your setup:

- **Marble Statue AI Avatar**: Gimmicky, doesn't fit brand
- **Complex Greenscreen**: Technical overhead, not authentic
- **Multi-Actor Formats** (Homeschool Showdown): Need multiple people, rehearsal time
- **Room Makeover**: Not your angle, wrong audience
- **Quiz Show Formats**: Production complexity doesn't justify return

---

From Andrew Muto's 15-Minute Rule:
