# Social Media Principles & Strategy

**Master Framework for OpenEd Social Content**

---

## Core Philosophy

### The Two Pillars of Marketing (Reimagined)
1. **Storytelling** - What you have to say
2. **Reach** - How many people will hear it

**Social Media Revolution**: You can now *earn awareness* through algorithmic distribution rather than buying every eyeball.

---

## Understanding the Algorithm

### The Interest Graph (Not Social Graph)

**Old Model**: Content shown to followers
**New Model (TikTok Innovation)**: Content distributed based on:
- Topic relevance
- User interests
- Content characteristics

**Key Insight**: You're not making content for your brand, customers, or CEO. **You're making content for the TOPIC.**

### Platform Goal = Audience Satisfaction

All social media platforms care about is keeping users in the app. They want to:
- Serve the highest quality content in every category
- Keep users watching and engaged
- Avoid serving content that makes people leave

**Your Mission**: Help the algorithm understand what your content is about so it can serve it to the right people.

---

## How Algorithms Identify Content

Use ALL of these signals to help platforms categorize your content:

### 1. On-Screen Text
- Use relevant keywords deliberately
- Think of it like SEO for social media
- Be specific and intentional about language

### 2. Description Copy
- Stuff descriptions with relevant topic keywords
- Help algorithms understand content
- Don't rely solely on natural language

### 3. Hashtags
- Use strategically (~12 hashtags)
- Guide algorithmic understanding
- Choose hashtags that accurately represent content

### 4. Audio/Spoken Content
- Platforms transcribe and analyze audio
- Speak keywords and topics explicitly
- Use audio as another layer of content identification

---

## The Watch Time Formula

**WATCH TIME + RETENTION + ENGAGEMENT = VIEWS**

### Watch Time & Retention

**The 2-Second Rule**: The first 1-2 seconds are crucial. Create immediate, compelling hooks.

**Length Strategy**: Make content as long as possible *while ensuring people finish it*.
- Short-form sweet spot: 15-30 seconds
- Longer is better IF retention stays high

**Real Example**:
- Video 1 (slow start): 18,000 views
- Video 2 (instant hook): 5.2 million views
- Difference: 1-2 seconds of retention in the opening

### Engagement Hierarchy (Most to Least Valuable)
1. **Shares** (highest signal)
2. **Saves**
3. **Comments**
4. **Likes**

**Velocity Matters**: How quickly engagement happens in the first 15 minutes determines algorithmic promotion.

---

## Content Type Framework

### 1. Emotional Content
- Tap into human feelings and experiences
- Create relatable, heart-touching narratives
- Validates audience identity and concerns
- Example: "Why I homeschool: So my 9-year-old doesn't have to see porn"

### 2. Science/Psychology Content
- Leverage research and expert knowledge
- Present information in digestible formats
- Create "aha" moments
- Example: "Why Finnish kids don't get homework but score higher"

### 3. How-To Guides
- Provide practical, actionable information
- Break down complex topics
- Address audience pain points
- Example: "5 AI math tools that get school done in 2 hours"

### 4. Podcast Clips
- Extract 15-30 second powerful moments
- Highlight key insights
- Repurpose long-form content

### 5. Polarizing Content
- Controversial but authentic takes
- Unexpected opinions
- Dramatic storytelling
- Sparks conversation and comments

---

## Content Styles vs. Content Types

**Critical Distinction**:
- **Type** = WHAT the content says (the message)
- **Style** = HOW it's presented (the format)

### Content Styles (Formats)

#### Text + B-Roll ("Cottagecore")
- Onscreen text overlays
- Slow, emotionally resonant footage
- Often paired with trending audio

#### UGC-Style / Selfie Cam
- Informal, handheld phone footage
- Direct address or react-style commentary

#### Screen Capture / Desktop Footage
- Tool tutorials, product demos, walkthroughs
- Tactile and trustworthy feeling

#### Podcast Clips
- Natural dialogue or interview cuts
- Can be polarizing, educational, or emotional

#### Meme Formats / Quote Graphics
- Text-focused, short (~8 seconds)
- Overlaid on aesthetic or AI-generated footage
- Highly scannable, emotionally punchy

### Matrix: Mix and Match

Any **Content Type** can be delivered in any **Content Style**:
- Emotional message → Text + B-roll
- Psychology insight → Podcast clip
- How-to guide → Screen capture
- Emotional testimony → UGC voiceover

**Strategic Benefit**: Reuse strong messages in multiple formats. Test styles against audience preferences.

## Hook & Caption Strategy

### The McDonald's Test
**Rule**: Someone who works at McDonald's should be able to read and understand your headline instantly.

- Avoid jargon ("quadratic formula" ❌)
- Use accessible language ("stop raising entitled kids" ✅)
- Wider net = better performance

### Hook Psychology

Your on-screen text serves three critical functions:
1. **Immediate Context** - Tell viewers what they're watching
2. **Drama Injection** - Add tension when opening lacks punch
3. **Search Optimization** - Help algorithms understand content

### Hook Categories That Work

#### 1. Polarizing Statements
- "Your kid's Minecraft addiction is actually genius"
- "Stop raising kids who wait for permission"
- Format: "[Negative thing] is actually [positive]"

#### 2. Counter-Intuitive Reveals
- "My son's first job sucked. Perfect."
- Unexpected positive reaction to negative outcome

#### 3. Direct Challenges
- "Never give up on the weird kid"
- "If your kid hates school, please watch this"

#### 4. Curiosity Gaps
- "Her boyfriend freaked out..."
- "The third tip will blow your mind"
- "Rich kids learn this"

### The Ultimate Hook Test

Before publishing, ask:
1. Would this make ME stop scrolling?
2. Does this create curiosity or emotion in the first 2 seconds?
3. Can my grandmother understand this instantly?
4. Does it hint at the payoff without giving it away?

## Editing Principles

### The "Junk Food for Information" Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Content must be perfectly consumable, not pixel perfect.

Focus on:
- Designed consumption over perfect ingredients
- Message clarity over cinematic aesthetics
- Tools that "get out of their own way"

### Ruthless Editing

- Remove every awkward start, breath, and pause
- Cut out redundant sentences and filler words
- Eliminate anything that doesn't drive the narrative forward
- Be willing to make 75+ cuts in a single video

**Advanced Techniques**:
- Cut between different zoom levels on the same shot
- Add subtle background music to maintain energy
- Use jump cuts to create urgency and momentum
- Make content move too fast to comprehend on first viewing (encourages rewatches)

### The "Frankenbite" Permission

- Cut and rearrange sentences for clarity
- Remove redundant information
- Construct improved narratives from raw footage
- Use AI tools (like Descript) for seamless transitions

**Ethical Boundary**: Maintain original message intent. Don't create misleading statements.

---

## Publishing Strategy

### Frequency
**Core Principle**: Post as often as possible - ideally daily, Monday through Sunday.

**Why**:
1. Social media = focus group (immediate feedback)
2. More at-bats = more opportunities for breakthrough content
3. New followers explore archives (compounding views)

### Timing
- Post 1-2 hours before peak audience activity
- Allows algorithmic processing time
- Be present in comments immediately after posting
- Monitor engagement velocity in first 15 minutes

### Platform Strategy
Post **same content** across multiple channels:
- Instagram Reels
- TikTok
- YouTube Shorts
- Facebook Reels

**Why**: Maximum reach with minimal additional effort.

---

## Quality vs. Speed Balance

### Priority Order
1. Speed of publication
2. Message clarity
3. Audience engagement
4. Technical quality

### "Good Enough" Standards
- ✅ Readable fonts over designer fonts
- ✅ Clear message over perfect aesthetics
- ✅ Fast production over Hollywood quality
- ✅ Consistent publishing over sporadic perfection

### Low-Friction Improvements (DO THESE)
- Quick background music addition
- Simple zoom changes during cuts
- Text overlays for context/hooks
- Fast-paced editing to maintain energy

### High-Friction Activities (AVOID)
- Sourcing extensive B-roll footage
- Complex motion graphics
- Time-intensive color correction
- Elaborate visual effects

---

## Trending vs. Viral

### Trending (What We Chase)
- Algorithmic promotion
- Platform wants to share your content
- Consistent, plannable, systematizable
- Most influencers capitalize on this daily

### Viral (Not the Goal)
- Word-of-mouth sharing
- Lightning in a bottle
- Unpredictable and unreliable
- Not a strategy

**Focus**: Build systems for trending, not chasing virality.

---

## Platform-Specific Tips

### Instagram Collaboration Features
- Coordinate acceptance within 60 seconds of posting
- Have collaborator ready to accept immediately
- Late acceptance can hurt algorithmic performance
- Default to simple tagging if timing fails

### Trending Audio Discovery
1. Scroll through your platform's feed
2. Look for trending indicators (up arrows, trend markers)
3. Save audio that appears in YOUR demographic's content
4. Avoid generic trending lists (not audience-appropriate)

**Key**: Different communities see different trending content. Stay within your ecosystem.

---

## Brand Integration

### Subliminal Branding Techniques

**Verbal Branding**:
- Consistently mention brand names in content
- Create natural integration opportunities
- Build recognition through repetition

**Visual Branding**:
- Subtle logo placement in backgrounds
- Consistent color schemes and aesthetics
- Branded clothing in video appearances

### Multi-Property Strategy
- Focus on building primary brand recognition
- Integrate sub-brands naturally
- Avoid over-segmentation (don't create separate accounts)
- Let algorithms determine optimal audience matching

---

## Testing & Iteration

### A/B Testing Approach
- Create multiple versions of successful content
- Test different editing styles on same audio
- Compare stock footage vs. original content
- Measure fast-cut vs. standard-paced editing

### Performance Indicators
- Engagement velocity (first 15 minutes)
- Watch time retention rates
- Share and save ratios
- Comment quality and quantity

### CTR Specific Benchmarks (June 3)
- **< 4%** = Needs immediate revision (poor packaging)
- **4-6%** = Acceptable performance
- **6%+** = Strong performance
- **7-8%** = Excellent (top-tier content)

**Critical insight**: "If you have low view numbers, it's almost always because you couldn't get the click, not because the content was wrong."

### Revision Strategy for Underperforming Videos
- Review CTR within first 24-48 hours
- Can revise title/thumbnail months after publishing
- "Can potentially restart algorithmic distribution"
- Look back through YouTube Studio at underperformers
- Systematic testing shows this works consistently

### Volume-Based Title Generation
- Write **15 different potential titles/hooks** per video
- Forces you beyond the obvious first idea
- Discover creative angles through iteration
- Avoid "first-match bias"

---

## Thumbnail Psychology Deep Dive

### Shock Value Over Recognition (July 11)

**Core Rule**: Only use guest headshot if they're "George Clooney-famous"

**Instead, show**:
- The outcome/situation, not the person
- Emotional states that match content
- Visual drama that complements title

**Examples**:
- "If your kid hates school" → Upset kid + pointing hand
- Classroom control episode → Upset/crying teacher with rambunctious kids
- Success story → The result, not the person's face

### Stock Photos > Hand-Drawn Illustrations

- Hand-drawn style doesn't work for thumbnails
- Use illustrations as storyboard only
- Replace with stock photos for final version
- Photoshop elements together for drama

### AI-Generated Thumbnails

- Dall-E for Pixar-ish photorealism
- "That AI look" works well on YouTube
- Can dial up prompts iteratively
- Test AI generation vs. stock photos

### Technical Positioning Rules

**Text Placement**:
- Keep text **left-aligned** (avoid right-side UI overlap on YouTube)
- Simplify text for maximum impact
- Example: "They hate me" > "They ate me for lunch"

**The "Dial to 11" Thumbnail Strategy**:
- "What is the most extreme version of that title?"
- Push visual drama as far as possible
- Keep dialing it up until it becomes absurd, then pull back one notch
- Example: "His kids missed 100 days" + thumbnail "CRAZY"

### Complementarity Examples (June 3)
- Title: "6 months with Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses"
- Thumbnail: "It has one problem"
- Creates curiosity gap: What's the problem?

---

## The 15-Minute Prototyping Rule (July 11)

### Core Philosophy

**"If you're working longer than 15 minutes, that's a warning sign."**

- 90% good is enough - diminishing returns on perfectionism
- "Jump in mindlessly and keep it mindless"
- For short-form: complete 15-25 second video in under 5 minutes
- "Just bing bing bing bing - fuck it, it's done"

### The Psychology of Creation

**Blank Page Paralysis**:
- "Almost everybody is a better editor than blank page creator"
- "The less you care about your writing, the better it is" (Naval)
- Blank page creation is the hardest part
- Editing completed work is easier

**First Draft Philosophy**:
- First drafts suck - that's the point
- Complete it, don't evaluate while creating
- "Get it down, it's going to suck, then you'll edit it successfully"
- "You'd be shocked how much you're like: oh that wasn't that tough"

### Mindless Execution Process

1. **Jump in** without overthinking
2. **Complete** the first version rapidly
3. **Evaluate** only after it's done
4. **Edit** the completed work (much easier)

**Why it works**: Removes psychological barrier of "creation weight"

## Platform-Specific Advanced Tactics

### Facebook Reels Monetization (August 1)
- Meta encouraging cross-posting from Instagram
- Can be monetized effectively
- Different content performs better than Instagram
- Test what works on Facebook specifically

### Instagram Edits Restyle Feature (July 11)
- 6-second limit per clip (current)
- Multiple characters available (marble, Yeti, etc.)
- Need talking head footage
- Feature likely to expand over time

### Remix Feature
- Instagram/TikTok/YouTube Shorts allow remixing videos
- Sometimes just cut-to, not screen-on-screen
- May be restricted by original creator
- Use to piggyback on trending content

### Screen Recording from Phone (July 11)
- Record Instagram/TikTok content **on phone** for highest resolution
- System audio included automatically
- Easier than desktop screen capture
- Content goes straight to camera roll

---

## Hook Categories (Expanded)

### The "One Thing" Constraint Hook
- Promises simple, powerful insight
- "All high performers do this one thing"
- Works for condensing complex topics into digestible format
- Creates focus and clarity

### The "Repeatable Gimmick" Strategy
- Find a hook that works, use it repeatedly
- Example: "I'm an 85-year-old clinical psychologist..."
- Becomes signature device for attention
- Builds brand recognition through consistency

### Curiosity Gap Without Clickbait

**Clickbait** = Leaves viewer frustrated and feeling tricked
**Curiosity** = Delivers on promise immediately (first 3 seconds)

**Example**: "Watch me get turned down"
- Shows rejection in first 3 seconds
- Rest of video can be positive
- Hook was honest, not misleading

**Rule**: As long as you deliver on the promise, it's not clickbait

---

## Golden Rules

1. **Create content for the TOPIC, not for your brand**
2. **The first 1-2 seconds determine everything**
3. **Speed and consistency trump technical perfection**
4. **More at-bats = more home runs**
5. **Let the algorithm do the heavy lifting**
6. **Keep people watching until the end**
7. **Make viewers want to watch again**

---

## The Ultimate Success Formula

**High-Retention Opening + Clear Topic Signals + Fast-Paced Editing + Consistent Publishing = Algorithmic Promotion = Growth**
