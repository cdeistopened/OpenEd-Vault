## MISSING FROM 1_Social_Media_Principles.md

### Performance Metrics & Optimization
- **15-Minute Prototyping Rule** (July 11)
  - "If you're working longer than 15 minutes, that's a warning sign"
  - 90% good is enough - diminishing returns on perfectionism
  - "Jump in mindlessly and keep it mindless"

- **CTR Specific Benchmarks** (June 3)
  - < 4% = needs immediate revision
  - 4-6% = acceptable
  - 6%+ = strong performance
  - 7-8% = excellent (Andrew's best-performing content)

- **First Draft Philosophy** (July 11)
  - "Almost everybody is a better editor than blank page creator"
  - "The less you care about your writing, the better it is" (Naval)
  - Complete first, edit second
  - Blank page creation is hardest part

### Thumbnail-Specific Strategies
- **Shock Value Over Recognition** (July 11)
  - Only use guest headshot if "George Clooney-famous"
  - Otherwise show outcome/situation, not person
  - Example: Upset kid for "if your kid hates school"

- **Stock Photos > Hand-Drawn Illustrations** (July 11)
  - Hand-drawn style doesn't work for thumbnails
  - Use illustrations as storyboard only
  - Replace with stock photos for final

- **AI-Generated Thumbnails** (July 11)
  - Dall-E for Pixar-ish photorealism
  - "That AI look" works on YouTube
  - Can dial up prompts iteratively

- **Text Positioning Technical Rule** (June 3)
  - Keep text left-aligned to avoid right-side UI overlap on YouTube

### Content Testing & Iteration
- **A/B Testing Timeline** (June 3)
  - Review CTR within first 24-48 hours
  - Can revise title/thumbnail months later
  - "Can potentially restart algorithmic distribution"

- **Generate Volume Before Selecting** (June 3)
  - Write 15 different potential titles/hooks per video
  - Forces you beyond the obvious
  - Discover creative angles through iteration

- **Revision Strategy for Old Videos** (July 11)
  - Look back through YouTube Studio at underperformers
  - Revise thumbnails/titles months later
  - "I hear that story all the time" - it works

### Platform-Specific Tactics
- **Facebook Reels Monetization** (August 1)
  - Meta encouraging cross-posting from Instagram
  - Can be monetized effectively
  - Different content performs better (vs Instagram)

- **Instagram Edits Restyle Feature** (July 11)
  - 6-second limit per clip
  - Multiple characters available (marble, Yeti, etc.)
  - Feature likely to expand over time

- **Remix Feature** (July 11)
  - Instagram/TikTok/YouTube Shorts allow remixing
  - Sometimes just cut-to, not screen-on-screen
  - May be restricted by original creator

- **Screen Recording from Phone** (July 11)
  - Record Instagram/TikTok on phone for highest resolution
  - System audio included automatically
  - Easier than desktop screen capture

### Production Philosophy
- **"Junk Food for Information" Expanded**
  - Tools that "get out of their own way"
  - Designed consumption over perfect ingredients
  - 90% rule: last 10% takes 2.5x the time

- **Mindless Execution Approach** (July 11)
  - "Just bing bing bing bing - fuck it, it's done"
  - For short-form: complete 15-25 second video in under 5 minutes
  - Complete it, then evaluate (don't evaluate while creating)

### Hook & Concept Development
- **"One Thing" Hook** (How to Write Clickable Headlines)
  - "All high performers do this one thing"
  - Promises simple, powerful hack
  - Works for condensing complex topics

- **Polarizing vs. Clickbait Definition**
  - Clickbait = leaves viewer frustrated and tricked
  - Polarizing = delivers on promise but challenges norms
  - Example: "watch me get turned down" - shows rejection in first 3 seconds

- **Repeatable "Gimmick" Strategy**
  - Find hook that works, use repeatedly
  - Example: "I'm an 85-year-old clinical psychologist..."
  - Becomes signature device for attention
