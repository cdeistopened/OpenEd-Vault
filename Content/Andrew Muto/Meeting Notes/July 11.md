meeting_type: Tactical Workshop - Thumbnail Optimization & Prototyping Mindset
duration: ~35 minutes
status: processed
primary_focus: Thumbnail Design Critique & Fast Prototyping Philosophy
key_topics:
  - Thumbnail shock value over guest recognition
  - Stock photos vs hand-drawn illustrations
  - "Dial it to 11" thumbnail strategy
  - Fast prototyping mindset (15 minute rule)
  - Thumbnail-title complementarity
  - AI-generated thumbnails (Dall-E)
  - Colin & Samir cold open style
secondary_topics:
  - Instagram Edits restyle feature (6-second limit)
  - Screen recording from phone for best quality
  - Revising old video titles/thumbnails
  - ASMR oddly satisfying footage pairing
  - Remix feature on social platforms
key_insights:
  - "If they're not famous, what can we get out of a random person's face?"
  - "Play for shock value - what is the most extreme version of that title?"
  - "Every time a video doesn't work, I ask: how could I have dialed that up?"
  - "Almost everybody is a better editor than blank page creator"
  - "Get a version done in under 15 minutes - don't nickel and dime"
  - "His kids missed 100 days of school" + thumbnail text "CRAZY" = plays into takedown expectation
  - "This dude's trying to get my kids expelled" = high energy line for cold open
action_items:
  - Replace hand-drawn thumbnails with stock photos
  - Show upset kid + pointing hand for "If your kid hates school" episode
  - Create upset teacher with rambunctious kids for classroom control episode
  - Simplify text: "They hate me" instead of "They ate me for lunch"
  - Dial up thumbnails to "11" - make more extreme/attention-grabbing
  - Test oddly satisfying footage (hot metal balls) with educational text overlay
  - Record 6-second restyle clips with Instagram Edits
  - Complete first prototype in under 15 minutes
  - Create cold open using "This dude's trying to get my kids expelled" clip
  - Test Dall-E for AI-generated Pixar-ish thumbnails
thumbnail_strategies:
  shock_value_over_recognition:
    - Only use guest headshot if they're George Clooney-level famous
    - Otherwise: show the outcome/situation, not the person
    - Example: Upset kid for "if your kid hates school"
    - Example: Crying teacher with chaotic kids for classroom control
  dial_it_to_11:
    - "What is the most extreme version of that title?"
    - Push visual drama as far as possible
    - Test: Keep dialing it up until it becomes absurd, then pull back one notch
  stock_photos_over_illustrations:
    - Hand-drawn style doesn't work for thumbnails
    - Use as storyboard, then replace with stock photos
    - Photoshop elements together for drama
  complementarity_examples:
    - Title: "His kids missed 100 days of school"
    - Thumbnail: Guest face + "CRAZY" text
    - Works because it plays into viewer expectation (takedown)
  simplification:
    - "They hate me" > "They ate me for lunch" (fewer words, more charged)
    - Higher contrast, fewer words
    - Direct emotional impact
  ai_generation:
    - Dall-E can create Pixar-ish photorealism
    - "That AI look" works on YouTube
    - Can dial up prompts iteratively
prototyping_mindset:
  15_minute_rule:
    - "If you're working longer than 15 minutes, that's a warning sign"
    - "Get a version done - you don't have to publish it"
    - "Work really fast to just get it done and get out of your own way"
  psychology:
    - "The less you care about your writing, the better it is" (Naval tweet)
    - Blank page creation is hardest
    - Editing completed work is easier
    - "Almost everybody is a better editor than blank page creator"
  90_percent_rule:
    - "90% good is enough - the last 10% would take 2.5 hours"
    - "Just bing bing bing bing - fuck it, it's done"
    - Diminishing returns on perfectionism
  mindless_execution:
    - "Jump in mindlessly and keep it mindless"
    - "Just get it edited, get it completed, then evaluate"
    - For short-form: can complete 15-25 second video in under 5 minutes
  first_draft_philosophy:
    - First drafts suck - that's the point
    - Complete it, then edit it
    - "You'd be shocked how much you're like: oh that wasn't that tough"
examples_discussed:
  daryl_stinson_100_days:
    title_options:
      - "His kids skipped school for 100 days - Here's what happened"
      - "His kids missed 100 days of school"
    thumbnail_concept:
      - Guest face + "CRAZY" text
      - Plays into takedown expectation
    cold_open_clips:
      - "Is that allowed?" (host question)
      - "I'm like, is this dude serious? It's because he's white and I'm black - I'm going to jail"
      - "This dude is trying to get my kids expelled"
    best_line: "This dude is trying to get my kids expelled" (high energy, great delivery)
  classroom_control_episode:
    current_problem:
      - Hand-drawn illustration style doesn't work
      - Too low contrast
      - Guest not famous enough to carry thumbnail
    solution:
      - Stock photo: Upset/crying teacher
      - Rambunctious kids in background (photoshop together)
      - Simplify text: "They hate me" not "They ate me for lunch"
      - "Dial it to 11" - most extreme version
  thermostat_vs_thermometer:
    - Potentially complicated as title
    - Interesting opening hook: "What the fuck do you mean by that?"
    - Better as thumbnail text than title
    - Title: "Why Most People Can't Influence Anyone" OR "The #1 Reason People Can't Influence Anyone"
technical_tips:
  screen_recording:
    - Record Instagram/TikTok content on phone for highest resolution
    - System audio included automatically
    - Easier than desktop screen capture
    - Content goes straight to camera roll
  remix_feature:
    - Instagram/TikTok/YouTube Shorts allow remixing videos
    - Sometimes just cut-to, not screen-on-screen
    - May be restricted by original creator
  instagram_edits_restyle:
    - 6-second limit per clip
    - Need talking head footage
    - Multiple characters available (marble, Yeti, etc.)
    - Feature likely to expand over time
  oddly_satisfying_pairing:
    - Hot metal balls dissolving through foam layers
    - Pair with educational text overlay
    - Text reveals in succession
    - Example: "Kids learn to walk at different ages... talk at different ages... tie shoes at different ages... so why do we make every kid learn algebra at the same age?"
revision_strategy:
  - YouTube allows title/thumbnail revision months later
  - Can potentially restart algorithmic distribution
  - "I hear that story all the time" - it works
  - Look back through YouTube Studio at underperformers
  - "Yeah no shit I should revise that thumbnail"
key_quotes:
  - "Every time a video doesn't work, I ask: how could I have dialed that up?"
  - "If you find yourself working longer than 15 minutes, that's a warning sign"
  - "The psychology of creation can prevent you from finishing it"
  - "Get it down, it's going to suck, then you'll edit it successfully"
  - "Any non-creative person is a good editor, never mind creative people"
  - "What is the most extreme version of that title?"
  - "This dude is trying to get my kids expelled" (best energy line)

## Transcript

## Suggestions for Podcast Thumbnail and Title

### For "If Your Kid Hates School" Episode:

- Show an image of an upset kid instead of just the guest
- Include a pointing hand gesture toward "one tip"
- Add more visual elements for better engagement
- Play for shock value to get more clicks

### For "Teacher Lost Control of Classroom" Episode:

- Replace current layout with more dramatic imagery
- Consider showing an upset teacher with rambunctious kids
- Use stock photos instead of hand-drawn style
- Simplify the text from "They ate me for lunch" to something more direct like "They hate me"
- Use higher contrast and fewer words
- "Dial it to 11" - make it more attention-grabbing

Note: Andrew mentioned that the layout/storyboard concept is good, but should be modernized with actual photos rather than illustrations for better engagement.

  

Charlie Deist  
How's LA treating you?

Andrew Muto  
It's good, it's good. I'm kind of just getting started. Thursdays are slow here, but tonight, this afternoon and tonight should be crazy.

Charlie Deist  
Nice. You're doing your thing. You're doing the street photography?

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, just same thing. Yeah, just up and down. Kind of like the Venice, Santa Monica boardwalk area. Nice. And I always forget, like, my one issue is that there are lots of folks that, like, are peddling for stuff, you know, like street performers. And so I have to differentiate myself from them. People think that I want money and I'm like, I don't want any fucking money.

Charlie Deist  
Right, Right.

Andrew Muto  
So that's. It's interesting. I forgot about that again. Like, when I did this last year too. I was like, it's a constant problem.

Charlie Deist  
Right, right. Well, you might run into my friend, Case Bradford down there. He's kind of in the. The new muscle beach scene a little bit.

Andrew Muto  
Okay.

Charlie Deist  
He's. He's biggest on Twitter and then after that, Instagram. Let me see. I don't actually know what's. What's his handle on Instagram. He's. I. I became friends with him through Twitter and we became good friends. Like, he comes up and visits me here, I visit him down there. But he's. He's a really cool, just like, authentic guy with. The thing is, he doesn't wear very many clothes, so I don't know if I feel like. Although it's always the sort of, you know, addition by subtraction, right?

Andrew Muto  
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think my angle here needs to be too. Like, some people just are like, weird. Like there's like weird people. And I think that's. It is less like badass fits and more like, bro, you're a character. What is your story?

Charlie Deist  
Yeah, I don't know if he'll fit that mold then. But anyway, that neither here nor there.

Andrew Muto  
Rock and roll bad. What do you have for today?

Charlie Deist  
So I've got some more podcast stuff. Just because in a way this month for me, like, I'll consider it a win if. If I can just like get. Get, you know, continue kind of leveling up what we're putting out for the podcast. The other thing is, I'm still stuck. Stupid, stupid little things. But I still can't find where the heck I made that AI avatar of the horse. I know we mentioned it yesterday, but were you saying it. Was it edits? Was it the edits app?

Andrew Muto  
Yeah. Inside of Instagram edits is a. Is a feature called Restyle.

Charlie Deist  
Let me do this in real time because I was looking for it and like, well, I guess I can't hold my screen up to my screen. Maybe what I can do. Let me see first. I'll just come into it and see. Why am I such a. I feel like the, you know, the 86 year old that I work with, I'm always having to coach him through things on his phone and now here I am. Okay, so on the main screen I see.

Andrew Muto  
So if you click into a video, if, like you have to make a project.

Charlie Deist  
Okay.

Andrew Muto  
And then click on a video and I assume the video needs to be a talking head.

Charlie Deist  
Okay.

Andrew Muto  
And then once you. Once a video is highlighted, like you can see it in yellow there, then there's a button that says Restyle and you click the restyle and then you get all these characters that pop up.

Charlie Deist  
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Show that, show that again from the.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, so if you, if you, if you're in the timeline and you click one of your clips in the timeline, there's a button that says Restyle at the bottom.

Charlie Deist  
Okay. Can't restock clips over 10 seconds. That's good to know. So maybe have to be kind of like a succession of.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, that's.

Charlie Deist  
That's fine. Restart. Okay. Okay. And then you've got your characters. Right. And they might have a. Right. Okay, they've got the Yeti. All right. Okay, let me see what I can do here. Not right now, but I will sure get on that.

Andrew Muto  
And this, it might be helpful to like, if that's a hack, like that might actually work because it's, you know, it's ubiquitous, like meta's supporting it. It's right there in the app. It's free. And I would bet even that 6 second limit gets adjusted over time.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah, somehow I'm doing this. There's some weird thing with my.

Andrew Muto  
The top down. Yeah. What is Tape tabletop view.

Charlie Deist  
Give me one second just to see if I can figure this out. Otherwise I'll. Oh, I know what it is. Here we go. There's desk view camera. I don't know what that for.

Andrew Muto  
It's for like top. It's like for top down. Like hands.

Charlie Deist  
Like now I want to play with it, but I'm. I'm not going to. All right. Yeah. So let's see. I mean on the, on the reels front I had, you know, I still just overcoming some kind of block to just creating and like I feel like I need to. Part of me feels like I need to set a very modest goal. Like just create one thing and then there's another part of me that feels like I need to just power through it and try to create like 10 different things. And then from that, I don't know, maybe there's a middle ground.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, well, I mean, so. So what are you. What is the bl. Like, what are you trying to do? Like we. We. You want to prototype new stuff, right? Like that's the idea.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah, I think, I think what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to pair some kind of video footage with some kind of on screen text. Because that, to me, feels like the thing that I can churn out with the most frequency. And I actually, I had a good one the other day. I didn't. I didn't actually finish it, but let me see. There was this. It was, it was actually some. I just looked up oddly satisfying footage and one of the first ones that I found and now I can't find it anymore. But it was like these hot, you know, piping hot metal balls being dropped on these, like little layers of foam and they're like dissolving through them.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, I'm familiar with that, yeah.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah. And so they get to the bottom at different, slightly different speeds. And my thought was to pair that with just like, you know, all the text kind of shows. Or maybe the text would show up in succession, but something like, you know, the text would be like, kids learn to walk at different ages and the balls keep falling. They learn to talk at different ages, they learn to tie their shoes at different ages. And then the punchline is sort of, so why do we cram? Why do we make every kid learn algebra at the same exact age? Something like that. Where the text can kind of do the heavy lifting of the content. The oddly satisfying footage is there for the add among us and to stop the scroll and give them a little bit of eye candy to stick around for that punchline. Like, I think I could, I could execute on this one pretty easily.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah. I mean, I would say, you know, just dive right in. You know, like find, find 10 or 15 minutes and just go for it. And you might, you. First of all, you'd probably feel some sense of satisfaction in that. You're like, you've, you've done it. But also what I love about just prototyping stuff is that I immediately start answering some of the questions that I have and like, oh, I see some potential pitfalls that I need to revise. Right. Like, oh, I talk too fast or something. Right. It's like, I see I have to fix these things.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah.

Andrew Muto  
And that starts you down this road of like very fast evolutions on ideas.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah.

Andrew Muto  
And same with like the talking head and the D and the restyle thing. But I would just record one. I would just do one and then pop yourself in and you're going to start to discover, you know, along with a six second thing like, oh, how do I make this work properly?

Charlie Deist  
Right, right. You see this?

Andrew Muto  
Yes. That's great. I've seen versions of that too, where they drop bigger ones into stuff like, like aloe, aloe lotion or aloe gel or something and it like burns through well.

Charlie Deist  
So. And again, like with the fair use kind of thing, I mean, if I find a way to scrape this and I. That that shouldn't be that hard, but I was actually having some trouble scraping it in a decently high resolution. Do you have any, any inside knowledge into how I might approach that? Like, obviously I'm not going to go out and make this video myself, but I also think it's a pretty low risk for strikes, especially if.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah.

Charlie Deist  
You know, posting this to Instagram instead of YouTube.

Andrew Muto  
Well, the first two things that I would do is one is sometimes. Almost all of these apps allow you to kind of remix a video, so I would first see how much legwork you can get out of that. Okay, that, like on Instagram or TikTok and even YouTube shorts. Sometimes they might be able to restrict that, though, but you can remix it and, like, add your take to it. Now, sometimes it's just. Just like a cut to, like, it's not, you know, screen on screen there. You can't affect it. Right, right. But in cases where I need to screen grab something or screen record it, I'll look at it on my phone and screen record it on my phone. I generally get the highest resolution there, and then it's in your camera roll, and then you can do whatever you want with it. And it usually includes the audio, too.

Charlie Deist  
If there's something audio, that's okay. I like that.

Andrew Muto  
I do that for everything, for YouTube or whatever. Just. It's easiest just record it on your phone because all the system audio, everything is just like, built in.

Charlie Deist  
Right, right. Yeah.

Andrew Muto  
And then you can work on top of it.

Charlie Deist  
My. My other thought was to do this horse. Some asmr. Horse horse shampooing and horse grooming. I could actually even. I don't have a horse, but I do have cows. I could do some cow grooming. Asmr.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah.

Charlie Deist  
I mean, you're even.

Andrew Muto  
Even dual screening that, like we talked about last time, like, have that on the bottom half of the screen and have your content on the top.

Charlie Deist  
Right, right.

Andrew Muto  
Just go for it.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah. Okay, well, let's. Let's turn to podcasts for a minute. Unless you have more. More thoughts on how I might kind of get out of this.

Andrew Muto  
No, I mean, I would just. I would try. If you find yourself working on anything for longer than 15 minutes, I think that's a warning sign that at this, like, fast prototyping stage.

Charlie Deist  
Right.

Andrew Muto  
The thing is, like, just get a version done. You don't have to publish it, but, like, work really fast to just get it done and get out of your own way. I find that with myself, too. Like, this morning I was editing this. I don't often post stories on Instagram reels, and I put together this, like, edited one, and I had to take a couple minutes, be like, I don't give a fuck how this turns out. Just bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing. And I could have nickel and dime the hell out of it, but instead I just. I was like, fuck it. It's like 90% good. This last 10% would take me two and a half hours, and I'm not going to do it.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah, fuck it. Yeah. No, it's so true.

Andrew Muto  
So I would just say try to get out of your own way and just get it completed and then evaluate it. And. And I think you'd be shocked at how much you're like, oh, that wasn't that tough. I could just power through these.

Charlie Deist  
Right, Right. Yep. No, for sure. There was a tweet from naval last week. It was funny because somebody screenshotted. He must have had some sort of social media scheduling glitch where he sent out the same tweet three times in one day. And it's probably one of these things that he just recycles every month or so. But for whatever reason, it got in the queue for three times in a day. And the tweet was like the. You know, the less you care about your writing, the better it is or something like that. And each time it gets like a million retweets or. But there is something to that. Just like, you know, when you. When you. The more. In a way, there's diminishing returns. That's one way to put it.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah. I mean, I think the psychology of creation, like, you can start to just. It just prevents you from actually finishing it. And I would say just jump in mindlessly and keep it mindless.

Charlie Deist  
Right.

Andrew Muto  
And just. Just make it just. Get it edited. And given that like short form, that's harder to do in long form, because long form, you're working on it for a long time, so you start to evaluate it. But in short form, you can make a 15 to 25 second video in under five minutes.

Charlie Deist  
Right.

Andrew Muto  
And it's like that's, that's the headspace. And then you could become, because I think almost everybody is a better editor than they are a blank page creator. Blank page creation is tough as. But, but when you're looking at something that's already completed, you can have a lot of nickel and dime comments and be like, oh, I know how to make this better. I'm going to cut this, I'm going to cut that. Any non creative person is a good editor, never mind creative people. So get it down. It's like what people say about first drafts of, of like novels or scripts or whatever. Just get the first draft out, it's going to suck. And then you'll be able to edit it much more successfully because it's complete.

Charlie Deist  
Right, Right. Yeah. While I'm on YouTube here, last two podcast episodes. Well, this one just, just came out today. The content here, I mean, I don't know, look at, just looking at these thumbnails here on the screen. Is there anything, any feedback you might have? This one was about the, the teacher who kind of. The title was what to do when your students don't respect you or when you've lost control of the classroom was another idea there. And again, I'm not doing like a knee jerk. Oh, these videos aren't getting views. I mean this one again, we literally just published it. This one we published last week, 4th of July, who knows at the time, whatever. But. And I can click in if you want to see it a little bigger.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, I think my initial reaction to it and dude, this is a great example we just talked about of like once you get it down, it's much easier to like edit and revise than it is to be like, how should I do it the first time? My initial reaction to this is that it, like if you just wanted to make the dream thumbnail of if your kid hates school, watch this. You'd almost want to see an image of like an upset kid.

Charlie Deist  
Right.

Andrew Muto  
You know, and then maybe this guy and a hand that isn't. It could be your hand. Right. Pointing at like this one tip or something.

Charlie Deist  
Right, right. You know, some more elements. Some, some more elements in that.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, I would, I would play for shock value. Like, I would play for like, you know what, what is going to get the click. And if you, if that, if either of these people were incredibly famous, then this style of thumbnail would probably work better, where it's like, oh, that's George Clooney. I'm going to watch that.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah.

Andrew Muto  
But given that they are just faces, you know, what then can we get out of a random person's face?

Charlie Deist  
Right?

Andrew Muto  
And like, you know, for the teacher one, theoretically, if you had a woman, not her, like with the crazy kids, you know, upset, upset, crying as a teacher in class or something like that, you know, like kid throwing, you know, a paper ball at her, everybody pointing at her.

Charlie Deist  
Right.

Andrew Muto  
You know, something that's really over the top. Like, what is the most extreme version of that title?

Charlie Deist  
Yeah.

Andrew Muto  
Is it a direction that I would go with something like that?

Charlie Deist  
Right. I think this is one of the things that I had my. My VA do some. Like, I don't know if this style is really working. The kind of.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, the hand drawn style. I mean, that's.

Charlie Deist  
This one I thought was just too low contrast. You can't really, like, especially from far out, you have no idea what's going on in this image.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah.

Charlie Deist  
So like the black.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, but. But you know what? I think that layout, like, as a storyboard, that's probably exactly right. If you modernize that with stock footage, stock stock photos, like, I'm sure you can find an adult man or woman being like, oh, my God. And then you could have rambunctious kids and just photoshop those two things together.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah, okay.

Andrew Muto  
I would bet that that would work a lot better.

Charlie Deist  
Okay.

Andrew Muto  
And then, you know, we could also go back and forth about they ate me for lunch. It could be. There might be a simpler version of like, they hate me.

Charlie Deist  
Right, right. Fewer words. Simpler. More charged.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, Something. Yeah, Just like, how can you dial that to 11 is kind of. You know, every time a video doesn't work, I always think to myself, how could I have dialed that up? And often, just like this exercise of when I look back through my studio, my YouTube studio, and I see videos that didn't perform and I'm like, yeah, no shit, I should revise that. That thumbnail. And I think YouTube best practice says that you can revise a title and thumbnail later, even months later, and potentially restart it. Potentially. Like, it kind of like, oh, it gets served again. And like, now it's working.

Charlie Deist  
Uh huh, uh huh.

Andrew Muto  
I like, I hear that story all the time.

Charlie Deist  
I kind of like this idea of, you know, dial it up a level as a. As a prompting technique too. You might have seen a while back, there was a trend where people would say, like, you know, bake this potato. Like, give me an image of a baked potato. Like, okay, now bake it more. Now bake it more. Until it's just like this shriveled, you know, patch of dust. And I can kind of imagine trying something similar with like, okay, so yeah, this is. This is the cho. This is a different episode. This is actually going Back to Corey DeAngelis, who I still haven't posted yet, but how to fix American education. One simple step. If we just say like, like, this is the one I like best. But dial this up a level and see, you know? And how many times can we do this before it just becomes completely absurd? Yeah.

Andrew Muto  
Have you ever experimented with Dall? E making the thumbnail for you?

Charlie Deist  
Not a little bit. A little bit?

Andrew Muto  
Because that might. I mean, given how deep you are in AI, I'm sure you'd be super successful in that. But, like, the. That AI look of, like, almost Pixar. Ish photorealism, you know? I'm sure you're familiar with that kind of, like, style, Right? That's not unsuccessful on YouTube. Right. Like, I may have aesthetics. Aesthetic qualms with it, but like on YouTube, it does work. So you might be able to get Dall e to create you something that you can publish, right, based on a prompt that you generate.

Charlie Deist  
Dial it up even further. American education is broken. But some. But sometimes it just, it really does kind of go off the rails into just nonsense or things that I don't know. Dial it up one more time. Dial it up. If at first you don't succeed, dial it up again. Let's see, there is one episode I wanted to focus on because this is, I think maybe the next one that's going to come out. And we haven't. We looked at it a little bit together at the beginning, but then I had some thoughts. I like what I've got for this one. I don't actually have the. The video assets prepped yet, but just thinking of title thumbnail combinations. This one, it was the. It was like a TedX motivational speaker. He does, you know, he's. And the reason he was on our podcast is that he met our company's founder and the founder convinced him to basically just pull his kids out of school and do things with them that were far more educational than school ever was. So, like, the story is he skipped school for 100 days. They went to the Grand Canyon. His kids overheard him doing, you know, taking business calls in the, in the car. And then they started their own businesses and stuff like that. So, you know, something like his kids. His kids skipped school for 100 days. Here's what happened.

Andrew Muto  
So that's a cool title. That's a cool title.

Charlie Deist  
Any, Any suggestions or potential improvements there?

Andrew Muto  
Well, that's pretty good. I mean, if you've got the video to support that, that's a pretty damn good title.

Charlie Deist  
Okay.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, I would try to thumbnail that. I mean, it's tough with podcast clips because I saw this video recently that really described the psychology behind a thumbnail, that in the most perfect ideal space, you would have the most click baitable title of all time. And the thumbnail would represent essentially what the audience sees as soon as they click the video. Right. And you're like, oh. And that, that doesn't just speak to like, oh, my thumbnail needs to come from the first frame of video. It's like, how should I start the video? Right, that the video starts in that crazy moment and then kind of flashes back or whatever, but kind of sets up kind of like this is what you're about to watch.

Charlie Deist  
Right, right, right.

Andrew Muto  
And. And with podcasts, it's a little odder because it's like you're talking about concepts, but essentially everybody's kind of sitting at a desk or microphone. And so theoretically, you're constrained. Unless it's so obviously a aesthetic recreation of what you're talking about that it's like. Oh, that doesn't bother me.

Charlie Deist  
Right, so.

Andrew Muto  
So you can go in that direction of like, it's actually kind of like a symbolic representation of what you're talking about. Or it is reality, theoretically. Or it could be them in a podcast. And it's like the biggest moment, like big face, big like whatever.

Charlie Deist  
Right, right. Yeah. I think, I think this kind of comes back to like the cold open sequence and sort of like the Colin and Samir, their style of doing it, where you get launched right into the action, it sets up the tension without resolving it, that kind of thing. And so here. And again, this might be in. We might be able to watch him actually say some of this, but I don't think it's been edited in yet. Let me just see what's in here. Because it's a good story. The tricky thing. No, so actually originally I had found this one clip and it's not good. It's not dynamic at all. We can watch it. But I just remember your freedom reminds people of their lack thereof. The truth is all about what? Let's just. Do you have sound?

Andrew Muto  
I don't know.

Charlie Deist  
Okay, let me see the bing, bada boom. Freedom reminds people of their lack thereof. And the truth is, is that all the feedback that we were sort of getting when we were like putting our toe in the water with like letting them know what was going on, the deep part of it, it was all a response. Because if this was a better pathway than that would remind them. Yeah, I mean, it's like, what? What the heck are you talking about? I have no idea what you're talking about here.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, and he's kind of low energy too, which is.

Charlie Deist  
Right, right. Yeah. Funny for a motivational speaker, I assume elsewhere he kind of comes out of his shell a little bit more.

Andrew Muto  
But what about the host? Is there like in Colin and Samir, there's a bit of back and forth in the cold open, you know, of like, you did what? And he's like, yeah, you know, like maybe, maybe just a rapid fire phrase. Phrase for, you know, like maybe that would be a way of cold opening in a fun way. I'm not sure what this content looks like.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah, well, and actually there is something here. And I could probably find the timestamp for this exact thing at 12, 25, 30 to 27. So let me see. Because there is a back and forth where. And I thought for the thumbnail text, if this is. He's, you know, his kids skipped school for 100 days. I thought the thumbnail text could be something like, is that even allowed? Because the resolution is like. And that's in the transcript. The host says, I remember your first question was, is that allowed? And then he says. I'm like, is this dude serious? Then I'm like, it's because he's white and I'm black. I can't do that. I'm going to jail. I want to know what's going on. So that.

Andrew Muto  
Let's say those are great little clips.

Charlie Deist  
I mean, yeah, um, let's see what's going on. Or I can find it. Oh, I'm in the wrong composition. 2527. Somewhere around here. Okay. It took me a long time to rewire my nervous system where I felt normal. Hold on a little. A little lower. Just pull them out for a couple weeks. I remember. So Matt says, I remember your first question was, is that allowed? Right, Right. I'm like, is this dude serious? And then I'm like, it's because he's white and I'm black. I can't do. I'm going to jail. Like I don't know what's going on. And. And then there's.

Andrew Muto  
That's pretty good. That moment right there is pretty good. I'm sure you might be able to even cut it up even more like.

Charlie Deist  
Right, right.

Andrew Muto  
But that's a good. What are they talking about? What can you not do because of race? Like, there's a lot of interesting bits there.

Charlie Deist  
Uhuh. Uhuh. Yeah. Because this is, this, this is the earlier setup. And I don't know where he actually mentions the hundred days, but pull them out of school for a couple weeks and take them on some learning adventures and see how they go. And I'm like, this dude is trying to get my kids expelled.

Andrew Muto  
That, that line right there is great.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah.

Andrew Muto  
Right. Like you can do the Colin and Samir, a bunch of nonsensical stuff strung together. Like I gotta watch this episode.

Charlie Deist  
Right, right, right. Yeah.

Andrew Muto  
And this, this dude is trying to get my kids expelled is a. Is potentially another good sub headline and. Or God, I mean, maybe even title. Like maybe there's a combination of those things. Like.

Charlie Deist  
Right, right.

Andrew Muto  
There's something about that line and the way he delivers it is. Is with energy. So that's great.

Charlie Deist  
Right. And there's also an opportunity that I want to pull this as a long clip. So I've got the instructions here for, for my VA to cut a long. This. And I had this, you know, the schooling option most parents don't know exists. I don't know. But maybe instead it could be something like that. You know, this dude's trying to get my. This dude's trying to get my kids expelled. Or something like that.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah. And then, or even, you know, maybe my kids got expelled and if there's no quote. Right. And that's. It's not true. So that, that might be unsatisfying, but like I would wonder like how far you can push something like that.

Charlie Deist  
Right, right. Yeah. In this episode we'd also talked about sort of just leaning into his, his core message, which is about sort of high performance. And I think I didn't really see a delivery on this one of high performance is about this one thing. Or, like, level up in 90 days with this one tip. But he did have a good one on, like, why, you know, I gave it this title why Most People Can't Influence Anyone. And it starts off with, if you're going to communicate. Communicate. You better do it like you're called to, you know, basically, like, talking about what. What it takes to influence a crowd when you're speaking in front of them. Something like that.

Andrew Muto  
That line right there, you've got to be like a thermostat and not a thermometer. Is an interesting line.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah, that.

Andrew Muto  
Theoretically, that. That. No, theoretically, that sounds like it could be a great clip. Oh, you already have that as a title. Cool. It might be complicated as a title, but it's an. It's an interesting opening because, like, you're like, what the fuck do you mean by that?

Charlie Deist  
Right, right. Well, considering, you know, like, let's just. If we were trying to use this line and this line together, which one would be a better thumbnail? Which one would be a better title?

Andrew Muto  
Why Most People Can't Influence Anyone is probably. Probably a better title. Or the number one reason People can't influence anyone.

Charlie Deist  
Right. Maybe most, maybe not.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, I'm not sure about.

Charlie Deist  
I'll figure something out with that. Okay. Yeah, that's. That's good. And then I. I haven't quite figured out how I would shorten the. The short clips for this, but I think I want to do at least one for his kids skipped 100 days of school. And then.

Andrew Muto  
That's a great. That's a great title. I mean, that. That I would do is. Even if you have a long version, I would do a short version of that too.

Charlie Deist  
Right, right. And so for this one, we're thinking on screen text, they missed over 100 days of school. Is school actually optional? Let's see. I mean, this is. This is the clip they missed over 100 days of school. Something crazy. Still had good grades, and we're still student council leaders. Still worked out perfectly fine because they'd be messing around half the time in school anyways. And you could just catch up.

Andrew Muto  
You might be able to. So let's say the title was his kids missed 100 days of school. Then you could have his face on the thumbnail. And then it's like just the word.

Charlie Deist  
This is for the long. This is for the long clip.

Andrew Muto  
Either. Either one, honestly. And. And you could. The text, it could just say crazy next to it.

Charlie Deist  
Right, right, right, right.

Andrew Muto  
Like, because I think most people would go into that video thinking, yeah, this is going to be a takedown of this guy, and then the guy's going to explain himself and how well it's working, I'm sure.

Charlie Deist  
Like, wait a minute. Sorry.

Andrew Muto  
Can you hear me?

Charlie Deist  
Yeah, I can hear you. Right. For some reason I I down. Put my audio down until it muted for about a split second, but then.

Andrew Muto  
No, no. So. So I'm thinking, like, if you put crazy next to his face, it's gonna play into people who read that title. Like, this isn't this. That's an insane idea.

Charlie Deist  
We're talking on a thumbnail or we're talking. Working on a, on a, on a clip.

Andrew Muto  
I'm talking about a thumbnail.

Charlie Deist  
Oh, like, okay, right, yeah, yeah.

Andrew Muto  
That you'd have title his kid skipped 100 days of school. And then you know, his face and the word that says crazy right next to it.

Charlie Deist  
Right.

Andrew Muto  
And I think that would play into like people. What people want out of that video theoretically is like a takedown of this kid, this guy up and.

Charlie Deist  
Right, right.

Andrew Muto  
You know, but it turns out he didn't fuck up. He had a great experience with his kids, the whole thing. And it's like that's. That probably summarizes a pretty, a pretty satisfying video.

Charlie Deist  
Right, Right. Yeah, for sure. Before the clip, I'm just thinking through on screen text for this if it's needed. I mean he starts off right. The first thing he says in this

Andrew Muto  
one you're talking as like a, as like a portrait, short form piece of content.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah, as a, as a, short, as a real. Like they missed over a hundred days of school or something crazy. He says that at the very beginning. So I'm not inclined to necessarily repeat that in like that could even be. I could, I could have this. Well, unless if I do two or three words per caption, then I wouldn't do that.

Andrew Muto  
But you could even like with something that starts that hot of like the guy is saying essentially what you'd put on screen. Right. Then you can just do a reaction from like the creator's point of view or your point of view. Like for instance, today I. My on screen text was just what question mark and what W h u t kind of like mind blown. And it's like, okay, so I guess it's indicating to me that something very odd is happening in this video. And by frame one, you see what is going on. It's like, okay, this is weird. I can't. I'm going to watch the rest of this. And same with yours where it's like they missed over 100 days of school and it's just like what maybe even like the eyeballs emoji, you know, of like what. What is going on here? And so it's just kind of compelling the audience of like, I better watch this. To see it's a similar tactic to the ending is crazy, you know, Like, I guess I'm gonna watch this because the creator of this video is indicating something. This is wild, right?

Charlie Deist  
Right. Yeah. Okay.

Andrew Muto  
I use that, I use that tactic all the time. Like when I have like a pretty girl video and I don't really have anything to say about it. I'll just use like a. Wow.

Charlie Deist  
Right. Right. And if I were to do this, would I need to. I guess there's a. You could, like, you can upload a thumbnail that's different from any of the frames in the video, right?

Andrew Muto  
Yeah. I mean, I was. When I was on a thumbnail before, I thought maybe you wanted to make a short version for YouTube. So I got. I got caught in that. That if you were going to make, like a th.

Charlie Deist  
I do, I do. I want to do both for this episode. I think that this is probably going to be the title of the main episode. It's probably also going to be some variation of. This is going to be a long clip, five minute. Six minute clip and then I also want to do a short and then for the, the thumbnail of that short, usually what I do is I just have some on screen text in the first few seconds and I select one of those early frames as the thumbnail. But if I'm doing something like what? Or you know, I guess I could just have that be a frame in the early part of the video or I could create a separate image and upload that as the thumbnail.

Andrew Muto  
Got it. Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't. For YouTube, that's where thumbnails matter the most. On Instagram and TikTok, generally speaking, the whole people get served your thing.

Charlie Deist  
Right.

Andrew Muto  
On YouTube, you often see shorts inside of your search feed, right. That like on your homepage there's like the traditional TV ones and then there's a bunch of portrait ones. That's where a thumbnail really matters for a short form video. But yeah, what I do often is I very rarely on YouTube shorts, upload my own image of thumbnail. I will find the frame and then if I already have text there, I'll just write text in the YouTube app and blow it up to cover the text. Okay, so let's say I've got transcription down there. I would just write like, wow, and just scale it up to cover my text.

Charlie Deist  
I see.

Andrew Muto  
And that almost always works.

Charlie Deist  
And do you download the video? Wait, no.

Andrew Muto  
You could do that right in the YouTube app. Like right in the YouTube. Yeah, yeah, right in the YouTube app. Like when you're, when you're uploading a short.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah, well, when you upload the short, are you uploading like an edited short that you've already posted on Instagram or are you uploading?

Andrew Muto  
Okay, no, always, always the same thing from Instagram and it doesn't

Charlie Deist  
have like the watermark on it or.

Andrew Muto  
Well, because I've, I've created a master version in Adobe Premiere the same way you do in descript. Right. That like I have a, a official version sitting in my camera roll and I just upload that to everywhere.

Charlie Deist  
Got it. And you do the caption. You do captions and almost all the creative elements in Premiere.

Andrew Muto  
Yes, 99% of the time, every once in a while there's something that I want to try to maybe give the algo a little bit more of the understanding of what's it about. So I'll add a little caption here or there. Very rare though for me to do that.

Charlie Deist  
Okay. Okay. Well, I think I'm just about at my limit. This week has just been not a bad week? Just exhausting.

Andrew Muto  
Are you still. Are you, like, on vacation? I'm sorry.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah. Yeah. I've got another week where I'd say I'm like, I'm able. I can phone it in for another week. And then I need to start to start to figure out what my balance is going to be for the rest of the quarter. I'm thinking about. I don't know, there's even a possibility of trying to. Trying to become like a fractional independent contractor for Open Ed, but still working at close to my current salary or at my current salary, but. But being like officially two thirds time or something, just because. Because I'm looking at everything going on and I'm like, I don't think that I can show up on slack at the, you know, I don't, I don't know that I want to be on the hook for everything that I have been. Yeah, yeah, it's all good. And this is, this continues to be sort of one of the highlights, both just from a skill building perspective and leveling up, and also makes me think that I can hit my marks. Like, I can hit my KPIs without putting in, you know, eight hour work days if I'm smart about how I use that time.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, for sure, for sure. Well, I mean, I, if I were you, I would try to use some of this kind of like, slower downtime period to experiment leisurely. Right. Like try to record a talking head for just a few seconds, put it into the Instagram edits. Try that restyle. Just see, see what it feels like to make some of this content as a prototype.

Charlie Deist  
Right, right.

Andrew Muto  
So that you can come back a week, you know, like, like when you're kind of back on.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah.

Andrew Muto  
And have some prototypes. Like, all right, I'm gonna execute on these. Or I've discovered that these are horrible. They're too hard to make, whatever it is.

Charlie Deist  
Yep. Yeah, sounds good. You gave me some good ideas. The, the recording on the phone and then all this stuff, as always, is. Is good on the podcast front.

Andrew Muto  
So I feel pumped up about this one.

Charlie Deist  
I'm gonna do a little more on the cold intro for this episode and start to prep it for next week.

Andrew Muto  
Cool. On, on Tuesday when we meet again, do you want to. Do you want to plan on having like one of those Instagram edit restyled AI videos ready or.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah. Hold me accountable for that.

Andrew Muto  
Okay. Because I mean, it really should be easy. It really should take less than 10 minutes.

Charlie Deist  
I'm going to do it right now. I'm going to do it right now.

Andrew Muto  
Just try to. I would say try to bang one out and see what you know. You're instantly going to realize whether or not it's even doable.

Charlie Deist  
Right. Right.

Andrew Muto  
So cool. I think that'd be a. That'd be a good plan.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah. Well, the only thing I'm trying to remember now is when I made that horse video, and I think I either texted it or emailed it to you. Let me see if I texted it to you. Wait a minute. No, I must have emailed it to you, so I'll check my email and see because I remember, I think that I typed something and got the horse from typing it rather than speaking it. But maybe I spoke it, and, like, I spoke.

Andrew Muto  
I heard one where you spoke and you used a voice. You did. Like a thing.

Charlie Deist  
That was. That was, I think, from. Hey, Jen. Oh, let me see. Style, cap cut. Oh, wait, no, it was cap cut. It was cap cut.

Andrew Muto  
Oh, interesting.

Charlie Deist  
Is that a TikTok? No. Yeah.

Andrew Muto  
Owned by. Yeah.

Charlie Deist  
Okay. Okay. So this is what I made in Capcut. Hello, I'm Ed. I'm a talking horse. Isn't that rather odd? But I'll try the. I'm a talking horse. I'll try the Instagram one, too, and just see which one of these. Feels better.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah. And. And with Instagram, I think what it's going to rely on is, like, your video.

Charlie Deist  
Like, you're gonna have to do the action. Well, that could be good. That could be good. I might still be able to pull off the. The skits involving. We'll see. I got some ideas.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, very cool, man. I'll talk to you on Tuesday then.

Charlie Deist  
All right, talk to you then. Thanks, Andrew.

Andrew Muto  
You got it. Bye. Bye.

## Section 1: Podcast Thumbnails – Revise for Maximum Clickability

### Tactics:

- Replace guest face-only thumbnails with _story-driven imagery_
- Use stock photography (e.g., upset kid, overwhelmed teacher) instead of hand-drawn or abstract visuals
- Add **gesture or action cues** (e.g., a pointing hand, shocked face)

### Rewrite Examples:

- Title: “If Your Kid Hates School” → Thumbnail: upset kid + tip indicator
- Title: “Teacher Lost Control of Classroom” → Thumbnail: overwhelmed teacher + rambunctious kids + caption: “They Hate Me”

### Technique:

> “Dial it to 11” – exaggerate thumbnail content to the most dramatic visual implication of the title

---

## Section 2: Restyle AI (Instagram Edits) – Easy Prototyping

- Found inside Instagram Edits app (within the timeline clip editor)
- Ideal for short talking-head AI avatars (e.g., 6-second limit)
- Free and frictionless: great for fast experiments with skit formats

**Takeaway:** Restyle is a viable short-form hack worth prototyping for visual variety and character-based storytelling

---

## Section 3: Short-Form Reels Creation – Overcoming Output Blocks

### Strategy:

- **Set low-friction targets**: just make _one_
- Then try a **volume burst**: make _ten_ and iterate

### Oddly Satisfying Format Idea:

- Visual: slow-motion video of metal balls melting foam
- Text: “Kids learn to walk at different ages…” → punchline: “So why teach every kid algebra at the same time?”
- Pair soothing or ASMR-style footage with subtle social commentary

**Bonus:** Use reaction text like “what?” or emoji overlays for stronger scroll stops

---

## Section 4: Screen Recording Hack for Content Capture

- Use native phone screen recorder for high-res captures of social content (with system audio)
- Ideal for remixing content found on TikTok, YouTube, or Instagram
- Useful for fair-use commentary / education formats

---

## Section 5: Hook Design for Podcast Shorts

### Concept: Cold Open with Tension

- Pull most intriguing or outrageous moment to open the video
- Use it as the _first second_ of the short before cutting to full context
- Text overlay to frame viewer expectation (e.g., “He missed 100 days of school… on purpose?”)

### Example – “100 Days of School Missed” Story:

- Title: "His Kids Skipped 100 Days of School"
- Thumbnail text: _Crazy_ + shocked face
- On-screen intro: "Is that even allowed?" or "This dude is trying to get my kids expelled"
- Add short version _and_ long clip version

---

## Section 6: DALL·E for Thumbnail Ideation

- Use AI to generate symbolic or exaggerated thumbnails
- Try Pixar-style photorealism for visual intrigue
- Generate variations on a title: “Bake it more” thumbnail iteration technique

---

## Section 7: Prototyping Rules of Thumb

- If you spend more than **15 minutes**, you’re overworking it
- Don’t polish beyond 90% during R&D phase
- First draft ≠ publishable draft
- Move fast → review → iterate

### Quote:

> "Almost everyone is a better editor than creator. So create something you can edit."

---

## Section 8: Cross-Posting + Shorts Strategy

- Create one polished vertical video per idea
- Upload to YouTube Shorts, Instagram, TikTok
- On YouTube Shorts:
    - Add simple bold text manually during upload (e.g., “WOW”) to cover default captions
    - Custom thumbnail is optional, but can be added manually

---

## Next Steps:

- [ ] Record and upload one AI-generated or edited talking head video
- [ ] Try “oddly satisfying” caption + punchline concept
- [ ] Apply "dial it to 11" concept to 1 existing thumbnail
- [ ] Start prep for next podcast cold open clip with tension
