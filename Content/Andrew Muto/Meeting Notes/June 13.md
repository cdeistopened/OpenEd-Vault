## Transcript

[Charlie Deist] 13:17:34  
Right, right. Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 13:17:35  
And I… if I can gain that audience now through… I'm gonna talk about the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses, I'm gonna talk about the Insta360 GO 3S, If I could talk about these things in, like, practical… practical reasons as to why they are or are not good.

[Andrew Muto] 13:17:51  
That audience hopefully comes with me. Over time, when they kind of fall in love with my schtick, and they really like this guy, so when I'm talking… when I'm doing, like, a daily vlog, they're like, this is cool.

[Andrew Muto] 13:18:00  
I'll follow this guy. And so they will… you get them with one, you hold them for the other.

[Andrew Muto] 13:18:06  
I also tend to believe that, like. Who doesn't want somebody to fall in love with philosophy?

[Charlie Deist] 13:18:06  
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:18:12  
Of anything. But I think that's a lot tougher. Um, especially when it's pure philosophy, when it's pure… here is an ideology.

[Charlie Deist] 13:18:14  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 13:18:23  
Sometimes, I think you can couch that ideology in… because the only thing that's good about the tips and tricks, it isn't… A tip and trick to get your kid to enjoy blah blah blah. It's 5.

[Andrew Muto] 13:18:34  
Right? Like, if you can do the philosophy stuff. With 5.

[Charlie Deist] 13:18:34  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 13:18:40  
Then I think you can have both. And so I think that's where… that's something to consider, too. It's like, I would go after the tips and tricks, because I do think it would likely get you… the audience you're looking for and the numbers you're looking for. The question that any reasonable person would have is.

[Charlie Deist] 13:18:43  
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:18:58  
Can I hold onto those people long-term? Or did I… or was it a very cheap view?

[Andrew Muto] 13:19:02  
That doesn't build brand. Great question. Um, and then there's the philosophy stuff, and then if you can couch the philosophy stuff.

[Charlie Deist] 13:19:04  
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:19:09  
Along with what you're doing, which, like, we're really tightening up the way you're making the videos, the way you're packaging the first 2 or 3 seconds, but if we also use some of those hooks from the tips and tricks of, like, the five reasons why, and get these guys to say it.

[Charlie Deist] 13:19:25  
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:19:25  
Or to edit that, right? To, like… like, on the screen right here, there's a… I'm looking at a grid of 12 videos, I see 7 or 8 faces. If you cut together a very quick 5 different people with one or two sentences. Like, the five things that suck about

[Andrew Muto] 13:19:45  
Public school. And then, you know, there are 5 different interviews from 5 different people. Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing. It's like, oh, shit.

[Andrew Muto] 13:19:53  
That's cool. But, like. It's really the tactic that you could probably sell any… well, I mean, maybe… current public discourse… makes this very clear. You can sell any stupid idea with the tactic of, like, 5 reasons why, right? Like…

[Charlie Deist] 13:20:10  
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:20:11  
People will follow dummies into hell, because they have, like, you know, 5 blah blah blah. It's like, okay.

[Andrew Muto] 13:20:17  
That's… the packaging of that tactic is really the value, not really what the substance is.

[Charlie Deist] 13:20:24  
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:20:24  
As we see every single day, right? Like, substance seems to be lost, but everybody's listening to the tactic.

[Andrew Muto] 13:20:31  
And some of these folks have gotten so very good at packaging tactic.

[Andrew Muto] 13:20:35  
That they now have massive audiences. And it's like, well, but what you're saying is crazy? But it's like, yeah, but you're really good at packaging.

[Andrew Muto] 13:20:41  
So, got it.

[Charlie Deist] 13:20:42  
Right, right, right. Yeah. Um, a couple thoughts that come to mind.

[Charlie Deist] 13:20:48  
One is, uh, the podcast archive. I've always just selected gun clips from within a single episode.

[Charlie Deist] 13:20:56  
But the idea of kind of a mash-up of different podcast clips is sort of intriguing.

[Andrew Muto] 13:21:02  
Yeah, it could be cool.

[Charlie Deist] 13:21:02  
Um, and I feel like… yeah, I feel like, you know, that's something where I'd be curious to see what I'd get if I just stuck And the muscle memory is there for editing podcast clips, so it's a little less of a barrier. But if I just jammed, like.

[Charlie Deist] 13:21:15  
6 or 7 sort of similar-themed guests into one chat with ChatGPT, like, I could probably come up with a handful of concepts that would be like a… little supercut or a mashup.

[Andrew Muto] 13:21:28  
Yeah, yeah. And I think that's probably easier than… the hook setup? Like, what is that hook setup, right? And That's something to just experiment with on its own, right? Of just, like.

[Charlie Deist] 13:21:34  
Mm-hmm. Right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:21:41  
You know, how can I, in two seconds, do this thing?

[Charlie Deist] 13:21:45  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 13:21:45  
Right? Like, and it doesn't need to be you, right? But it's like, what if it is… it's already written out on crayon on a desk over the shoulder of a kid, right? But then you let your child finish it, as though they wrote it.

[Andrew Muto] 13:21:59  
Or what if it's, like, magnets on a refrigerator? You know, and, like, a little kid finger pushing the last few into place. You know, like.

[Charlie Deist] 13:22:00  
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:22:08  
What is the hook that can get people to listen to the rest of it?

[Andrew Muto] 13:22:13  
Um. Van Nystadt, his hook is that typewriter.

[Andrew Muto] 13:22:19  
Right? Of that… are you familiar… have we talked about this? Okay, so Van Nystad is Casey Neistat's brother.

[Charlie Deist] 13:22:20  
Hmm. No.

[Andrew Muto] 13:22:24  
And every video of his essentially starts with a typewriter typing out kind of the name of the video essay you're about to watch. And it's like.

[Charlie Deist] 13:22:31  
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 13:22:34  
And it's like, you know, an extreme macro close-up of a typewriter.

[Charlie Deist] 13:22:38  
Yeah, I'm checking this out.

[Andrew Muto] 13:22:38  
And, um. And so you can… you know, and it's… now it's more of a… his hallmark that it is a hook. But, like, it worked in the beginning.

[Charlie Deist] 13:22:52  
Right, right, right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:22:55  
And… and so it's like, what is a hook that you can start to own and control that is gonna get people to come back?

[Charlie Deist] 13:23:05  
And to what extent do you think that the idea really has to be in the video itself versus the text hook? Like, what if… I'm almost feeling like there's just so many videos where somehow they get you… it is the combination of the two.

[

ou know, but it's one of those oddly satisfying kind of things, where it's like.

[Charlie Deist] 13:23:53  
Or, uh, or, yeah, I mean, it could… I probably could find… Right, right, right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:23:55  
Or it's melted all over a kid's face, right? Like… It's the… it's the first shot is the shot you're trying to avoid.

[Charlie Deist] 13:24:03  
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:24:03  
Right? So, this is something I did for Hoover, where, um… it was… it started with my son eating ice cream, and he's a disaster in the car.

[Andrew Muto] 13:24:14  
And then it cuts to our clean slate spot cleaner that has… that's battery-powered that you can use in the car. It was our highest performing ad of all time. That is probably the most Highest performing Hoover ad in the history of Hoover ads. That, like, it played for 2 years, and it was… it was shot in a phone, and it was shitty. It was like, you know, he's covered up. It was like America's home video quality. Like, it was nothing.

[Charlie Deist] 13:24:28  
That's hilarious.

[Charlie Deist] 13:24:38  
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:24:40  
Um, but it played so good because it started with this disaster of a kid covered in ice cream that was melting all over his face, clearly on the car, in the car, and mom over the shoulder, you know, saying, like, hey, you're a mess! Something like that.

[Charlie Deist] 13:24:54  
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:24:54  
And so, like, you know, you could say, you know, 5 snacks that don't melt in the car, and then you seeing the melting of, like, oh shit, I'm gonna watch this.

[Charlie Deist] 13:25:04  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:25:05  
Um, but to your point, or I think what you were kind of asking was.

[Andrew Muto] 13:25:10  
You kind of presumptively solve whatever you're setting up. Right? But I think that's a sliding scale the more you are an abstract philosophy territory.

[Charlie Deist] 13:25:14  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 13:25:19  
Right? Like… If you're talking about some grandiose idea.

[Andrew Muto] 13:25:24  
You have probably more wiggle room as to… here is my suggestion as to how to beat depression.

[Andrew Muto] 13:25:30  
Theoretically, right? Like, that… if that's the subject, how… 5 ways to cure depression you probably have some wiggle room. But 5 snacks that don't melt in the car, I think that's pretty… I think… I think that's accomplishable.

[Charlie Deist] 13:25:37  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 13:25:47  
An example of something I did today was I published a video on Velvet that was Um, watch me get turned down.

[Andrew Muto] 13:25:53  
And the first 3 seconds of the video is me going up to a girl, she says no.

[Andrew Muto] 13:25:59  
And then it cuts to… her coming up to me later, and her friend saying she changed her mind, now she knows who you are, she'll take the photo. Okay. And then, so we watch the rest of the video.

[Andrew Muto] 13:26:09  
So, the video, 85-95% of that video is not me being turned down.

[Charlie Deist] 13:26:16  
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:26:17  
But it's not clickbait. Right? Like, I think all you're trying to do is avoid the clickbait. The concept of clickbait, so that when people finish the video, they're like, fuck you, that was not the video I… That's… that… yeah, that's all you're trying to avoid. Like, some frustration. And I… and you know what?

[Charlie Deist] 13:26:27  
Right, okay, so that's how you define clickbait. Right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:26:36  
That's not even a black and white thing. So, for instance, I also published a video that did really well, which was a guy who has this, like, skeleton tattoo on his hand.

[Andrew Muto] 13:26:46  
And, um, I walk up to him, like, this guy is, you know, iconic or something, was the text, and I was like, man, you're great, I love that tattoo, you look fucking great, blah blah blah blah blah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:26:55  
The comments are filled with, like, that guy sucks. I hate that tattoo, like, everybody hated it.

[Andrew Muto] 13:27:00  
And so it's like, I actually gave you exactly what I said I was gonna give you, but people disagree.

[Andrew Muto] 13:27:06  
And it's like, oh, okay. But now the video's still got great views, because the algo doesn't understand bad sentiment. So that video just goes to the moon anyway. And that's another… That's another tactic that, like.

[Charlie Deist] 13:27:12  
Right. Right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:27:17  
I don't know what you'd want to call them, dark YouTubers will do of, like.

[Andrew Muto] 13:27:21  
They are actively antagonizing their audience for views, right? Of, like, everybody flies into the comments, and that's not our game, and almost assuredly not your game.

[Charlie Deist] 13:27:26  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:27:32  
Um, but it is a tactic that, like, even if you feel like you're on the edge here, people are gonna get frustrated, that frustration may play to your short-term advantage of getting a lot of views.

[Andrew Muto] 13:27:42  
Um, and then, like, you may get in front of even more people that agree with you.

[Andrew Muto] 13:27:48  
Because the algo's like, well, great, I'm gonna send this to a shit ton more people.

[Andrew Muto] 13:27:52  
Um, which is what I… like, on Facebook, that, that, um, I… it was, like, one of my most popular videos ever.

[Andrew Muto] 13:27:57  
Of this tattoo guy. It was very… it was earlier this week. And I got, like, a hundred and… thousand views on Facebook. We're normally at, like, 5,000 views on Facebook.

[Andrew Muto] 13:28:06  
And it was… vast majority of people, like, I hate this guy's tattoo, blah blah blah. But Biago doesn't know the difference, and it's just like… Sends it to everybody.

[Charlie Deist] 13:28:12  
Right. What was the tattoo? What was wrong with the tattoo?

[Andrew Muto] 13:28:16  
Well, I don't think I even noticed if it was poorly done, but the guys got, like, um, literally, it's like an x-ray of his hand, so there's, like, it's just… you know, phones. It's a very aggressive hand tattoo.

[Charlie Deist] 13:28:25  
I see, yeah, yeah. Kind of creepy, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:28:30  
And, um, people were just ragging on him about it, but I thought he looked cool. I thought he had the guts to do it, like, that looks cool, and… Um, it was… I had a fun interaction, but, um, Facebook, you know, and Facebook's…

[Andrew Muto] 13:28:43  
Tough. No one… says nice things on Facebook.

[Charlie Deist] 13:28:46  
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:28:47  
Um, so, uh, but, like, yeah, I think you need to… attempt to avoid the concept that you have tripped the audience into something. But I think that's a really wide… you know, like… had a… I don't know, I'm trying to even think of an example of clickbait, like…

[Andrew Muto] 13:29:07  
The battery that lasts forever. And then it doesn't last forever, is probably clickbait.

[Charlie Deist] 13:29:14  
Okay, right, right, right, yeah. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:29:15  
Unless it's rechargeable, right? And then, like, well, yeah, and again, if you confront the clickbait, you're probably fine. Like, no, I know, you guys saw the title thumbnail.

[Andrew Muto] 13:29:25  
But you don't have to recharge it. But after that, it does last forever. I don't know, it's probably safe. It's probably fine.

[Charlie Deist] 13:29:32  
Yeah. I… so, I mean, thinking about one like that, you know, messy… messy phase, 5 snacks that don't melt in the car.

[Charlie Deist] 13:29:40  
Again, just thinking, like, what's the fastest way to get the assets for that video? I was looking into… websites, like, you know, stock video websites that kind of specialize in a more raw, authentic, user-generated content feel, iPhone footage.

[Charlie Deist] 13:29:56  
Still haven't really found anything that is, like. Easy to get into and go. Actually, I was about to put something in the newsletter today.

[Charlie Deist] 13:30:05  
Kind of like a… win a, you know, win a t-shirt by entering, um, just, like, fill out this Google form and upload a couple phone videos, and each video that you upload will be an entry into the competition.

[Andrew Muto] 13:30:18  
Ooh, that's interesting.

[Charlie Deist] 13:30:18  
Um… But the parameters were pretty vague. It was, like, something like, you know, show us what your homeschool kind of feels like, and feel free to do facelift, you know, faceless videos are fine, it can just be… anything, just to sort of have a library of diverse, um…

[Charlie Deist] 13:30:38  
On, you know, maybe kind of on point. But I could also be more specific with the prompt.

[Charlie Deist] 13:30:42  
Um, and it might be a little bit safer to first explore this internally in our company Slack.

[Charlie Deist] 13:30:48  
Since we do have, like, 40 or 50, mom, teacher, like, people that fit both demographics.

[Andrew Muto] 13:30:54  
Yeah. Well, um… My… I mean, my instinct is always to attempt it myself first, before I try to go to others, because, like, I want to understand, like… because there's things you don't know, like, what is the structure of this video? How long does each video need to be?

[Charlie Deist] 13:31:10  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 13:31:10  
How many… how many cuts do I have? Let's say in any given segment, or the whole video, like, what am I trying to do? And once I know that, I'll know kind of what I'm asking.

[Andrew Muto] 13:31:20  
And, you know, what you're asking for a recipe video is likely different than what you're asking for, like, a philosophical education video, let's say, or just B-roll.

[Charlie Deist] 13:31:21  
Mm-hmm.

[Charlie Deist] 13:31:29  
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:31:31  
And so, um, it really depends. I mean, like, the… the recipe video one, I would probably try to accomplish myself initially, of like, I'm just gonna make 5 things this weekend.

[Andrew Muto] 13:31:42  
And… boom, boom, and I'm gonna try to document them, and then… but what I… but instead of making it difficult to, like, document every scoop of whatever. I am going to shoot the end result of each one.

[Charlie Deist] 13:31:42  
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 13:31:54  
And then recipe in the description. For, you know, like, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, like… Number 5, number 4, number 3, number 2, number 4.

[Andrew Muto] 13:32:04  
All in there. That might be a way to do it. And then I will film my child with a chocolatey mess.

[Andrew Muto] 13:32:10  
Like, then that'll be the text. So it's… it's gonna be essentially 5 shots… 6 shots.

[Charlie Deist] 13:32:15  
Right. Right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:32:17  
Messy face, recipe 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. The glamour shots, and… of each meal.

[Charlie Deist] 13:32:25  
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 13:32:26  
And then you're gonna write it up. That's how I would try that first.

[Andrew Muto] 13:32:30  
Um, and then… the newsletter thing's a great idea, and using the slack of an employee is a great idea. I think it's just figuring out, like, what am I trying… to get out of them. Am I trying to get B-roll of their kids

[Andrew Muto] 13:32:43  
Playing outside, then that would be the… because I have this idea for a handful of videos where I need kids running on swing sets and the whole thing.

[Andrew Muto] 13:32:51  
Because I'm going to talk about next week, how video… how, um… kids who have more free time, or more blah blah blah blah blah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:32:59  
So I need footage for that. So here's the newsletter. I think that's a way to go. That's how I would probably go about it if I really needed footage.

[Charlie Deist] 13:33:09  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:33:10  
Um, alternatively, though, I would probably try to film it myself first, again, just to confirm oh, I know the structure of this video.

[Charlie Deist] 13:33:19  
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:33:19  
Like, I've got my own kids, and I know it's like, oh, actually, you know what? It's gonna take 12 shots to put this together, because I use this trending audio, and there's a cut.

[Andrew Muto] 13:33:28  
On every beat, and there's 12 beats, and it's like, okay.

[Andrew Muto] 13:33:31  
Cool. Um… Theoretically, you know, like, that's the nuance of what you're trying to accomplish.

[Andrew Muto] 13:33:39  
Um, and I always try to brute force it with myself first, even if it doesn't get published.

[Andrew Muto] 13:33:44  
Um, but that's how the Hoover thing came up, that the… the… there was all this rigmarole with the people who made our official commercials.

[Andrew Muto] 13:33:55  
We had, like, an in-house production team, and it was, like, dealing with them was, like, pulling teeth, because it was, like, they had all this stuff, and everything took fucking forever, and, like, blah blah. It's like, guys, I'm just gonna go home, and I'm gonna just shoot a version.

[Andrew Muto] 13:34:05  
I was gonna shoot the bad version, and fine, and everybody's like.

[Andrew Muto] 13:34:09  
Everybody said yes because they didn't care, and they're like, it's never gonna go anywhere. It's like, cool.

[Andrew Muto] 13:34:14  
Went home, literally shot it in my driveway with an iPhone.

[Andrew Muto] 13:34:19  
And it… it came back, and it was good enough, mostly because I'm an editor, I think, because I was able to make it feel really tight.

[Andrew Muto] 13:34:28  
And it was like, how is this not the video? How is this not the video that we… like, are we gonna redo this professionally? Like, this is the video.

[Andrew Muto] 13:34:35  
They're like, yeah, it's the video. I was like, okay, out the door. Um, and then it did really well.

[Andrew Muto] 13:34:39  
So I would say, try a version yourself, even… and in the back of your mind, say, I'm not even gonna publish this. This is just as, like, a demo. Like, this is what I'm looking for. And it might help in the Slack channel.

[Andrew Muto] 13:34:51  
So you could show… this is what I'm trying to accomplish.

[Andrew Muto] 13:34:54  
With your footage.

[Charlie Deist] 13:34:54  
Right. Yeah, no, it makes sense, makes sense. And I feel like… If I get to the point where… I find a formula… where I can gather footage for… multiple future videos in that format.

[Charlie Deist] 13:35:13  
Then I can see myself doing that. I doubt I'll get to the… I doubt I'll ever do something where I, you know, do a whole… Um, ask for… Well, I don't know. On the company Slack, I can see myself asking for footage for a specific… for one specific video.

[Charlie Deist] 13:35:27  
Um, I don't think I would do that for our general audience, just because it's… Would be too much effort for one video, probably.

[Andrew Muto] 13:35:35  
Yeah, I mean, I think if you had a series, like, if you had something where Um, I'm just making this up, but, like, your best piece of homeschool parenting advice.

[Charlie Deist] 13:35:38  
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 13:35:45  
Mm-hmm. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:35:46  
Give it… give it to us in under 30 seconds. And then you get it, and you cut it down to, like, a hot 17.

[Andrew Muto] 13:35:52  
Seconds. Um, and let's say that that could be something for the newsletter, where it's like, now, I just got 75 inbound videos.

[Charlie Deist] 13:35:54  
Yep.

[Andrew Muto] 13:36:00  
From a single newsletter push. Now, theoretically, assuming all these are good.

[Andrew Muto] 13:36:04  
I've got 75 posts that I can pepper out over the next 6 months.

[Andrew Muto] 13:36:08  
And that's just one… like, that's a great way of doing it. I mean, that's not a bad idea on its own, I'm sure, like.

[Charlie Deist] 13:36:08  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 13:36:14  
Of… I'm sure every parent's got homeschooling advice. Give me your homeschooling advice in 30 seconds.

[Charlie Deist] 13:36:22  
Yeah, I mean, do you think that… do you think that could work?

[Andrew Muto] 13:36:25  
Sure. Yeah, I mean, why not? And then, you know, you put a little piece of trending audio underneath it.

[Andrew Muto] 13:36:29  
And then maybe you build, like, um… you know, there's some, like, on-screen text that kicks everyone off, uh… like, this is a real mom, you know, a little arrow.

[Charlie Deist] 13:36:41  
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:36:42  
Real… real open ed. I don't know what you… do you guys call them customers?

[Charlie Deist] 13:36:49  
Families, just like families. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:36:49  
Okay, real open ed family? Real open-end mom, like… That, I mean, that's an ad, too. I mean, that's… there's a lot going on there. Um… That could be super cool.

[Charlie Deist] 13:36:54  
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 13:37:03  
Yeah. Let me… let me see if I can run with that. Um…

[Andrew Muto] 13:37:08  
Okay, the one call-out there is, um, I would chat with whoever you have on your side about legal to proper approval to use it. That can get weird.

[Andrew Muto] 13:37:19  
Um, I fly fast and loose on the street because I'm not selling any of these images, and I'm in the public eye. But for businesses, for Hoover, we had all these rigmarole things. They'd actually sign the release and everything, and…

[Charlie Deist] 13:37:26  
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:37:31  
So UGC can get, like. Um… I don't want to say complicated, but it is more than just, like, somebody gave me a video. It's like, well, great, what What if that video works really well, and you guys buy ads against it, and you make a billion dollars? That person may come back and be like, yo, what the fuck?

[Charlie Deist] 13:37:48  
Right, right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:37:51  
Man, maybe you guys are already doing that, but just something to mention of, like, you know.

[Andrew Muto] 13:37:55  
Usually, it's, like, by submitting this video, you are agreeing to our terms, and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, that we can… use it and put it on our Instagram, and… blah, blah, blah. For commercial use.

[Charlie Deist] 13:38:06  
Right, get that… get that boilerplate, get that figured out.

[Andrew Muto] 13:38:09  
Yeah, yeah, and it's usually based on, like, if you submit, you agree to.

[Charlie Deist] 13:38:12  
Right, right. Yeah, I had a little checkbox on the form that I drafted up, but I don't know if that would… Check all the actual legal boxes.

[Andrew Muto] 13:38:13  
Um.

[Andrew Muto] 13:38:23  
Yeah, it's not… like, a lawyer, I don't know if you guys have, like, uh, counsel in-house or whatever, but it shouldn't be super complicated for them, it's just something that, if I were you.

[Andrew Muto] 13:38:34  
You know, kind of plan for success. In that regard, because if it it's a nightmare when it goes the wrong way.

[Charlie Deist] 13:38:41  
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:38:41  
They're like, oh, shit. Now I gotta take this down, and now there's, like, 12 people involved in the marketing team that are, like.

[Charlie Deist] 13:38:51  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:38:53  
Yeah, I remember when UGC started back in the day, and, like, it wasn't actually UGC. We used to send producers out to people's homes.

[Andrew Muto] 13:39:01  
And film fake UGC. This was, like, back in, like. Let's say 2010, where you'd see, like, UGC stuff with flip cameras and a bunch of different stuff, but it was really producers bringing those cameras in, feeding them, like, talking.

[Charlie Deist] 13:39:06  
Uh-huh.

[Andrew Muto] 13:39:15  
Because nobody knew how to do it. Nobody had… there weren't, like, really great cameras on phones yet or anything, so all this stuff was engineered, and they had all the same pieces of paper to sign that, like, an actor would sign.

[Charlie Deist] 13:39:17  
Mm-hmm.

[Charlie Deist] 13:39:26  
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:39:27  
Um, of, like, you know you're being recorded, you know you're not… you're only getting this $100 fee, blah blah blah blah blah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:39:33  
Um, and it was, yeah, it was, like, really hyper-produced, but the first generation of UGC, everybody's like, this is just totally normal, people are just recording videos and sending them to companies. And it's like, no one's doing that!

[Andrew Muto] 13:39:43  
Literally, no one's doing that. Everything is being artificially generated.

[Charlie Deist] 13:39:45  
Right. Yeah. No, it is funny. All games get gamed.

[Charlie Deist] 13:39:52  
In the end.

[Andrew Muto] 13:39:52  
Yeah. Yeah. Um… So, yeah, I mean, I would… I think… I think the hook and, like, how you generate the hook is something that I would personally explore.

[Andrew Muto] 13:40:06  
In the immediate short term. Of, um, what can I do Because you already had a big list of ideas, but, like, if you want to talk about Like, the ideas are not the hard part.

[Charlie Deist] 13:40:07  
Okay. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:40:19  
You would… you and I would be able to spitball a billion ideas in 10 seconds of, like, you know, the snack ideas are a great one, right?

[Charlie Deist] 13:40:19  
Right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:40:26  
Best mom tip and trick, grade one, right? Five problems with, uh, public school education. These are, you know, we do this all day.

[Andrew Muto] 13:40:34  
The problem is that first 2 or 3 second hook. And… you don't have to solve it. Like, the podcast community basically doesn't solve it. They just assume, I'm gonna be ingenious every single time.

[Andrew Muto] 13:40:49  
Right? So, like, the beginning of every podcast clip that we see, whether it's Tom Segur, Joe Rogan, or whoever else, Diary of a CEO, that first line is just from the podcast, and every week, they get really lucky that somebody said something that queued up a perfect piece of short-form content.

[Charlie Deist] 13:41:06  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 13:41:06  
You can do it that way, or you could say, I'm gonna build a device, like a guy described last time, when he's got the phone, and he's like, come here.

[Andrew Muto] 13:41:15  
Like, he built a device that he can rely on for anything, whether it's a brand deal, or something he wants to tell you.

[Charlie Deist] 13:41:21  
What's up, guys? Account's name? Did you know?

[Andrew Muto] 13:41:23  
I can find them, let me find them for you, um… TikTok guy… that… So it's come here.

[Andrew Muto] 13:41:32  
There he is. Uh, Jordan The Stallion?

[Charlie Deist] 13:41:33  
Okay, I think I found him. Jordan. Okay, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:41:40  
So he… and that, obviously, he didn't figure that out on his first video, but he figured it out now, and now he can… couch, anything in that.

[Charlie Deist] 13:41:44  
Right, right, right.

[Charlie Deist] 13:41:50  
Yeah, right, right, right. Huh.

[Andrew Muto] 13:41:52  
And… and now that, I would say, to be fair, that is a high fucking bar. That is a, like, if I… I don't have one of these.

[Andrew Muto] 13:41:58  
Like, this is… this is great. My best is the… hey, can I take your photo? But I can't put anything behind that. He could put anything behind this, because it's… the whole idea is, like, let me give you information. It's like, I'm listening to whatever this guy says. Sometimes it's recipe.

[Charlie Deist] 13:42:05  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:42:12  
Sometimes it's a brand deal, sometimes it's his opinion on something.

[Andrew Muto] 13:42:17  
Um. But that's really kind of what you're hunting for.

[Charlie Deist] 13:42:19  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:42:21  
Unless you want to toss the cards up into the air every time and say, I'm just going to get really good at knowing and feeling what a good, sexy hook is.

[Andrew Muto] 13:42:30  
And I'm gonna find it organically out of pieces of content that come my way.

[Andrew Muto] 13:42:33  
And that's not… That's not a bad approach, it's just harder.

[Andrew Muto] 13:42:41  
Or it's… it's less dependable. Maybe it's not… maybe it's not harder. Maybe it's like, well, I just can't… I mean, I didn't get anything good this week, man.

[Andrew Muto] 13:42:51  
Like, there's nothing… They talked really in-depth about a lot of things, but I don't know, really sexy looks.

[Charlie Deist] 13:42:55  
Right, right, right. Now, that's kind of how I'm feeling about the next several podcast episodes.

[Charlie Deist] 13:43:00  
There's nothing that good.

[Andrew Muto] 13:43:02  
Well, we… I mean, if you want to review those, do you want to review those on Monday or something, and see… Um, and see what we can implant into the upcoming episodes, like, hey, can you guys say this or talk about this?

[Charlie Deist] 13:43:05  
Yeah, let's do that, let's do that. That'll be good.

[Andrew Muto] 13:43:17  
That might be helpful.

[Charlie Deist] 13:43:17  
Yeah. No, it sounds good, and just maybe go over a few more of the podcasts that have already been recorded.

[Andrew Muto] 13:43:24  
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 13:43:24  
And I'll come with a lot of… different pieces of source material that we might take as the… the jumping-off point.

[Andrew Muto] 13:43:34  
Great. Great.

[Charlie Deist] 13:43:37  
Alright, sounds good. What have you got going on this weekend?

[Andrew Muto] 13:43:40  
Alright, dude. Um, well, it… The weather for the last couple weeks has been my touch-and-go, where it's like, every day it says on the calendar it's gonna rain, but then it rains for, like, an hour, but it's always exactly when I shoot.

[Charlie Deist] 13:43:49  
Oh, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:43:53  
Which has this problem of, even if it's not actually raining.

[Andrew Muto] 13:43:57  
All I need is somebody to be scared that it's gonna rain, and then they don't go out in the street looking cool.

[Charlie Deist] 13:44:02  
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:44:02  
And it's like, shit. So, like, right now, it's raining, and it's like, damn it, I'm gonna… supposed to be out there in about an hour.

[Charlie Deist] 13:44:08  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:44:09  
And, um, I don't know what to expect, so… I might be rained out, and if I'm rained out, I think I would just make more long-term long-form YouTube videos?

[Charlie Deist] 13:44:19  
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 13:44:19  
Oh, that's… that's really… that's really what I got going on this weekend. Um… just trying to keep on keeping on. I'm going back and forth about… I'll talk to your off about this.

[Andrew Muto] 13:44:30  
These… the Ray-Ban glasses versus the hat camera that I use. And because the Ray-Bans are perfect in every way, except they don't shoot 16x9 landscape video for TVs, for YouTube, right?

[Charlie Deist] 13:44:34  
Huh.

[Charlie Deist] 13:44:43  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:44:43  
So if you record something great on there, you have to kind of encapsulate it with a frame of some kind, or a background. You've seen, you know, they'll… the background is blown up and blurry and, you know, like So I can either do that, or I can shoot on these hat cameras that do shoot 16x9, but I have all kinds of problems.

[Charlie Deist] 13:44:48  
Right. Yep. Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:45:01  
They have a short battery, they have these connectivity issues, the audio's not as good, like, really not as good.

[Andrew Muto] 13:45:08  
And… I… I felt that when I'm wearing the hat camera, I'm concentrating too much on the gear, and I'm missing I'm, like, not present enough.

[Charlie Deist] 13:45:18  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:45:19  
And all for long-form… the opportunity for long-form YouTube? I don't know. I'm going back and forth about this, that, like, I made this video, too, like, asking Mark Zuckerberg to make a 16x9 version of these glasses.

[Andrew Muto] 13:45:32  
But I haven't published either, like, I don't know what to do.

[Andrew Muto] 13:45:35  
With that, and um… I don't know, keep going back and forth.

[Charlie Deist] 13:45:41  
I'll be curious to see that Mark Zuckerberg video when it… when you post it.

[Andrew Muto] 13:45:44  
Yeah, I have a long-form version right now, and I'm like, I should just make a short one that is just me begging them for it.

[Charlie Deist] 13:45:49  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:45:52  
Um, I'd kill. I'd kill for a version that shoots either… that you could just switch, you know, like… Um, because there's plenty of video cameras that shoot It's called OpenGate, but that shoots the whole sensor, and then you can decide after the fact, do I want this, or do I want this?

[Charlie Deist] 13:46:04  
Oh, interesting. Huh, I've always wondered about that, because, like, where do those lines come from? Like, that's not the way the lenses work, right?

[Andrew Muto] 13:46:09  
Um.

[Andrew Muto] 13:46:14  
No, it's the… so you… so often, it's the sensor size, right? So the sensor is this way, right? And that's why you'll see people turn a camera like that and snap a photo sideways, because the sensor's actually long.

[Charlie Deist] 13:46:17  
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 13:46:26  
And when you want to get a portrait, you just rotate the camera.

[Charlie Deist] 13:46:28  
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 13:46:30  
Action cameras recently have had larger sensors, and they don't use the whole thing so they can move around the image and stabilize it.

[Charlie Deist] 13:46:38  
Huh, okay.

[Andrew Muto] 13:46:40  
If they were to apply that idea to the glasses, then they… you'd be able to do the same thing, where I could just get a censure punch, it's called.

[Andrew Muto] 13:46:49  
Um, and uh… it's got… I mean, I'm not

## Section 1: Philosophy Wrapped in Tactics

**Tactical Entry > Ideological Depth**

- Gain audience with _practical, clickable_ formats (e.g., tips, tools, "5 things")
- Hold audience long-term with _value-rich_, ideologically aligned content
- Example tactic: “5 Things That Suck About Public School” → delivered via rapid-fire clips from podcast guests

**Quote:** “If you can do the philosophy stuff with ‘5,’ then I think you can have both.”

---

## Section 2: Podcast Archive Supercuts

**New Format:**

- Mash multiple podcast clips into a single theme-based montage
- Great for:
    - Reinforcing brand pillars
    - Creating dynamic social proof
    - Highlighting voices across guest segments

**Workflow:**

1. Identify recurring themes (e.g., public school criticism, learning freedom)
2. Use ChatGPT to batch-find excerpts
3. Stitch into 15–30 sec format with on-screen structure: "5 Real Parents on X"

---

## Section 3: Hook Delivery Mechanisms ("Gimmicks")

**Hooks That Work:**

- Kid drawing message in crayon on a desk
- Magnets spelling out message on fridge
- Macro close-up of old typewriter (Van Neistat)

**Reusable Gimmick Examples:**

- "Come here…" intro (Jordan the Stallion)
- "I'm an 85-year-old psychologist…"
- Product disasters before solution (messy ice cream in car)

**Key Idea:** Build or identify a gimmick you can repurpose infinitely

---

## Section 4: Packaging Without Clickbait

**Avoiding Misdirection:**

- The hook can tease, but must deliver _some version_ of what it promises
- Emotional hooks are fine, even if payoff is brief (e.g., turned-down photo request)
- Frustration from unmet expectations = algorithmic death

**Guideline:** You can over-promise lightly, but _never bait-and-switch_

---

## Section 5: Testing and Iterating Production Formats

### Strategy:

- Use yourself first as test subject (lower friction, faster iteration)
- Develop internal clarity on:
    - Number of cuts needed
    - Hook structure
    - Clip length pacing

**Low-Effort Production Techniques:**

- Use Google Forms to collect footage from internal team (start with Slack moms)
- DIY footage of children for lifestyle visuals
- Consider repurposing newsletter visuals or graphs (e.g. Gen Z alcohol stat)

**UGC Legal Note:**

- Always get usage permissions (checkbox at submission minimum; ideally legal boilerplate)
- Plan for success: what if you want to run ads against it?

---

## Section 6: Content Pillars & Modular Deployment

Build multiple content archetypes:

1. Green Screen Guy (explainer + visual prop)
2. Expert Mom (testimonial, UGC)
3. Faceless Quote/Stat Reel (text + trending audio)
4. Compilation Format (e.g. 5 guests, 1 theme)

> “Different formats = different hooks = diversified risk.”

---

## Section 7: Creative Mindset + KPI Philosophy

- Don’t build rigid process around unproven content
- Stay in R&D mode while experimenting with hooks and styles
- Track performance but don’t overreact to short-term metrics
- Use short-form as the proving ground for long-form topics

> “Be deliberate with experiments. Pick one battle per week.”

---

## Immediate Experiments to Consider

- 5 Tools for X → Faceless, VO + screencap + soft b-roll
- 5 Problems with Public School → Podcast supercut
- Parenting Tip Submission Drive via Google Form (internal first)
- Trendline graphs + voiceover commentary (Gen Z drinking stat)
- Visual gimmick hooks (fridge magnets, handwritten notes, slow zooms)
