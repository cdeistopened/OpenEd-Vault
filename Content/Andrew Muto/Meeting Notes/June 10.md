[Andrew Muto] 12:12:48  
Got a summary from the actual guy who understands this. And the deeper you dig into the AI universe, a lot of them will tell you, like, this is really… We’re flying by the seat of their pants, and we don’t really understand a lot of this, or how it scales, because if we did.

[Charlie Deist] 12:12:50  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:13:01  
We’d be able to build it better, faster. And so, I don’t know how much of this… I’m starting to get some more doubt that, like, AI… what it’s doing right now, it’s very good at, but the idea that it could even get to the level of being a sophisticated agent for you, of understanding the context of, like, I want to go to… I want a vacation to Venice, and it, to not fuck up that you want to go to Venice, California, not Venice, Italy, like, I’m…

[Charlie Deist] 12:13:03  
Right, right.

[Charlie Deist] 12:13:12  
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:13:27  
I’m… I’m increasingly… Uh… skeptical, I guess, that AI is going… is going in that direction. I might be wrong, but just feels like… I haven’t seen anything that blows my mind that I can’t attribute to, like, statistical… like, it is…

[Charlie Deist] 12:13:33  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:13:45  
It is, um, you know, statistics in action is fundamentally what it’s doing, right? If you index every written word in human history, you could put together an incredible chapter of a book.

[Andrew Muto] 12:13:58  
But that’s… that’s like a statistics thing, as opposed to a reasoning and logic, and like, what am I doing? And… Um, it seems like it won’t be able to do some of the things we want it to do, like rewrite itself.

[Andrew Muto] 12:14:10  
In, um… that isn’t… like, the whole thousand monkeys typing a thousand hours, and eventually you get a script, it’s almost like that, where it’s like, yeah, no, the compute is so good.

[Charlie Deist] 12:14:15  
Right, right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:14:20  
That, like, you can throw a thousand monkeys at it, and in 10 seconds, you’ll get back the version that makes sense.

[Charlie Deist] 12:14:26  
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:14:27  
Um, as opposed to… training a… a… process that can learn and iterate.

[Andrew Muto] 12:14:34  
I don’t know. Um… It’s interesting times, though, that’s for sure.

[Charlie Deist] 12:14:39  
Yeah, I mean, this is top of mind for me, and partly because today I… maybe I’m a little bit behind the eight ball, or… day late and a dollar short on some of the things that I said I wanted to talk about today.

[Charlie Deist] 12:14:53  
I have one concept for an alternative. Short that relies more on, you know.

[Charlie Deist] 12:14:59  
Material that I can find from places, and that wouldn’t be a very heavy lift.

[Charlie Deist] 12:15:02  
That, I don’t know how much time it will actually take to look at that. Um, I had some thoughts that maybe we could… spend a little bit more time thinking about a sort of a… the formula behind YouTube titles and thumbnails with the thinking… at one point, I had planned to go through

[Charlie Deist] 12:15:19  
Sort of all the previous podcasts, um, just because it feels like if I batch process now, and I do take the 30 episodes that we’ve put out, or 50, I don’t know how many we’ve done.

[Charlie Deist] 12:15:30  
Um, like, I could potentially… Given that you’re saying, you know, YouTube has this kind of long tail, um… Maybe… maybe start to get more clicks on those old videos.

[Andrew Muto] 12:15:36  
Yeah, I think they’re both valuable in context of, like, building awareness immediately.

[Charlie Deist] 12:15:40  
Um, as lower-hanging fruit than And simultaneously optimizing going forward.

[Charlie Deist] 12:15:48  
Um, but I don’t know, again, I don’t know what the relative ROI is going to be on that versus continuing to try to find the real formats that are replicable and that can drive growth across all the short-form video platforms.

[Charlie Deist] 12:16:02  
So, sort of, long-form YouTube titles versus continuing to find the formats on short form.

[Charlie Deist] 12:16:08  
Um.

[Andrew Muto] 12:16:14  
Right? Like, um… I think… I mean, I see in my metrics that, like, and I just had a call with another creator, um, late last week, where Um, he does something very similar to what I do. His name’s Justin Vinema, and he’s like, he does what I do on the street, but he does it with

[Andrew Muto] 12:16:30  
Dogs. And he’s 3 times bigger than me. And, um, I got on a call with him, and I was just chatting him up, like, you the transition into YouTube is very, very… long form is very tough for us, because, like, how the fuck do you extend what we do into YouTube long form?

[Charlie Deist] 12:16:31  
Hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:16:45  
And, um, he had tried a couple things with varying levels of success, and where he netted out was, like.

[Andrew Muto] 12:16:52  
He doesn’t want to do long and… it seems like a time suck to do long form and short form, and that he had success in short form, so why not just quadrupled out on short form? And everything that you want to get out of it.

[Charlie Deist] 12:17:00  
Hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:17:04  
Brand awareness, brand deals, money, blah blah blah. You can get all that out of short form.

[Andrew Muto] 12:17:10  
Um, because if you’re gonna have to be creative to solve long-form problems, you might as well get creative on short-form to solve short-form problems.

[Andrew Muto] 12:17:17  
And it’s like, man, that’s a compelling fucking case, because in my head, I’m thinking long form.

[Andrew Muto] 12:17:23  
Because I can get brand deals easier. But I have to solve for what works well on long form. If short form, if you just get more at-bats at short form.

[Charlie Deist] 12:17:32  
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:17:33  
You know, there’s… there’s an argument to be made that I’m kind of contemplating in my head of, like, maybe this long-form thing is a red herring, and then I… for me.

[Andrew Muto] 12:17:41  
And that if you… If all things being equal, short form can get you where you need to be. That if you just were publishing a ridiculous amount of stuff on short form constantly.

[Andrew Muto] 12:17:52  
One of those things would hit to the scale at which you get a lot of attention, and then you’re… it’s a snowball rolling downhill.

[Charlie Deist] 12:17:59  
Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:17:59  
And long form is just exponentially more difficult. And the longer your long form is.

[Andrew Muto] 12:18:06  
It’s even more difficult, because you gotta keep people watching, right? So, like, how do you make an incredible piece of long-form content, even if it is a podcast. You know, like, the barrier to entry there is… you know, pretty high, given that some of these podcasts these days are, like, really highly produced. It’s like, wow, okay.

[Charlie Deist] 12:18:23  
Sure. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:18:25  
Um, is somebody going to spend time on my video versus somebody else’s video?

[Andrew Muto] 12:18:29  
So, um, I think about this a lot, and I think that, like, if one had to make a choice.

[Andrew Muto] 12:18:37  
I guess, short form makes the most sense. That if one was like, listen, I gotta just concentrate on one of them.

[Charlie Deist] 12:18:40  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:18:44  
Then short form is where I would triple down, because you just get… it takes less effort to publish, and you can publish more often.

[Charlie Deist] 12:18:54  
Right, right. No, that makes a lot of sense, and kind of last week, we talked a little bit about some of these concepts that I had. I just haven’t been a document called High Octane YouTube Concepts.

[Charlie Deist] 12:19:04  
A lot of this was based on… And I think I mentioned this video that has one of the highest ratios of total views to average views on the channel, and it’s this video, how Archimedes almost broke math with circles.

[Andrew Muto] 12:19:18  
That’s one of your videos? That’s one of your… Oh.

[Charlie Deist] 12:19:18  
Um, and… no, no, no, it’s, uh, let me see if I can… Pull it up, um, because there’s a lot in this that I feel like I would love to sort of master this style of video, if I could do it in a low-friction way. And this is an 8-minute video.

[Charlie Deist] 12:19:34  
But, um, I feel like you could probably do a lot of this stuff as short-form video.

[Charlie Deist] 12:19:40  
Uh, and I feel like it’s just… it’s… it’s sort of spot on the OpenEd open education brand in terms of… this… you can kind of tell already, like, you don’t even really have to watch the video. I’ll just play a couple of seconds.

[Andrew Muto] 12:19:47  
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:19:54  
I don’t even really remember, you know, and there’s some animation here that would be… above my pay grade, I would need to get a, uh… freelancer is somebody that could do these quickly, or find some other way Um, but the…

[Charlie Deist] 12:20:09  
These sort of concepts like, um… just, you know, historical tidbits, curiosities, little things that That, uh… I don’t know, the… let’s see, what was this one? The lost language that children can learn, but adults can’t. Like, why is it that kids…

[Andrew Muto] 12:20:17  
Yep.

[Charlie Deist] 12:20:26  
Are so good at learning language, and adults aren’t. Just like, sort of meta… content about learning, like, an education.

[Charlie Deist] 12:20:35  
Um, sort of thinking outside the box, but I haven’t actually… the fact that I haven’t actually, like, attempted to really execute on any of these, the closest that I came was that one, uh, it was like a 5-minute video of

[Charlie Deist] 12:20:49  
Um, you know, your kid says, I hate school, what does that actually mean?

[Charlie Deist] 12:20:53  
But, like, if I had done that one. Or if I redid that one as a… one minute short, um… maybe that’s, like, a better way to approach that.

[Andrew Muto] 12:21:03  
Well, it’s funny, so this is… this reminds me of something, um, I know we talked about Colin and Samira last week, but, um, I remember one of the most impactful videos I ever saw from them was this one with Cleo Abram, and she makes this show called Huge If True.

[Charlie Deist] 12:21:08  
Mm-hmm.

[Charlie Deist] 12:21:16  
Okay. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:21:17  
And she makes… they’re, like, basically, like, science episodes, but she’ll… like, she’s like.

[Andrew Muto] 12:21:24  
What happens inside of a black hole. And they’re incredibly… like… watchable. Like, these are… Whoa. Uh, hey Siri, stop.

[Charlie Deist] 12:21:26  
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:21:35  
Sorry. So, they’re just very, very watchable. One of her things was that she makes… a lot of these episodes come from short form.

[Charlie Deist] 12:21:45  
Hmm. Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:21:45  
That she throws a noodle at the wall, and if something sticks in short form, she’s like, oh shit, I should make that as a long form.

[Andrew Muto] 12:21:52  
Um, and she talks a little bit about that process in the course of this, like, 2-hour.

[Charlie Deist] 12:21:52  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:21:57  
Podcast. Um… confirm my speaking language, there we go. Um… So, you know, looking at your list there, I would say, man, especially, you know, it would take… you’d have to really suit up to do one of these. Let’s just be generous and be like, they’re sub-five minutes a pop.

[Charlie Deist] 12:22:13  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:22:14  
But if you were like, hey, can you make a version of these that are, like, you know, 30 to 45 seconds?

[Charlie Deist] 12:22:18  
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:22:19  
And… and really try to hone in on what the drama of every video is. Like, what is the perfect question?

[Charlie Deist] 12:22:26  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:22:26  
And… and how do you present that question, and how do you solve it? And then if you see any spikes in that, you’re like, well, this is one we’re going to go deeper in.

[Andrew Muto] 12:22:34  
And the cool part is, is that if any of these don’t work, you can kind of repackage it with a new VO.

[Andrew Muto] 12:22:40  
And a new kind of, like, opening question. And see, oh, can I get a hook on this instead?

[Charlie Deist] 12:22:45  
Well, so here’s a thought I just had, and I was gonna ask you, because, like, I’ve been paring down the… open-ed, people that I follow, just so that I can actually get a finger on the pulse of, like, okay, what are other homeschool moms posting? So here’s posts, not reels. When I go to reels.

[Andrew Muto] 12:22:59  
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:23:02  
It knows me, it knows that I’m a social media manager, and so everything is all about Instagram strategy. And what I’m… what I’m seeing in most of these is that they’re… very short, 5-second loops, and they reference the caption, and the meat of the content is in the caption.

[Andrew Muto] 12:23:09  
Uh-huh.

[Charlie Deist] 12:23:20  
Um, and there’s some good tips here. It’s overwhelming, and, like.

[Andrew Muto] 12:23:20  
Mm-hmm.

[Charlie Deist] 12:23:26  
Both exciting and despair-inducing at the same time, because… and this is why I go to you, because you can kind of cut through the BS and tell me, like, you don’t need to worry too much about that. But it’s like, oh, I should do this, and I should do this.

[Andrew Muto] 12:23:34  
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:23:39  
Um, but I could kind of imagine, you know, you just put the hook And, like, a very simple visual, in the first 5 seconds, and then the storytelling is somehow in the caption.

[Andrew Muto] 12:23:52  
Yes, and that’s, like, a classic like, gimmick for Instagram Reels and TikTok.

[Andrew Muto] 12:23:57  
Um, mostly Instagram. And it… I think to a certain extent, it does work. I think that is, like, a thing that you can deploy. My wife has deployed that a handful of times on her account.

[Charlie Deist] 12:23:58  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:24:07  
But, um, it is a gimmick and less a long-term strategy. It’s, like, something to put in your… in your toolkit.

[Charlie Deist] 12:24:13  
Okay. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:24:16  
Of, like, hey, you know, I got something… And it may even come down to publishing. I’m just like, you know, I got… I need to publish a video today. I do not have any fucking time.

[Andrew Muto] 12:24:25  
And I’m gonna do this. I’m gonna… here’s what the video I plan to make.

[Andrew Muto] 12:24:29  
But I’m just gonna put the headline, and I’m gonna write everything in the description, and I’m gonna just film a video that goes like this, and I’m gonna be done. And then I’m going to brunch, you know? Like, that’s… and no harm, no foul, like, that stuff works. I would be… shocked if someone who does that gag consistently builds brand.

[Charlie Deist] 12:24:33  
Right, right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:24:45  
That you’re not really building brand, you’re building short-term gimmicks. And I also think that Instagram and these platforms are aware of these gimmicks.

[Andrew Muto] 12:24:54  
And they would love to snuff those gimmicks out, if they could. But yeah, because… because there’s a problem, too, like, what’s… so this, you know, what you showed was just, like, a 5-second loop.

[Charlie Deist] 12:24:58  
Really. Interesting.

[Charlie Deist] 12:25:05  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:25:05  
What would stop somebody from going to one second, right? And one second is, you know, the algorithm is clever enough to be like, yo, a one-second video can’t… we can’t have that.

[Andrew Muto] 12:25:14  
And so now you’re just in this kind of Cold War, you know.

[Charlie Deist] 12:25:14  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:25:19  
What’s the… space race of… is it 1 second, 5 seconds? Where is the balance?

[Charlie Deist] 12:25:25  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:25:25  
And so I think if they can detect that you are… gaming it. They’re not gonna punish you other than to just, like, this video’s not gonna be shown.

[Charlie Deist] 12:25:32  
Right, right, right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:25:33  
Um, so I think it actually has to be deeply valuable.

[Andrew Muto] 12:25:38  
Um, and… and not just a gimmick, because then you’ll get… you know, you… the algo wants to beat those kind of bad actors. They really do want people to stay and watch videos and enjoy them.

[Charlie Deist] 12:25:50  
Interesting, okay, got it.

[Andrew Muto] 12:25:51  
Yeah, but it is not… I wouldn’t be against it. I mean, I would say, yeah, go for it. Add that as a thing that you do every… Yeah, you know, let’s say a couple times a month, maybe.

[Charlie Deist] 12:25:57  
I might try it. Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:26:02  
Um, and then really make sure that those, um. You know, the description is really chock full of real advice. What were some of the other things in there that kind of gave you… filled you with despair? Just the tips they were giving you?

[Charlie Deist] 12:26:09  
Right, right, right. Um, just the overwhelm of, like, there’s so many… different, potentially contradictory things that I could try, uh, and, you know, how am I gonna find the… the time and effort to actually… how I feel knowing I have to film reels every day. Like, this is how, yeah, this is…

[Andrew Muto] 12:26:32  
Yeah, well, I mean, that… so, man, I hear this stuff all the time. I was on a call with somebody yesterday that wanted me to, like.

[Andrew Muto] 12:26:39  
Talk at their… some… God, this is so harebrained. I don’t even know where to start. Some guy, this team of… creators or filmmakers have rented a space where they wanted to, like, sell studio time to other creators, but it hasn’t worked well. So I thought the best thing that they should do is create a non-profit and teach other people

[Charlie Deist] 12:26:53  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:26:57  
How to be creators. And I was like, wait a second, that’s your pitch to me? Your pitch to me is that you haven’t been successful, so you had to teach other people how to be… and you want me to come in?

[Charlie Deist] 12:27:04  
Right. Many such cases, many such cases.

[Andrew Muto] 12:27:08  
Yeah, and… and then they came in, and they were like, but every… we had a hard time finding students who wanted to join, because everybody just wants to be an influencer, and we think people should be building content for marketing brands, and I was like.

[Andrew Muto] 12:27:20  
What the fuck? Influencers, that is the future, because that’s the only weapon against AI.

[Andrew Muto] 12:27:26  
That, like, so you have a face-to-face relationship with somebody that you look up to and trust, the Casey Neistat, right? If Casey dedicated himself to just making ads for Samsung.

[Charlie Deist] 12:27:31  
Right, right, right. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:27:36  
You wouldn’t fucking… what the fuck are we… so, anyway, um, but they were… they were lamenting how much content they had to make.

[Charlie Deist] 12:27:43  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:27:43  
And I’m thinking, like, guys, this isn’t cost, this is benefit. This is… we’re so lucky!

[Andrew Muto] 12:27:48  
Imagine if we didn’t have access to this platform, and all you’d have to do is, like, well, I guess I have to make content and buy ad time.

[Andrew Muto] 12:27:56  
Right? Nothing would change, what would change? You would just have to also pay for the ad time. So this person complaining here.

[Charlie Deist] 12:27:58  
Right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:28:03  
I mean, I’m so sorry that you’re getting free awareness. I mean, look at that free 6,400 likes.

[Charlie Deist] 12:28:10  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:28:11  
Um, but on the other hand, maybe this is a super clever thing of, like, this is that polarization.

[Andrew Muto] 12:28:17  
Right? Like, I’m about to… I’m about to get all red in the face because, um, she said something I disagree with.

[Andrew Muto] 12:28:23  
And I’m 10 seconds away from hopping into her comments and being like, dummy. But that’s what she wants. Like, that’s the genius.

[Charlie Deist] 12:28:29  
Right, right, right. Yeah, I mean, in my dream world, I guess there’s just, like, I could, you know, today I sent out an open-end daily, and I started to think, okay, how can I repurpose this for social media?

[Andrew Muto] 12:28:30  
Um, and so, uh, good for her.

[Charlie Deist] 12:28:45  
There’s some good things that could be a little quote graphic, just a little, like, text image.

[Charlie Deist] 12:28:50  
You know, if I really wanted to get ambitious, I could turn that into a text over video reel, and then, like, there’s this… Great chart, I don’t know if I have it up right now, but it’s, like, the chart that shows

[Charlie Deist] 12:29:03  
Um, how Gen Z is drinking less than every other generation, by a lot. And maybe this is just the fact that they’re still young or something, and they don’t have money to spend, but this, to me, is like, whoa, that’s a crazy stat. Like, the…

[Charlie Deist] 12:29:15  
And actually, I found somebody, a young girl, that did a hot take on this, where she was like, the reason, you know, this is actually not good news, and then you have to watch the video to find out why. And she says.

[Charlie Deist] 12:29:26  
The reason is that they’re all spooked that somebody’s gonna record them doing something stupid.

[Charlie Deist] 12:29:31  
And that’s gonna haunt them for the rest of their life.

[Charlie Deist] 12:29:34  
And it kind of made me think back to, you know, college and, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:29:37  
How would that have affected? Yeah, I think that potentially would… maybe that would have affected my… if everybody’s filming all the time.

[Andrew Muto] 12:29:43  
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:29:43  
Um, so my dream scenario would be, like, having some kind of a… having my content engine geared up to where I could take just this image.

[Charlie Deist] 12:29:52  
Write the script for the message. And, you know, get to the point where there’s a good video behind it.

[Charlie Deist] 12:29:59  
And I just don’t think that I’m the… I mean, I… I could be the face for it.

[Charlie Deist] 12:30:04  
Um, and in some sense, that probably still is going to be the lowest… the lowest friction.

[Charlie Deist] 12:30:09  
But I’m still thinking about… trying to think creatively about formats where I don’t have to be a talking head on screen, where I can just do voiceover, or, like, text over, you know, text over image.

[Andrew Muto] 12:30:22  
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:30:22  
Um, the video that I produced, which is… pretty lame, and I think it also suffers from this AI syndrome, and, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:30:30  
Uncanny Valley artificiality. I bought, like, a… for $10 on Etsy.

[Charlie Deist] 12:30:38  
Kind of like a 10-pack of… AI-generated videos of just, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:30:43  
Women doing the pointy thing. So, so, you know, here’s our, here’s our opening, like, this is a message that I think uh, resonates with people. The idea of getting your homeschooling done in 2 hours a day, or 3 hours a day.

[Andrew Muto] 12:30:45  
Okay.

[Charlie Deist] 12:30:58  
Uh, maybe I’ve got too much going on here, because I also say 4 days a week.

[Charlie Deist] 12:31:02  
But it’s like, alright, 5 tools we use to get homeschool done in 3 hours a day.

[Charlie Deist] 12:31:07  
Um, you know, she’s pointing up. I seek naturalist app, that’s my, uh, pregnant wife, and… two of our kids, uh… Khan Academy, this is just, like, a recording of my screen.

[Charlie Deist] 12:31:21  
Um, another one, like, Epic Library. Uh, and then I have a couple other, just sort of, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:31:28  
Filming the screen to give it a little more, like. Texture. Um… But even…

[Andrew Muto] 12:31:31  
Yeah. I don’t… I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. I think… I think this is an option. Going back to what you were saying before.

[Andrew Muto] 12:31:40  
Is it feels like you’re on exactly the path I was when I was trying to think out velvet.

[Andrew Muto] 12:31:46  
Where it’s like, I know what I’m trying to accomplish here. I got… I got things I want to talk about, and I need a production methodology.

[Andrew Muto] 12:31:53  
And I was kind of really locked in on POV. And I had… I was struggling with the tech for months of, like, thinking about this. Every hour of every day, trying to figure out how can I get this… how can I wear this camera in a way that is, like, really baby simple.

[Charlie Deist] 12:32:00  
Hmm.

[Charlie Deist] 12:32:10  
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:32:11  
Um, and you’re in that… it feels like you’re on that same path of, like, you have these ideas.

[Charlie Deist] 12:32:16  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:32:17  
That you want to deploy. And you’re… now you’re getting very familiar with the structure in which they need to be deployed, and the real question is.

[Andrew Muto] 12:32:25  
How do I do this consistently? In a way that is pretty frictionless for me. And given your skill sets. And it’s like, okay, cool. And this is… I think this is fun work.

[Charlie Deist] 12:32:31  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:32:36  
But it is torturous work in that it’s like an artist trying to find their, you know, their yellow pigment.

[Andrew Muto] 12:32:44  
You know, it’s like, God, I can’t… I know what I’m looking for, and to me, that’s the artist’s struggle.

[Charlie Deist] 12:32:44  
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:32:50  
And you kind of have to just keep hunting. And I could even flashback and say my whole career has been leading up to me trying to find velvet.

[Andrew Muto] 12:32:59  
So I’m not… it’s not like a 3-month process, theoretically. It could be, like.

[Andrew Muto] 12:33:03  
I’m still trying to find that thing. Like, I know what I want to do.

[Charlie Deist] 12:33:05  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:33:08  
And I wouldn’t… I wouldn’t ever walk away from that. It’s just a matter of, like, what is that thing?

[Andrew Muto] 12:33:14  
And I would challenge your preconceived notions as to what you think you’re capable of. Like.

[Andrew Muto] 12:33:20  
George Lucas famously had this argument with his wife, where he was making this very insular, hard-to-understand movies in the early 60s.

[Andrew Muto] 12:33:28  
And his… and his wife was like, George, I don’t know why you keep making these movies that nobody likes.

[Andrew Muto] 12:33:33  
Um, why don’t you make something the audience can enjoy? And he was like, well, it’s not a big deal to make a movie that everybody loves, it’s just take a kitten and wring its neck. And it’s like, fine, I’ll show you. And he made American graffiti.

[Andrew Muto] 12:33:44  
And then… and he’s like… and he says, this is easy, and everybody fucking loved it.

[Charlie Deist] 12:33:44  
Oh, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:33:49  
And then he made Star Wars, and he’s like, I just… I just turned my logic on its head.

[Charlie Deist] 12:33:53  
Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:33:53  
Of, instead of swimming against the current. I just turned around and swam with it, and it turned out it was really easy.

[Andrew Muto] 12:34:01  
And it’s… it’s that thinking, too, where, like, maybe you don’t want to be on camera, not saying that you have to be, but, like, any… any areas where, like, well, I’ve put some guardrails up, I would at least take some time on a walk or, you know, in the shower, just consider the guardrails and say, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:34:01  
Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:34:16  
Kent, should I try that? Should I do it? Whatever. Um, so I would say that. But… What you’re going on here is exactly that journey, like, how do you… what is the content?

[Andrew Muto] 12:34:26  
The AI stuff, I don’t think this is bad. I think there’s a gimmick to this very specific layout that you’re kind of on this longer than you should be. I think that you need to be on this longer, right? Because you need to give them time of, like, alright, so what is it?

[Charlie Deist] 12:34:34  
Hmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:34:39  
Right? And you’re kind of waiting for it to start, and once you’re in the video deep enough.

[Andrew Muto] 12:34:45  
The algo thinks, oh, they must really enjoy this. The hook must have been so good, they’re still watching.

[Charlie Deist] 12:34:50  
Uh-huh.

[Andrew Muto] 12:34:50  
Right? If you do it really quickly and get into it, you’re like, oh shit, I couldn’t even really understand what they were saying in the beginning, and I haven’t built up that anticipation.

[Charlie Deist] 12:34:59  
So you’re saying this opening should be shorter or longer? Longer, okay.

[Andrew Muto] 12:35:00  
Um. Longer, longer, longer.

[Andrew Muto] 12:35:04  
Um, like, give somebody time to read it, and really, like, okay, I’m down. If you… because if you’re in, you’re in. If you’re in, you’re gonna watch the whole damn thing.

[Charlie Deist] 12:35:08  
Right, right.

[Charlie Deist] 12:35:13  
Right, right. Yeah, okay.

[Andrew Muto] 12:35:17  
Um, and then I think the technique of showing that, I mean.

[Andrew Muto] 12:35:21  
If you really want to be helpful, I would try to make it as clear as possible, you know, Khan Academy, whether it’s a logo or whatever. You know, I’m assuming you’re gonna put OpenEd in there somewhere?

[Charlie Deist] 12:35:27  
Right, right. Um, I wasn’t planning on it, actually, but now that you mention it, it, like, as number 3 or something like that.

[Andrew Muto] 12:35:34  
Okay. Yeah, yeah, I mean, I would… I would try to do… I mean, that’s… you know, I think everybody who has a newsletter It is fundamentally an excuse to talk about your thing. I think that’s great, right? I think, like, if…

[Charlie Deist] 12:35:38  
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:35:48  
Yeah, no, I mean, and then it also becomes potential ad creative if it… If it works.

[Andrew Muto] 12:35:52  
Yeah, exactly. Um… So, I mean, I think these kind of techniques are, like, um… go back, you had, you had, like, a list of things you wanted to talk about. You just, um… was it a Google Doc?

[Charlie Deist] 12:36:02  
My list was… I mean, I emailed you a couple things. It was, like, YouTube thumbnails and thumbnail title combination, that kind of complementarity.

[Charlie Deist] 12:36:10  
Seeing if we could… oh. Okay, right, right, right. Um… That was…

[Andrew Muto] 12:36:11  
No, no, you just had a list of subjects.

[Andrew Muto] 12:36:17  
Well, you also described that, the fading bomb thing there, like, so if you had a great idea, if you go back to that infographic that had the, um, the drinking, if you had a great idea, like, hey, I want to turn this into a video.

[Charlie Deist] 12:36:23  
Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh.

[Andrew Muto] 12:36:28  
Exactly. I mean, that’s… you’d be super well positioned to do that, and it’s just like, what is the structure?

[Charlie Deist] 12:36:34  
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:36:34  
Of the production methodology that lets me do this. And, like, even listing out what those options could be, and going on a hunt.

[Andrew Muto] 12:36:43  
On social media. Of, like, what, what… like, and you, you don’t even need to, like, search for this, just scroll, and you’ll see a bunch of ones pop up. You saw the one where they’re going like this, or going like this, right?

[Andrew Muto] 12:36:53  
But there’s plenty of others, and it’s like, start to… start to, like, save a folder worth of, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:36:53  
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:36:59  
These are production styles. And which ones make the most sense?

[Charlie Deist] 12:37:01  
Yeah, I’m trying to… No, totally. That reminds me, um… I have a young friend, young Gen Z friend that shared this video with me. I don’t know, am I sharing sound right now?

[Andrew Muto] 12:37:15  
Uh, I don’t think so, I didn’t hear anything, no.

[Charlie Deist] 12:37:16  
Okay, because this video, I’m pretty amazed by the… Like, this should have way more than 10,000 views, based on how much… how good this video is. But, I mean, the claim here, every content strategy explained in 60 minutes, 16 minutes.

[Andrew Muto] 12:37:30  
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:37:30  
Um, it’s maybe slightly overselling, but my friend shared this video with Specifically, he directed me to a timestamp, 2.31.

[Charlie Deist] 12:37:39  
Strategies. The key women of reach, if you can get controversial, and you send the information or reveal. So this is typically going to be some kind of exciting music, jumping between different years or different stages of your life, maybe when you’re really skinny previously, and you suddenly switch to commercial It’s definitely worth testing.

[Charlie Deist] 12:37:40  
Um, let’s see… Okay, here we go.

[Charlie Deist] 12:37:52  
Uh, this one I can’t really see using it. I’m not sure why he’s saying… suggesting this one.

[Charlie Deist] 12:37:56  
But, um… I mean, I can see for this one, like, I can kind of imagine Doing, you know, kind of like a fast pace, where I just… try to get into, um… not stream of consciousness mode, because I’d want to have a script, but like…

[Charlie Deist] 12:38:13  
Get into my theater kid mode, and just do, like, a pretty simple, not overactive, but just, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:38:18  
Read my script, maybe, you know, point at one part of the graph or something, and just have this as the background.

[Charlie Deist] 12:38:25  
I could maybe, you know, if I find the study, I could find one highlight in the study where it’s just… the only assets are My talking head with a green screen filter applied to it, and then a handful of still screenshots.

[Andrew Muto] 12:38:37  
I mean, that sounds great to me. I mean, have you ever seen that guy that does the thing where he’s, like, shooting in a mirror, he’s a black guy, and he’s like, he’ll say one line, he’s like, come here, and then the camera zooms in at every little bit.

[Andrew Muto] 12:38:48  
And then he’ll talk about anything. It might be… he’s like, everybody’s been looking for that, or have you been looking for that, uh, blah blah blah recipe? Come here, I found it for you. And then he goes… and then he talks.

[Andrew Muto] 12:38:58  
And it’s just that hook. He found that one hook. And then I saw this other guy recently who has been explaining internet things to his wife. And so it’s always him in the kitchen, on the, you know, the island, and he’s got the phone, and he’s like, alright, honey, listen, now I gotta tell you about X.

[Andrew Muto] 12:39:16  
And it goes, and it goes… and he’s just found the hook.

[Charlie Deist] 12:39:16  
Right, right. Yep, yep.

[Andrew Muto] 12:39:19  
And in all cases. They’re very easy. In all cases, it doesn’t seem like anybody needs to suit up for a big thing at all, which I think is… the recipe for success, right? That, like, if you have to say, okay, I gotta get the teleprompter up, and I gotta write, there’s a 2-hour time for me to write the script, and blah… it’s like, these people show… I think they just have an idea that you got this, and you’re like, I’m gonna go, I’m gonna riff, and I’m gonna figure it out. I did happen to watch your YouTube video where you were doing that on the open-end page, where you, you, um…

[Charlie Deist] 12:39:27  
Right, right. No, it’s so true. Yep.

[Charlie Deist] 12:39:40  
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:39:47  
Why is it that so many tabs open right now. Um.

[Charlie Deist] 12:39:49  
Oh, was it, like, a Duolingo? Okay, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:39:52  
Yes, the owl one, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And it’s like, dude, you’re… you know, you’re really good, right? Like, that’s… that would be… a lot of people would be hard-pressed to have been that clever, and, like, that was… you were well-spoken, it made sense.

[Andrew Muto] 12:40:10  
Um, and I think… Um, I saw a YouTube version of it. If you’ve got a shorter version, I haven’t seen that. I saw, like, a 5-minute version.

[Charlie Deist] 12:40:14  
Okay. Yeah, it was… it was maybe a couple minutes, and at one point, I tried to do one of these with Isaac, too.

[Andrew Muto] 12:40:18  
Um.

[Charlie Deist] 12:40:23  
But it just, it wasn’t very good. It didn’t really make sense Um…

[Andrew Muto] 12:40:25  
But I think you on camera. Is something too experiment with in short form.

[Andrew Muto] 12:40:31  
Um, even if it’s just you setting it up. Right? Even if it’s just you.

[Charlie Deist] 12:40:31  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:40:36  
Um, like, whatever that hook is. And… it’s… non-trivial to find that hook.

[Andrew Muto] 12:40:45  
I will admit. But once you find that hook, you’re kind of on rails.

[Andrew Muto] 12:40:50  
And the struggle that you would have, and that I would say I have currently, is… you fall into this pipe of, like, so what happens if I don’t use that hook? Am I just… am I screwed? Like, I find every time I don’t do the… I think I’ve told you this before, every time I don’t use the, hey, you look incredible, can I take your photo? My video bombs. And it’s like, holy shit! Yeah, and bomb is, relative speaking, I’ll get, like, 20,000 views instead of 80,000.

[Charlie Deist] 12:41:00  
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:41:06  
Really?

[Charlie Deist] 12:41:13  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:41:13  
And it’s like, what the fuck? That sucks, though. Like, that somehow… I’m pigeonholed into this one really great hook, and that I am now forced to find a second once-in-a-lifetime hook, you know, like…

[Charlie Deist] 12:41:26  
Right, right. No, I mean, have I showed you… have I showed you this that my other client before with… But you haven’t… you haven’t actually seen this, or…?

[Andrew Muto] 12:41:32  
No, you’ve mentioned, you’ve mentioned, yeah. Let me see… I haven’t seen them, I haven’t seen him, no.

[Charlie Deist] 12:41:37  
Um, so let’s see, his pinned, like. I’m pretty sure in all three of his… He maybe has 4 reels with over a million views.

[Charlie Deist] 12:41:46  
Um, and I’m pretty sure that they all start with the same hook.

[Charlie Deist] 12:41:48  
I’m an 85-year-old clinical psychologist. People want tips. Uh, let’s see, I’m an 85-year-old clinical psychologist.

[Andrew Muto] 12:41:55  
Yeah, yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:41:57  
I want… this one actually was a little bit different. I want to be an influencer. After 64 years in practice. Same basic thing.

[Charlie Deist] 12:42:05  
Um, and he might have had… Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:42:06  
And, you know, part of the hook is just the way he looks. You know, like, so very rarely see people that age.

[Andrew Muto] 12:42:13  
Participating in social media, so that’s super cool. Um.

[Charlie Deist] 12:42:14  
Yeah. Yeah, this was the last one. I guess not… doesn’t have the same exact hook.

[Andrew Muto] 12:42:20  
But you can see how, like, nothing… Does he have a script? Do you know if he has a script?

[Charlie Deist] 12:42:25  
No, nope, usually no. Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:42:26  
He just goes, right? Yeah. So, like, that’s the level of effort.

[Andrew Muto] 12:42:29  
The level of effort is really… showing up consistently And I’m assuming, taking the time to find this hook.

[Charlie Deist] 12:42:30  
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:42:39  
I… maybe it’s possible that he got this out of the gate.

[Andrew Muto] 12:42:42  
And good for him. Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:42:43  
No, no, it took a while, and it was just… it was this young social media manager that I brought on, and he found it in, like, the first 2 or 3 months.

[Charlie Deist] 12:42:52  
Or less, but it took some iteration, and then… Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:42:54  
But that sounds exactly right. That sounds… I mean, that’s really what you’re looking for. And then.

[Andrew Muto] 12:42:59  
This is why the low effort works, where it’s like, I don’t have to hire an animator, I don’t have to hire a video editor, it’s just like, it’s just this. And, um, because the nightmare is, what happens if the hiring the editor version works. It’s like, oh, fuck, now I’m beholden.

[Charlie Deist] 12:43:05  
Right, right.

[Charlie Deist] 12:43:12  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:43:14  
To this editor, and, you know, like, the more complicated your process, the more you’re like.

[Andrew Muto] 12:43:20  
I’m not really in charge of this, right? Like, it’s… I can imagine, in my scenario, if I didn’t rely on only me for velvet, boy oh boy, that would be frustrating Um, so, um… I think… I think you’re on the right path in terms of figuring out

[Charlie Deist] 12:43:27  
Yeah. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:43:38  
What you need. It’s just a matter of, like, you know, trying to… as fast as possible, usually.

[Andrew Muto] 12:43:45  
Deploy different versions of this that you feel good about, that are also… You know, because the other thing is, like, you can make videos, say, I don’t… God, I really hope this video doesn’t take off, I don’t really like this video. And then it’s a shame. That’s where I was with Fantastic Daily, where it’s like.

[Andrew Muto] 12:43:58  
Oh, no, oh no, it’s the ghost stories that have taken off? Come on!

[Charlie Deist] 12:44:02  
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:44:03  
Um, and so it’s like, you want to make sure that, like, these are videos you really enjoy, because, um, you’re gonna be doing them a lot.

[Charlie Deist] 12:44:11  
Yeah. Yeah, I guess the idea of having someone kind of reliable, who could take a concept and put the edit together. Like, I’m not totally opposed to that, if it really… you know, but I think… What I take away is…

[Charlie Deist] 12:44:30  
I could try the, you know, try myself on a green screen. I might just, I might try that a little bit, a couple times, maybe with the Gen Z alcohol thing, maybe with something else.

[Charlie Deist] 12:44:39  
Um… The other… No, no, no, go ahead.

[Andrew Muto] 12:44:41  
And really… yeah, sorry to interrupt. I think the thing about the green screen is.

[Andrew Muto] 12:44:47  
Base and green screen likely won’t be enough. There’s a third component there that is… whether it is hook or gimmick.

[Charlie Deist] 12:44:52  
Yeah. Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:44:54  
And I think gimmick is a better way of describing it than hook.

[Andrew Muto] 12:44:58  
But, like, what’s the gimmick? And that’s where you kind of have to internalize either what is special about me?

[Andrew Muto] 12:45:06  
Or what am I prepared to do than most people wouldn’t do.

[Andrew Muto] 12:45:10  
And that’s a… that’s a sliding scale of, like… like that guy with the camera of, like, whispering and, like, telling you to come here.

[Andrew Muto] 12:45:16  
Like, he’s an actor, so he’s like, I wanted to, you know, he’s playing to his strengths of, let me be… let me be cute here.

[Andrew Muto] 12:45:23  
Um, and then the psychologist guy, he had… what’s special about him is his age, and For you, it’s like, you know, what… what are the things? Just the top of my head, the fact that you living on a homestead, right? Like, that’s…

[Andrew Muto] 12:45:36  
That there could be… not that you would become an influencer for OpenEd, but just in general, the idea that, like, that is something special that would inform your opinion on almost anything? Right? Like… That is a really unique lifestyle, right? Imagine, like, you replace that with, I’ve been a cowboy for 50 years. Like, I’m listening. I’m listening. If you’re a cowboy, and now you’re gonna talk about Apple, I guess I’m listening.

[Charlie Deist] 12:45:46  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:45:58  
Like, it’s cool. And so, like, what is special and cool about you?

[Andrew Muto] 12:46:03  
And then… like… Is that something you say? Is that something that you show?

[Charlie Deist] 12:46:09  
Right, right. Yeah, or, you know, is there a way… to crowdsource this within the company, the moms, the homeschool moms.

[Andrew Muto] 12:46:17  
Sure.

[Charlie Deist] 12:46:19  
Like, I think that what… Right, again, if it works, then I’m in trouble, because… if I have, like, a big stable of people that can share their iPhone footage.

[Charlie Deist] 12:46:31  
For example, and it’s cute, and it’s… aesthetic, whatever. Um… That could be replicable, and especially if the… kind of real content and gimmick of the video doesn’t necessarily depend on having something specific in the footage. The footage is just there to create the mood.

[Charlie Deist] 12:46:50  
Um, if it’s… If I need something more specific from the footage, maybe having one specific go-to person who has a little bit of the… the acting background. I mean, the format that’s kind of jumping out to me, if it works, and I’d have to test this, and maybe I can just

[Charlie Deist] 12:47:05  
Finish the reel that I’m working on to test it, but it’s like… Um, I can do, like, top 5 tools for X all day long, or things like that, because I’ve… I’ve been, you know, curating these pieces of content for the newsletter. I’ve got all kinds of curriculum databases and things like that.

[Charlie Deist] 12:47:22  
You know, I can get as niche or broad as… and I feel like that’s sort of the George Lucas thing of, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:47:29  
What people want. They kind of want these, like, quick, digestible videos where they maybe feel like They, um… you know, they got something of… They might not even act on it, but in what… like… I fall for it still, where it’s like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:47:45  
You know, top 5 AI tools, whatever, for… X, I don’t know. Um… And kind of with that frame of, like.

[Andrew Muto] 12:47:49  
Sure. Yeah, yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:47:54  
Finish your schooling faster, you know, um… I’m not sure. But how does that…

[Andrew Muto] 12:48:02  
Well, it does, it makes sense. I think what you’re describing, though, sounds like like, when we were talking before about the, hey, let’s find people in the company that are prepared to talk about something, and I think we spitballed, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:48:13  
Oh, right, right, right. Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:48:14  
Right? I think that’s its own content category. And what you… what you showed me a moment ago of, I have a topic that I want to expound on that is more… U2B slash infographic-y slash, you know, like, it’s not a personal…

[Andrew Muto] 12:48:31  
Experience. It is much more an education thing. That feels like its own content category.

[Andrew Muto] 12:48:37  
Right? That would require its own hook. And so this content category uses a hook, right? This content category uses an entirely different hook.

[Charlie Deist] 12:48:42  
Mm-hmm. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:48:45  
That you don’t need to use. The best would be… And what I’m jealous of on my account is that I really only have one really solid one.

[Andrew Muto] 12:48:52  
It would be great if you could build multiple pillars, right? So some days it is five things that you need to know. And then another day would be, like, this interesting historical fact.

[Charlie Deist] 12:48:55  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:49:05  
And something else would be, like, you know, news of the day.

[Charlie Deist] 12:49:08  
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:49:09  
Great, and it’s like, I have different methodologies to deliver each one. This one is green screen guy.

[Andrew Muto] 12:49:15  
And I… and let’s say I’m just spitballing, you’re a green screen guy. And this is, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:49:15  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:49:20  
Expert mom, and this is Faceless, right? This is something else.

[Andrew Muto] 12:49:24  
Like, that would be cool. Those… you’re chasing down these three things independently, or more, or less, you know, but each one of these could be its own thing. And then, theoretically.

[Charlie Deist] 12:49:32  
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:49:33  
Let’s say green screen guy took off. You could try green screen guy with 5 tips, or you can try Green Screen Guy with anything.

[Andrew Muto] 12:49:41  
Or, if the moms took off, or one specific mom took off, like, it’s… it’s just kind of subdividing up what you’re trying to do, and be like, what here is working?

[Andrew Muto] 12:49:50  
And it all doesn’t need to be the same if I have different things I want to talk about. Like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:49:51  
Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:49:56  
The historical education story that you had on your document a moment ago of just, like, here are all the different subjects.

[Andrew Muto] 12:50:04  
Right? Or different interesting… historical facts.

[Andrew Muto] 12:50:09  
That doesn’t need to be… the, um… UGC inside of the… organization style.

[Charlie Deist] 12:50:18  
Yeah. Two… two questions. One is, like, so… when I look at my weekly numbers analytics for, like, you know, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, okay, I see that we got, you know, 22 new YouTube followers.

[Charlie Deist] 12:50:33  
We got 50 new Instagram followers and 60 new Facebook followers, or something like that. And I’m, you know, like, those numbers are keeping me afloat, like, they’re getting me close to my… my KPIs for this quarter. Um, I’m banking on…

[Andrew Muto] 12:50:41  
Yep.

[Charlie Deist] 12:50:48  
Or I’m… like, I’m wanting to get that, uh, 10x growth at some point. You know, I’m not expecting it in the next month, or two months, or even the next you know, quarter or year, but at some point, I feel like I am going to find that

[Andrew Muto] 12:50:55  
Sure.

[Charlie Deist] 12:51:00  
I’m gonna hit it, and then I can use that for… I mean, that’s… That’s my sort of gold standard, and I think that this whole conversation points towards that. Um, at the level of, like, keeping things afloat, keeping the numbers kind of going up.

[Charlie Deist] 12:51:13  
Um, in that incremental way, if I wanted to see, okay, on Facebook, like, where are these new followers coming from?

[Charlie Deist] 12:51:20  
Um, I should know how to do that, but, like. Do you know, sort of, it’s somewhere in, like, metabusiness Suite, or on Instagram, maybe Instagram would be the…

[Andrew Muto] 12:51:24  
Yeah. That’s a good question. Like, where they are coming from is a question that I don’t know. You can see… traffic source per video.

[Charlie Deist] 12:51:36  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:51:36  
I’m not sure you can tell traffic source from followers. But you might be able to say video source. Let me just pop into my, um, Facebook app here real quick.

[Andrew Muto] 12:51:46  
Um, I don’t use the business suite, I just use Facebook’s professional dashboard, it’s called.

[Charlie Deist] 12:51:52  
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 12:51:53  
Um, let me see, insights here…

[Andrew Muto] 12:52:07  
I don’t see sources for followers.

[Charlie Deist] 12:52:10  
Yeah, it’s… right now, I don’t… I don’t either. I’ll look into that with ChatGBT a little bit. What I was gonna… get at was, um… This idea that, like, I think one of the reasons I was feeling over… a little overwhelmed this morning was, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:52:25  
I had written out an intention that this week, I’m gonna kind of define my procedure for taking a newsletter and then spinning that out into different social media posts. And by the nature of the newsletter is mostly text and image.

[Andrew Muto] 12:52:38  
Mm-hmm.

[Charlie Deist] 12:52:41  
Sometimes I’ll put a real embed a reel in the newsletter, but usually I’m going in the other direction of repurposing from the short form to the newsletter. So with this, I’m just kind of thinking, what are some easy post… like, I can post a link on Facebook

[Andrew Muto] 12:52:51  
Well, I think… I think I feel your pain, because I feel like I’ve been in your shoes before, where You’re trying to do a couple things at the same time. One is.

[Charlie Deist] 12:52:54  
With, you know, some kind of… engagement-type question. And, like, sometimes that stuff does okay, usually it doesn’t do Great, and it never goes gangbusters, but… Um… I feel like I attribute some of our growth on social media just to the fact that

[Charlie Deist] 12:53:14  
I’m kind of keeping things alive, and I don’t know when one might get 1,000 views and a dozen shares, or something like that.

[Charlie Deist] 12:53:22  
And, um… So, like.

[Charlie Deist] 12:53:27  
Do you think it’s worth it, in a sense? Like…

[Charlie Deist] 12:53:36  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:53:38  
I’m assuming somewhere in the organization, you were asked to deliver, like, KPIs. Like, what do you… what number are you gonna hit?

[Charlie Deist] 12:53:45  
Right. Right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:53:45  
And you had to toss a number out. And that number is based on what seems like reasonably possible, based on your current trajectory. Maybe there’s a little bit of math behind that, but kind of it is just really guessing.

[Charlie Deist] 12:53:57  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:53:57  
And so now you’ve got that number in your head. You’re also aware of the fact that, like, your method here, which is ideation and creation, is not solid, so we’re still kind of hunting for that.

[Andrew Muto] 12:54:09  
And then the thirdly, it is the process of just, like, when I wake up, like, I should know what I’m doing. I’m in control of my own destiny.

[Andrew Muto] 12:54:16  
Am I making short form? And, like, what is due today? Show me my schedule.

[Andrew Muto] 12:54:20  
I feel the pain on all of that. So, starting with one, the KPIs thing, and you might not be in a situation to do this, and I know we’re… you’ve already done this, but… I was asked for KPIs all the time at Hoover, and I would consistently push back.

[Andrew Muto] 12:54:34  
Of, like, guys, I’m not a… I’m not a fortune teller. What do you want me to say? I don’t… I don’t extrapolate into the future based on a kind of asymmetric growth over the course of a year. Like, I can see bumps all over, and I can see One month, I got 1,500 followers, and another month, we got 72,000.

[Charlie Deist] 12:54:51  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 12:54:52  
How am I supposed to project what’s gonna happen in the next month or the next 12 months? There’s no sense behind it, and… Um, all I can… all I can say to you is.

[Andrew Muto] 12:55:01  
Let me show you my everyday work and how we’re slaying ourselves to, like, push this forward.

[Andrew Muto] 12:55:05  
And I may… and inevitably, we dramatically would overshoot anything we ever would have guessed.

[Charlie Deist] 12:55:05  
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:55:11  
But KPIs are really tough in social media because people are asking to be lied to, really, about… and so that’s something that… I would always keep in the back of your mind, and I don’t know how much political capital one would have to spend to push back on that, and I wouldn’t ask you to kill yourself, but…

[Charlie Deist] 12:55:16  
Right, right, right.

[Charlie Deist] 12:55:23  
Yeah, in some sense, I might just kind of leave it alone, because at least this quarter, like, I’m coming in right about at what I forecast, just based on the secular growth.

[Andrew Muto] 12:55:29  
Yeah. Sure. So I think that’s a good place to be, that if you’re hitting it, then I would say put the KPIs aside, because it’s a really difficult thing to go after.

[Charlie Deist] 12:55:34  
Um.

[Andrew Muto] 12:55:41  
Right? You can… I think that you could say, like, am I up or down for the month? I mean, that’s a number that all these platforms give you. And that gives you a sense of, like, am I trending in the right direction?

[Charlie Deist] 12:55:41  
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 12:55:51  
Mm-hmm. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:55:52  
Um, but that’s all I would pay attention to, personally. Yeah, jumping to the third thing.

[Andrew Muto] 12:55:59  
It’s very difficult, because you said you woke up today and you wanted to try to work on on newsletter, and try to figure out, like, what am I doing for the newsletter, and how does that affect short form?

[Andrew Muto] 12:56:09  
I think all of this is kind of like, you’re still hunting for what works, and it’s very difficult to build process when you haven’t figured out what really works. The good news is.

[Andrew Muto] 12:56:24  
That you have found, like, micro-success, and that you’re doing great on that. Like, you’re showing up every day. And that’s, like, 80% of the battle.

[Andrew Muto] 12:56:32  
Now it is just a matter of, like, nose to the grindstone, trying to innovate every day, and something here is gonna work, and you’re like, oh shit, I can do that 50,000 times, no problem.

[Andrew Muto] 12:56:42  
That’s all you’re waiting on. So, you’re gonna hit your KPI numbers, assuming they weren’t extravagantly elevated.

[Andrew Muto] 12:56:48  
And you’re gonna keep on keeping on if you’re showing up every day publishing content. If you take your foot off that gas.

[Andrew Muto] 12:56:56  
I think that’s where things can be problematic. But I would say try to not build processes until you know what’s working.

[Andrew Muto] 12:57:04  
Because I’ve used this analogy before of McDonald’s, of you don’t… build an entire franchisee system.

[Andrew Muto] 12:57:15  
If you’re not already selling a billion cheeseburgers every day. If you’re selling a billion cheeseburgers every day.

[Andrew Muto] 12:57:21  
You build a process to keep that happening. If people love your cheeseburgers, you want to make sure you’re building them at a reasonable schedule. But if no one wants your cheeseburgers.

[Andrew Muto] 12:57:32  
You don’t build a process in which to build more cheeseburgers people don’t want.

[Andrew Muto] 12:57:37  
And that was something that I struggled with, too, that somehow it feels like process is what informs success. And in the creative space, that’s almost never true.

[Andrew Muto] 12:57:47  
In… in a manufacturing space, maybe, but, um… what you want to do is find out what works, and then build a process around that, that you can make that as often as possible.

[Charlie Deist] 12:57:54  
Yeah. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:58:01  
And so I would try to be as loosey-goosey until you can figure it out, because, like, maybe you discover short form does power the news… the newsletter, and that’s what makes the newsletter take off, or vice versa, that the…

[Andrew Muto] 12:58:13  
The other way to look at, or an additional thing to mention, is you don’t need the newsletter to get you Instagram traffic, or social media traffic, because that’s what the algo’s supposed to do for you. That’s the genius So, really, it should only be in the other direction, likely.

[Charlie Deist] 12:58:20  
No. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 12:58:30  
And you probably get way more data with short form, and you can pump it out quicker, that, like, make as much short-form content as possible to inform what does and does not work.

[Andrew Muto] 12:58:41  
Try to get a pulse on the audience.

[Charlie Deist] 12:58:43  
Yeah, I guess I’m just thinking, like, let’s say that I had tried to repurpose that Gen Z image into a still image. Like, just put, you know, I put it on branded background or something like that, or even lower-fi. I literally just post, like, a cropped version of that

[Andrew Muto] 12:58:56  
Sure.

[Charlie Deist] 12:59:00  
This kind of fits the dimensions, and then I have a little bit of the caption.

[Charlie Deist] 12:59:03  
Uh, and I do that consistently with one piece of content from the newsletter.

[Charlie Deist] 12:59:08  
That’s visual every, every day. And then in other cases, if there’s a really, really awesome quote that just hits, like, a, you know, heavy-hitting one-liner kind of thing.

[Charlie Deist] 12:59:17  
Um, again, I put that into our Canva template. And it just goes up, because when I look at our… Instagram, when I look at our feed of other people, I’ll share my screen again one more time really quick.

[Charlie Deist] 12:59:29  
A lot of what I see are this style of post, um… like, like, okay, this a little bit, um… this a little… well, these are carousels And my read is that, for one, carousels are primarily getting shown to your own audience. They’re not as good for

[Andrew Muto] 12:59:46  
Yes.

[Charlie Deist] 12:59:47  
Getting shown to others. So until we have, like, a really big audience, the data’s gonna be somewhat limited.

[Charlie Deist] 12:59:54  
Um, you know, here’s another one, uh… Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 12:59:56  
I think even with a big audience, the expectation is for sub-20% of people to see your carousel, or photo.

[Charlie Deist] 13:00:03  
Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:00:04  
At any scale, so you have a million followers, only 20% are gonna see them, likely.

[Charlie Deist] 13:00:08  
Right, right. Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 13:00:10  
The other thing I would say about this experience is. This isn’t how I would recommend consuming Instagram. I would say that I would pop into reels on your phone, or I guess you’re… I never do it on the web, but you could…

[Charlie Deist] 13:00:21  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:00:23  
And consume it this way. Because… Sure.

[Charlie Deist] 13:00:26  
The only thing is, this is… this is all about social media for some reason.

[Charlie Deist] 13:00:30  
Which is still maybe not bad, it’s still probably… I can extrapolate a lot from that.

[Andrew Muto] 13:00:32  
Well, the only thing right now, the only thing you’re trying to suck up is tactic.

[Andrew Muto] 13:00:37  
So, ignore the content. Pretend the content’s just blank, and it’s like, oh, somebody does a thing where they turn to the camera and say a word just started, or… bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, text. Okay, that… I’m stealing tactics.

[Charlie Deist] 13:00:38  
Right, right, right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:00:52  
And you could apply this to recipes, or open ed, or whatever.

[Charlie Deist] 13:00:52  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:00:56  
Um, but that’s what you’re hunting for. Just hunt for tactics.

[Andrew Muto] 13:01:00  
When you’re scrolling through this. And this takes the noise out of carousels and images.

[Charlie Deist] 13:01:00  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:01:06  
Because those are not, like, a really sustainable long-term tactic right now.

[Charlie Deist] 13:01:08  
Yeah. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:01:13  
Or short-term tech. Um.

[Charlie Deist] 13:01:14  
Yeah, so, I mean, in some sense, like, you know, maybe just keep it level, but don’t, um, with the posting on the platforms, those other formats, but… uh, don’t invest in building out too much of an advanced system for it until I…

[Charlie Deist] 13:01:29  
Figure out what works.

[Andrew Muto] 13:01:30  
Personally, I think that’s how I would do it. I think different… this comes down to how different people work.

[Andrew Muto] 13:01:35  
Um, and I like structure. But I don’t want the structure to dictate my innovation ability, right? So, on Instagram, I am, like, locked in on how I do it.

[Andrew Muto] 13:01:47  
On YouTube, I’m like, I don’t know. On YouTube, I’m, like, still trying to, like, be very malleable from even camera systems to… schedules, because I haven’t figured out what works yet.

[Charlie Deist] 13:01:55  
Right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:01:59  
And if I were to figure out, like, oh, this type of review always works with this thumbnail.

[Andrew Muto] 13:02:06  
Then I’d build incredible time management systems around that, of like, alright, this is how I generate that thumbnail, I’m gonna make, like, a… Like, it crossed my mind the other day, I was like, oh man, I don’t have a bunch of, like, good photos of me

[Andrew Muto] 13:02:19  
Like, doing this for thumbnails, right? Like, all the stuff, like, angry, and, like, happy, and, like, I was like, you know, I should probably suit up and, like, shoot a bunch of those, I’ll get the white background, I’ll kind of make… and I was like, wait, what the fuck am I doing?

[Charlie Deist] 13:02:23  
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:02:30  
I don’t even know if that’ll work yet. I shouldn’t suit up for that. That’s a… that’s a 4-hour time suck.

[Charlie Deist] 13:02:31  
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:02:34  
I need to prove out on one of them, maybe, that, like, this is even necessary before I build that process. Um… That’s how I think of it personally, because otherwise, you’ll build all these processes that support the creation of a product that no one wants.

[Charlie Deist] 13:02:50  
Right, right. No, that makes… that makes perfect sense. Um, and I mean, like, X is a perfect example of just, like, I have a theory, but I haven’t been able to crack the the nut of X in any way, like, and when I look at my content on X, I cringe, so…

[Andrew Muto] 13:02:55  
Um.

[Charlie Deist] 13:03:07  
It’s no surprise that, uh, others are not exactly flocking to retweet it.

[Andrew Muto] 13:03:12  
But I, I mean, I think you’re… what you said about the under… the Gen Z drinking really resonated with me, because I feel like that is the problem I felt like I had with Delvin.

[Andrew Muto] 13:03:24  
I was like, I know how to take street photos. I know that that video… short-form video content is what works on social media. How do I square that circle?

[Charlie Deist] 13:03:34  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:03:36  
And then it was like, okay, wait, maybe POV content. But how does… how do I wear it? And then I tried a bunch of things, and none of it felt right. It felt really laborious, and I was like, this is a fucking nightmare.

[Charlie Deist] 13:03:45  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:03:48  
And I really… you know, because I started thinking, well, maybe it’s not POV content, maybe… and I had all these… maybe… and you could scroll all the way back and kind of see some of the nonsense I was trying.

[Andrew Muto] 13:03:58  
And, um… I think that’s the journey of, like, you need to throw a lot of noodles at the wall.

[Andrew Muto] 13:04:05  
Um, consciously. Of, like, I’m trying this out, I’m trying out Talking Podcast Head Guy.

[Charlie Deist] 13:04:12  
I can do Talking Pothead Guy.

[Andrew Muto] 13:04:12  
I’m trying. You know, I’m trying the caption thing, right? And if you want to make your life easy, do your ver- shoot it with you first.

[Charlie Deist] 13:04:21  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:04:24  
Right? Like, you know, it’ll take you 4 seconds to be like, meh, meh, you know, like… And then at least you can try it.

[Charlie Deist] 13:04:30  
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:04:34  
Um. There may be… there, you know… Well, I was gonna… I was about to say, there might be something to… men talking to women.

[Andrew Muto] 13:04:45  
Like, like, an engaged male parent. Talking to women, where women often may feel as though they are the ones in charge of the education and the the children and stuff. Why wouldn’t it be great to have a guy helping support like this? Like, there… I can see some magic there. Like, my wife’s complaint is I’m not as involved in the…

[Andrew Muto] 13:05:03  
You know, the parent-teacher conferences, as much as I’m sure she would like, and so if a man was talking, she’d be like, see this fucking guy, why can’t my husband be like this? Like, sometimes that’s enough, right? Like, sometimes that’s like, oh, that’s the guy that’s super helpful, and… Um, you know, women flock to that, theoretically.

[Charlie Deist] 13:05:18  
Right, right. Yeah. Okay, well, uh, once again, I’ve got a lot to chew on here.

[Charlie Deist] 13:05:29  
And I… Wrote down some notes for my to-dos, but I’m gonna have to go through the transcript again and pull out I’ve got some ideas, but yeah, thinking about the gimmick, thinking in terms of the gimmick first.

[Andrew Muto] 13:05:42  
Yeah, and I know we… it does… I know you do have a lot on your plate, because, like, you’re… you’re actually trying to keep all these boats afloat with what you’ve been doing, right? Of, like, newsletter, YouTube video, podcast, short form.

[Andrew Muto] 13:05:53  
All that makes sense. And you’re gonna have to keep that going, while also finding time to innovate on something new.

[Andrew Muto] 13:06:00  
Kind of R&D, theoretically. And maybe the R&D overlaps with some of the short form. You’re like, well, no one you know, you’re in charge, so you can decide. Maybe… all the stuff I post this week will all be R&D, or next week, let’s say.

[Charlie Deist] 13:06:01  
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 13:06:13  
But I would try to be deliberate about, like, alright, this is what I’m trying.

[Andrew Muto] 13:06:17  
This week, and… and keep your aspirations smaller. You don’t have to do all these options, right?

[Andrew Muto] 13:06:24  
Figure out, like, what am I gonna tackle this week? I’m gonna tackle green screen guy.

[Andrew Muto] 13:06:28  
Cool. Or, I’m gonna tackle this, and I’m gonna do, like, 5 variations on this.

[Charlie Deist] 13:06:28  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 13:06:33  
And try… like, pick your battles, and then deploy it, and then see what happens. As opposed to… trying to do a little bit of everything, and the data will come in so slowly, where it’s like, well, I guess let’s just do this for a couple weeks, and then see…

[Charlie Deist] 13:06:34  
Right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:06:45  
What happens? If you can do this, you know, over the course of a week or more on one idea, we can look and evaluate, is any of this working?

[Charlie Deist] 13:06:53  
Yep. Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 13:06:58  
Sounds good, sounds like a plan.

[Andrew Muto] 13:06:58  
That’d be my advice. Yeah. Yeah, man. Um, and, um, you have the other invite for Friday.

[Andrew Muto] 13:07:05  
Same time. Um, and yeah… No, no problem, no problem at all. Yeah, um, and hopefully this is getting you in the right direction. I… but I can… if ever you’re feeling like you’re off the reservation, one, I’m always around if you want to chat.

[Charlie Deist] 13:07:06  
Perfect. Yeah, we can do… we can do… keep it short, but, um, yeah, appreciate this. This is… this has been great.

[Andrew Muto] 13:07:20  
Just ping me, be like, hey, can I get a couple minutes? I… you can just use me as a whiteboard of… chatting it through. But two, this is the process.

[Andrew Muto] 13:07:29  
You’re not off the reservation by, like, I’ve got a lot I’m chewing on, I want to try this, but it feels like I’m overwhelmed, there’s so many things floating around.

[Andrew Muto] 13:07:37  
This is that creative process, and sometimes it feels hectic, and sometimes it’s like I’m staring at a wall, I’m like, I just don’t have anything good right now.

[Charlie Deist] 13:07:44  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:07:44  
And that is what it’s like that I… I’ve… done this many times in my life, where it’s like, even though I’m successful, quote-unquote.

[Andrew Muto] 13:07:53  
There’s still a lot of, like, oh my god, there’s so much… my mind is going a million miles a minute, and, like.

[Andrew Muto] 13:07:59  
That’s not bad. I would say that’s just part of the experience of… trying to find the solution to a creative problem.

[Charlie Deist] 13:08:09  
Yeah, yeah. Well, that, that’s comforting.

[Andrew Muto] 13:08:15  
Yeah, yeah. I would embrace it, I guess. What I see… what I saw on the corporate side was that people would either be a part of this process who are not creative, and they would start to panic.

[Andrew Muto] 13:08:26  
And try to apply, like, business leadership shit to it, of like, we’re just gonna do this! And it’s like, well, that’s not even how it works.

[Andrew Muto] 13:08:33  
I wish it’d be that easy to just dictate. It is. You kind of have to be this weird, soft sponge until something works, and then… sharpen up to, like, we’re doing that now, because that worked. That worked really well, and now I’m gonna triple down, and I’m not gonna sleep, and I’m gonna make 15,000 of these videos.

[Charlie Deist] 13:08:35  
Right, right, right.

[Charlie Deist] 13:08:45  
Yep. Yep.

[Charlie Deist] 13:08:50  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 13:08:51  
But until then, you’re kind of like, I don’t know, maybe it’s this, maybe it’s a little bit of that. You’re making these micro-differences that maybe only you can see.

[Andrew Muto] 13:08:58  
And until finally, it’s like, oh… like, my wife wouldn’t have known the difference between a POV camera on my chest or a POV camera on my eyes, but to me, I was like, I know the very specific difference between those two things, and I’m trying to get a very specific type of reaction in a video.

[Andrew Muto] 13:09:13  
And, like, it’s all that micro-nuance that you kind of just have to fuck with until, like, you’re like, oh, this is working.

[Charlie Deist] 13:09:20  
Right, right. Yeah, I love that analogy, the sponge.

[Andrew Muto] 13:09:27  
Yeah, just be very okay with not having an answer about some of this stuff. This is what the process feels like.

[Charlie Deist] 13:09:27  
The sponge, and then…

[Andrew Muto] 13:09:32  
It can be stressful inside of an environment where there are leaders who are used to clear-cut black and white answers.

[Andrew Muto] 13:09:40  
And if any of those… if you’re feeling stressed of any of that, I’m happy to talk that through, too, at some point. But, like.

[Andrew Muto] 13:09:45  
I would say try to just, like, it’s okay that you’re sorting this out.

[Andrew Muto] 13:09:48  
And just keep trying, but just try to be diligent about, like, I’m gonna try just one thing at a time.

[Andrew Muto] 13:09:54  
You know, as opposed to, like, I’m gonna do a bunch of different stuff, and, like, it’s gonna be…

[Charlie Deist] 13:09:58  
Right, right. All right, onward.

[Andrew Muto] 13:10:03  
Cool? Yeah, man. All right, buddy, um, I hope you have a good week. Let me know, I’m always around. If anything comes up, just, um, ping me, and I’ll hop on a call.

[Charlie Deist] 13:10:12  
Sounds good. Thanks again

  

  

Here are the key points about titles and thumbnails from the discussion:

- The title and thumbnail work together as a combination - they should complement each other rather than repeat the same information
- The thumbnail should offer something extra beyond what's in the title. For example, a title about "6 months with Ray-Ban Smart Glasses" paired with a thumbnail suggesting "It has one problem" creates intrigue
- Target click-through rate metrics:
    - Below 4% is considered low
    - 4-6% is the ideal range
    - Above 6% is excellent performance

For poorly performing videos, the first thing to evaluate is the click-through rate. If it's below 4%, try changing the title and thumbnail to improve performance.

Remember that low view counts are usually due to poor "packaging" (title/thumbnail) rather than poor video content.

---

## Section 1: Titles + Thumbnails – Psychology and Mechanics

**CTR Benchmarks (reconfirmed):**

- **< 4%** → Poor performance
- **4–6%** → Solid baseline
- **6%+** → Excellent

### Best Practices:

- **Thumbnail + Title must complement**, not duplicate
- Use thumbnails to inject tension, curiosity, or promise
    - Example:
        - **Title**: "6 Months with Ray-Ban Meta Glasses"
        - **Thumbnail**: "It has one problem"
- Thumbnail layout: **Text should be on left** to avoid UI overlay
- Avoid excessive negativity unless balanced with an insight payoff

### Evaluation Process:

- If CTR < 4%, change thumbnail/title combo
- A/B test with YouTube’s native tools (results take weeks)
- Fix the packaging first before assuming content is the problem

---

## Section 2: Long Form vs Short Form Strategy

### Long-Form Challenges:

- High barrier to entry
- Slower growth curve
- Demands narrative cohesion and pacing over 10+ minutes
- Not ideal for high-output, low-friction experimentation

### Short-Form Advantages:

- More publishing opportunities → more shots on goal
- Easier to test different formats, hooks, visuals
- Best for R&D, idea validation, and building momentum
- Allows low-cost iteration until a breakout video hits

### Strategic Takeaway:

> "Short form is the R&D lab. Long form is the product line—only if it’s proven."

---

## Section 3: Finding Hooks & Gimmicks

**Key Distinction:** Hook = concept; Gimmick = delivery mechanism or repeatable device

### Examples:

- "I’m an 85-year-old clinical psychologist…"
- "Come here…" zoom-in POV
- Talking head + green screen with dramatic gesture

**Best Practice:** Identify what’s uniquely _you_ (e.g., homestead dad, curriculum curator) and lean into that as the starting gimmick.

---

## Section 4: Production Methodology

### Constraints:

- Must be sustainable
- Avoid over-engineering before proving the format

### Tactics:

- Use talking head + green screen to test low-lift concepts
- Crowdsource or delegate footage for B-roll (from team or moms)
- Create voiceover + screencap explainers (e.g., "Top 5 Tools for Homeschool")
- Test fridge magnet quotes as motion graphics with light AI support

### R&D Mindset:

- Pick **1 experimental style per week**
- Publish **5 variations** (minimum viable test)
- Use CTR + retention as validation metrics

---

## Section 5: Repurposing from Newsletter

- Identify heavy-hitting quotes and visuals from newsletter drafts
- Format as:
    - Quote graphics
    - Short form video w/voiceover or text overlay
    - Still-image posts for Facebook
- Use short-form performance to inform what to highlight in future newsletters

---

## Section 6: Creative Process = Sponge → Blade

> Phase 1: Sponge mode (explore, imitate, experiment)
> 
> **Phase 2:** Blade mode (cut what doesn’t work, scale what does)

Stay soft and flexible during discovery; harden systems only after validating success.

---

## Section 7: Platform Insights

- Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YT Shorts still favor _native short-form video_ over static content
- Carousels and images reach mostly existing followers, not new ones
- Facebook is ideal for fridge magnet or quote-style reels

---

## Final Takeaways

- CTR = packaging. Start there.
- Don’t prematurely systematize unproven formats
- Short-form is the proving ground
- One good gimmick can be worth more than a thousand ideas
- Be deliberate, test one style at a time, and track results
