Summary

This meeting focused on developing a content strategy for podcasts with emphasis on generating shareable short-form video clips to build audience on social media platforms.

### Content Strategy Overview

The central audience-building approach involves creating "fire clips" that algorithms will serve to wider audiences. Effective content includes rants, soundbites, emotional moments, and polarizing statements (within comfortable boundaries). A standard operating procedure will include brainstorming YouTube titles and thumbnails before recording episodes.

### Upcoming Podcast Guests

**Corey DeAngelis (Open Ed podcast)**

- Author of "The Parent Revolution"
- Described as a "firebrand" in the school choice debate
- Potentially controversial due to positions on teachers unions and political affiliations
- Has 211,000 followers on X, presenting an opportunity for increased visibility
- Need to steer conversation away from explicitly political framing while still addressing educational issues

**Daryl Stinson**

- Mental health for high performers
- TED speaker focusing on anxiety and depression
- Opportunity for hooks around what separates top performers from others

### Content Creation Approach

The team discussed creating templates and frameworks for podcast hosts, including:

- Potential hooks and questions that generate compelling soundbites
- YouTube title and thumbnail combinations that attract viewers
- Ways to frame conversations that align with the podcast's identity
- Using tools like Windsurf to organize content planning

### Action Items

- [ ] Create a document with talking points for hosts before the DeAngelis interview
- [ ] Develop hooks and questions for Stinson about high performance (e.g., "What separates the top 1% of performers?")
- [ ] Generate YouTube title and thumbnail ideas for upcoming episodes
- [ ] Share the Open Ed identity framework to help hosts navigate potentially controversial topics
- [ ] Prepare visually compelling moments for thumbnails (like Stinson holding up one finger for "the one thing")

Notes  

  

Transcript  

separate from the zoom call. Okay, we're good on that front. But yeah, I gave I gave some preliminary instructions to all the podcast hosts. And I can share what I told you, and we can use that as kind of the jumping off point. Yeah. I told them, let's see, I created this Slack channel.

  

Okay.

Big one is thinking about each episode largely as an opportunity to generate fire clips. This is central to my audience building strategy on the short form video platforms. These platforms will serve up our content to a wider audience algorithmically if we serve them the best content on a topic.

In our case, homeschooling, personalized learning, etc. Could be broader than this. But what works? Rants, soundbites, emotion, polarizing statements. I meant to say within the boundaries, but I said without the boundaries of what you feel comfortable with. I should probably correct that. Same goes for your guests, although I'll leave it up to you whether how you communicate that to them. Another practice I want to build into our standard operating procedures is to brainstorm one to three YouTube titles and thumbnails before we record the episode.

And I never followed up on this but for example practical how-tos with a certain number of pieces of advice not meant to constrain but Anyway, so that's yeah, that's what I told them Okay, great. So do you have a sense, do you know what podcast is coming up next? Yeah, I should. And who's on it? Yeah, I've got a calendar.

for that. Let's see Open Ed podcast. I think take all these off and now. Okay, so like, here's a good example. This is kind of funny. This is kind of, uh, I'm realizing you actually, do you know, Corey, do you know who this is by any chance? Corey DeAngelis. You guys have a bit of a, an uncanny resemblance.

Oh, that's funny. I'm always still looking at your Slack screen. Oh, okay. Okay. Hold on a second. This is sort of funny. I'm just realizing that you guys kind of look alike. I know that it can be a weird thing when people say you look like someone and you're like, I look nothing like that guy, but yeah.

No, I, uh, I'm not familiar. This is the guy who's next time. Okay. And so, and he is a, he's a real, um, firebrand, like his, his recent book. I think it had a blurb from Donald Trump, and he's gotten into the school choice debate and really stirred the pot. He's kind of a controversial figure because he really has taken on the teachers unions head-on.

And this is kind of a tricky one for us because we try to sort of steer clear of the politics of the school choice debate. And he's like right in the thick of that. Very much like a kind of libertarian, conservative influencer. Yeah. So do you guys have like.

Any kind of talking points already around this episode? Is there any like collateral that already exists that your hosts would go off of? That's a good question. Let me check what I've been trying to set up, although no one is... taking me up on it yet. I want it so that when the guest books, they give us like, all of that, like what they want us to specifically talk about.

In this case, I would say his most recent book, I don't know if that's going to be the topic. For this one really quick.

Any more details on that? I don't think that I have a whole lot of context. I mean, I can kind of tell you what the contour is of it. are going to be probably.

I mean, it's like the rise of the rise of educational choice.

kind of the sudden shift in opinion, I would guess, from like where 10 years ago This was still like a fairly fringe libertarian position to now where, you know, every other state has passed some kind of education savings account. Is that what you mean by collateral? Or do you mean more so? Yeah, I mean, well, I guess like, I wonder if I didn't know if there was like a central document or any document that like, say, the host would

Here's some questions or here's some topics or even the structure of the show, or are they literally just winging it? That's a good question. Yeah, I think... Actually, let me check one other there's one other channel where there's been some conversation recently. Hold on one second.

  

  

This got put on the, we have like an intern who's now managing A lot of these podcasts and I'm glad you asked about this because we do we need to get one of these to the host beforehand. And I don't think so. So I don't think I think we're kind of building it from scratch.

Got it. OK, just trying to get myself up to speed here on.

like there was a the the link that led well no that doesn't really

Yeah, what I would probably do is like I would send him a series of articles like a kind of a book summary, certain highlights of particularly snappy lines or like things that kind of align with with the open education message, ways for him to sort of steer things onto a less controversial track. Yeah.

I shouldn't say less controversial because it's still like we can be radical on this podcast. We just want to take it a little bit out of the framing of public versus Public versus private or like public versus homeschool sort of got it. Yeah.

  

Kind of think of like...

Just even questions to queue up his take.

It, you know, the first thing that comes to mind is like,

The number one thing wrong with public schooling, or American school systems, or something like that. Right, right. That might be, you know, that's a good soundbite. And I'm assuming this guy can deliver, given his pedigree. For sure. For sure. Yeah. Like, we don't really want to, I don't know, we don't want to get too much into teachers' unions, probably, I don't think. Okay. And the political stuff holds no value, right?

That's just.

Yeah, I mean, we kind of we picked a we picked a difficult one as the test case, which maybe is a good thing. Because it's also a lot more upside. Like if he, you know, he's got 211,000 followers on on X and we're really trying to like I've been trying to kind of get a little bit more attention on X for a long time so I'm going to want to push this in a way that he'll be proud to promote it. And Randy Weingarten happens to be

In the news right now, she's she was the president of the teachers union. And I guess she got like, I think she got like kicked out of the Democratic Party or something. Future of the Department of Education, like we could do something around that. The future of the Department of Education and the school choice movement, he's

But I think I, I think I sort of already see where you're angling. Is the parent revolution his? Okay, because the parent revolution is an interesting idea.

You know, that's the name of his book, but an audience on social media might not know that.

The parent revolution is here, you know, or the parent revolution has started and then like that, you know, then a soundbite of like what he believes that even is, and I'm sure he's got that on lock given his book. Right, like what does that even mean in two sentences. Right, right. And it's funny because now I'm remembering that I think I did.

create some notes on this a while back because I read this book. It'll be easy for me to come up with these. Um, the takeaway is I'm just trying to see if I can find that document anywhere. Maybe I don't have it.

Um, let's see, do you want to, do you want to keep on digging into this one? Or could we maybe take another example of another guest on the podcast? Yeah, we, yeah, we can take, we can take another, we can take another. Alright, next one is Daryl Stinson, and again I'm gonna have to kind of check out...

What has been said so far, not a whole lot. Daryl Stinson. I'm gonna, let me just share my whole screen here. Am I sharing? No, I'm not sharing the whole screen. No, no.

Okay, so here's Daryl Stinson, mental health for high performers. So he's kind of in a different vertical. He's not He's like a Ted Ted speaker that, yeah.

  

I don't exactly know what the angle is going to be for this one yet. Anxiety and depression. Well, but you know, I think, I think we, as the, let's call it storyteller, or at least producer of it, We're in the same boat as the audience. Why is this guy valuable? And just off the surface, the idea that he's about.

the number one thing you should do to level up your performance. It's questions like that.

What's the big red flag that you notice in someone that indicates they're not a high performer? You know, it's those type of things. And then you can imagine...

The video title being something like...

All, all high performers do this one thing. And then if you're lucky, maybe you get a video clip of him in the podcast, where he's holding up one finger, you know, right, right. So in that you can imagine, like the kind of assets we're trying to get, but let's say we spitball that and we have like a

half page document of like, here's a couple cues of like, hit him with these questions, right? And then even in this case, we'd love this image of him being like one. And then that's a thumbnail, and we might generate some other ideas like maybe let's say he's got a book let's say the other guy.

They're not nouns, but they're like bullet points of things. Let's get all this stuff tangibly. Right, right. Yeah.

Okay, so this is just applying a lens to a topic.

Again, we're leaning on some of these formats. I think of them as frameworks, templates. And I've got my, you know, short list of.

YouTube title and thumbnail combinations now that kind of functions as a set of adjunct instructions. And so what I might do, like if we're imagining that I'm actually doing this, I won't hide the fact that I think that this is probably how I would approach it.

And by the way, this is a A new tool that I've been using in lieu of the traditional interface with the large language model. It's kind of like a layer on top, but this is Windsurf. You might have heard of like Cursor or Windsurf. They're pretty much the same apps, but they're designed for programmers and you've got like your code base over here normally.

a chat window that has agent mode or in Windsurf, it's called write mode, but it's like this kind of cascade thing where you can just, you can talk to it and it'll do the coding for you. It'll update your documents. Vibe coding. Vibe coding, exactly. So this is Vibe marketing here. And instead of my code, I've just got...

Folders with different projects and documents. So I've got my frameworks folder here, the podcast wizard, which has all my different things like the YouTube title and thumbnail framework that, that this is basically based on conversations that we've had in the past.

And I can just start a new. And I would say something like, okay, here's, um, context. That's a YouTube transcript of the parent revolution. And I'm just going to say, Corey DeAngelis is going to be a guest on the open ed podcast. Uh, we're looking to design the title and sort of stage some soundbites in the podcast and come up with,

A list of ideas for the host and guest to have at the top of their mind. And then I'll tag the YouTube title and thumbnail framework. This document contains sort of the formulas for YouTube titles. And then I'm also going to tag the OpenEd identity document. Let's see. Identity framework. This document contains the perspective of OpenEd. A few of the landmines we want to watch out for are getting too explicitly political or anti-political.

But it's still fair game to speak more broadly about, you know, the problems with traditional school. So now let's kind of refresh like what were what were some of your suggestions earlier? Um, the number one or like the, what was it? Uh, yeah, I mean, like, I think I spit balled some stuff like, um, you know, what's the one red flag that you would notice in anybody indicating they're not a high performer.

But I just did something similar in chat GPT, but it's something really basic, like, give me 10 give me 10 hooks to ask a high performance coach on a podcast. Yeah. And from that I got I got 10 solid ones here. I can drop them in the chat. Yeah, go for it.

And that's for the, that's for Daryl Stinson. I want to come, I'm going to come back to. There you go. I mean, like, you know, what separates the top 1% of performers from everybody else? And can it actually be taught? So, like, I think at least the first half of that is probably a solid short-form hook-on. Right, right, right. Is high performance about mindset, habits, or environment?

And so you can imagine a hook there being something like high performance is about this one thing, right? What's something most people would be shocked to learn about high about elite performers. Right. Let's say someone wants to radically level up in 90 days what step one, what's the one thing you should do.

to level up in 90 days. Or level up in 90 days with this one trick, or this one tip. Right, right, right.
