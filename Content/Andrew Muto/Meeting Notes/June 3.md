## Transcript

[Andrew Muto] 10:12:47  
If you have low view numbers, it's almost always because you couldn't get the click, not because the content was wrong. So I think about this with myself, like, anything under my follower count.

[Charlie Deist] 10:12:54  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:12:59  
I just assume is poor packaging, not poor video. But we can dig into that video. If you click into the analytics on that video, um, do you mind… we can take a look. I pulled up the one you just published here, too.

[Charlie Deist] 10:13:06  
Yeah, let me see. Yeah, sure. Um…

[Andrew Muto] 10:13:12  
We could help with that in a sec. Uh…

[Charlie Deist] 10:13:13  
It does… it's higher retention than the average video. I did see that.

[Charlie Deist] 10:13:18  
Um, and I can go… I'll go to the analytics on this one.

[Andrew Muto] 10:13:19  
Yeah, the analytics, yeah, right there, there we go. Um… So let's go to Reach.

[Andrew Muto] 10:13:28  
So click-through rate's 2.8%. So that's a pretty low click-through rate.

[Charlie Deist] 10:13:33  
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:13:33  
Ideally, it's in between, like, 4 and 6. Um.

[Charlie Deist] 10:13:38  
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:13:41  
At above 6 is like, whoa, okay, great. So, like, my videos that have done better in the, you know.

[Andrew Muto] 10:13:49  
10,000 view and up. Those have, like, a 7% to 8% click-through rate, but videos that are, like, just my talking vlogs, and, like, I didn't try super hard, sometimes those are in the 2-4% range.

[Charlie Deist] 10:13:54  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:14:02  
So, I would always try to get Um, because, like, so you… it got served to 10,000 people.

[Charlie Deist] 10:14:03  
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:14:09  
Right? And only 2.8% of those people decided to click. And that's what you… that's your opportunity. That if you could get that number higher, so… Click-through rate is always a part of the title, thumbnail combination.

[Charlie Deist] 10:14:10  
Right. Mm-hmm.

[Charlie Deist] 10:14:17  
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:14:26  
And that's where I would go first, that…

[Charlie Deist] 10:14:26  
Right, right. I mean, this thumbnail, looking at this thumbnail, this stinks on multiple levels. It's very vague, you have no idea what this video is about just from looking at the thumbnail, like…

[Andrew Muto] 10:14:35  
Yeah, and this is an incredible art of, like, how do you make a thumbnail fantastic? You could… you could spend an entire career just doing this, as opposed to saying, hey, I'm a filmmaker. It's like, no, no, I'm just gonna concentrate on video editing.

[Charlie Deist] 10:14:42  
Yeah. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:14:48  
And it's like, okay, so you're not a filmmaker, you're just a video editor. It's like, yeah, that's all I think about is video editing. Thumbnail design is the same thing, where creators are expected to, like, do it all.

[Charlie Deist] 10:14:53  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:14:58  
And the reality is, thumbnail is, like, a real serious thing. Let's go into engagement, too, real quick.

[Charlie Deist] 10:15:03  
Okay, this… well, now I just switched over to a different video.

[Andrew Muto] 10:15:06  
Oh, got it, got it, got it, okay. I mean, it's probably too early for this, but go back to reach real quick, then.

[Charlie Deist] 10:15:08  
Um, this… this is the most recent podcast where

[Andrew Muto] 10:15:16  
So it's probably too early. Um, this was published when? Yesterday?

[Charlie Deist] 10:15:21  
Yesterday at, like, 10 a.m. 9 a.m.

[Andrew Muto] 10:15:22  
Yeah… Yeah, I mean, it is… you still would expect to be higher, um… Let me just look at mine real quick.

[Andrew Muto] 10:15:34  
I obsess over the click-through numbers often, um, because… because I really feel like that's how I can win.

[Charlie Deist] 10:15:38  
Uh-huh.

[Andrew Muto] 10:15:43  
Um, alright, so analytics… So I'm at 4% on my recent long-form video that I uploaded.

[Charlie Deist] 10:15:52  
Okay. Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:15:52  
And… and that's not… that's okay-ish. That's like, alright. I'm really on the far edge there.

[Andrew Muto] 10:16:00  
And then another video that did recently… I published it last week, it's a gear review video.

[Charlie Deist] 10:16:09  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:16:09  
And the click-through rate is 6.9%. It's like, okay, rock and roll. That guy, that guy's on rails. That's gonna… I'm gonna get some serious views on that over a long enough timeline.

[Charlie Deist] 10:16:16  
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:16:20  
And it's already at 7,000 views. Um, so I would really concentrate on that click-through rate.

[Charlie Deist] 10:16:23  
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:16:28  
And that is entirely around… title and thumbnail.

[Charlie Deist] 10:16:33  
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:16:33  
Um, I was just watching some videos about thumbnail design. I should send these videos to you. I think you'd really enjoy them. They're… yeah, they are really about… kind of like the… the psychology of what you're trying to do with a thumbnail, and then it's con… it's, like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:16:49  
It's working in combination to the title. So, like, you read the title, and then the thumbnail is offering you a little extra. Like, I'm working on a video right now, it's like.

[Charlie Deist] 10:16:53  
Hmm. Okay. Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:16:58  
6 months with the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses. And then my thumbnail is gonna be, like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:05  
It has one problem. And it's like, okay, shit, so what's the problem after 6 months? Like, those two things work together.

[Charlie Deist] 10:17:07  
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right, right, right.

[Charlie Deist] 10:17:13  
So you kind of assume that people are seeing both, that they process them both.

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:13  
Hopefully… Yes. Yes.

[Charlie Deist] 10:17:17  
Kind of in real time, like, the way that we scan it, it's not like you're just seeing the title or just seeing the thumbnail.

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:18  
Absolutely. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:23  
Yep. And so, that's… that's one type of problem. Another type of problem is.

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:29  
I got 10,000 views, but when I look at my analytics, it drops off halfway through.

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:36  
And it's like, oh shit, what's going on there? What is the… why is the retention rate so low on that?

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:41  
The retention rate's low because something happened there. You started talking about subscribers, like, hey, make sure to like and subscribe, and blah blah blah, hit the notification bell. Or some… maybe something, maybe you drifted and started talking about your family, who even knows?

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:51  
But, like, there's a reason why someone left, and it's like, okay, I'm gonna avoid that problem next time.

[Charlie Deist] 10:17:56  
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:17:57  
And a classic thing is where people ask for subscribers and likes and everything at the end of the video, and that goes on for, let's say, 20 to 30 seconds.

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:05  
And you could see your retention rate go off a cliff.

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:09  
And it's like, shit, you should do that somewhere else, make it smaller so the video kind of ends.

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:15  
So then… then there's never an opportunity for people to leave. They slide right into the next video.

[Charlie Deist] 10:18:15  
I see, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:21  
Um, and so that's what… those are the two classic problems, that either no one clicked.

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:27  
And your views are not where they should be. Or people did click, but the retention rate is really, really low.

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:33  
And it's like, okay, so I could… and you can see, usually on a graph, they have a graph in there, where you can see, like, where people left.

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:40  
At what minute. So, thumbnail and title is what I would consider for any video that you think is doing poorly. And really.

[Charlie Deist] 10:18:41  
Right, right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:50  
You know, we wouldn't expect either of our accounts to get a million views, but we should all be capable of getting multi-thousand.

[Charlie Deist] 10:18:59  
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:18:59  
And so anything under a multi-thousand view. Um, I would say start evaluating. Look at that click-through rate, and if that click-through rate is below 4%, Um, or if it's below… or if it's at 4%, and you're like, I have a better idea for that one.

[Andrew Muto] 10:19:13  
Switch them, and, like, just upload… change the title, change a new thumbnail.

[Andrew Muto] 10:19:19  
And see if you can get it back in the game.

[Charlie Deist] 10:19:21  
Yeah, okay. Um, shifting gears a little bit, I wanted to talk about, kind of, my… A little bit of my overall content workflow with the daily, but also come to something in my notes from our first conversation where Um, you talked about, kind of, different, different frameworks or buckets of content, and I think subconsciously or otherwise, I already sort of think about

[Charlie Deist] 10:19:45  
Actually, I don't know that I necessarily had this this bucket so much top of mind. I had in mind, like, when we do the newsletter, it's always Thought Trend Tool, so that's kind of like… you know, tools sort of like how-to guides. Sometimes it's a how-to, sometimes it's more of just like a, hey, here's a new AI math tutor you can try out.

[Charlie Deist] 10:20:05  
Um, the psychology stuff, a lot of times, these fit the trends, where it's like, okay, why did everybody… why did… kids suddenly get depressed in 2012. And actually, I'm thinking about this right now. This would be a great short-form video. If I could execute on it with the visuals and a good script.

[Charlie Deist] 10:20:22  
There's this book, uh, like, a huge bestseller, came out last year, called The Anxious Generation by a social psychologist, Jonathan Haidt, and he's talking about, um, you know, this huge explosion in depression and anxiety among teens.

[Charlie Deist] 10:20:36  
Kind of tracing it to social media and smartphones. And 2012 is when the line really starts to spike for depression and anxiety. And that was the same year that the smartphone companies introduced the front-facing camera.

[Charlie Deist] 10:20:49  
So that's why we get kind of, like, selfie culture and the, uh, all that. I feel like we could… I could… He makes that connection. Um, but I feel like I could probably, you know, do a shout-out, like, do a, you know, call that out from the book.

[Andrew Muto] 10:20:52  
Yeah, that's… that's smart. Does he make that connection?

[Andrew Muto] 10:20:57  
Yeah, yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:21:03  
Um, and just, like, spin that off in some interesting direction with some visuals.

[Charlie Deist] 10:21:10  
Um… the emotional content, I kind of think of that, like, we do a lot of just sort of validating parents, um, but I think that it is broader than this, and, like, that hair braiding video talking about why I homeschool, you know, so my 9-year-old doesn't have to see porn, so blah blah blah blah blah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:21:27  
Um, that… like, that stuff, I think… is… but all of these could be well-suited to… that style of video where it's mostly about the text on the screen.

[Charlie Deist] 10:21:39  
Sort of supported by the… caption, um… And then just the video is playing a little bit of a backup role, at least this is how I'm thinking of it.

[Charlie Deist] 10:21:49  
The video's just creating a little bit of, like, backup intrigue, something, you know, either eye candy, something relatable, um, the kind of cottagecore Pinterest.

[Charlie Deist] 10:21:58  
Uh, visuals, but then, like. The actual text content is doing the heavy lifting to keep people there.

[Andrew Muto] 10:22:07  
Yeah, no, that's exactly how I would go after it, too. And, you know.

[Andrew Muto] 10:22:13  
There… you can think of these in both like, content buckets, but also stylistic buckets. So, like, theoretically, your podcast clips could satisfy almost any of these, right?

[Charlie Deist] 10:22:25  
Mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:22:26  
But that's a style. And then the text with B-roll That's another style that doesn't need to be just emotional content.

[Charlie Deist] 10:22:36  
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:22:36  
It could also be the science-psychology stuff, right? Like… You could cut, let's say.

[Andrew Muto] 10:22:42  
A voiceover about the science of… and I think I showed… one of those was an example, right? That someone was talking about like, adolescent boys needing a certain thing, but he was cut against cottagecore video. And… I think that's a way of looking at it, that

[Andrew Muto] 10:23:00  
While a podcast clip could probably cover any of these content types.

[Andrew Muto] 10:23:04  
You can think of podcasts as a style. And then your cottagecore text with B-roll, that's a style.

[Andrew Muto] 10:23:12  
That could theoretically handle any of these. And then UGC… UGC is a style.

[Charlie Deist] 10:23:15  
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:23:18  
But that style could be applied to emotional content, science and psychology, how to guides, whatever.

[Charlie Deist] 10:23:23  
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:23:24  
That it's not so black and white, that, like, if it's UGC, it's how-to all day, because what else, right?

[Charlie Deist] 10:23:30  
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:23:30  
And if it's podcast, it's gotta be science and psychology. No, it's like, I think there's a style, and then there's the kind of the bucket.

[Charlie Deist] 10:23:36  
Yeah, one of our best performing meta ads… we had it first as a video format, where it was, like, it was a… kind of Instagram comment of somebody saying, like.

[Charlie Deist] 10:23:48  
Just learned that, you know, in Finland, they go to school for fewer hours, but they have higher test scores, something like that. And then there's a voiceover that comes in and says, like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:23:55  
Uh-huh.

[Charlie Deist] 10:23:58  
You know, oh, girl, I was just reading about that same thing, like.

[Charlie Deist] 10:24:02  
Blah blah blah, and then it was an ad for the OpenNet Daily, like, heard this in the Openet Daily, I don't know. Uh, and then we… we kind of repurposed that same message in the form of a mock Reddit post. Same idea, same core message.

[Charlie Deist] 10:24:16  
That in both of those formats, did really well. I thought that was interesting, and it makes me kind of… I'm on the lookout for more of these kind of trends, you know, science and psychology.

[Andrew Muto] 10:24:20  
That is interesting. Well, I'm wondering if you could… Can you deploy that to organic social in any style you want? Like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:24:32  
If that message has been confirmed to work, I would just quadruple down. The way that, like, on Velvet Alfredo.

[Charlie Deist] 10:24:35  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:24:39  
It's the same gag, right? Like, I don't go searching for new gags often. And when I do, I'm still finding them, right?

[Charlie Deist] 10:24:43  
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:24:46  
My gag is, hey, can I take your photo? And it's… that's it. Every time, every day in the entire account's built off that. So, it's not like you need to have 17 really great ideas. If you have one really good one.

[Charlie Deist] 10:24:49  
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:24:58  
Then it's like, alright, so how can I… how far can I twist this idea?

[Andrew Muto] 10:25:02  
Can I turn that into a video? Can I have… podcast hosts say that to each other.

[Andrew Muto] 10:25:09  
Cool. Can I do animated text? Can I make a version? But, like, if you've got a message that resonates, it'd be interesting to push the boundaries as to why it resonates.

[Charlie Deist] 10:25:19  
Yeah, for sure. For sure. Um… And something that I'm a little bit embarrassed to even show for feedback, but I think that means that I should probably do it, rather than just sit on it. This was something… this was kind of a format slash aesthetic and workflow that I was playing with, with the new Google VO

[Charlie Deist] 10:25:40  
Video generator, and I couldn't… actually, I couldn't find my login for it.

[Andrew Muto] 10:25:42  
Oh, yeah. God, you're so deep on this stuff, dude. You're so… I haven't even touched this yet.

[Charlie Deist] 10:25:48  
It… it's free. That's one thing. It's kind of crazy. Actually, maybe I did have to create, like, a trial account for the pro thing to get it, but then… Um, I haven't hit any kind of caps on it, and this video I actually didn't love, because this video doesn't look at all

[Charlie Deist] 10:26:01  
Like user-generated. And if you really zoom in on it, you start to see the, like, very strong AI tells, like.

[Charlie Deist] 10:26:09  
You know, with the teacher's drawing on the chalkboard is… Yeah, like, I don't think that is a real, uh, meaningful equation, but I just put this.

[Andrew Muto] 10:26:10  
Oh, yeah, oh, that's funny. The math is not right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:26:19  
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:26:19  
I mean, this is kind of, like. Previously, I would have had… I would have done this as a… as an image post.

[Charlie Deist] 10:26:26  
You know, just put this text on, like, a textured piece of paper and post it on Instagram.

[Andrew Muto] 10:26:26  
Sure.

[Charlie Deist] 10:26:31  
But I do notice that, you know, our reels get more engagement than our static images, so something like this.

[Charlie Deist] 10:26:37  
Just like a kind of cute little aphorism or something like this.

[Charlie Deist] 10:26:41  
Um, and, you know, maybe set it to some trending music.

[Charlie Deist] 10:26:44  
Uh, it's 8 seconds long, um… This one, I was kind of going for, like, a little bit of that.

[Charlie Deist] 10:26:51  
Aesthetic of the, um… you know those fridge magnets? They're kind of, like, snarky, irreverent, you know, like… I haven't had my coffee yet, so I'm gonna bite your head off with the smiling housewife.

[Andrew Muto] 10:26:55  
Sure, yep. Yes. Yes.

[Andrew Muto] 10:27:00  
Yeah. Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:27:02  
Um, kind of, kind of that vibe, like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:27:06  
I would say, um, that's a great idea. I think trending audio is exactly where you should try this.

[Andrew Muto] 10:27:14  
Um, something that I have in my head that I'm going to experiment with this weekend is making more of my videos not in Adobe Premiere, but doing it in Instagram edits.

[Charlie Deist] 10:27:21  
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:27:22  
Because, um, I think classically, these platforms super serve their newest features, and so there is connective tissue between edits and Instagram, so it knows when you've used one.

[Charlie Deist] 10:27:28  
Right. I see, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:27:33  
And so, if you build this in edits and deploy it to Instagram via the edits.

[Andrew Muto] 10:27:39  
App, I'm wondering if that throws extra signal weight to Instagram, and it's like, oh, we're gonna… because we wanna… it's… every time you do that, it's an advertisement for edits.

[Charlie Deist] 10:27:49  
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:27:49  
And it's like, okay. So, um, edits… edits would also be a great place. You're already kind of familiar with these next-gen tools, so, like.

[Charlie Deist] 10:27:57  
Mm-hmm. Is that a desktop or a phone app?

[Andrew Muto] 10:27:57  
You're gonna be fine in edits, um, but it also… it's a phone app. Um, it's… it's a… if you have a Mac, you can… you can use it on, I'm pretty sure, you can use… because… Because I can… yeah, exactly.

[Charlie Deist] 10:28:03  
Okay, gotta do them fun.

[Charlie Deist] 10:28:09  
Oh, yeah. Well, now there's this, like, screen mirroring thing, so maybe I can do… oh, cool, okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:28:13  
Yep, exactly. I… so I… yeah, I use that, so try that out. But that's where you can get the trending audio, is my point.

[Charlie Deist] 10:28:18  
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:28:18  
So, like, I would try that out and see. And, um… that would probably be a… good expo… regardless what you're discussing, there's a good experiment, whether it's 8 seconds, whether you can make it longer, or if that's the right AI video.

[Charlie Deist] 10:28:34  
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:28:34  
But I think you're in the right direction of, like, yeah, that fridge magnet stuff, I think would be… would work really well. I would bet it would play, like, Gangbusters on Facebook, too.

[Charlie Deist] 10:28:42  
Oh, yeah, yeah. Video or image, do you think, there?

[Andrew Muto] 10:28:45  
Well, I think… I think Facebook's definitely more, um… it accepts photos in a better way than Instagram.

[Charlie Deist] 10:28:52  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:28:52  
But I think both. I mean, I think… you know, people are… they're much more frivolous with their viewing patterns on Facebook, and it is a bit more polarizing.

[Charlie Deist] 10:29:01  
Yeah. Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:29:02  
Um, it's… it's less community-focused and more crazy So I think, like, fridge magnet stuff is exactly where you'd expect to see it, yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:29:10  
Okay, nice. Um, well, I might… I'll play around and try to get a few more of those designed and get your feedback next week.

[Andrew Muto] 10:29:18  
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:29:19  
Um, do you… would it be easier for you in any way to set, like, a recurring time earlier in the week, or… I'm happy to… I can go either way. My pretty static, so I can… I can slot it in at last minute, or…

[Andrew Muto] 10:29:33  
If you'd like to, I'm totally down. I'm also happy to be flexible. It's up to you. It's whatever works for you, really. My… Especially the times… I use the morning to do a lot of my editing So, the fact that you're on Pacific time has worked out really well, because by the time you're ready to have a chat.

[Charlie Deist] 10:29:45  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:29:51  
It's like, well, mom, done. Like, my afternoons… I generally don't edit in anyway, so… Um, it has worked out really well for me, so I'm really flexible in between noon Eastern time.

[Charlie Deist] 10:29:54  
Nice. Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:30:03  
And, uh, about 4.30 Eastern Time.

[Charlie Deist] 10:30:06  
Okay. Okay, maybe I'll… maybe I'll toss out, uh, time that we could do… have our kind of set recurring meeting, that would be awesome.

[Andrew Muto] 10:30:13  
Okay, yeah, yeah. And we could do a recurring Friday one, too. It's however you want to rock and roll, man.

[Charlie Deist] 10:30:16  
Um, and then…

[Charlie Deist] 10:30:21  
Alright, good deal. Yeah, that, I think, could work well for me. I like having a little bit of… That routine.

[Andrew Muto] 10:30:27  
Sure. Yeah, absolutely. I'm looking at your… the episode you just uploaded here on YouTube, the long-form podcast one.

[Charlie Deist] 10:30:35  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:30:36  
Um, and… I think my instinct would be to address that thumbnail, and just see what you… see what you can do.

[Charlie Deist] 10:30:41  
Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:30:43  
Um, because I would have thought it would have worked. Um, because the thumbnail it's the version I would have made.

[Charlie Deist] 10:30:46  
I did… I did 3 variations. There's another one that says, you'll never do that after school, and then another one that says your kid's C-plus is fine.

[Andrew Muto] 10:30:52  
Um…

[Charlie Deist] 10:31:01  
But if we want to think even a little bit further outside the box.

[Charlie Deist] 10:31:04  
Um, it could be… it doesn't have to be a direct quote from him. I'm kind of now thinking about, again, that, like.

[Charlie Deist] 10:31:10  
Um, uh, that, that complementarity that you engineered into the one with the, like, what could we do? How top 1% parents prep their kids.

[Andrew Muto] 10:31:15  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:31:20  
Did you… when you said you made… a few, are you ABC testing them in YouTube, or did you only publish one?

[Charlie Deist] 10:31:25  
That's what I'm doing in YouTube, yeah. And it hasn't given any results yet. It says not enough information. Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:31:27  
You're… okay. So… Yeah, it takes… it takes weeks.

[Andrew Muto] 10:31:32  
Usually takes weeks. Um… the… Yeah, they're all quotes.

[Charlie Deist] 10:31:40  
They're all quotes.

[Andrew Muto] 10:31:41  
Top 1% parents prompt their kids I… the thing about the kids C plus is fine is almost too negative to my ears. Like, it's… it's almost Well, that's not what I'm shooting for. What I'm shooting for is something even higher, like, um…

[Charlie Deist] 10:31:52  
Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:32:09  
I'm trying to remember what that first… I'm gonna click… one sec here.

[Andrew Muto] 10:32:26  
Oh, I'm so sick of hearing this. That's… that was the line. Um Something that… that…

[Charlie Deist] 10:32:29  
Right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:32:40  
Something that, like, piques your curiosity. I'm so sick of hearing this And… it's like, oh, I want to hear what the 1%ers do.

[Andrew Muto] 10:32:54  
Like, there's something… there's something there of, like. Um.

[Charlie Deist] 10:33:05  
Yeah…

[Charlie Deist] 10:33:13  
Um…

[Charlie Deist] 10:33:17  
The world pays for edges. Your kid will hate you.

[Charlie Deist] 10:33:24  
No. The career killer, uh, let them fail.

[Andrew Muto] 10:33:25  
Um…

[Andrew Muto] 10:33:33  
I would almost… play to the psychology in the other direction of there's something that you're doing that you always just assume you have to do.

[Andrew Muto] 10:33:44  
Like, and not that you'd make fun of public school, but, like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:33:49  
Public schools ruining them. That's not the right one, but, like, something…

[Charlie Deist] 10:33:52  
No, I… well, and there's one that is a direct quote. Nobody cares about your degree, or nobody cares where you went to school, something like that.

[Andrew Muto] 10:34:03  
Well, no, it's good, it's good. I just, I wonder, I'm not sure… that's a good quote, it's whether or not it… um, fits with how the top 1% parents prep their kids.

[Charlie Deist] 10:34:04  
No. Um…

[Andrew Muto] 10:34:15  
Because the prep implies… I'm about to get some, like, legitimate tips and tricks.

[Charlie Deist] 10:34:22  
Uh-huh.

[Andrew Muto] 10:34:24  
And I guess I'm already operating around the assumption of, like, mo… like, normal schooling.

[Andrew Muto] 10:34:30  
Right? So, what am I about to hear? Right? There… there is a tutor… is it tutoring? Is it, you know, what's going on?

[Charlie Deist] 10:34:33  
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:34:38  
So you kind of want to play into that psychology, or against it.

[Andrew Muto] 10:34:44  
Um… is where my instinct is at that time.

[Charlie Deist] 10:34:48  
Yeah. Um…

[Andrew Muto] 10:34:51  
Like, okay, so, like, for instance, if it was… this one trick worked.

[Andrew Muto] 10:34:57  
You know, like, um… something… something I was like, oh shit, I want… like, what is the answer to how top 1% parents prep their kids? And then tease that answer.

[Charlie Deist] 10:35:01  
Right.

[Charlie Deist] 10:35:08  
Right, right, right. Hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:35:15  
Works every time. Right like that? Like, that would be… that would be the kind of thing, like, oh shit, if the promise of this video is it will work every time if I follow the advice that the 1%.

[Charlie Deist] 10:35:16  
Right, right, right, right. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:35:30  
Do to prep their children, right? Like, that's the promise of the video.

[Charlie Deist] 10:35:33  
Yeah, yeah. Even if it's… even if it's not, like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:35:34  
Um. Like, with…

[Charlie Deist] 10:35:38  
Really borne out in the content itself, as long as it's sort of close enough.

[Andrew Muto] 10:35:43  
It has… yeah, I mean, you have to be in the universe, right? Like, my… so my video… I spent 6 months with Ray-Ban MetaSmart glasses.

[Andrew Muto] 10:35:50  
Um, they're… they… they've got one serious problem. And in that video, I discussed the fact that they only… they'd only shoot portrait. They don't shoot 16x9.

[Charlie Deist] 10:36:01  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:36:01  
And the next version has to shoot 16x9 so that you can wear them for social media videos and for long-form YouTube videos.

[Andrew Muto] 10:36:08  
But I express my absolute love for these things. So it's… so it's like, yeah, alright, it wasn't like a deal-breaker, but it was very much, like, that's the one feature that needs to be addressed.

[Charlie Deist] 10:36:11  
Right, right.

[Charlie Deist] 10:36:19  
Yeah, yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:36:19  
And I assume over, you know, your 38 minutes, you're going to talk about, you know, what these guys should do. And when you come out the other end, you're like, yeah, I heard a bunch of device.

[Charlie Deist] 10:36:28  
Right, I mean… Yeah, could it be something like, rich kids learn this, or, uh, you know, try…

[Andrew Muto] 10:36:36  
That's great, that's… yeah, that's great. Um, it's kind of the same thing.

[Andrew Muto] 10:36:41  
But that might not be bad, that might not be bad.

[Charlie Deist] 10:36:41  
Right, right. Or the one thing that works, that do this instead? I don't know.

[Andrew Muto] 10:36:49  
Yeah. I think the more specific, the better. Do this instead. I've tried those, and I see those.

[Charlie Deist] 10:36:52  
Right, right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:36:56  
But it tends not to work for me. The more specific I can be.

[Charlie Deist] 10:36:59  
Okay. Well, let's toss, uh… Rich kids learn this into the mix and see… see if that… if we get data in two weeks.

[Andrew Muto] 10:37:07  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:37:15  
The other thing that you might want to consider I… text might be better on the left-hand side of the image.

[Andrew Muto] 10:37:23  
Because if you… if you mouse over, you see some of the UI pops up on the right-hand side of the image.

[Charlie Deist] 10:37:23  
Okay.

[Charlie Deist] 10:37:28  
Oh, interesting.

[Andrew Muto] 10:37:29  
And so you can block some of the text.

[Andrew Muto] 10:37:34  
And so I would consider putting the text on the left-hand side. Similar to your STEM one.

[Charlie Deist] 10:37:34  
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:37:40  
Okay. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:37:40  
Have we been teaching STEM completely? That, like, there's no UI there that is really overlapping

[Charlie Deist] 10:37:49  
And does it matter, like, top or bottom?

[Andrew Muto] 10:37:53  
Um… I don't think… yeah, I don't think… I don't think top or bottom matters. It's really just the… the UI on the right-hand side. There's something in the far bottom corner that's the time the amount… the duration. And then there is disappearing UI for the watch later and the playlist queue nonsense.

[Charlie Deist] 10:37:55  
In this case, toward the top, top left, like, there's more space above his shoulder.

[Charlie Deist] 10:38:03  
Okay. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:38:15  
So…

[Charlie Deist] 10:38:15  
Yeah, no, just looking at it, it looks… it looks much… and just also with the way his head is slightly tilted to one side, there's a little more space there for the… the words.

[Andrew Muto] 10:38:23  
Yeah. Um… Yeah, I would try that, but I think overall.

[Andrew Muto] 10:38:33  
It isn't about obsessing over one video, it's trying to build up the muscle of what am I trying… what am I… what am I… like, working towards, and that is click-through rate. Click-through rate is the thing that's where you'll win. That…

[Charlie Deist] 10:38:44  
Mm-hmm. Okay.

[Andrew Muto] 10:38:47  
That the advice that I wish I could take for myself, but I just get so excited making the videos, but if… You need the title and the thumbnail before you even start. Like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:38:58  
Best case, like, just build a series of titles and thumbnails, and you're a YouTuber.

[Andrew Muto] 10:39:03  
The video is almost inconsequential. Like, it's the thumbnail and the title that, like, get the click.

[Andrew Muto] 10:39:09  
And then make a video, and we see varying qualities of video, despite the fact that so much of it is Hollywood grade, you still see like, not awesome videos in there. So… it's like, you know, make an incredible thumbnail and title, and you could win.

[Charlie Deist] 10:39:18  
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:39:25  
Okay, yeah. No, I got that, and it's very helpful to go over it in this specific Okay, okay. My, uh, my kids informed me that there's a yucky bug in the… in the other room

[Andrew Muto] 10:39:27  
On YouTube, yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:39:40  
Alright, um… But yeah, doing it in the specific gives me that muscle memory, and then… and I'll… carry that over into the long game.

[Andrew Muto] 10:39:51  
Yeah, and it's… click-through rate's the one thing I would obsess over first.

[Charlie Deist] 10:39:55  
Okay, nice. I've never heard that before, but it makes total sense now, in hindsight.

[Andrew Muto] 10:40:01  
Rock and roll. And, you know, I could… I could talk to Europe about this, because I think about this every minute of every day these days.

[Andrew Muto] 10:40:07  
That there's… there's two philosophies to win on YouTube. Long form. There is the, I'm gonna get suggested to people, like, here are videos on your homepage.

[Andrew Muto] 10:40:19  
You… you like sci-fi TV shows, you like cooking, and here's the stuff.

[Charlie Deist] 10:40:19  
Uh…

[Andrew Muto] 10:40:24  
And it has all the SEO stuff you'd expect. Like, um… like, words in the title, words in the description, that whole game.

[Charlie Deist] 10:40:28  
Not bad, hold on.

[Charlie Deist] 10:40:33  
Uh-huh.

[Andrew Muto] 10:40:33  
But then there's… then there is the sidebar stuff. And the sidebar game is slightly different, of, like, um… It's more of this psychology, of, like, title.

[Andrew Muto] 10:40:48  
Thumbnail. Oh, shit, what's that? Like, that's a slightly different game. Maybe this is, like, level 2 stuff, but this is… it's a slightly different game than, let me just get served to an audience on their homepage that really wants

[Andrew Muto] 10:41:03  
Really wants it. As opposed to, how many times do you fall into rabbit holes based on your suggested stuff on the side?

[Charlie Deist] 10:41:09  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:41:09  
Where it's like, oh, I didn't… I wouldn't even have guessed Right? But, like, but I'm in the universe of this, and so, like, this is something that I'm interested in.

[Andrew Muto] 10:41:17  
Um, that… that dual strategy, I think, is something that we can get into a little bit more, too.

[Charlie Deist] 10:41:22  
Yeah. No, it is funny how you can get pigeonholed by the algorithm after a certain point, like, Facebook used to know that I really liked watching epic boat crashes.

[Andrew Muto] 10:41:28  
Yeah.

[Charlie Deist] 10:41:33  
Now it knows that I really like chainsaw reviews and, like, lumberjack videos Which perfectly parallels my move from the Bay Area, where I was doing sailing and boating stuff, to now where I'm out here chopping down trees.

[Andrew Muto] 10:41:38  
Yes, yes.

[Andrew Muto] 10:41:47  
Very cool. Very cool. Yeah, yeah. I think that…

[Charlie Deist] 10:41:48  
How does it know? Facebook, honestly, the only reason I go to Facebook these days is, well, Marketplace. I like the ads that Facebook serves me up. It knows me so well that it, like, it knows the products that I actually want.

[Andrew Muto] 10:41:57  
Oh, interesting.

[Charlie Deist] 10:42:02  
Um, and then sometimes those reels are just a… entertaining way to pass 5 minutes.

[Andrew Muto] 10:42:09  
Yeah, Instagram is that way for me. Like, Instagram has me on lock. Like, it's sending me every preset for photo coloring, every lens, every little… piece of nonsense. Um, it's really… it's wild.

[Charlie Deist] 10:42:18  
Yeah. Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:42:23  
What else you got?

[Charlie Deist] 10:42:25  
Um, that… that was… Pretty much, I mean, I could… I could also… go on… like, there's… I had one idea, uh, for something that I think could be somewhat lower activation energy, because it doesn't require me to be on screen for the duration of the video, but there's sort of the style where, like, maybe you've got someone, like, pointing to the title in the first frame, where it's…

[Charlie Deist] 10:42:46  
You know, we do a lot of, like… yeah, in the newsletter, the tool and curriculum reviews are, like, new tools and things like that are pretty popular. Those get a lot of link clicks.

[Charlie Deist] 10:42:56  
Um, and I can imagine doing Um, kind of like, you know, here are the top 10, you know, top 10 AI math tools, or top 5 AI math tools, or something like that, and then for the footage, I mean, one thought that's kind of boring would just be, like, screen share footage, but I think

[Charlie Deist] 10:43:13  
Where I've seen people take, like, cell phone footage of, you know, the… their actual computer screen. That just makes it a little bit more real and tactile.

[Charlie Deist] 10:43:23  
Um, and that's… I can imagine, you know, just as an experiment, as kind of a one-off experiment.

[Andrew Muto] 10:43:27  
Yeah, I mean, absolutely. With your voiceover, with your voiceover, it could even be AI voiceover, yeah. Um… That sounds great. I mean, I think that's where, like, practical tips and tricks are really helpful if you're in the market for that stuff.

[Charlie Deist] 10:43:28  
See if that for… that… Yeah, yeah, right. My voice over AI voiceover…

[Andrew Muto] 10:43:43  
So, if you are able to provide those tips and tricks, you can… that's… That's a killer, all on its own.

[Charlie Deist] 10:43:44  
Yeah.

[Andrew Muto] 10:43:51  
Um, like, there are endless… like, I don't know, self-taught chefs just have like, they share all their tips and tricks, and their content is not elaborate in any way, whether it's short form or long form, and they win forever.

[Charlie Deist] 10:44:05  
Mm-hmm. Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:44:05  
And it's like, exactly. Because if you want it, you got it. It's how recipe videos work.

[Andrew Muto] 10:44:11  
Recipe videos are essentially how-tos. And, like.

[Andrew Muto] 10:44:15  
Do that and you win. And if you… I'm sure there are… aesthetic ways of doing that. Like, there's something about recipe videos that, like, now, after, you know, 30-odd years.

[Andrew Muto] 10:44:27  
After Emeril Lagasse on the Food Network. Even home chefs can make their stuff look really nice in a standard kitchen.

[Charlie Deist] 10:44:33  
Right, right.

[Andrew Muto] 10:44:33  
You could probably deploy those aesthetic techniques to anything. Right? Like, how do you make on-screen imagery look fantastic and be very, very watchable. That's probably solvable.

[Charlie Deist] 10:44:47  
Yeah, yeah, this is a little bit off… off the… reservation, but, um, I discovered a… Twitter account yesterday that I was a little bit hooked by.

[Charlie Deist] 10:44:57  
Kiel James Patrick, who's like this… he has a store, a classic New England clothing.

[Charlie Deist] 10:45:03  
He's got 1.3 million followers on Instagram. I found him through Twitter, but he's just, like, this kind of… smug, unapologetically Anglo-Saxon wasp.

[Charlie Deist] 10:45:13  
New England, and he's got, you know, two photogenic golden retrievers, and this beautiful storefront, and he just takes these picture-perfect videos around New England, kind of being, like, a little bit like, like, like shoving it in your face.

[Andrew Muto] 10:45:22  
Uh-huh.

[Charlie Deist] 10:45:25  
But there's something very likable about it. And, uh, it was getting me a little bit of inspiration for, uh, sort of… my own, you know, if I could do this with the sort of homesteading lifestyle, obviously there's a zillion accounts like that, but mostly women kind of doing their aesthetic

[Charlie Deist] 10:45:41  
Uh, you know, trad wife thing, but…

[Andrew Muto] 10:45:41  
Yeah, I… I… I wouldn't… I mean, I always think there's room for another person, because it's like, if you enjoy watching it as a viewer, to find somebody else, like, that's just another one to throw in the fire for you.

[Andrew Muto] 10:45:53  
Right? Like, oh, great! I like this person. There's another one? I love him too.

[Andrew Muto] 10:45:57  
And, um, I would… I would go deep in that if I were you. The… there was this guy, I think his name's Sad Pappy, but he was a… he's a chef, but he's, like, all tatted up.

[Andrew Muto] 10:46:10  
Very alternative, but knows as shit. And his style is so, like, slow and slack and cool, that I was like, man, I wonder if you can do camera stuff in his style.

[Charlie Deist] 10:46:13  
Hmm.

[Andrew Muto] 10:46:24  
Like, because

## CTR Optimization Guide

### Purpose

To diagnose, improve, and systematize the **click-through rate (CTR)** for video content across platforms. CTR is the most immediate and measurable indicator of whether content packaging (title + thumbnail) is working.

---

### Benchmark Targets

- **< 4%** → Needs immediate revision
- **4–6%** → Acceptable / baseline
- **6%+** → Strong performance

---

### Common Failure Mode

> "If your views are lower than your follower count, it's probably packaging—not content."

### Packaging = Title + Thumbnail

CTR depends almost entirely on how well the **title and thumbnail work together** to create curiosity, specificity, and emotional charge.

---

### Title + Thumbnail Pairing Patterns

### 1. **Curiosity Gap ("What's the problem?")**

- Title: "6 Months with Ray-Ban Meta Glasses"
- Thumbnail: "One Major Problem"

### 2. **Status Reveal / Insider Knowledge**

- Title: "How Top 1% Parents Prep Their Kids"
- Thumbnail: "Rich Kids Learn This"

### 3. **Problem/Pain Hook**

- Title: "Why Kids Are So Anxious Today"
- Thumbnail: "2012 Changed Everything"

---

### Clickthrough Troubleshooting Checklist

- Is the **thumbnail text too vague** or abstract?
- Is the **text placement blocked by UI elements**? (Avoid bottom-right corners)
- Does the title set up a **strong question, tension, or promise**?
- Is there **redundancy** between title and thumbnail? (Fix it)
- Is there a specific **payoff** implied or promised?

---

### YouTube-Specific Notes

- CTR influences whether you get shown in _Suggested_ videos
- Sidebar CTR behavior is more psychological/emotional than SEO-driven
- CTR combined with retention = growth

---

### A/B Testing Practice

- Use YouTube's native A/B thumbnail testing tool
- Wait 2+ weeks for enough data
- Track:
    - CTR delta
    - Retention consistency
    - View velocity changes

---

### Workflow Recommendation

1. **Generate 10 titles per video idea**
2. **Draft 3 thumbnail variations**
3. Pair the top 3 title/thumbnail sets
4. Choose 1 to publish, 2 to A/B test

---

### Future Additions

- Examples of CTR turnarounds
- Swipe file of high-performing pairings
- Template thumbnails for different content types
- Thumbnail layout best practices by platform

  

## Retention & Watch Time Guide

### Purpose

To identify, prevent, and fix common issues that reduce **audience retention** and **watch time** on short- and long-form video.

Retention determines how well content performs _after_ the click—it's the second half of the view equation.

---

### Key Retention Metrics

- **Average Watch Time** (absolute duration)
- **Audience Retention Curve** (graph of when people drop off)
- **Completion Rate** (what % watched all the way through)

---

### Top Retention Killers

1. **Slow or vague opening**
    - Fix: Hit the core idea in the first 1–2 seconds
2. **Overlong CTAs at the end**
    - Fix: Minimize ask or relocate mid-video
3. **Off-topic tangents mid-video**
    - Fix: Ruthless editing; stay on message
4. **Abrupt tone or pacing shift**
    - Fix: Maintain energy, cut awkward transitions

---

### Practical Fixes

- **Embed mini-hooks every 10–15 seconds**
- **Use pattern interrupts** (cut style, music shifts, punchy text)
- **Re-cut endings to avoid long wind-downs**
- **Cut anything that doesn’t earn attention**

---

### Hook Mechanics (First 2 Seconds)

> "If they don’t make it past 2 seconds, retention doesn’t matter."

Types of first-second hooks:

- Unusual phrase or question
- Strong facial expression + gesture
- Cold open (mid-sentence, emotional punch)
- Reversal or surprise insight

---

### Ending Tactics

- **Avoid the “subscribe & like” ramble**
- **Slide into the next video** (no hard stop)
- **Reward payoff** before any ask

---

### Retention Graph Analysis (YouTube/Instagram)

Look for:

- **Sharp drop early** = bad hook
- **Drop near CTA** = move ask or trim
- **Plateau mid-video** = good pacing

## Content Types vs Styles Guide

### Purpose

To help the team classify and repurpose content more effectively by distinguishing between **what** the content says (_type_) and **how** it’s presented (_style_).

This modular approach allows for flexible experimentation and remixing across platforms.

---

## Content Types (Buckets)

These define the _purpose_ or _message_ of the content.

### 1. Emotional

- Validates feelings or identity
- Often used for connection, relatability, or resonance
- Example: "Why I homeschool: So my 9-year-old doesn’t get exposed to porn"

### 2. Science / Psychology

- Research-backed insights
- Frame problems and solutions using data or theory
- Example: Jonathan Haidt’s 2012 front-facing camera + teen depression theory

### 3. How-To / Tools

- Explains or demos a process or resource
- Example: "Top 5 AI math tutors for homeschoolers"

---

## Content Styles (Formats)

These define the _presentation_ or _delivery_ of the message.

### 1. Podcast Clips

- Natural dialogue or interview cuts
- Can be polarizing, educational, or emotional

### 2. Text + B-Roll ("Cottagecore")

- Onscreen text overlays
- Slow, emotionally resonant footage
- Often paired with trending audio

### 3. UGC-Style / Selfie Cam

- Informal, handheld phone footage
- Often includes direct address or react-style commentary

### 4. Screen Capture / Desktop Footage

- Great for tool tutorials, product demos, or walkthroughs
- Can feel tactile and trustworthy

### 5. Meme Formats / Quote Graphics in Motion

- Fridge magnet style (text-focused, ~8 seconds)
- Overlaid on aesthetic or AI-generated footage
- Highly scannable, emotionally punchy

---

## Matrix Example:

|Type|Style|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Emotional|Text + B-roll|"Why I Homeschool" over soft mom-life footage|
|Psychology|Podcast Clip|"Boys need to move" insight from a parenting coach|
|How-To|Screen Capture|"Top 3 Math AI tools" walkthrough|
|Emotional|UGC / Voiceover|Personal testimony with homemade footage|
|Psychology|Text + B-roll|Haidt’s 2012 insight over youth-in-crisis montage|

## Fridge Magnet Content Guide

### Purpose

To develop and standardize short, pithy content formats that mimic the vibe of refrigerator magnets, bumper stickers, or passive-aggressive Post-It notes—often humorous, relatable, and emotionally charged.

These pieces are:

- **Quick to produce**
- **Visually minimal**
- **Highly shareable**

---

## Format Characteristics

- **Length**: 6–12 seconds max
- **Structure**: Short phrase or one-liner (no setup, just punchline)
- **Tone**: Irreverent, validating, emotional, cheeky, or subversive
- **Visuals**:
    - Light animation or AI-generated B-roll
    - Stock footage with visual irony or vibe match
    - Retro aesthetic or slow pan over vintage textures
- **Fonts**: Consider using Garamond, Bookman, or other classic serif fonts (avoid default sans-serif)
- **Layout**: Text centered or top-aligned, left-justified to avoid UI overlays

---

## Common Themes

- Parenting exhaustion or defiance
- Homeschool justifications or commentary
- Anti-institutional snark (schools, bureaucracy, etc.)
- Cottagecore / trad life romanticism
- Inspirational sarcasm

---

## Example Lines

- "Your kid's C+ is fine."
- "I don't co-parent with the state."
- "Sorry, we don't do spirit week."
- "Homework is a scam."
- "My kid learns more from the creek than the Core."
- "No, I don't miss drop-off."

---

## Editing / Production Tools

- **Google VideoFX** (auto VO, AI-generated scenes)
- **Descript + Stock Footage**
- **Instagram Edits (native)** – for platform-favored reach

---

## Deployment Tips

- Pair with **trending audio** when possible
- Publish on **Facebook**, **Instagram Reels**, **TikTok**, and **YouTube Shorts**
- **Test identical captions on different visuals** to see what resonates

---

## Expansion Ideas

- Use as **carousel starters**
- Integrate into **newsletter quote blocks**
- Build out **mini-series** around viral lines (e.g., "Things We Don’t Do Anymore")
