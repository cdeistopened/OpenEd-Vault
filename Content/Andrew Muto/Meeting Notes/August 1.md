## Content Strategy and Performance Review

- **New York Times Video Performance**
    - Achieved better than normal engagement, with almost **4,000 views** on TikTok.
    - Generated significant comments, indicating successful audience engagement.
    - Facebook Reels for this content did not gain traction, prompting a different approach focusing on a grammar debate (home-school hyphen), which also yielded limited comments (13).
    - Andrew Muto noted that Facebook can be monetized effectively, with Meta encouraging cross-posting from Instagram.
- **Whale Vomit Video Performance**
    - Demonstrates a strong format for engaging content.
    - Andrew Muto suggested adding more information within the video or description to extend watch time, such as explaining _why_ whale vomit is valuable.
    - Megan Hennessy has resources for creating similar "random facts" content.
- **Content Format Exploration**
    - **"Hot Take" Format:** Polarizing topics drive engagement and comments, which is crucial for algorithm performance.
        - Examples include challenging major news publications or discussing controversial social topics (e.g., children at weddings).
        - The goal is to create polarity without damaging the brand.
    - **"Is it Reimbursable?" Meme:** A potential new series idea based on real-world reimbursement questions from parents.
        - Examples of items parents tried to get reimbursed for include stocks, Pokemon cards (as inventory for an entrepreneurship course), recreational ski passes, shake weights, and family trampolines.
        - This format aims for broad applicability to encourage audience participation.
    - **"What Kind of Kids Are You Raising?" Video:** A template-based video format designed to unveil different types of learners or schooling approaches.
        - The initial hook should tightly connect to the subsequent content to minimize audience "bump."
        - This format could be adapted for topics like "best math curriculums for different learners."
    - **"Hammock" Video Concept:** The initial concept of contrasting work with leisure did not align with the visual of working from a hammock.
        - The revised approach will focus on highlighting the **perks of being a homeschool parent**, such as flexibility and freedom, which better matches the visual content.
- **Content Creation Efficiency and Scale**
    - The goal is to produce content at scale, aiming for **two videos per day** on platforms like TikTok and YouTube Shorts.
    - Template-based videos (like the Canva list) are estimated to take **10-15 minutes per iteration** once the template is set.
    - Pointing videos are estimated to take around **90 seconds** to record.
    - It is important to identify formats that allow for rapid content generation.
    - Andrew Muto emphasized the importance of testing different elements (e.g., background images vs. no background) to understand what drives performance.
- **Audience Engagement and Socialization**
    - A key concern for homeschool families is **socialization** for their children.
    - This topic presents an opportunity for "spicy" content that addresses common misconceptions and highlights how My Tech High provides social opportunities (e.g., 50 different clubs, neighborhood parties).
    - Teachers running clubs are willing to provide snippets about their clubs, which could be incorporated into content.
- **Creative Challenges**
    - Charlie Deist identified "shiny object syndrome" and "overthinking" as personal challenges in content creation.
