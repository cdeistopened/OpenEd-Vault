Charlie Deist  
Hey, what's up, Andrew?

Andrew Muto  
Hey, Charlie. How are you, man?

Charlie Deist  
Good. Let me shut off my music here. I found this. Do you listen to music while you do, like, focus work? Like, any kind of. Are you. More of you're doing more sound stuff so you interferes during writing?

Andrew Muto  
Whenever I'm writing or working on, like, PowerPoint presentations, I generally do if I'm listening to dialogue. It's. It's very tough. Okay. But I'm. What I always have in the background is. I'm ashamed to Admit I have YouTube videos going, like, non stop. Right? Yeah. And I. It's. It's just like a combination of camera stuff, and then I've fallen down some weird rabbit hole of, like, police cam, body cam videos. I find them fascinating. And I just get served this all day and it's just like, on. And I'll pause it while I'm editing vo, and then as soon as I'm done with the vo, it starts up again and I'm editing the graphics or whatever.

Charlie Deist  
Nice. Yeah. I go back and forth between, like, I don't know, the binaural beats the, like, 600 or whatever special frequency. But I found this one recently that it's kind of a throwback. There was a Bradley Cooper movie that I don't think it actually got that much attention when it came out, but. Did you ever see Limitless?

Andrew Muto  
Oh, sure, yeah.

Charlie Deist  
Maybe it was a bigger deal than. But I liked it. And then this. This video is like. It's called Rewrite youe Story, Limitless Productivity Playlist. And it kind of like opens with a little bit of, like, that setting the stage. He's like the loser version of himself. And I don't watch the video part of it, but it gets me in a good zone to be like, okay, let's get shit done.

Andrew Muto  
There's a whole subculture of kind of like biohacker types from Silicon Valley that try to like that. That's called NZ17 or something like that. The drug that he takes. Like, I guess there are, like, nootropic kind of like, similarities that are available. And I think someone said that. What is. It's not Ritalin. What's the one that people take now?

Charlie Deist  
Modafinil. Paracetam.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, even. Even for adhd. What am I.

Charlie Deist  
Oh, Ritalin. No, no, no.

Andrew Muto  
What's the other one?

Charlie Deist  
Well, Ritalin and Adderall are the ones.

Andrew Muto  
Adderall. Adderall. But Adderall is actually apparently a very close similarity to, like, the effects. Like, obviously it's not giving people superpowers but it was interesting. I went down a rabbit hole years ago, but like, how possible is this?

Charlie Deist  
No, I find it relatable, having only taken Adderall a handful of times in college to get through finals. I remember one time I had been studying for stats or econ. Maybe I did. I experienced this twice, actually, with two different sets of finals, and in each case I was cramming for some kind of quantitative thing and then I would. When I came out of that mode, the whole next day, I was seeing the, like, patterns from econ in everything, like license plates and stuff. I felt like, wow, if this were turned up a little bit, I could, like, fall off into paranoid schizophrenic.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, yeah.

Charlie Deist  
Thankfully, I never took the habit that far, and now coffee is good enough for me.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, Coffee is just my baseline these days. Like, I'm very clearly, you know, reliant on it. There was an interesting podcast I listened to that I think was based off a book, but the idea that the age of enlightenment is directly tied to the introduction of coffee into humans.

Charlie Deist  
Right. And that, like Michael Pollan.

Andrew Muto  
Or it might. It might be. It might be. It was a Tim Ferriss episode.

Charlie Deist  
I bet it was Michael Pollan, because those guys are buddies.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah. And that's always stuck with me, that caffeine is, like, a core component to modern human existence. And you. Oh, it's just doesn't behoove us to subtract it.

Charlie Deist  
Right, right.

Andrew Muto  
Like, there seems to be no real downsides. And it's like, fuck it, I'll just, you know, augment my psychology with caffeine for the rest of my life. I guess.

Charlie Deist  
Truly, I could. It makes me think I should actually revisit this. I used to write on medium. I can't even find my account right now. I don't know. Did they take it down? This is the problem with the Internet now. It's like, stuff that you thought would live forever sure disappears. But before. Before Michael Pollan wrote his book, I made that same argument and wrote one of my. It's actually one of my favorite things I wrote. I did a whole series on caffeine, and at the time, I was struggling with it more. Now I'm at peace with my relationship with coffee. I believe that it is a vitamin and it has very little downside. So I'm all about it.

Andrew Muto  
Very cool. Maybe before we get started, I was looking at your Instagram and TikTok and the recent horse one that you just posted. So on TikTok, it's doing, you know, marginally better than some of the other stuff, which I think is a good sign on Instagram. It's just standard. I think in both cases, there's not enough context for the algo to understand what this is even about. Like, there's not. Like, there isn't a lot written into the description. Right. Like, groundbreaking study out of Harvard. I would jam pack that with a little bit more SEO, especially on Instagram.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah. Just like you know, you probably can't do too much, but, like, a paragraph or two about homeschooling, children learning, you know, all the stuff. So the algo has a good chance to understand what this could be.

Charlie Deist  
Right.

Andrew Muto  
And over time, I think it starts to associate your account with these things. Yeah, but it struck me that, like, I'm not sure the algo would really. I mean, it could read the. Voiceover and it should be able to do okay there, but I would say try to play into that a little bit more.

Charlie Deist  
Okay, good deal. It's funny because I, I'm looking and it actually did above average on YouTube also. And I posted it the platform that are the tool that I use to schedule. I can do different captions for different platforms. And I did a longer caption for some of the other platforms. Not Instagram or TikTok, but like on LinkedIn, there's a longer post. So you think I, you know, I should just beef that up a little bit?

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, I mean, just let it. The, the description is like another real signal to the algo. Like, what is that? What are they even talking about?

Charlie Deist  
Right.

Andrew Muto  
And if you can give it context there, that's just in your. To your benefit. And same with hashtags that like, you know, whether hashtags have been deprecated or not, clearly they're still in the mix. And so I would include hashtags in that of hashtag, homeschool, hashtag, you know, teaching or learning strategies, stuff like that.

Charlie Deist  
Okay.

Andrew Muto  
And you'll see. I, I don't know what it's like in your scheduling, but at least in the app, when you start a hashtag, it'll give you the scale of the hashtag as you're writing it. It'll suggest it and then tell you, like, how many reels it's been used in. And that's really helpful because you can start to make decisions about. If I go for a hashtag like photography, that's like, that's everybody. It's almost not helpful. But something like Street Portrait, which is closer to 2 million, it's like, okay, so that's a big enough like, audience, but also not astronomical, where I would just not be considered. So you're right.

Charlie Deist  
Kind of like SEO. Just like SEO.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah.

Charlie Deist  
It's exactly not going to rank in the.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah. So you're trying to find these sweet spots of like, you know, one of the ones that works really well for me is this concept of street style. And that's something where, like, that's. It's right under a million or right around a million. And it's like, cool, I can use that and really, you know, stick out.

Charlie Deist  
Right, Right. Okay.

Andrew Muto  
So I would just, I would make sure that's also part of your daily posting strategy, hashtags and description.

Charlie Deist  
And so I'll have to do that in the platform, though, or in the.

Andrew Muto  
I don't think you have to. If you do it in the plat if you do in the app, you'll get, you'll get insights. I don't know what platform you're. What platform to use to post post Planner.

Charlie Deist  
It's like Buffer.

Andrew Muto  
Got it. Yeah. I don't know if I can't remember. I used to use Buffer. I can't remember if those would give you the same insights that, like, it autocompletes a hashtag and gives you the stats of it. But if you do it in the app at least one time, you'll get a sense.

Charlie Deist  
Okay. You know. Right. Then I can just, like, make my folder.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah. Yeah. You could start to get a sense of, like, I'm going to include a handful of these each time.

Charlie Deist  
Right.

Andrew Muto  
I mean, I probably use, like, 12 every post, which I think everybody will tell you is overkill, but. But I have tried not using them and the post doesn't do well, so I'm a little superstitious at a minimum.

Charlie Deist  
Okay, got it. Well, I've got another. I've got one to show you that I just kind of whipped up pretty. Pretty last minute. The concept came to me just from like a newsletter segment today. And it sort of plays off of the, you know, the, like, hard times create Tough men. Tough men created.

Andrew Muto  
Sure.

Charlie Deist  
That thing. So there's this woman who in the podcast was talking about, you know, how kind of hard times create, like, capable pairings. Well, I'll just, I'll show you the video here. But. But I also tried. I'm trying the original Ed, the horse mascot image. And I've been trying to get the green screen effect to work into script because I want to be able to, you know, layer more stuff in the end, do it like, kind of in the style that people do with like, yeah, green screen over headline or whatever it might be. And in this case. Well, I'll just show you again, not final draft quality here. And you'll see immediately, very obviously, that the green screen didn't quite work. Like, this was the. This was the clip. I actually just uploaded the image like with literal green. In case that's how the green screen thing works. I wonder. Like, I mean, I would assume Adobe Premiere has a pretty good green screen.

Andrew Muto  
You know, I don't think I've ever used it. Adobe in my use, Adobe Premiere is coordinates with Adobe After Effects. So, like, if I ever have like a motion graphic thing to do, like a green screen, there's a way of just kicking whatever you're working on over to After Effects work over there and over there. It has a really robust green screen.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah.

Andrew Muto  
But I have never used it the way I see it used in kind of like phone apps where it's like, it's basically, you know, it's a mat around, you know, whether something is moving or not. So it can identify people really easily and it just erases the background. I've never used that in Premiere.

Charlie Deist  
Somehow it's like not quite getting the horse's ears, maybe. Because it is. I think it is probably looking for like a person.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah.

Charlie Deist  
Human face. But yeah, pretty. Pretty simple here. Let's see if I turned on the audio.

Andrew Muto  
I don't hear audio.

Charlie Deist  
No. Okay, hold on. I went back to the British, the regular British. I think this was the same British accent as the original one. It might be a younger voice here. Hard times create capable parents. Also ignore this double caption I meant to generate it without a caption, but it got it.

Andrew Muto  
Okay. Hard times create capable parents. Capable parents create easy childhoods. Easy childhoods create anxious adults. And anxious adults create hard times. Yeah. I mean. Yeah, I. I think. I. I think that the magic with this. Is when the lip sync works really well. It's hard for me to tell on the screen based on the frame rates, whether or not parents create easy childhoods.

Charlie Deist  
Right, right. Let's compare that to this original one. Life in other. Harvard just confirmed that doing chores helps kids later in life. In other news, hay is food and water is wet.

Andrew Muto  
Let me see. Brilliant.

Charlie Deist  
Oh, whoops. Am I sure I'm sharing my full screen, Right? Yeah, you're just looking at. On yours. Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

Andrew Muto  
Well, you know, the, the trouble with the horse is that, you know, it could, it could look like chewing, you know, and it's like it really is the mouth shape that, you know, that you're hoping to nail. But when it works really well, it works really well.

Charlie Deist  
I might try just different. And I bought the Pipit Monthly subscription so I can play around more with different base photos. The way this works, you just upload your file and it takes a long time for it to load. But like, you just upload your picture, then you write the script, you assign the voice. But like, if I found a different. I mean, I wonder how many stock photos like this there are where maybe where there's a little bit more like definition around the lips or something. Or I could even take off the glasses and put the glasses on myself later. But like. Yeah, I'll play around with that a little bit more. I won't take. Take time. Too much time. Now, this one is kind of funny.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah. Mr. Ed is probably. I mean, that's a pretty good example of how it's been done in the past. But it was just.

Charlie Deist  
I can. Yeah. I think that the fact that it shows the teeth might kind of. Might make it a little bit. Let's just try. I want one that's a little bit higher resolution. This one maybe. Is it still loading? Let's try this one. And it's going to take a while, but we can, we can move on to something else. And then in five, five or ten minutes we can look at it again. Pip it.

Andrew Muto  
And are you, are you like a hundred percent tied to the horse thing? Like, is there a world where you would try something else?

Charlie Deist  
What else, what else might we consider? Like, give me an example of.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, well, I mean, you know, I saw the Mona Lisa stuff in there, so historical stuff. Right. That you can kind of get away with. Right. It could be Albert Einstein or, or even like the David sculpture, you know, that you could.

Charlie Deist  
Right.

Andrew Muto  
I know that the Edits app has that sculpture feature. Right. So just something that feels a little more high route. That's one. One that comes to mind is that aliens commenting on human culture is interesting and gives you an angle. Right. Like, not just the way they look, but the way that they could talk about a society that, like, hasn't quite figured it out yet. But you could be in the world of. You're figuring it out. Right. Like, you're the ones who are acting the way that they would expect humans to act in a positive way.

Charlie Deist  
No, I like that.

Andrew Muto  
I like that aliens could be fun and, and then, you know, theoretically you could own it. Right. Like, you could, you know, whether you have chat GPT help build you, like a illustrated alien or something, or even a photoreal alien, it becomes something that you can kind of control and own, which is super cool.

Charlie Deist  
I like that Albert Einstein alien statue of David. Just things that I could use as the messenger for different messages.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah. You know, stuff. And, and, and maybe it's contextual. Like, you know, if somebody's talking about being smart or not being smart, you know, the. Albert Einstein is one to deliver that information. But you could also imagine Cleopatra, you know, like delivering something about aging empires or something.

Charlie Deist  
Right, Right. Yeah. If it's sort of like. If it's some kind of educate. Actual educational content.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah. Or, or no, just in context of, like, the American system. Right. That's where. That's where my head's going. Like, if, like, the American system is antiquated or not working, and it's like the American empire is not delivering the education it should be, you know, that could be delivered by a historical figure known for their empire building or something.

Charlie Deist  
Right. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Let me just. I'm going to do a random caption. The caption's not the point here, but. All right. It's not going to be funny. It's not going to be clever. It's just going to be a technical test. They say I'm putting the cart before the horse. At least my cart has personalized learning plans and doesn't smell like cafeteria pizza. I want to. I want to also see if I can get rid of the captions in this platform show as captions. Seems like I should be able to if I untoggle the box that says show us captions. Well, we'll see. I'll just export it and then we'll see if it does better with the, with the, with the mouth moving. The mouth match and I'll do faster export rate frames per se. Oh, interesting. You can choose how many frames per second. I wonder. This one. I'll just try more frames per second and see what happens. Let's see what else I. I guess some. Some of your thoughts on the other videos, and I, I didn't really finish those ones or post them yet because I, I heard you on the, you know, don't make the visuals, the, the oddly satisfying visuals any longer than the captions or the voiceover. And, yeah, I think that was just. Kind of an editing glitch or I just.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, okay, got it. That. Yeah, that was my main thing of like that is really there just as another tactic to get people to keep watching. Not that they would finish. And. And there's probably good philosophy behind or psychology behind the fact that when it doesn't finish, you know, like, I see that more often than ever. Like I'll get served something of like Karen freaks out and gets arrested and in a tick tock video. And then it never even gets to the arrest.

Charlie Deist  
No, it never ends. Right, right. And it's like me.

Andrew Muto  
And then, you know, the comments are full of that. But the video has already taken its views and ran and it's like, interesting strategy. I'm just.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah. What was that? Let me see the. Oh, right. So I mean, it's. It was up in the corner. The horse was up in the corner because I had to make room for the visual.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah.

Charlie Deist  
That wasn't really my, my. I think my intention would be to do it more like bottom left or you know, that's usually kind of where the talking head shows up. It seems like.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah. The horse head shape is also, you know, tough. It's perfect for portrait. Right. But hard to make half a frame.

Charlie Deist  
Right, right. It's very long.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah. I mean, the other, like I had mentioned, I think. And did I not write back? I did.

Charlie Deist  
No, I think you did. On the text you did.

Andrew Muto  
But I, I thought I had written something about how I liked the English voice better than.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah. Yep.

Andrew Muto  
Oh, that's okay. Yeah, yeah.

Charlie Deist  
As opposed to the one it was sort of ambiguously like, is it Indian? Is it Rastafarian, Is it British Indian?

Andrew Muto  
It almost sounded like vaguely Ethiopian or something to me.

Charlie Deist  
Right, right.

Andrew Muto  
And none of those areas to an American ear strikes me as like, like sophistication. Yeah, yeah, I think that's. And I know there's like classic things about the British accent not sounding to other. To other ethnicities. The British accent does not blow people away, but to American ears it feels.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah, well, I don't know. I mean, let's see. What. What should my next milestone be for? I could try some other avatars. I could try.

Andrew Muto  
I think you're. I think you're on to something with this, man. I'm super jealous. I've been thinking about this for like a decade. Just like using avatars to say whatever you want and then, you know, you're, You're. You could do anything with this. And personally, I wouldn't get hung up on the horse if the horse is specifically difficult to execute on. Right. Like, the mouth shape is difficult to shape, the face is difficult. And it's like if you can win with something else, whether it is a historical painting or a, you know, an avatar, that you could create an AI, like an alien of some kind that's funny and silly looking and. Fun for everybody to look at. I think of, you know, Mike from Monsters Inc. You know, he's got one eye. You know, like, you could go crazy. You could do the classic alien thing. You could do the Simpsons. You know, they have the two guys that are always talking. You know, there's a lot of stuff that you could do, but all of a sudden, if you could do it, you could own it. And you could have these guys talk to each other, they could talk to the audience, and you would never have problems with mouth shape. It would just be. It would be a home run every time. Now it's just about the content.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah, I think there's like. I think part of. I'm already. I'm skating on a little bit of thin ice because I know that our CEO is sort of like a Luddite on AI and he didn't want. But, but, but his secondhand man is all about it. And actually saw the post on. On X of the Talking horse and was like, I love this and posted it in Slack. And then that got a bunch of likes within Slack.

Andrew Muto  
Oh, that's great.

Charlie Deist  
Conspicuously absent from the likes was. Was Isaac, the CEO. But, you know, he fixes battles, so if liking things, he's not going to say anything.

Andrew Muto  
So I mean, personally, I would chase that down, but I would also try to sort out maybe different angles of horse that would work better. One of my gut instincts is that, like, in a profile would at least give you the side angle of mouth.

Charlie Deist  
Okay. Okay. Well, we might get that with. We might get that with this latest one. Let me see how the download's going. Okay. It's about. It's almost 75% done here, so we'll see in a minute whether that might be a little more viable. And then if I can figure out the caption thing and the green screen thing, that'll also maybe help. And then Mr. Ed has more recognizability among the older generation.

Andrew Muto  
Sure.

Charlie Deist  
I. I've never seen that show.

Andrew Muto  
Or I used to watch it on like Nick at night or Nickelodeon or something like that.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah, right.

Andrew Muto  
The other thing that I would chase down is what we talked about before, which is short versions of somebody going like this or like this.

Charlie Deist  
Oh, yeah. Okay.

Andrew Muto  
And. And that could be your face in the short. Just. Just to test it. Just to do a handful of these. Right? Yeah. Maybe would like, you know, whether you want to include your kid or not. But like, you know, kid on lap or like, you know, it's just very organic. Like dad, dad saw something interesting. Okay. My wife does these all the time for her floral account, and they work like gangbusters.

Charlie Deist  
And you're. What you're pointing to is really the description.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah. Or the words telling you to do something. Right. Like.

Charlie Deist  
Right.

Andrew Muto  
You know, the five best ways to blah, blah, blah. And then it says, like, that's what. That's the text on screen. And then in tinier font or somewhere else, it's like, you know, read the description.

Charlie Deist  
Right. Okay.

Andrew Muto  
I think that kind of stuff, like, that's a. I mean, that's the kind of thing you can whip up, like five of those in three minutes.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah. It doesn't have to follow up with more video of, you know.

Andrew Muto  
Yes. And if you can make it work with just your face, you can make it work with other people's faces. Right. The catch right now is it like very low hanging fruit. You can do it with you and then you could just as a stress test and then see if that works. You can deploy other people or AI versions or whatever, or even a combination of the horse. Right. Like you could start to understand the limits. If it works with a human but doesn't work with an animated avatar. You start to understand stuff of like, okay, so they avatar has limits.

Charlie Deist  
Right. All right, that's going on my list for sure.

Andrew Muto  
So and then the last thing I would say is a podcast clip that maybe already exists that didn't do good, but probably should have. Right. Like the George Washington one is maybe on that list of mine where like that's, that's well done. And if only he was more well known, he would. And pair that with one of those burning through Styrofoams.

Charlie Deist  
Okay.

Andrew Muto  
Right. Like one that should have done good but for some reason people didn't pay attention. What tactic can you use to get people to pay a little bit more attention?

Charlie Deist  
Okay, so I've got one maybe, you know, re. Redo of the. The horse with better lip syncing. One recycled podcast with oddly satisfying. And then one pointing at text or something like that. Pointing at text or description.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, yeah. And. And the other one is. I, I know. I'm sure I would. I would. If it's easy and it would be easy. This is the way to do it. Try maybe another avatar that's built into one of these programs.

Charlie Deist  
Right.

Andrew Muto  
Whether it is an animated kid that I just saw on your screen before or something in Instagram edits and the restyle feature. Yeah, just use the same script that you used with the horse and try it with that. I think that some of the magic of why people like watching these is because they feel so well done. Right. Like the, the Yeti or the Bigfoot. You're like, holy shit. Like that look, you're watching out of fascination of like that's really well done. And so there. These apps have already come to the table with the well doneness.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah.

Andrew Muto  
So it's like, see if you could exploit that at all and you could. We could start to figure out like, is it the script or is it the. Just the horse is not working or like.

Charlie Deist  
Okay, yeah, I can do that. And our next meeting is Tuesday, right?

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, Tuesday. Yeah.

Charlie Deist  
Okay.

Andrew Muto  
The one that comes top of mind for me is the. The marble statue restyle and edits in that it feels high brow. Right. That you could have. It's going to look like it's educational adjacent, at least. It feels like Greek Roman history.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah, I'll find a good. Maybe that could be the one to deliver the hard, you know, hard times. Create capable parents or something like that.

Andrew Muto  
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, just. And just see if maybe you can get that to work.

Charlie Deist  
All right, can do.

Andrew Muto  
And that's all like really low hanging fruit stuff that I think should be not a hard lift.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah. Well, our Mr. Ed is 5% away. In the meantime, I did actually have one other thing if I wanted. I occasionally host some podcasts and. And then there's also. I'm wanting to do more like screen. Screen sharing AI videos for my own personal stuff. So I got some, got some lights, not that I necessarily need them, but I got a couple of these small rigs.

Andrew Muto  
Oh sure, I got them. I got. Right on my shelf over here.

Charlie Deist  
Oh yeah, yeah. And I also got this backlight which maybe is right now. Let's see. I feel like Every, everyone on YouTube always has some kind of like neon something in the background. Not to just straight up imitate them, but, but if we were to, you know, if I'm trying to frame, sort of frame myself and think about things like that. I don't know if you have any special insight into that.

Andrew Muto  
But yeah, I mean, I obsessed over this for like all of this that you see here. It's a shame I'm not on my iPad right now because really my set is right here. It's my computer and you know, there's probably a frame of it on YouTube. Let me see if I can just pull a frame real quick. One sec here.

Charlie Deist  
And I can, you know, I rearrange anything and this, this bookshelf can go out and I could take the photos down.

Andrew Muto  
Let me just drop this image into. Where's our chat?

Charlie Deist  
There it is. I could add more.

Andrew Muto  
Okay. So I, I, no, I just, I just added. So I built, I moved my desk into this part of my office and built that shelving system and added that tree and everything to kind of build my own background. And you're right, like I added some of those like neon lights. What I discovered was that a lot of these battery powered lights and I have other ones that I used to put on the shelf. They don't last long enough for me to get through a recording. They'll last like 20, 30, 40 minutes. But I was routinely spending a lot longer than that, just kind of tinkering. And I would realize in the middle of a recording one of the lights went out. So that was one of my core issues. And you can see in my image right here that I'm talking to you and that. That the cable here, right? Like this cable, right, Is what is powering those lights, right? But I frame it out and then I have, like, studio lights. That are on both sides of me. There's one key light that's hitting me on my screen, left side, the brighter side of my face in that image. And then there's another one further away that's giving a little bit more fill. But it's basically, it's a classic two light setup. And Phil. And you know you can tinker with this forever.

Charlie Deist  
Right.

Andrew Muto  
But the idea is you. I think the benefit of this kind of setup is that it immediately adds a. It has a sniff of professionalism.

Charlie Deist  
Right.

Andrew Muto  
It's that I think there's credibility built in. It's kind of my frustration with some of the podcast people where it's like, bro, there's nothing back there and you're wearing a T shirt. Like you kind of hope, you know, to his credit, who is the fucking guy? God, I'm not going to remember his name now. He, he's that Canadian professor that's always causing trouble talking about trans people. But he's. Yeah, Jordan Peterson. To his credit, he always looks like a million bucks. Right. Like, he always looks. He's always dressed the up. And so you're. You're prepared to listen to what he has to say.

Charlie Deist  
Right.

Andrew Muto  
And I think in, in the universe of providing information in that genre, that's kind of what you're coming to the table with. Right. And so I think that's what's going on when you look at a screen.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah.

Andrew Muto  
On the other hand, I would say that all of this is a time suck. That.

Charlie Deist  
Right.

Andrew Muto  
Compared to I could, I could. For every one of these that are like really well done, like mine, there's like another person who just didn't give a. And they're nailing it.

Charlie Deist  
Right.

Andrew Muto  
Like there's this whole subculture of something called grandpa vlogging where it's like set up a camera, talk for 55 minutes and basically edit nothing and they go to the moon, it's usually about a specific topic. Like there's this one like cattle rancher guy and he just like sets down a shitty camera and talks into it and it's like, how the fuck is this so popular? But sure enough, it is actually interesting to listen to because the guy's just got a take on a universe that I never even thought of there being takes.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah. Yeah. Well, that might be. It's probably something for my 86 year old psychologist client to learn from that.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, I mean, I think there's something really to that. And so I would, I would say build something that's easy, that you can literally flick a button and not think about it again, right? And so my nervousness about anything with battery power, like, because it could die, and you're going to start to feel this ticking clock as soon as you turn it on, you're like, oh, shit, I better start recording soon. And when you're talking, you know, and. And sometimes, depending on the light placement, you might even know goes out. And you look at the footage like, holy shit, it turned out. It turned off 30 minutes into my recording. So, like, interesting, I feel. And I have the same issue. Maybe you wouldn't think it, but, like, with my screens, they can't be on a screensaver or anything, right? They can't. I have to, like. And I have to turn all the notifications off. Otherwise. Things will pop up on the screen in the middle of the recording. So, like, I try to set these monitors up. Like, they're actually like a stage.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah.

Andrew Muto  
So it's that kind of stuff.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah.

Andrew Muto  
But on the other hand, you can't really miss. I would never sweat video quality as much as I would sweat audio quality. Like, audio quality is one of those things that when it's not good, people really, really notice. And when video quality is, like, not so great, people are generally fine with it. It's audio quality that will fuck people up. So I try to, like, prioritize audio quality, and there's a lot of different ways, depending on whether you want a mic in the shot or not. I actually don't really like the mic in the shot that I've got. I. I'm. I'm thinking about getting rid of it because it just does weird that I. It's like.

Charlie Deist  
It's not.

Andrew Muto  
I just. It's like, this is not worth the space and. Yeah. So you sound great. So I wouldn't. I wouldn't sweat yours. And you're pretty far away from it. Mine, I have to be really close, and it's a little too bassy, and I don't want to tinker with it. And so.

Charlie Deist  
Well, I got the Mr. Ed, and I feel like it's probably even more of the. The same problem where it just looks like he's chewing. I'll show you. But I don't know if they say I'm putting the cart before the horse. I say, at least my cart has personalized learning plans and doesn't smell like cafeteria pizza.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah. I mean, I think it. It just. It. It really goes back to that 1960s gag of, like, the fun with the AI these days is like, holy, that looks real. They got the yeti actually talk.

Charlie Deist  
Right.

Andrew Muto  
And this feels like a gag you've already seen of, like. I know he's not talking.

Charlie Deist  
Right. Right. Well, I think I've got my work cut out for me this week. Kind of kicked my ass. I had, you know, just on top of all the newborn baby stuff. Then my wife's grandma passed away on Thursday.

Andrew Muto  
And I'm sorry to hear that.

Charlie Deist  
It was. It was a happy death. It was not a.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, yeah.

Charlie Deist  
You know, and I mean, obviously it's never. It's never a purely happy death, but there was. There were tears and there were a lot of emotions. But so I was driving up to Reno and back on Thursday, Wednesday. And then yesterday was sort of a. Not a completely lost day, but just a bit of a recovery day, so. Not to make excuses, but at least I did get that one. That one prototype out.

Andrew Muto  
Yeah. No, dude, man. I mean, I. I always feel like I should be being more productive. Like, my family's out of town right now, and they left early so that I could. I can make some YouTube videos. I haven't made them yet, and it's like, you know, so, like, there's part of this game is. Is being reactive to when inspiration strikes, you know, there's gonna be days where you do show. Up at the desk and you kind of get through the day, but you didn't really make anything great and that's fine. And then there's going to be days where it's like you wake up on fire, you have this moment, you listen to some podcasts and you're inspired and you just rock and roll. And I think that's why it's important to have a set that's ready on a button click. So they're like, I'm, I'm good. I can just go right now.

Charlie Deist  
That's smart. Yeah.

Andrew Muto  
And that's why battery powered shit drives me crazy because like, ah, fuck, I'm. I'm 30 minutes out, I gotta charge it, I gotta say, no, no, no, no. Boom. I can hit a button and I'm good to go. Because I just, I'm on fire right now. And I think that's where any creative should be, that they can work at the, at the speed of thought. Right. That they.

Charlie Deist  
Speed of.

Andrew Muto  
Now it's really. Robert Rodriguez talks about this, that he got into digital editing way before it was a thing. And his thing was and visual effects.

Charlie Deist  
Right. I remember, I read his biography or autobiography, many years.

Andrew Muto  
The Rebel Without a Crew.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah, yeah.

Andrew Muto  
And so he talks about how like he, he's got some interesting videos that are kind of companions to that over the years. He used to release them on the DVDs like the 10 Minute Cooking School or something. But he, his thing was like, I want to be able to make as quickly as I can think it not I can make. And then I've got like, you know, three weeks ahead of me how it used to be. And it's like that's, that was always an inspiration to me of like, don't over complicate your tech setup because you're just going to drown. Make it as good as you possibly can without needing to worry about it. And then you could just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

Charlie Deist  
Yeah, yeah, I like that. I, I need to get a couple systems and that applies also to a lot of my writing stuff. Just having my, my writing systems all geared and that was one of the things we had to transition from my preferred newsletter platform, Beehive, over to HubSpot, which is just a solace CRM first thing. And yeah, one of the, you know, with like the email templates you have when you copy and paste from another place, it doesn't format right and everything's just all screwed up. But I got in and edited the HTML such that I can do a clean copy and paste and it's like, even though that took me probably two hours to get, it'll save me more time than that and headache in. In the law. In the. You know, less friction doing that every day, you know?

Andrew Muto  
Yeah. I mean, those kind of structural things. I have those moments, too, where it's like, all right, I need to figure out my lower third graphics package now, because it's gonna. I can't deal with this every video. So, like, I'm gonna do it once. It's gonna cost me two hours. And, like, that. That's normal. I would say the frustrating part is when you're being creative, but you. But you're too far away technically, from being able to act on the creativity.

Charlie Deist  
Right.

Andrew Muto  
And so that's what I would endeavor to try to fix. And then, you know, Stephen King talks about this too. You kind of have to always show up anyway and be okay with showing up at your desk. Desk and writing nothing. But showing up is. Is at the most important thing, right? Not getting to your desk in the morning is how you get nothing done, right? But getting to your desk and then having an idea and having it ready to act, whether it's editing or writing or filming or whatever. Like, I'm gonna go make some Velvet Alfredo videos on the street after this, and I might shoot nothing, right? Like, that happens, everyone. So I get out there, see nobody, but I'm out there. I gotta show up every weekend day, and I get what I get.

Charlie Deist  
Yep. Yeah. All right, well, should we stick a pin in it until next Tuesday?

Andrew Muto  
Yeah, man.

Charlie Deist  
I've written down this is my to do list for next weekend. This is the only thing on there right now, so rock and roll. If I don't get this done, then, yeah, no charge. Open that extra or something.

Andrew Muto  
You can do it, man. You can do it. These make them really lightweight. Don't stress anything other than, like, what does it take to. Because you could probably sweat the details on this horse thing, but it. That's not the point. The point is how can I make this crazy easy? And so if it's a, you know, if it's a sculpture character or an alien or whatever, right? Like, it should be easy. And on top of that, you can complicate it and innovate, but you want the basic to be easy, right?

Charlie Deist  
Yep.

Andrew Muto  
Cool. Right, dude, I'll talk to you Tuesday then.

Charlie Deist  
Talk to you then.

Andrew Muto  
All right, man. Good luck. Bye, Andrew. See you.

  

## Session 7: Context, SEO & Avatar Refinement

### Avatar Strategy Expansion

- **Ed the Horse**: Still charming, but technical issues persist (mouth shape, chewing look, limited expressiveness)
- **Lip-sync performance** varies by image, mouth detail, and angle. A side profile may improve believability.
- **Next steps**:
    - Test profile-angle horse images
    - Try new characters: Einstein, Statue of David, Cleopatra, alien avatars
    - Consider contextual delivery (e.g. Einstein = intellect; Cleopatra = empire/decay)

### Technical Refinement Goals

- Fix green screen/caption layering in Pipio
- Try other tools like **CapCut** or **Instagram Edits Restyle**
- Use higher FPS settings and mouth-detailed avatars to test improved lip sync

### Posting Optimization (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube)

- **Add richer descriptions** for better algorithmic context
    - Include keywords: homeschooling, learning methods, parenting, education reform
    - Write at least one paragraph with relevant terms
- **Use 10–12 smart hashtags** per post
    - Look for mid-volume tags (~1–2M posts): e.g. \#homeschoolfreedom, \#learningstyles
    - Use app suggestions to gauge scale and relevance
    - Build a reusable folder or bank of high-performing tags

### Content Prototypes to Test This Week

1. **Avatar Remix**:
    - Retry "Ed" with new profile image
    - Try new Pipio avatar or Edits AI character (Yeti, statue, alien)
2. **Recycled Clip + Oddly Satisfying Overlay**:
    - Re-edit George Washington or other solid clip with a satisfying visual
    - Ensure visual ends _before_ or _at_ punchline, not after
3. **Pointing-at-Text Reel**:
    - Simple 3-second loop with you (or AI) pointing to text
    - Text = hook / CTA (e.g. "5 Mistakes Every Parent Makes")
    - Add caption: "Read description" or similar

### Creative Mindset and Production Notes

- Don’t let production friction kill momentum
    - Keep lights hardwired
    - Avoid battery-dependency for long shoots
- Prioritize **speed over polish**
    - Done > Perfect
    - Audio > Video in terms of perceived quality
- Your creative system should support **speed of thought**

### Set Design and Lighting Insights

- Goal: Click-on-and-go recording setup
- Use wired lights (avoid battery-powered unreliability)
- Two-light setup:
    - Key light (screen-left)
    - Fill light (screen-right or diffused bounce)
- Add subtle backlighting for depth (e.g. bookshelf lights, neon strips)
- Optional: Replace mic-in-shot with hidden lav or desk mic to reduce visual clutter

### Macro Takeaways

- Make your content tools as invisible as possible
- Chase emotional resonance AND satisfying visuals
- Use thumbnails, voices, and avatars tactically, not just stylistically
- If an idea doesn’t land, **dial it up** before throwing it out
- Systematize your wins, prototype your hunches
