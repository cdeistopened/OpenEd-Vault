Summary

This meeting focused on analyzing and improving podcast clip strategy for TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, with emphasis on creating engaging short-form content from longer podcast episodes.

### Content Presentation Insights

- Less text on screen at a time for captions
- Well-spoken hosts in visually appealing environments perform better
- Color correction can significantly improve clip visuals
- Consider split-screen format with engaging "oddly satisfying" footage on one side
- Try adding narration or contextual text to standalone clips
- For clips without satisfying conclusions, add prompt to check description for the resolution

### Title and Thumbnail Strategies

- YouTube title suggestions: "Five Dyslexia Myths" is more broadly appealing than "Five Dyslexia Myths Every Parent Believes"
- For thumbnails, use expressive headshots with paraphrased quotes
- Add compelling text like "Schools are getting this wrong" to thumbnails
- Consider using "The Second Person Theory" as an intriguing title that promises a "hack"
- Try universalizing specific topics to appeal to broader audiences

### Content Volume Strategy

- Consider publishing 4-5 clips daily rather than being too selective
- One successful approach: "I don't have bad clips, I publish everything"
- Experiment with publishing the same clip with different titles to test engagement
- Even "wonkish" content might find a specific audience

### Visual Enhancement Ideas

- Try the "restyle" feature in Instagram Edits
- Explore using AI-generated characters as a "land grab" opportunity
- Consider using puppet-style characters that can be controlled off-camera
- Test creating a persona like "a horse trying to be an influencer"

Notes  

  

Transcript  

So I think that there's probably some, you know, variability based on how.

So just generally like less words on screen at a time maybe. I am seeing that you know the captions. This is mostly TikTok, but I'm guessing that it can largely be generalized to... Yes, I based on what I see Instagram you can do it as well. I don't personally get served a lot of podcast stuff on Instagram.

I get that on TikTok, so this was served organically to me, everything you see here. The Instagram stuff I have searched for and you can find it and it's it. It's essentially the same, but it's not exactly the same kind of like organic delivery to me that I was hoping for. Right, right.

Yeah, it's so funny. This is a count. 32,000 followers, about 15 videos total. And he's just got a good eye for picking out the bangers, I guess. Yeah, you know what, I've done a little research on some of these types of accounts too. There is a... A sub syndicate often where these.

Accounts work for the actual podcast and sometimes they're they're almost like subcontracted out. We're like, they'll try out a guy and he'll build an account, and they'll never copyright strike him, so to speak, because it's like, you just do what you can to generate interest for us. And there are rewards at certain view counts. So

A lot of this clip show stuff, the clips of longer stuff, some of that, or maybe much of that, isn't as organic as it seems. Because it is, behind the scenes, an entire machine of, let's call them faceless content creators, maybe Indian kids, whoever, who are building this stuff.

As a kind of bounty.

Okay. Interesting. Yeah. Well, and last time we got through one or two, we got through, I think two podcasts. We went, we went. I've got several more podcasts in my queue right now with some clip. I was going back and looking at some of the clips again and they were just like.

They they left a bad taste in my mouth because they just I felt like there was a disconnect none of them had the context necessary Contained within the script or the combination of the script and the onscreen text to stand on their own. And that's, I feel like the biggest challenge with podcast clips is like either getting something that's funny enough, uh, wise enough, you know, that gives you that gives you a full arc without, uh, you know, that, that Theo Vaughn clip it's 11 seconds and it has a full, you know, it's a funny setup.

He's trying to think of the name of a disease. And then the name of the disease is just a stutter. Like that's, you know, that, that's. Um... I think you're right. I mean, I think the... The trouble with any kind of documentarian content collection is like sometimes it's perfect and sometimes it's not right.

And you, as a creator, need to decide, like, Can I craft it into something that is slightly imperfect but still publishable, or is it just a wash? I briefly touched on this in some YouTube video I just made, where when I'm on the street, it's a lot like fishing. I show up every day. It's whether or not there's anybody good on the street.

It's like sometimes there is, sometimes there isn't, and you kind of can't let that bum you out because you're showing up, you're doing the work, and just because I didn't see the most perfect person. Besides having shot 23 people. Yeah. But I didn't get a million view video.

It's like, that's life. You know, that's, that's the matter of like, all right, well, I'm going to keep on searching the game doesn't change, right? It's just a matter of So I would agree, but, and then, you know. Then in that kind of continuum, you're searching for hosts or interview subjects and or hosts who can consistently deliver that stuff.

And the other thing that I feel like I notice in the clips on your finger, Like the one guy that we reviewed one time, he's got the hat. He's like the last published post on TikTok. I don't know, I don't remember his name, but it's the George Washington. It's a screw up, right? Yeah.

I think he's super well-spoken, but he's not—I don't know who he is, and he's in a vaguely— Low rent background, right? Yeah. And looking at your stuff, it's like, you know what, I bet that matters, at least more to the initial audience. Yeah. Yeah. Right, right, right. Yeah.

And he's well spoken. And that kind of triple word score fundamentally does matter. Well, and this is another just sort of visual thing that David Spade thing. It's hyper, what's the word? The colors are amped up, it seemed like to me. And he is totally washed out here.

So if we go to George Washington is a screw up and I can at them. Yeah, it's super. It's just like all grays basically. And I can do there's some effects that I could do one at one that I usually been doing in the For the full episodes is a blur speaker background. You can even do a green screen, but that seems like it, what are you going to put back there? That's not going to be hokey, but then also just like color adjustments. And I'm actually going to, I'm going to bring this guy upstairs in a second.

My wife said I could bring him up, but it'll just take me two seconds. Like if we, you know, turn that, that's just going to look weird. If I turn up the saturation, maybe I can do something. Take down the shadows, bring up the highlights a little bit or, you know, contrast a little bit of.

I, it's probably tough to like really resolve this in a clip like that. I mean, I think actually you're making some progress here. You know, I wonder if I'm not I'm sure you've seen these tick tocks were like on one half of the screen, there's like somebody talking on the other half of the screen. There's like somebody like

I don't know, like there's like a taffy machine, right? Right. It's almost like nonsensical, right? Oddly satisfying stock footage. You know, maybe there's something to that, right? Yeah, come for the... Come for the laffy taffy stay for the the insight. Yeah, it's very much engineered like a casino game of like, I kind of don't know why it's all blinking and flashing and making noises, but I'm here because I have a lizard brain and I'm watching right, you know, those kind of tactics may be interesting if you have access to stock footage as you do.

And it might be something worth trying of like put one of these talking heads. on the top and put the laughing taffy twisting on the bottom and see if you can get folks to pay a little bit longer attention. Yeah. Yeah, all right. Let me let me run upstairs and okay.

I'll be back in one minute. Yep.

Okay, so we might try that tactic of just like, you know, something that's maybe even very tangentially related. You had also talked about maybe doing a little bit of like a Yeah, I think so, especially with voiceover that like either maybe you can record or something that just feels like.

It's meant for that right right like the George Washington when I think it's already talked about that right because It's talking about something historical. So it's like, oh, this won't even, this might feel like a documentary even in a positive way. Right, right. So that we, and I had my VA. George Washington, before he became president, before he became general, before he became a legend, as a young man, 22 years old, he was sent out to the Ohio territory to tell the French to leave.

Cause at that point it hadn't been fully claimed yet by the French nor the British, but the French were kind of setting up camp and whatnot. And so the British were like, well, we need them to leave. And so they sent young George Washington. as a young military officer out to tell the French to leave. And the interaction goes horribly wrong. I'm not going to spoil the story here and share all the details, but basically George screws up in the worst possible ways and accidentally sets off a global war.

Massive blunder. Career-destroying-type mistakes here. And this is a story about how George goes from hitting rock bottom, making the worst possible mistakes, to turning that around in this character-defining moment where he ends up in a battle, and General Braddock is killed.

And things are going terribly wrong, and George needs to lead an evacuation. He basically needs to get his troops out of there. And so he mounts a horse and charges the enemy lines. Yes. It ends up with three bullet holes in his coat and a couple more in his hat, but he goes unscathed. He gets the troops together, executes a successful retreat, saves hundreds of lives, proves his bravery, his valor. This is the beginning of the legendary George Washington.

I feel like both extremes are dangerous, right? You know, on the one extreme where if you just focus on, oh, man, George Washington was so amazing, he was a legend, blah, blah, blah, people are gonna be inspired by that. They're gonna feel like, oh, I'll never live up to that.

No, that's not me. Whereas on the flip side, like, you know, you go back to 2020 when all the, you know, monuments were being torn down and stuff. And this idea of like, hey, these guys were imperfect. They owned slaves. Therefore, they were dirtbags. Therefore, we should tear down their monument. We should erase them from history. That's dangerous, too, right? It's really important, in my opinion, to acknowledge that they were flawed human beings. They were imperfect.

They made major mistakes. But despite all that, they also made massive contributions to set up what we now benefit from. And I think that's so much more inspiring, you know, for my 14-year-old son to hear a story where he's like, man, that guy really screwed up, but then he turned around and he's still brave and he's heroic.

And I want my son to know that, like, despite being a human, despite being weak, despite having flaws, I can still be brave. I can still swing for the stars and try to do something big. I think that's a really important message.

I mean, for a YouTube video, that could work. I mean, that could be something that's interesting. Right, not for a short, but for the actual. Yeah, I think it's just like, you know, it's dramatically too long for a short. But for a YouTube video, yeah. I mean, I also, if the goal would be to...

Deliver awareness around a podcast, hoping that someone watches to the end to get said awareness message. I would just put some lower third on there that says, you know... Right, right. You know, lower lower third on your like bending crane like from the open

Yeah, just to have it, you know, or even like a little logo bump that pops up in the corner somewhere just so that you constantly. are hitting the audience with, you know, we've got, this is where it's from. Right, right. Yeah. And this one, it kind of a weird, like the topic doesn't really relate to Open Ed's topic.

Not to say that it's, we can't do some of that, but I feel like maybe we'd want. Kind of a lower ratio of this kind of content to more topical. Well, I mean, this is probably good though. I mean, I think the fun part about the podcast is that you get to throw a wide net.

I have the reverse problem on Velvet, where it's like, I'm not just about street portraits, right? Like, I would love to be about a lot of things, but I've done... The opposite of this, where I've only done street portraits, and so now I'm trying to throw a wider net so that I can talk about other things, bring them to me.

I would encourage any creator to be like, try to allow yourself to be broader. Otherwise you're gonna. comedy or otherwise is going to have an upper limit. Yeah. And you kind of, you want more, you know, like all these, all these comedy guys. gotten into politics likely, or at least partially, due to the fact that like comedy has a audience limiter.

Right, like, SNL can only get so big. But if you're Howard Stern or Theo Vaughn or Joe Rogan, at some point, you need to be about more than just— sketch comedy stuff if you want to attract a $300 billion dollar. Spotify. That's, I think, how that happens.

Yeah, okay. So I think we can go in a couple directions here. I have, I do have a few more clips prepped, but I think last time what was helpful. Was kind of going through more of like the workflow that I use to come up with the concepts for the clips and the titles and thumbnails for the episodes.

So like this one. Let me share again. This is an episode that I thought was kind of a stinker as an actual podcast episode, and none of the clips were very good. It's about dyslexia and there's she, I mean like the full episode, it kind of meanders around. I actually don't think that this host, Andrea Phyfe, she did about five episodes and then she's sort of.

I feel like don't actually tend to produce very good clips. Interesting. For what it's worth. Okay. Yeah, no, I mean, I think that's a super great insight. But yeah, they you know, they talk about kind of the it's basically like the myths around dyslexia. And I think that that's probably

In the title, something like that, you know, the dyslexia myths that are hurting kids, what parents need to know something like that, or there's another one, the list format five dyslexia myths. Uh huh. Right, right. You know, and, and, you know, back to the shorter one.

It could just be five dyslexia myths, as opposed to that every parent believes. Or maybe and why they're wrong or not, or like, maybe not. I mean, like, based on what we just saw, you know, it was three words and an emoji.

Yeah, and then, you know, in terms of loading other kinds of keywords or... You know, I don't have any attachment to putting the guest name in the title, especially if they don't have... name recognition. Are you talking about YouTube videos? Are we talking about YouTube videos? I'm talking about YouTube title and thumbnail.

Yeah, I mean, five dyslexia myths seem strong to me.

You could add the with whoever, but, you know, I guess I think about this a bit that. Sometimes you want to narrow down your audience so that it really hits. And then other times, you kind of want to leave it broad because every word after you're really sexy.

Like, for instance, five dyslexia myths. That's a banger. parent believes. It's like, okay, so now it's for parents. If I'm not a parent, that's not for me. It's kind of a filter to lessen the audience. Is that really necessary? Now, if you desperately want to just talk to parents, and in our case, we might want to.

Then that filter may be helpful, but if all we want are views. It's possible we'd say, you know what, maybe there's a bunch of 15-year-old kids struggling with dyslexia that are gonna see this in EJM. yeah yeah um okay and then for like the uh An accompanying thumbnail, there's some different things here, most of these are no good.

really what that refers to in the episode. That's kind of intriguing. They were about these maybe seem like too much text. This The longer you wait the harder it gets I don't know if that really has the complementarity

And like I'm kind of going off of a paraphrase quote that we could put with the guests head like we've done a few of that format, and we could do it. Yeah, I think the original instruction and this to me is like, not very compelling but You know, and then this just reiterates the title directly. So I don't know that this is quite the right one, but if we you know, a thumbnail like this style versus the

The expressive headshot with a paraphrased quote. I kind of like that format because it's, it's easily replicable. I think I could just decide like, that's just what we're going to do for, for this current batch of podcasts and see how it performs. But I would agree.

I think the, the expressive headshot. And you can try variations, either an adult or somebody struggling. Whether it is a kid or whether it is an adult, and then

You know, I agree about the quote. To me, it should directly relate to... The title. Right, right. So like top five dyslexia myths. And then, you know, something like...

Sounds so stupid, but it's like, number three. Number three blew my mind.

Right.

I'm thinking here, hold on a second. No. Top five.

I didn't believe it. Right, right, right. Something like that. Something that kind of like reinforces the surprising nature of the myths. Yeah, yeah.

Schools are getting this wrong is your yeah. Yes, that's great. Schools are getting it wrong. It's really good. Okay. I like that.

I don't know if parent doesn't need to be in parentheses or. Anything too fancy? Okay, and for this one, yeah I'm probably gonna do a blog post about this just because the episode wasn't that great But I think that it is good good content inside of it. It just needs to be

and I also tried for some shorter clips, or longer clips rather, but none of them were that awesome. Um, let me go, let me go to. Another one here. Does this look familiar? Michelle Rhee? How to regain control when you've lost your classroom? They ate me for lunch. This is a woman who's big in sort of like education reform circles, not so much among

Like homeschool or, you know, parent, home educators. So there were a couple of titles here, like, okay, the number one mistake that leads to classroom chaos and how to fix it. That could be applicable to a. a homeschool parent or something. Sure. You know.

Something that speaks to parents as teachers or what to do when your students don't respect you. Those all sound great. The Michelle Rhee one, the number three, option three. That one though really relies on her. So you're either in or you're out based on that title.

The other ones, like what to do when your students don't respect you, that seems like a banger. If you're a teacher, how do you not click on that? Right, right, right. You know, you kind of have a teacher image in a classroom. I mean, that thumbnail makes itself a distraught teacher.

with crazy kids in a classroom in the background, right? Well, and if it needs text, I don't know that it necessarily does, but this was a good paraphrasing quote. They ate me for lunch. Yeah, and that's good. And you're right, it might not, honestly. I mean, I do think that there's a certain thumbnail style that doesn't use that.

But you're still doing the same thing where it's like, wow, there's a lot of questions. Based on what I'm seeing here that I have to click to get the answers, right, even not me and not even that I'm interested, but that like like often I watch these police body cam videos, and it's like,

You know, some woman destroyed a Walmart, and there is no on screen text on the thumbnail but it's the woman. Right, right. Yeah, no, it's true. A picture is worth a thousand words. Yeah, I think about that with my thumbnails often to where it's like, should I do the thing where I add a text? Or should I do something that's just so like what?

Right, right. Because sometimes when I confront people on the street and ask to take their photo, their initial expression... looks very ominous. And it's like, oh, if I just stop on that frame. and make that the thumbnail. And then the title is This almost went wrong, right, you know, it's like, oh shit. Yeah, right, like, or I made a serious mistake. You know, like,

That's a video you might click. Yeah. Um, so, and, and speaking, speaking of this, there's. This also is probably the best clip. I don't think that are in my original notes. I had even done this I had done more Staying with a teacher for two years in a row, but that it's just like it's too wonkish. It's all about like policy stuff Homework she talks about this one. I think also like when I went through this again I was like this this doesn't doesn't really hit me but then Um, just thinking about this again.

Okay, so she talks about this is this is the transcript and I can try to make it a little bigger um I had one of the toughest first year teaching experiences probably in my core year I was assigned to a third grade classroom at one of the worst performing elementary schools in baltimore

So they ate me for lunch. This one, it's got a good setup with the storytelling, but it seems like it doesn't actually really deliver any catharsis or any lesson. Would you agree? I mean, yeah, based on that, there's, it's just like. Teaching is tough, you know. On the other hand, in the description, you might be able to add a lesson.

Like you might be able to have something on the screen that says like description for her solve or something. So if she goes into elaborate detail. about how she addressed this or how she got through it. You might be able to add that into the description copy. Yeah, yeah.

And the only reason to do that would be to call it out in the video. So that people spend longer reading that and the videos playing in the background.

This one, this could complete it.

Through that experience what I realized was the environment these kids were growing up in didn't change. None of that changed.

I think there could be something here that I could play with, but the on-screen text... So the on-screen text for something that you're saying could maybe fill in Well, and I don't like this idea of an on-screen text strategy that isn't all up front where you have to, where the on-screen text changes as it goes. I feel like that's just...

I just want it to be at the beginning. Yeah, I mean... I think what I'm describing is, it's that first graph that you showed me where she describes working in Baltimore, lowest performing kids, the whole thing. And either on the whole time or on towards the middle end is something that says.

Check the description for how she solved it, you know, right, right. And then in the description, you could write. Even a third person like your summary of how she addressed it. Right, right, right. You know, or if there's a combination of quotes that you can put together from her, but like.

That might be a way to address a clip that doesn't have a sexy ending. It's like, well, the ending, it's the same thing of like, you know, five strategies to homeschool your kid. In the below right like it's it's that thing except longer, right? No, I like that. I like that

If it gets people to stick around and that bodes in favor of making it pretty short. Then it would say like, OK, here's kind of just a first draft of. I'll work on it. I think I can do something with this. That's a good idea. I like that. And I'm just going to do one clip for most of these podcast episodes. Okay. Well, actually, something to mention about this. So I have a buddy who has been trying to build up

stuff. And he has run entirely kind of like against what I would have assumed it worked, which is he is publishing like four or five times on Instagram and Tick Tock. Okay. Every day, he's just generating a shit ton of clips. And you can look at his metrics and you can see that he is sneaking up.

And it's like, wow, that's interesting. I never would have recommended that, especially on Instagram. But it seems to be working, but it is definitely working on TikTok, for sure. And so, you know, his philosophy fundamentally is, I don't have bad clips, I publish everything.

He has no ego about the ones that get 12 views and and sometimes they get 5000 and he has $100 So, I would say, I looked at that, his metrics enough to say. Man, if you have the output, I would be less picky. about which one is the one making it, especially if it's all the same effort, right?

If it's like, no, bro, I don't have time to make that many clips. Okay, that's the that's the reason not to do it. But if you're making them or backing away from the table. because you don't think they're good. I would say, go for it and see what happens. Like the one that you said is wonkish. That's what got me thinking about this. Cause maybe you would find.

a cohort of like people who were just into it. They're like, oh, this is exactly the kind of shit I've been looking for. Right. Super inside baseball, super, you know, like that's how you find a niche.

Yeah. All right. And if those are clips that your VA can do too, that might be the benefit. Revisit this one Chris Vassell. This is the dyslexia one because I think maybe that you know with the Five Dyslexia Myths. Was that the one we settled on? I think so. Yeah.

The original quotes that I had, let's just take, I already rejected some of them because they, because a lot of them just kind of start off on a note where it's like, what the heck are we talking about? But let's see. It's easy for us as parents to be like, I'm gonna educate my kid and I know all the answers. And I've just experienced so many times, there are moments in my education, opportunities for my kids, when I've had to swallow my pride and recognize there might be a different person that needs to be that second person in their life who's gonna literally say the same things I've said to them.

And this one actually is maybe not too bad. It's just, I'd probably just cut out this beginning part here. And I could actually pull up the actual clip. Let's try listening to this. It's really easy for us as parents to be like, I'm going to educate my kid and I know all the answers. And I just have experienced so many times there are moments in my education opportunities for my kids when I had to swallow my pride and recognize that there might be a different person that needs to be that second person in their life, who's going to literally say the same things that I said to them for the past year at school, but having a second person come in and

Here, do this, do that. It all of a sudden rings through in their ears. I call it the second person theory. It happens all the time in the school world. And I feel like sometimes as a parent, when you're just like, I'm just going to swallow my pride and see if there's somebody else who can meet my kiddo's needs right now and then utilize a tutor to do that.

That's interesting. The second-person theory... Strikes me as an interesting title caption for that. Right, right.

I want to hear what this is, you know, because if you.

Um, what was the original one? It's not mom's fault or something? Um, white kids won't listen to mom. Yeah, so that's, I mean, that's not bad, but it's kind of not giving you anything extra because that first line is about parents. So it's like, I know it's about parents, right?

The second person theory is like, I understand that and then I'm about to hear about parents like, okay, so is it It plays to that desire for a hack, you know, like, oh, give me the hack. Right, right. And again, I think here, her, her, she, we've got some,

with with some yeah, I wouldn't get too crazy with the that stuff personally, but I would say it is something to keep in mind for like if and when You have to give a shit, you have to have the leverage to be able to dictate to a guest like this is what we need, right? But it's like, you know...

It's why things need to look so nice. And it's like, you know, what is the nicest? Set up you've got podcast interviewee. Right, right. Very difficult. And you could see why like podcasters bring people into their studio, it just looks beautiful. Yeah, yeah, I mean, I might be able to.

Just kind of one thing that can work, and this might be a good place to try that. You know, sticky laffy taffy thing and just, you know, sort of shrink this down. Yeah. For a while, I was doing a lot of stuff like, just like this with a little, you know, textured paper background.

It's not quite as grainy. Like I think already this does look a lot better.

Yeah, I got to find that that stock footage library for the. Yeah, give that a shot. Yeah. But I won't do that now. Hey guys, I need 15 more minutes, okay?

Let's see. Well, yeah, this already here is looking. It's looking a lot better. One more thing the other I wanted to check and see if the other clip here. Something about dyslexia.

The only thing I was thinking about dyslexia a second ago was that dyslexia itself is its own filter. And, you know, it affects a small subset of. the population. So I wonder, I guess what I would game out for myself. in a few minutes is like, is there a way of pulling the same emotional triggers?

without it being about dyslexia in the title, so that you could almost extrapolate the learnings to your personal disorder. Like, if you're not dyslexic, but you're depressed, like Because I guess the worst part about the Dyslexia title is that you better...

Want to know about dyslexia, right? Like, if you don't care about dyslexia, then you're not in. But if you kind of care about something that can be more broadly applicable.

then you might be able to use dyslexia as a way of explaining people jump the gun on this or that disease or whatever. I'm just, that's kind of abstract, but like, that would be something to consider. I think about this in context of like my camera stuff, where it's like,

If I'm making a camera review about X camera, you better care about that camera. Otherwise, you're not going to watch this fucking video. Right, right. And how do I make this more broadly appealing? This is the this is my favorite camera of all time. Okay, now I'm going to get a lot more people.

Come to this video then as opposed to the Sony a7R V is the best camera I've ever used. That might be less intriguing, right? Because people want to know what it is, they kind of want to compare it to No, that's that's good. I mean, I just took a chunk of your transcript. I wish I'd gotten that that last part in because I think that was also

A perfect example of how to universalize the interest here. Um, so if we like, okay, the myth that's destroying struggling students, I think one of the biggest myths is that struggling students can't learn. I think, did that change? Well, it actually changed the language. I think one of the biggest myths is that students with dyslexia can't learn to read. So that's actually what the transcript says. So maybe this isn't quite the right applicable one. I mean, if this is like truly, truly about dyslexia, then, you know.

It's going to be where it's going to be. But something to consider that like your title, whether it's a YouTube video title or like the on-screen, you know, headline caption. That can bring people in but it also is its own inherent filter. And what can you do to make that as broadly appealing as possible?

Despite the fact that like the underlying subject matter is truly pretty specific. Right, right, right. Are you up for an experiment? Or do you mind if I just, again, borrow this exactly? And I'm going to say one more thing here. Note, you cannot. I've changed the actual content of the transcript that is set in stone because it's what we're actually working with.

Because this is, this is genius. I mean, this stuff, like your, your words get, uh, get converted into my, uh, my prompts oftentimes. And if I had been. More diligent after each session, I'd probably go in and tweak everything that we talk about to be a little bit, a little bit closer because.

That's the real art of prompt engineering. I'd say it's 90% examples, and then the remaining 10% is sort of how you craft the instructions. But if you can come up with good examples of input-output, Then you can get incredible results.

Let's see... Dyslexia myth... The most damaging myth parents here... When everyone says your child can't, they're wrong. Things like that So the and and this might be an example where take the exact same video right dyslexia video Yeah, make the title we're planning on and then make an alternate and publish one this week and one next

Yep. And, and just see, you know, like, how would that work? Does one work better? And we'll be able to look at the views week over week and just see like, did we see anything discernibly different there? Or is it generally the same amount? Okay. Alright, sounds good.

I mean, there's several more episodes in the queue here. We've already looked at We did Bend and Crane last week. We've done, I don't want to spend any more time on Corridi Angelis. Daryl Stinson. This one I probably haven't done enough. Uh, kind of preliminary work on this one to really know what the episode is about. So maybe I'll, I'll hold off on that. Uh, one other thing I was just trying to remember is when I sent you that one video of the horse talking head, you had sent me the tool for that.

And I think it was part of the Instagram universe. It was like there. Oh, Instagram edits, it's called. It's called Instagram edits. And there is a thing called restyle. I believe it's called- Yeah, restyle. That's the feature. Okay.

And then I think maybe our next meeting I want to get back to Just general, like if we're talking about trying to put out three, four, or five reels a day. I think maybe I still need to overcome this block. creating with any sort of, let alone volume, just getting some more prototypes out there. And I kind of keep coming back to...

You know, I don't want to lean too heavily on my phone. Camera roll. I don't want to lean too heavily on myself as a talking head unless I can somehow get it so that I'm speaking through Ed or something like that. I mean, I could still try some where I'm talking and I hold the little microphone and I comment on a trend. I should actually try a few of those because it'll be a good exercise for me to just overcome my stage fright or something.

Well, yeah, I think it's it to me, it's humorous to hear you say you've seen tricks. I've seen you on camera. You're good. Okay, like, so I wouldn't worry about that. I think that you're well, well, well above the bar of needing to worry about how good you are on camera.

You know, it could be as simple as any of these podcast clips and you green screen yourself on top just pointing. Somebody is kind of co-signing that this is valuable information. Right, right, right. That might be a way of doing it. And also the it doesn't even need to be in

The horse open ed style, but maybe try a video with the restyle thing of something that's broadly appropriate. There's like a marble person one, right? Just something interesting. There's a couple different creatures and, you know, read a 15 second monologue.

or something that somebody, a host has already said, but now you read it in your voice. And like, you know, there's no way to screw this up. I would say just throw noodles at the wall there and just see. If you can get any kind of uptick on anything. I mean right now I feel is the time for

Like an AI character land grab. If I had that at my disposal, I would definitely be trying to. Yeah, all right, make it happen there. Because it feels like, you know, one of these is going to bubble to the top and you like, Oh, that that guy is great. Like the

The Sasquatch one, the Bigfoot one, that's kind of worked. And I think it's just whether or not that has legs. Right, right. Well, my idea is still to do almost like... Make it a little bit lo-fi intentionally, like have it generate the video of the talking head and it's gonna put in whatever background you'd expect from a...

a horse, but then do like the green screen effect on the horse and make it like the horse is kind of trying to be an influencer in the style of these other talking heads, something like that. Yeah. Um, I mean, it's a very old meme, obviously, but you've seen like the rubber horse head.

It's a different vibe. It's kind of more in the meme. culture universe. But, you know, there's, God, there. I feel like for two decades I've been chasing this idea of a puppet that I can control. I love the idea of Triumph, the insult comic. Like, I can't tell you how often. Are you familiar with him? Yep. Okay. I can't tell you how often I think about him.

Because if you have him at your disposal and you can use him for anything, you're done. You're done. You could talk about Nabisco, you could talk about pop culture, you could go live on the street, like that's it like That could be huge. And all you've got to do is make that. So maybe there's a horse...

stuffed animal that you can find and you can green screen that and you could just puppet it. You know, like, there's endless kind of things like that, where all you really need to do is be able to have a creature that can talk on your behalf, or indicate on your behalf, you know, even with like a stupid little hoof, like the way tribe I'm not sure how familiar you are. He's got the puppet but he also has that there's a stick

And so off camera, you could have a paw come in, is how triumph works. So it's like a two-handed puppet, and you can point at things, you can touch people, you know, you can do all kinds of stuff. Yeah.

Well, let me get back to you with something next week. Okay. Or Friday. Friday, Friday. Yeah. That should work. I'll be in LA, but I'm totally available. Oh, yeah? Are you sure? I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah, no, for sure, no problem. Good deal. It'll be, but it'll, yeah, it'll be the same time, but it'll be earlier for me, so it'll be noon.

Right? What time do we do it? Sorry. Now my big kids want to say hi. You're just getting to see the whole family today. How are you? I guess they can't hear you, but yeah, go ahead. Okay, so it'll be 1 p.m., 1 p.m. Pacific time, so I'll do it at 1, yeah.

Got it.

And if for any reason I happen to be late because my computer has not reliably adjusted time zone things and when to notify me, just text me. Because I'm absolutely planning on it. I'm just trusting that all of my gear auto understands. I am now in Pacific time and all of my dates and times and alerts.

Yeah, I think it will. I always enjoy your social media recommendations. I'm still, I was re-watching that Paul Newman. I'm all ears. Yeah, what have I been coming across recently? I've been watching the Casey Neistat vlogs again, I'll tell you that I I have this thing I'm trying to crack for myself where like I would love to be uploading YouTube videos more consistently. Yeah. And

I had a semi-breakthrough this weekend where my workflow pipeline of going out and capturing stuff on the street with the gear, being able to sync all that audio up after the fact, so I was able to edit the vlog that I published this morning. in like four hours yesterday. And I was like, oh shit, that was fast.

for me. And so I'm wondering how often I can do that. Maybe a lot more frequently. And a lot of that came from like, I need to watch how Casey does this. Not that mine is anywhere near as good, but. I think I have a sense of it.

Interesting. I'll check him out. I, I, yeah, I've never really watched his stuff, but... He's basically, he's kind of credited as making the first daily vlog, even though he didn't, but he like really revolutionized the genre. Right, right. So, yeah man. But like always man, I'm around if you have any questions or want to run anything by me, just hit me up.

I'll be traveling a little bit on Thursday, but otherwise. Okay. Awesome. Thanks as always, Andrew. It's a pleasure. You got it, man. You got it. All right. Talk to you soon. Bye-bye.
