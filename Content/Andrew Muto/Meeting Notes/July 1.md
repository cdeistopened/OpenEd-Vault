Summary

This meeting focused on optimizing podcast content for social media, particularly transforming long-form podcast episodes into shorter, more engaging clips for platforms like YouTube and Instagram.

### Content Repurposing Strategy

- Create shorter 6-8 minute clips from 30-40 minute podcast episodes to get "more bites at the apple"
- Consider extending some clips to 8+ minutes for YouTube algorithm optimization (additional ad breaks)
- For Instagram, shorter content generally performs better, but can flex up to 60 seconds when needed
- Implement a "list format" with visual numbering and sound effects for certain content types
- Try starting clips with the punchline rather than building up to it

### Podcast Episodes Discussion

- **Benton Crane Episode**: Focus on the George Washington story about his early military failures and comeback
    - Potential title: "From Screw-Up to Legend: George Washington's Biggest Failure"
    - Key angle: Most people don't know Washington made major mistakes early in his career
- **Marketing Clip**: "Why entertainers make better marketers"
    - Convert into a numbered list format with visual indicators
    - Key points: Marketing is mechanical, but entertainment is nuanced; today's audiences aren't captive
    - Connection to Harmon Brothers (Poo-Pourri campaign) could be leveraged
- **Katie Kimball Episode**: Focus on anxiety in kids and parenting approaches
    - Key insight: Helicopter parenting leads to anxiety when kids feel they lack agency
    - Second clip about letting kids fail with low stakes before giving them higher-risk responsibilities

### Title and Thumbnail Optimization

- Consider direct appeal titles: "If your kid hates school, please watch this"
- Test provocative angles: "George Washington was a screw-up"
- Use thumbnail text to create curiosity: "Break the rules" or "My best tips"
- Avoid assuming titles or thumbnails that don't work mean the content isn't good - test multiple versions
- Consider A/B testing different titles and thumbnails for the same content

### Social Media Collaboration Strategy

- Collaborations with experts like Coach Meg Thomas have boosted engagement
- Consider inviting more expert contributors to Open Ed Daily
- Explore more collaborative reels where Open Ed is listed as a collaborator or vice versa
- Ghostwriting articles for expert contributors who don't want to write themselves

### Action Items

- [ ] Research examples of successful podcast clip screen text formats
- [ ] Review on-screen caption size and formatting on mobile devices
- [ ] Create and publish clips from the Benton Crane episode with optimized titles/thumbnails
- [ ] Implement the list format for the comedians/marketers clip
- [ ] Reorder the 6th grader's marketing pitch clip to start with the punchline
- [ ] Skip the meeting on July 4th and potentially reschedule for Thursday

Notes  

  

Transcript  

with like every brand on the planet, like if you're making a new movie, like the characters are in Fortnite. So it's Instead of making a movie about the video game, movies and pop culture come to Fortnite and be like, can you include our characters? Sabrina Carpenter's in it, the new Superman is in it, Transformers, Star Wars was last season.

Anything that's anything and it's a weird mix, right? There's the really the only holdouts that I can think of are like Nintendo. But everybody else is in there. Yeah, it's funny because it's almost like turning the game into a platform. Thinking about how that's the buzzword for, you know, every company wants to be a platform company. And I think the same is true of Open Ed where we're trying to find ways. And one of the things that has just come about in the last week.

I know that part of the marketing team's strategy for the next, well, just going forward, I guess, is going to be kind of like inviting more contributions. from other sort of well-known people on their topics of expertise, so they'll be a contributor to the Open Ed Daily. And in the case where they don't necessarily want to have to write the article, I'm going to be doing the ghostwriting for them.

Which I that's my bread and butter and like I'm super comfortable in that zone, but it's just sort of it's occurring to me now and also with the podcast, which I think that's our agenda for today is to kind of go over some of these upcoming podcast episodes.

I think, you know, we you've already talked about how we want to try to. prepare the host and guests to deliver the right content for the clip strategy. But I almost wonder if there could even be, this is probably overcomplicating it, to try to branch out into other, you know, like collaborative real formats. But for, for one thing, I think that that's, you know, there are a lot of

We have gotten a lot of traction with Coach Meg Thomas when she signs on as a collaborator on one of our Instagram posts. That is an instant boost for us. We might think about how we could do more of those kinds of things. and maybe kind of partner on a short form reel where we list them as a collaborator or vice versa.

I don't know. I mean, I think collaborations could be really powerful, especially if your collaborator has an audience. Right. Right. Yeah. It's it. It can definitely be a signal boost because you're going to get in front of a a sizable portion of their audience, particularly if the video is any good. Right, right. I think, you know, if you get to that point, I think we could talk through some of the technicalities of.

how that collaborator system works on Instagram, because there's been a couple things that I've learned over time that have helped. So we can chat that through if necessary. Cool. Perfect. All right. Well, then you want to kind of dive into the podcast or anything else? Yeah. Yeah. No, I thought I thought the podcast stuff would be great to get into just kind of see.

What you've got on what you've got available what we can turn into content now and then also what we can plan for the future right like what can we set up for the other things I was looking at your YouTube stuff and it struck me that Your YouTube videos are all 30 to 40 minutes, let's say, right? And that inside of every YouTube video that is 30 or 40 minutes, there's probably.

a handful of six or seven minute moments, right? You know, when you see, you see this in the comedian podcast world already, right? But like, and it struck me that, wow, you know what, you might be able to get more bites at the apple by by doing what you're doing.

But also Making you know, find a nice three to eight minutes total in every part and a handful of those and then and then you get another bite at the apple for another sexy thumbnail and title. And the worst case is that you get more data for like, what are people interested in? Oh, every time I talk about this shock title, it works, or whatever. That's the worst case. The best case is that, you know, this strategy may actually work, that like instead of deploying once a week or whatever it is, I can now deploy five times a week.

Totally. Totally. Yeah. And so, I mean, I just post the full podcast on YouTube and Spotify. Spotify also has some kind of clips feature. I don't really know what that's optimized for. Like, I wouldn't want to post the six to eight minute ones as episodes in addition to, but just focused on YouTube.

I like that idea a lot. And I think that I've got the bandwidth for it just because I see that, yeah, so many of our podcast episodes, the entire thing is kind of a snooze fest to listen to. Like, I don't even listen to them. Um, but, uh, there's oftentimes really solid six minute clips. Uh, yeah. And I think, you know, it's, it gives you another leg in that stool that a podcast is now giving you even more content. You're already getting the short form stuff, which we're working on.

You're obviously getting a long form, but then there's kind of this middle of, you know, you can find a great five minutes, maybe find multiple. And it kind of gets back to that core of Searching for what works in terms of thumbnail and title combo, and that'll just give you more bites at the Apple. Yeah, for sure. Let me just see one thing. Okay, good. My.

My VA did cut this one because this is the one, basically my status right now, I'm like technically on paternity leave and I'm kind of taking the opportunity of having the decks cleared and I'm not going to be responsible for so many dailies this month.

I'm just going to sort of focus on the short form, the reels, kind of tightening everything up and then gearing up to restart the daily come August. And in a sort of leaner format, all that. So now is like a great time to be kind of implementing some of these changes. This is, I'm still going to be posting a podcast, one podcast episode per week. So I'm hoping that I can basically schedule like bulk process.

We can get through as many episodes. But basically I think, you know, we should be looking at title and thumbnail. Clips and captions in particular, on-screen captions, and then if there's time we could also kind of get into like the text portion of the caption. My working assumption has been that the sort of, you know, the opening hook in the script itself and the on-screen are...

90% of what's determining whether somebody sticks around, with the supporting text being mostly for the algorithm. You're talking about the description copy? Yeah, the description copy. Right, yeah. Yep. Yes, I agree with that. Okay. Yes, that's yeah, you're right All right, cool. And then actually for this one maybe we'll spend the most time on this just because it's the timeliest and we could even see what what a You know three to eight minute clip from this would look like not necessarily cutting the whole thing, but just looking at from a transcript perspective because this episode was

little bit all over the map or like there were there were two or three very distinct beats. So I can imagine you know some of those beats being good to To convert, um, but yeah, so basically we've got, uh, the, the calendar for the podcast. This is my calendar. So if I'm going to release one every Thursday, I've got episodes in the queue, uh, through August 7th. And are those already shot? How many of these are shot?

They're all shot. They're all shot. Okay. So yeah, we're just what we've what we've got is what we've got, we'll make the most of it. And if there's not any good clips, like if we look at one, and we're just kind of like, that one kind of like, Doesn't leave me feeling anything. Then I would say, let's just cut it. Let's just like not, not even really bother trying to polish turd. Okay.

So, starting with Benton Crane, the background on this one, he's, we have, for some reason we seem to have a lot of people from kind of like the filmmaking, entertainment world speaking about, this guy in particular, he's connected with Angel Studios, which I think is a Mormon company.

They created The Chosen. Actually, I'm not sure if they're, it doesn't matter, but, but our founder kind of has these random connections to people in the, in the LDS or Mormon world. Um, so that this guy is like a producer of the movie young George Washington that comes out on July 4th.

Um, and what else do they talk about? They talk about, yeah. Okay. Young George Washington. They talk about kind of how you don't really need permission anymore to go out and make a movie. Actually, that's something that you've kind of talked about just how like.

The whole industry has changed. I think with this one, with the title, I'm trying to sort of balance like relevance to our audience and the topic. with sort of keywords and different things like that. We can start with the clips so you get a sense of the flavor of the episode before going to the title.

Or we could start with the title and kind of back out what are the best clips, but I think. Yeah, I mean, I think let's take a listen and kind of get a sense of what. Some of this is like, do you have some moments queued up? Yeah, I do. You want to do? Okay, great. Because I say we listen and then kind of let that inform what we're gonna do. But before I forget, you mentioning the fact that it's

This is at least tangentially related to an upcoming movie release. That's another thing that I would leverage. I just assume that they are going to do some kind of marketing. And there may be a way of piggybacking on that. Right. Right. Right. So if it's using the poster for a thumbnail or.

You know, like whatever it is, whatever ways that you can kind of leverage, you know, think about this like a press junket and like, how would you get in front of that? That's the kind of stuff where it's like, you know, let me see where I can suck up audience and assuming.

Do you have any reservations with playing towards his audience in the short term? Okay. So assuming that's not an issue, then like rock and roll, then I would say See what these people are already going to be searching for and then you can kind of like lay in the cut. Okay. You know, you're kind of a part of that media machine. Yeah. Yeah, it's funny because this movie, I would have assumed...

That it's going to be sort of a, I thought it was coming out on July 4th. That was everything I was told. Yeah. And here's an article talking about, but there's like, I can't even find the movie poster. So it might be, I don't know, sort of a B-level movie, but we'll figure that out. At least there's this, so there's something. Yeah. Okay, let's check it out. Okay. Where were we? Here we go. Nope, that's not it.

Descript.

I'll just find it in here. Benton Crane

And the first clip, um, let's go with the George Washington one, the failure that created a legend. And I actually haven't even, I wrote these, but I haven't watched them since my edit since my VA. George Washington, before he became president, before he became general as a young military officer out to tell the French to leave and the interaction goes horribly wrong.

It's on 1.5 speed. Let me slow that down.

George Washington, before he became president, before he became general, has a young military officer out to tell the French to leave. And the interaction goes horribly wrong. George screws up in the worst possible ways and accidentally sets off a global war.

Massive blunder. career-destroying type mistakes here, and this is a story about how George goes from hitting rock bottom and making the worst possible mistakes to turning that around in this character-defining moment where he ends up in a battle, and General Braddock is killed, and things are going terribly wrong.

And George needs to lead an evacuation. He ends up with three bullet holes in his coat and a couple more in his hat. But he goes unscathed. He gets the troops together, executes a successful retreat, saves hundreds of lives, proves his bravery, his valor.

This is the beginning of the legendary George Washington. That's cool. That's a cool story.

Yeah, I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I would have anything to cut from that. I mean, like, I think it's, it's set up really well. It is kind of a tease, you know, to more of his adventures, let's call it, right? I didn't know that. My initial reaction was, oh my dad would love this shit out of this too from a demo point of view. 40 plus year old men, you know, love history, you know, you age into loving the history channel. And I wonder about women. Right, right.

But. It's hard to argue with this clip. It's just like, who is it for would be a question, but it's good. And it's like this. Could be an example of, you know, this is what it looks like to shotgun. This is what it looks like to throw noodles at the wall.

We're like, I'm trying to find hits everywhere. And this might resonate with an audience we didn't expect. Or women may, who even knows? But I like that. I'm not sure I would change that. I mean, I think it is what it is. Like it's a it's I think it's the best version of what one could think wouldn't benefit from

Rearranging stuff or putting things earlier. No, I mean, that was really it was all really well put. I mean, there are a couple of words in there that you can say. Well, you don't need to. Yeah, I can smooth it out a little bit. Like the one I noticed was massive blunder career destroying type mistakes. Like I would, you could take a type, you know, like, but on the other hand, that just saves you, you know, like less than a second, I'm not sure.

  

I don't know. I think that's pretty clear.

Yeah, the caption, this actually wasn't the caption that I had originally come up with. I had come up with, he started a global war, like George Washington started a global war at 22, something, I don't know. That's not yet. No, that's good. Well, I think the most shocking part is like that second graph there, right? Where he's like, George Washington screwed up. It's like, oh, shit. What? Like.

George Washington was a screw-up as a headline. That is interesting that I didn't know. Yeah. And I'm just assuming it's true. Like this is, you know, like I would watch this technology and I'd be like, Holy shit, I never I know. And I take it all the way to the bank. This sounds totally legit. Yeah.

So, um, that's an angle. Um, let's go with it. Let's go with it. I would say we could keep brainstorming, but, but I'd rather kind of get more, um, More volume in this session than affecting any individual, but I think that's a good one. I like that. One last thing. I know how much you like those illustrated...

old timey images, right, that you've shown a few times. This may be a good example of if you had enough of them, right, to kind of make a montage as he's talking to kind of make it a little bit more interesting. Okay, now, you don't need to do it, you could do both, publish this one, and then do that one on the side and publish that one in two weeks or something right, like

No one will know, you know, and it's just this is a great example of how maybe you could use that this is perfect for that style. I like that.

Because I think it'll be good. So these other two are completely different topics. This one I thought was kind of interesting. It's really not that hard to train a marketer, but it's really hard to train an entertainer. And so we actually found we would go out and we would hire comedians.

improv comedians or stand-up comedians. Marketing is actually not that hard. You provide value, you present the problem, you show a solution, you build some credibility, you overcome some concerns, you have a call to action. It's almost mechanical. It's almost you're following a recipe.

But the entertainment side of it, that is much more nuanced.

There's so much of that that's good. This guy's really good. Like he understands how to set up a story. Assuming this is in order. Assuming you didn't reorder this. No, I don't think so. It would be interesting. Is there any more there as to why comedians do that better? Right, right. That's the question. And I can look in the transcript.

That's what I was thinking the same thing, that it just needs like a little bit more. And I'm not sure that marketing... You know, I could teach somebody marketing, but I can't teach somebody how to be an entertainer. Right, right. And it's like, okay, so why is that? Why is the entertainment part valuable? Yeah, yeah.

But like if we wanted to expand on this clip with a little bit more content, what were you just saying? I would say, I think that it'd be interesting to understand why entertainment has value because the premise of this clip is That you could teach anybody marketing, but you can't teach everybody entertainment. And it's like, okay, so what is the value in entertainment? And so it would be great if this ended in a way that said.

You know, this is why comedians are particularly well suited as marketers. Right, right. Something about why entertainers are particularly well. suited as marketers. This will just help us kind of dig up like some other material that we might be able to copy and paste.

See, okay, so here's the setup. If you think back to the 1990s and before advertisers kind of thought of their audience as captive and it's like, Oh, you know, my audience is there. They're not going anywhere. They're kind of stuck. So I'm kind of forced.

So I'm just going to kind of force feed them. Well, that's not the world we live in today. Whether it's a skip button on YouTube or just scroll right past on Facebook or Instagram, you have to earn people's attention. They're not captive. And the way I do that is I have to entertain them.

I have to make them smile. I have to make them laugh. I have to provide value. That sounds good. That sounds like that's headed in the right direction. Just to explain why entertainers are particularly well suited. Well, and this one could be, if it's too long for a short clip, we could try turning this one into a longer segment where maybe it even has a little bit more of the back and forth between him and Isaac.

Yeah, I mean, you can definitely flex up to 60 seconds on Instagram. Okay, I don't, I don't do it because I don't even kind of have the content that lasts that long. It's the same thing. So it's like shorter is better. Right? But if you've got a you know, 60 seconds is still totally plausible. I don't want to shy you away from that. It's just not something that I generally have the guts to do. But you have a lot of

You have a lot of material here. Yeah. Okay. So it's basically just, it's all this and then where does it end on faces? Put a smile on your on your face, but it was all after that.

Yeah, so I'll just I can paste this to this composition and now. It adds it in here. So now we're up to well now we're up to two minutes and 30 seconds, but there's probably a lot that I can cut in here. So I'll hold off on actually making those edits because that would take a full like 15 minutes probably or 10 minutes.

But I like that. I think that's a good fix. Any thoughts on the. The captions are on screen. Why comedians are the best marketers.

That's not bad.

I don't, I, depending on what he says, you know, when I was looking through your Instagram earlier today, I was thinking to myself, boy, I sure would love to see some lists in here. You know, like five reasons comedians are the best marketers. And you don't even need them to necessarily set it up. But you can, if there are five reasons or three reasons, you could say three reasons and then.

Put a one on the screen, put a two on the screen, put a three on the screen as he's going through different points. You know, comedians are very good at entertaining one, they make people laugh too. Like, you could just for the hook for like, I'm waiting for the three. I'm waiting for the three reasons. Um, that could be another thing. Yeah.

OK, I'll think about that. I'll think about one whether I'd have the bandwidth to do the edit there, because that could be good. I mean, I wonder. If we were to just pitch it to Claude and see like, okay, so this is the script.

Is there a way to turn this to turn the caption into something like five reason why entertainers make the best marketers where we do a little ding sound effect with the number on the screen every time he mentioned something? Um, the only edits that we can make are deleting and rearranging. You can't add in any new words, keep the script intact.

That last part is just to make sure that it doesn't hallucinate. Working material that we don't have to work with. They're harder to train than marketers. Marketing is mechanical. Entertainment is nuanced. Today's audience isn't captive. Fun comes first. Entertainment earns attention.

Well, but wait, I guess, I guess we could do that. Like, like these are just, these would be captions that come on the screen each time it does a little ding. I'm going to try to pitch this to my VA and see if she can see if she can turn this around. Yeah, I mean, it's just a list format. The list format could be really powerful if you're just delivering info.

Right, right.

Yeah, I think that's good. I mean, this, this could also be like a, this is a great piece of content for other platforms, including the newsletter too. So here's what it would look like. It would be like, it's really not that hard to train them. Train a marketer. Was that the first line? Yeah, but it's really hard to train an entertainer. So, well, wait, I guess we'd have to, it would have to. Yeah, I'm not sure why that's good.

That's the only one that. You know, five reasons why entertainers make the best marketers. I'm not sure that first one supports that premise. Right, right, right. But otherwise... That would have to be...

Is this right? They're harder to train than, yeah, I see. Cause it, no, that, that's not, cause I'd have to, I'd have to tinker with that a little, but I'm going to, it could be, yeah. You can also do three. Right, right, right. Three reasons, right? Like...

We have three reasons and the first one as you have it is not really a reason and the first couple of seconds of the video need to set up with the main on-screen title card at the beginning. So get rid of that first one and then pick the other one that's the weakest and rewrite the script.

and include the captions with each ding as it goes through the video.

So here we go. It's really not that hard to train a marketer, but it's really hard to train an entertainer. So we actually found we would go out, our comedians, improv comedians or stand-up comedians, Show 1. Marketing is mechanical. Entertainment is nuanced. Marketing is actually not that hard. You provide value. You have call to action. It's almost mechanical. It's almost you're following a recipe, but the entertainment of it. And then 2.

Audiences aren't captive anymore. Um, whether it's a good one or YouTube or on YouTube, or just a score right past on Facebook and Instagram, you have to earn people's attention because We could almost do like in the in the intro three reasons why entertainers make the best marketers from the creator of the Pooh Paree campaign or something like that because everybody knows.

Everybody knows that ad campaign. Yeah. He did poopery. I guess so. Harmon brothers. Yeah. Or maybe. Interesting. Maybe, maybe he didn't specifically, but his, the, the agency that he. That's very cool. Yeah, yeah. All right, cool. I think I've got and you know something just to mention this.

It's plausible to make the same video three times and just change the caption and space them out. And try to see which one works better, right? Like I wouldn't give up on a post that you feel is good. Cause like maybe the hook was wrong or like maybe the, that caption was wrong.

Try it again like from the maker of the Pooh Paree marketing campaign. Yeah, somehow I think maybe this reveals a character flaw in me or some kind of way that I'm looking at this whole process wrong. But like to me, when I think about, it's a bit like, you know, hiking back on the same trail that you went out or something. For me, the thought of coming back to an old clip and remaking it.

It's kind of like, let's just move on to the next thing. Let's just, you know, keep moving forward. But do you think there really is some value in that? I really do, because I think you You discover that like, it isn't there could be 85% of what's working, but it's just the beginning part that that you need to fix. Yeah. And if you can fix that, then they get the rest of it. When you see a video that has low view count.

It's not even really a testament to the creative, because they didn't watch it. If they watched it, then you would have a better position. If you have a shit ton of views, but the comments are filled with hate, Then you know you may possibly have shitty creative, or at least polarizing creative, right? But if you have like low views, it means nobody even watched it because the algo

The people just abandoned the video they swiped away likely your swipe away rates really really high. So people didn't even really watch the meat of it. It's really, you know, like it's like a restaurant with a bad sign. It's like, well, the restaurant might be great, but it's like change the sign and they may come in. Yeah, I don't know. When I, like, when I look back.

I don't know. I'm just scrolling back through Instagram and looking like, okay, what's one that has under 500 views? Um, I mean, sometimes like one of these, this one I think did better on YouTube for some reason, but, um, I, I would just kind of rather march towards.

Continuous improvement. I think I think it's not a either or I would say it would be an and that and it and it really does mean only if you think the creative is really Good, or it has proven successful somewhere else. I'll give you an example for me is my Ray Ban mirrors video on Instagram, it's going to hit a million views on on Tick Tock. It's got 600 views. And it's like, so what the fuck was that?

How is that possible? And I think I didn't put any hashtags on it because I thought I was being clever. And I think maybe I fucked that up. I think that maybe I I made a mistake. And it's also possible that Ray Ban and meta is a word that Tick Tock's like, no, you don't talk about Facebook on our platform. We don't care. Right. So it's like, Oh, okay, got it. Maybe it's that. But like something's going on because that video performed really, really well on Instagram and got a lot of comments.

It wasn't like meta just signal boosted because it's like one of our products. Like it gets I get comments every three minutes. Yeah, still. Yeah. So like something's up and it struck it struck me. It's got to be my fault, right? It's got to be something I did. You know, it could be posting time, it could be lack of description and captions, whatever.

But and I do that I have a handful of videos that have like performed really, really well somewhere. And I'll try them again elsewhere. with like micro tweaks, usually in the set of text. Right, right. Okay, I'll consider that. But only if you love it. Don't do it because you feel like, now, shit, now I'm going back through all my stuff and trying everything again. No, no, no. Only if you're like, yo, this is a good video.

This is like a solid video. Yeah. Well, let's take a look at this is the third clip from this episode. Okay. And I'm looking at it and it doesn't really feel like

I put together this little pitch video where she was saying don't hire a middle-aged man from Google. That's creepy. Instead, hire me. You know, your kids will love it. So now she's done two or three of them, and I think it's kind of a tool set that she knows she can use to break through the noise and get to people when she needs to.

It's really effective. That's actually not bad. That's good. I think it's a shame that that great part comes in the middle after a lot of context. Like if somehow you could start the video with, my daughter says, don't hire a middle-aged. Man from Google, that's creepy. Hire me instead. Right, right. Yeah. Let me see. Did I give the full, let me give, let me just give the full transcript here and just see if there's a way to.

To rearrange this.

Where was it? It was this one.

I want to see if I can rework this clip to put the punchline about don't hire a middle-aged man from Google at the beginning. Is there more supporting context from the full transcript to where we could rearrange this again without adding anything in, only deleting and rearranging?

And then we can also just in one one prompt kind of see what some three to eight minute clips might look like.

Start with the punchline. Don't hire a middle-aged man from Google. That's creepy. Instead, hire me. You know, your kids will love it. That was actually the third pitch video that my daughter had done, her first pitch. So that could work. That was actually... Yeah.

...my daughter had done. Her first one was... Uh, let's see...

Okay, so there's some kind of discontinuity here the way that it did it, but I think it would work I think I don't think people would really remember Something like this.

It could be... Here's a few possibilities. This 6th grader's marketing pitch is genius. Yes, something like that. She's been closing deals since 6th grade. Yeah, I think the sixth graders marketing pitch is genius. My head was in daughters, but that's probably better. Okay.

Especially for you, especially for Open Ed. I've been wanting to try something. I don't know if this is going to work at all, but they have changed like. Actually, let me come over to the full thing here. I want to see, I don't think this is going to work, but like, can you create this clip? I'm going to see if Descript can actually stitch together.

I am fascinated by this. This is so alien to me. It's like I'm watching somebody in the future. Well, it didn't work. But soon enough, soon enough, I could say. You got the first part, but not the other parts.

Anyway, we won't get bogged down with that, but I like this a lot. I feel like we've taken all three of these clips to the next level. But I did want to see like, what would be some possible three to eight minute clips, do you think that's the sweet spot? Yeah, I think on YouTube if you can get above eight minutes like eight minutes ten seconds eight eight minutes is where the additional ad breaks are

So maybe like 8-12 or 8-15? hit eight minutes if you really have a two minute clip, I wouldn't do that. Okay. But if you can get to eight minutes, that means that it is the operating urban legend stuff around the algo on YouTube right now is that it can add more

Ad breaks, and so it will prioritize that video over, say, a two-minute. Right, right. Okay. Um, yeah, I mean, I think... There probably is. I'd like, let's look at these and then we can have it generate the script for one or two of them that we like the best. You may even... You know, have it suggest a thumbnail layout. Sure. Sure. Yep. Yep. Title and thumbnail.

And this, this thing here has a set of YouTube. Well, it's got actually, you know what, I need to update this project with, um, I have a new document for YouTube and thumbnails. This is my this is what's really blowing my mind recently is just the ID ease these these coding tools where

You have your code base over here. I've got folders with all my frameworks, and then I can call up the frameworks in this agent window over here, where it can just think through all kinds of tasks. I can pick which model I use. But I'm just- And what app is that?

What app is the one you're using? This is Windsurf. Windsurf. Cursor is probably the most famous. But there's new ones coming out. I think Cursor and Windsurf are really the two that have emerged at the front of the pack for serious developers. And now there's one Claude Code, which is used internally at Anthropic, the company that built Claude, that's also pretty powerful.

And that one just plugs directly into any terminal. I don't know. I'm not a programmer. learning the bare minimum that I need to know to get myself into trouble. But let's see. Okay, I'll just paste this. I'll say, okay, let's pick. Let's do the why entertainers make better marketers and the George Washington story as an extended clip. Make it as long as it can be without retaining any fluff and then also suggest a title and thumbnail combination or four or five title and thumbnail combinations for each video.

Reproduce the full script for each one and then write a short YouTube description.

okay so we've got we're just kind of rehashing the clip but it's going to be in longer form and I'm hoping it's going to have a little dialogue

Let's see.

I feel like this is going to end up being too short if it's not.

We're not captive. I mean, we had it at 2 and 1 1⁄2 minutes. Let's see.

Yes, they're effective as an ad, they sold a product, they earned money. But I think, do you agree that these would be better if we could have them as with like a little bit of dialogue and kind of frame them as

Like this one as a monologue just feels a little bit funny.

You mean with the host going back and forth? Yeah, or maybe not. Yeah, I mean, if possible. I mean, I don't...

I think it would just depend on, like, this guy seems particularly good. And I would have listened to his George Washington story for a while. I may be a version where it was cutting to some of that illustration I talked about. But I don't know. I mean, I think I've listened to podcast clips where it's one guy just going on a rant.

Yeah, OK.

I think, I think the purpose of an exercise like this though would be do every version like if there's a version where there's a rant if there's a version where there's back and forth. And then start to see what performs. Because right now it's really it isn't about like, hey, how do I get this one thing out the door that I know will work really well? It's like, well, what will work really well?

Maybe it's seven minute clips with that are much easier to digest. Yeah. So let's take a look at the title and thumbnail combinations. Cause with the actual selection itself, I'll play with that. I might do it with dialogue, but. Um, for the first one, why Harman brothers hired comedians over MBAs. I don't know if Harman brothers really has the name recognition that would agree in that situation, but marketing lessons from squatty potties, ad agency, CEO.

The $100 million marketing secret no one talks about. I don't really love that. That's, that's, oh, you don't? Oh, well, no, I, I don't know. I like the thumbnail here. Hire comedians, not marketers. I think, I mean, you get both of them, right? You get, I mean, if you.

  

You know, there's a certain type of person that clicks on 100 million marketing secret, right, right. And, and the, on one hand, my only criticism be that number seems so big. It's like, well, that's not I don't have those problems, right? Like, I don't need to worry about that. But I find myself clicking on Alex Hermosi stuff all the time. No, for sure. For sure. Mostly out of sick fascination, but it's in that universe.

I'm fascinated by Hermosi because on one hand I smell grifter, but the way his videos are constructed is so fascinating to me. You know, like he is, he's very casual. I can't, I don't get the impression he's reading off any kind of cue cards or any kind of, and it's just, but he's, you know, he'll go on a 48 minute tear.

Yeah. With all kinds of numbers and metrics. The only other time I've ever seen that happen in real life was with somebody who would make the numbers up. And it was like, you know, I used to, I was the creative director for this guy, this kind of co-duo CEO team.

And he would go into pitch meetings where we would pitch like major Hollywood studios to help. So we built this thing called 7-Eleven TV, which was a digital signage platform inside of all the 7-Elevens across the country, two big flat panel TVs, one above the register, one above the coffee station.

And we would sell ads to Pepsi and you know, and everybody and one of them was when Iron Man was coming out and he he looked people in the eye and was like, I just had a conversation with Robert Downey Jr. and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'm looking at him like, that did not happen. That is absolutely not true. But every day, it was like, whatever it takes to close this deal.

And to his credit, unfortunately, that worked more often than it should have. And I remember a couple times being like, bro, laid low on some of this stuff. We're about to go into fucking Warner Brothers. They will know. They know these people better than you know them.

But, and so that's why with Hermosia, I'm always trying to like sniff it out, I was like, is it bullshit? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. Seems like you'd have a lot more fact-checkers in the comments if it was total bullshit, but... Yeah, but some of the numbers are so inside baseball, like our business grew 27%...

You know, month over month, and we had X number of ROI. It's like, there's no fucking way you're coming off off the top of your head with this. Like not 48 minutes straight with no cuts. Like, I don't get it. Title, The 22-Year-Old Who Accidentally Started a World War, Young Washington Portrait, His Mistake Changed History. Do we want to get George Washington in the title or does it not necessarily matter if we've got him in the thumbnail?

Well, I do think given how important he is, I think that if you're not interested in George, you don't want to click on 22-year-old who accidentally started a war and then discovers George Washington. I don't think. You'd be like, wait, what? This is a George Washington story? You know, I thought I was clicking in on something. I don't know. There's some, that's clever. It's kind of a clever bait and switch.

Yeah, it strikes me as that. So that's an edgy idea. Maybe we put that one on the shelf and think on that. That's it's not a bad idea. But it is definitely like outside of the norm. Yeah, yeah. I would my instinct would be if you're going to talk about George Washington, show George Washington on the thumbnail. Right, right.

And also maybe imply something that you've never heard before, right? That he's a screw-up. Oh, that's and then I think I think we might want to just reuse that in the thumbnail like George Washington was a screw up or something, or, yeah, but but that's one idea you know and the other thing I was gonna say though is that like, um,

We know enough about George Washington that he had no career ending mistake. Right. So I think we do. We're playing inside the bounds of pop culture. But if you could fuck with that a little bit, if you could challenge your assumptions, that's where that could work.

Yeah. Like, if he died, you know, it's, it's what we love about the Thomas Jefferson stories that like, oh, he had slave kids. You know, like it runs counter to at least what used to be the pop cultural assumption of a guy like that. Right. I thought he was a saint. Yeah. Right. So it's that idea that maybe he died poor. I'm making this up. Right.

  

George Washington died in bankruptcy. Now I'm listening, right? Well, looking at some of these other ones, I don't know that any of these slap. George Washington's biggest failure, well the biggest failure that made him great, that's interesting. I don't know if the story we're about to hear supports that, but maybe enough. I think it does. I think it does.

But yeah, and then, I don't know, for the thumbnail, his mistakes from screw up to legend or. Something like that.

That's good. From Screw Up to Legend is really interesting, because I think everybody at a minimum would be interested to hear that journey. That's like a classic. dramatic arc. And also, there's a bit of selfishness of like, I'm a, I might be a screwup. How do I become a legend? Right, right, right.

Well, let's, I'm just going to go with this and we'll see how it does. I'm probably just going to, maybe I'll post a couple of versions or a couple of thumbnails or something, but. You could, yeah, you could do the AB test if you want the ABC test. Yeah.

I'm obsessed with those these days. Okay, let's let's go to the next one We are we spent a little bit of time on Cory DeAngelo. So I don't really want to dwell on him

Katie Kimball. This is a woman with an Instagram following, so that might bode in favor of putting a little more attention on her some of her clips. Oh wait, no. The last thing I wanted to do was the full episode title and thumbnail combination for this one that we're just working on.

That's the script for that. This was my idea. You don't need permission. Benton Crane on building the future. I don't know. This is pretty vanilla. But I like the thumbnail. You can just do stuff. Everyone's using that. It's kind of a meme right now. But I don't know how well it really compliments this. It might just be sort of reproducing like permissionless permissionless building or permission. I don't know.

And this is the same guy we just saw, right, about the, um, yeah.

You know, I just happened to look over in my YouTube thing here. And one of the titles is if you're ambitious, and in your 20s, or 30s, please watch this. Okay, right. Oh, shit. That's that's good. So it's like word. Well, if you're like, you know, something could be if you're, if you're feeling lost in your career, let's say if you're feeling lost in this or that or whatever, please watch this. That's

There's something about that, I don't know, gets me. Yeah, yeah.

There's another one here. This guy, this guy just started watching it. The title is I went back to India dot dot dot. It still sucks. I got to watch that, right? Like, how do I not watch that? No, I know. Like, what I'd love to do, because I found, I mean, with AI,

Examples are the most powerful prompting technique. And this has actually been verified in like studies, but I, I just found it intuitively and from other people talking about the same thing that the more rich examples you can give, like that's the best form of, of training.

Um, and in some, like instructions with examples can sometimes the instructions help. Sometimes they don't really, but like. If you just fed 20 examples of thumbnail title combinations that made you click, or the top title and thumbnails as measured by the.

how much better that video performed than the average video on the channel. What kinds of instructions or principles could you distill from the examples? I wonder. Like if you're a creative person in business, please watch this. If you feel like you're following the wrong path, please watch this. If you're drowning in data, but not, let's see.

If your kid hates school, please watch this. I mean, yeah, come on. My wife would click on that in a heartbeat. If your kid hates school, please watch this. So good. Okay, that's good. And then what was the... The suggested thumbnail, well, Benton Smiling, my kids joined bro school. I don't really love that one, but maybe something like skills are greater than credentials or there's another way, something like that.

There's another way. Break the rules for the thumbnail text. Break the rules is interesting.

Let's just say it's true for a second. You know, it's something that said, like, five tips. My five best tips. On the text on the thumbnail, where it's like, Oh shit, so I'm you're imploring me to watch this. And it seems like there's information in here that I can read.

What if we just say like, okay, something like five top five tips, something that indicates that there's information in this video that leads me there. Give me 10 more ideas for thumbnail text. I just want to iterate on this a little bit more.

Because that one I feel like we would have to deliver something in the editing style Maybe not maybe not but like the video in my view doesn't really

Sure.

It could be my best tips, and then you don't need to... Right, right, right.

Yeah, that could work.

All right, let's roll that. Let's go to the next one. Let's go to Katie Kimball. Because right now, I feel like Katie Kimball is weak. Not that the underlying content is weak, just that. I didn't do much with it. It's funny how like on my first pass through I can kind of feel like yeah you know this is good enough and then when I come back and look at it a few days later I'm like

This is just so suboptimal. Well, I mean, I think that that's a good that's a good exercise, man, to do some work and step away from it. Right, right. I think to my detriment, I don't have the patience. And like I make a thing, I'm like, I'm publishing. And if I could just say like, yo, I'm going to wait for a couple days and then look at it again. It's always better when you take another crack. Right, right.

Okay, this one, the real reason American kids are so anxious. Let's watch it. You look at our stats on anxiety, America has fallen off the list of top 20 happiest countries in the world. And it's because of the kids in their teens and 20s, their anxiety is so high.

When we bubble wrap our kids, a lot of parents are very safe, and very protective. And we call it helicopter parenting. Again, super well-intentioned. Parents aren't going out to be like, I'm going to mess up my kid. They're just like, I want to keep my kids safe. It's my job to keep them alive. But it actually makes kids really anxious when people are doing everything for them.

And when they feel like the world is a very scary place because we have to protect them. and you feel like you don't really have agency, you don't really have skills to take care of yourself because someone else has always done it for you. You're kind of like wandering about the world feeling really anxious because you have no control.

Really good. That's really good.

That feels like a good one. As I was watching that I was wondering about the size of all the text. Yeah, screen. Okay.

It might be a little big, but I would get that on your phone. Do you publish via phone, or do you have a tool? I publish on the computer. I would maybe just kind of sideload that onto your phone and take a gut check as to how it feels on the phone. And see, I think what you're trying to do, it should look like everybody else's. Right, right, right. There's no...

I'm going to make mine way different. Different is not the recipe for success, in this case. I suffer through this too, that I try to make mine stand out, but at the same time, I just need it to be what people expect. And sometimes when you're building at this scale, it's so tiny that it's like, oh, I'm just going to scale it up, like when I work on my computer. And then I realized, wow, this is fucking huge on the phone.

Yeah, I feel like at one point I'd copied this template from something that I saw that I liked, but if you have, if you could maybe, and I could do it too, but like... Find a couple of examples of exactly the format of content that we're creating, basically podcast clips. And just make a little bit more of a study of what are they doing with captions. Do the captions hang out for the full length of the video, or do they drop off after the first five seconds?

Do they change the on-screen text, or is it just something that can open up the clip? And I was doing I was trying to poke around a little bit on that and I looked up like what are some of the top And I think it also matters somewhat that the format here is a remote podcast of people doing like, you know Zoom conversation as opposed to an in-person Because that just changes the dynamic a little bit Yeah, I got it.

I got on my list to look at tonight. Let's see what I can find Caption here, on-screen caption, any thoughts?

I mean, it's definitely clear. It's not particularly sexy.

Like the number one reason. Right, right. Um, and then I'm not sure what American, I mean, If you're in a demographic that feels strongly that Americans are behind the eight ball versus the Chinese, let's say, American's gonna resonate. If you're not, I'm not sure what American brings to the table, because I think there's another demographic that says like American kids are the best kids, right?

Like. Right, so I think just kids.

Right, right. Kids. Number one reason kids are so anxious.

Yeah, I guess I'm not sure what cultures this would not apply to. Right, right, right, right. Like, I'm, I get the impression that Chinese and Jap, Asian kids in general are Much heavier helicopter. Right. It's my impression. Yeah. So I don't know French kids. Let's just go with let's just go with this. I think this'll

This will be good enough. Next one. And this one feels like it's pretty much an extension of the previous one. So I probably would just say, maybe I'm not gonna bother with this one. We've gotta give the kids like these skills and this feeling of like, I can fail.

I can burn the biscuits. And it's not a huge deal. I could still make better biscuits the next time. We want our kids to fail when the stakes are really low before we hand them the car keys and the fully unlocked iPhone. Because then the stakes are really high and they need to know how to take risks appropriately with things like a chef's knife or a paring knife or a hot stove before they're taking risks again like behind the wheel of a car.

Okay. So my initial reaction to that is that second graph is where to start. Yeah. And then that top graph is actually the last graph. Yeah. Agreed. Yeah. Okay, and I and I don't think this is a bad cliff. I if I were you, I would publish all this stuff. Yeah. And just just to see you know, like you're just

You're gonna have that many more soldiers in your army trying to win. Right, right. Yeah. I don't love, again, I don't really love the... Let them fail with low stakes first. We're like, do this before, do this before giving your kids an iPhone. Something like that.

You have kids real nice. It's funny. Like the, these, these are just like, I don't know, they're, they're captions in some other sense.

And actually, I might need a break here as much as I would love to continue on this thread. No worries, dude. Oh, shoot. Yeah, I'm getting I'm getting I'm getting the call. I've understood. Yeah, you're Just trying to think of this title. Do this before giving your kids an iPhone. How your kids can earn an iPhone.

OK, yeah, I like that. That might be a way to. You know, that's my wife thinks about that. And earning feels right. Every kid should earn a thing. Yeah. There you go, man. Yeah. I will look for these podcast clip screen text examples. And send them over. All right, and you let me know and I'm flexible if I know your world might be in flux right now so if you need to adjust Friday, even just the time so let me know.

It's hard for me to go a little later on Friday. That's fine, that's fine. But otherwise, oh, Friday's July 4th. Yeah. Would you still want to do it then? We'll skip Friday. Maybe we could do something on Thursday. Yes, I'm around. Let me know. Okay. Rock and roll, man. All right. Thanks, Andrew. Good talking to you. You got it. Bye-bye.
