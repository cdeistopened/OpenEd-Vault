Summary  

Meeting Overview

This meeting focused on developing short-form video content strategies for OpenEd's social media platforms. The discussion explored various content formats, approaches to algorithm optimization, and ways to build a distinctive brand voice through consistent character development.

### Content Tactics

- Create 5-7 second videos with Charlie pointing to attention-grabbing headlines
- Keep on-screen text simple with messages like "17-year-olds getting 70k offers" and "Here's how"
- Consider using a solid background color behind news article screenshots to highlight headlines
- Focus on "chum" content that attracts viewers while linking to more substantive content in descriptions
- Aim for multiple replays by keeping videos short but not too short (7-8 seconds ideal)
- Experiment with AI-generated "marble statue" videos for delivering educational quotes

### Character Development

- Build content around "Charlie the newsletter guy" persona
- Leverage the existing newsletter sign-off that the CEO already appreciates
- Create a consistent character viewers can follow and recognize
- Show the character in various settings (creek, fishing, etc.) to add visual interest
- Consider transitioning from purely tactical content to character-driven content over time

### Visual Approaches

- Use graph paper with markers for educational content
- Consider using colored markers/crayons for grade-level curriculum content
- Experiment with a children's easel/construction paper roll for classroom-style presentations
- Take inspiration from creators like "made by James" who use pointing and visual techniques
- Pre-write content on roll paper to create reveal moments without showing the writing process

Content Planning

- Create bullet-pointed shot lists before filming to ensure clear storytelling
- Integrate content with existing SEO strategy (curriculum ideas by grade level)
- Experiment with content that leads viewers to the newsletter or website
- Balance purely entertaining content with conversion-focused material
- Showcase the OpenEd property's natural beauty as potential background settings

### Action Items

- Charlie to create and publish 1-2 pointing videos before Friday

- [ ] Both participants to brainstorm more "Charlie the newsletter guy" video ideas over the next week

- Charlie to study "made by James" account for formatting inspiration

- [ ] Charlie to test integrating social video content with SEO strategy
- [ ] Charlie to experiment with different visual approaches (graph paper, easel, etc.)

Transcript  

So, like, a third on-screen text? Yeah, I mean, I think it could pop up or it's up the whole time. 17 year olds getting 70k offers. Did you have, did that text change? I just noticed that I don't think I've caught. So it does. So then it says the new career prep play. Oh, I see. I see. I mean, and this could be like, here's how or like.

Yeah, I mean I would personally not change it. I keep one piece of text up the whole time. And then, you know, if you've got a secondary thing to say, because I think the here's how is probably the same thing as new career playbook. I think Nuclear Playbook is probably not as spicy as Here's How, because your first sentence in the Here's How can be about the...

The new career prep playbook is XYZ, right, right. It's just like you, it needs to be. The most common denominator right right for humans on planet Earth, and a career playbook, you know, prep thing is not as much as like here's how you can make $70,000.

Right, right. I mean, what if, yeah, what if it just kind of like comes in as yeah, I would make that here's how kind of just like even like a little smaller font and just keep it up the whole time. Oh, really? Okay. Yeah, I think because if the idea is like, this is gonna be like in between five and seven seconds long. Right, right. It's just, there's no, you wanna get somebody in the first second and a half.

You know, like people read a lot quicker than you'd expect them to. So you really, it's like get them, anything worth saying is just worth saying in the beginning and just keep it up.

And then so so I'm going to in this one I start pointing up and then I'm and then I'm pointing down Yeah, I mean I think that's an interesting issue in that like Because you might have headlines sometimes, or there might not be any headline in a newspaper, and you're just pointing to the caption. And so you're gonna have to have a sense of that when you shoot it, of like, what am I trying to do here? Is the caption here and I'm framing it, or is there something above my head and I'm framing it that way?

I think in this case, it's probably fine. Like, this should all be pretty basic. But I would say you're doing one and then you switch. Or you could have just the bottom. I just do this. Okay. Is that the whole time? The whole time? Yeah, I've got I've got plenty of footage that I can. I did a bunch of different

And make it like seven seconds long. Eight seconds long. Yeah. I think the reason why you're making it short is so that it can finish and they watch again and again and again while they're reading it, right? If it's too short, the algo may detect it as spam. If it's too long, you won't get the multiple plays you're looking for. So that's the balance.

It is a kind of cat and mouse game with the algo of like, what can I get away with? This is essentially a tactic. It's not like a creative strategy. It's just like, hey, how can I game? You know, the what we understand to be the best practices of the platform to my advantage. Right, right. Yeah. And in terms of this background here,

Probably don't need to do anything fancy with like a motion or like zooming. I could I could have it. Definitely not. Definitely not. It's just there, you know, to be a. like social proof for you. Yeah, yeah. I you know, alternatively, if you really wanted them to read, see or see like if you wanted to make sure Wall Street Journal wasn't covered by text or something, you could give it like a colored background and shrink that screen grab.

To be a little bit more centered, you know, against a colored background, just so you saw the Wall Street Journal logo. I see. Yeah. Let me. Actually see what that kind of like.

It's annoying because there's all these different layers. This is an area where the script is pretty good, but not even canvas like this, where playing around with the layers. I would lower it. Don't worry about the photo. Because like a version of this could be that you only really need that top fourth, you know, you only really need the Wall Street Journal down to the, you know, the white space in between year job offers, right, you know, like, that tiny text is worthless, and the photo is probably worthless.

So like, you could theoretically just crop that. Yeah, even I go even higher, forget even that. little tiny text. Yeah, that. And then put that against, you know, you don't even need to green screen yourself necessarily. It could be whatever's in your background. And that's just floating.

over top of like, here's headline. And then that tactic works, or that layout works for almost anything. It could be somebody's, it could be a tweet, it could be a reply to somebody, right? Like. Yeah, yeah. Somehow, I don't know why I'm clinging to the green screen. It's really not important. Yeah, it's up to you. I think either way, it's really just like, I think the value to even having that on screen is for people to understand.

It is a, you know, reputable news organization. Right, right. Any thoughts? This is sort of my new show, but like, I think I would probably maybe go to black on this instead of the Dark blue just because again, that's what I tend to see more often or like white background black font. And then there's also I think maybe a little too much corner rounding here for what it's worth.

Yeah, I don't know if you can. If you notice on Instagram or TikTok captions, there's quite a bit more padding. Yeah, I mean, that's much closer. There's padding around the copy so that It's sitting deep within the border, but I think that's, that's probably fine. Yeah, I don't know if it actually has anything more.

Okay. Yeah, I wouldn't. I wouldn't. I wouldn't spend any more time with it. It's fine. Okay. Yeah. The hug lines versus the box hug lines I think are a little better. Maybe a little tiny tiny bit of corner rounding. And then, yeah, why doesn't that? Okay. There we go. That's a little better. Something like that.

Or yeah, okay. And you're saying, do the pointing pointing down for like the here's how I would you pointing down the whole time. Yeah. I'll see if I have seven seconds worth of pointing down. I think I do.

All right. I think that's I mean that feels strong it really depends you want to make sure that that article is worthwhile. Right. But if somebody clicks that. and looks at it and starts reading while the video is playing in the background, you're gonna get multiple views at it. Like you're gonna trick the algo into like giving you more than your fair share. So I think that looks like that kind of tactic. I would make.

Five or six of those and deploy those every other day, maybe. Yeah. Well, I think I can do that. I think it's a replicable format. And if people get tired of looking at my face, I can tap many of the... The photogenic female employees of OpenEd to just share like a few videos doing that, you know, doing different things. I realize I'm not sure. I know you think that there's really, you know, what if I just made myself a library of 20 clips of different people doing that?

If this worked, I think you can absolutely do that. Yeah, if it, yeah, I mean, and, and You won't know until you're 10 posts. You're going to have to do it a lot. Because it might be that 17-year-olds making $70,000 is just not a big enough audience, right?

That's a pretty smaller subset of a wider audience, right? You've got to have a kid who's 17, who you want to make $70,000. As opposed to, you know, you can broaden that into how could anybody make $70,000 or like they made $70,000 in a weekend. It's like, how did they do it?

Right. Right. And then, you know, in the description, you can discover that it might be about more but like this is really bait and You know, you don't throw in the most perfect like nutritious fish as bait. You use chum, right? Like you're using like that. And I think that's kind of the angle. If you're going to play this game, you should try to make it as delicious as possible to everybody.

Right.

It's genius.

Alright, I think I can try that. I can try a lot of variations because this plays to my sort of strength in the longer form content, even though it might not be super long form in the platform. Like I can deliver some substance in that description and every day I'm putting out daily content that I can do this kind of chum chum bait for I think yeah, and you know, there's a guy on Instagram.

I'm going to have to, let me dig him up. Maybe right after this call, but he's a graphic designer and he doesn't talk. A lot of his stuff started with simple pointing things or whatever, and then he'd have an explanation in the caption or whatever. But he has evolved into this whole universe of things he does by not talking. Like...

I love macaroni and cheese. That is why we call him Kraft. Right, right. And where he's at now is a much more advanced place, but you can see that he's still not talking and you can see how he got here and he started with the same shtick. So I can imagine versions where it isn't, hey, I can build a library of these and not have to worry about it anymore.

It's like, no, no, I can keep doing this and it's very easy. Imagine a version where you're just laying on the couch and you notice the camera and you're like... Yeah. And you point, you know? And then there's a thing up there. Like, it's everybody's waiting for the guy, you.

To do the thing, right? That's what this can turn into. It doesn't need to stay a tactic. It can turn into a, oh, this is that chill guy. This is that chill guy always talking about education, right? And it's like, you know, you're in a hammock drinking, drinking a lemonade. And it's like, you know, like, yeah, yeah, there could be, it could be a billion different things, but it's always like, where is he going to, and then it can be weird.

You know, like you could be, you know, upside down and your head comes in from the top. And you're like, like, there could be fun things that you could do. That's a guy again. That isn't just the hack of, hey, look at what's in this below. You can have fun with this. The way that that guy, we've talked about him before, the guy who's like, he says a thing and he's like, hey, come here. And he zooms in a little bit.

This could be a tactic that you could fuck with, like you decide, you know, I can do this or I can do this, but I can do it fun. I do it weird, right? I've been noticing, this is such a weird thing, but I just noticed this. I've been watching these guys who sell shoes. Now I'm not a shoe guy at all, but they sell, you're familiar with the universe of Nikes and like how they, they're worth a billion dollars sometimes and people wait in lines.

Where are these stores in Los Angeles where kids come in and they will try to sell them right and then the whole video is like an hour long of like 50 different people and their experience of like I'll give you 20 for this or 200 for this or whatever.

All these are fake, whatever. I've noticed that all of the compilations start with the guy introducing the video and he's in an entirely different environment. He's in a hotel. He's out to dinner. He's sitting with his kid. And I've noticed not just this guy, but the entire universe of guys who make these videos, they have the same style intro, where they're all like

I'm at the theme park and it's like, it has nothing to do with this video. They all take place in this retail environment, but it's like, it's a fun, it's an interesting idea that like, you could see it start to spread. And I think this could be something with yours of like, Hey,

I'm pointing, but it's different every time, right? Like, I'm in a different, like, locale. Like, you could screw around with this. Like, I'm in a field. You know, maybe you're this big, but you're like, look. There's a lot of different ways to play with this, if you can get it to work. No, that's true. I mean, I think that this is where I could see myself.

Maybe integrating a little bit more of the footage around just this property because there's there's a lot of crazy There's there's some actually really really beautiful Like if people are just in it for kind of the visual scenery I can go down I should go down to the creek actually because there's there's some stuff a little bit.

Uh, I I can walk like You know, 10 minutes up from this, this creek on our property and it's like, you know, National Park worthy almost. Yeah. And I mean, I think all these things work there. There are people who like look into the camera and they'll, you know, they'll spend all day trying to do this, but then they'll throw a ball over their shoulder and they'll get the, they'll get the basket.

It's like stuff like that where it's like, watch. Oh my God, I can't believe, like, there's just like something to the idea of. I'm waiting for it. There it is. Yeah. Right? Oh, there's the guy in the distance. He's pointing. Okay. Oh, there he is. He's fishing. I got something. I got something. And this is tying together a few threads that I've been thinking about.

One is in our kind of like quarterly review, we did a little strategy session about the daily and like what's the value proposition of the daily. And one of the things that... The daily's newsletter? Newsletter, yeah. But I also kind of, I have the socials branded as the Open Ed Daily because I want to distance it a little bit from the company Open Ed because I feel like people are less likely to...

Got it. Follow the company as opposed to like a media company within a company. That makes sense. And, you know, the CEO made the comment, like one of his favorite things about the newsletter is that I sign it off as Charlie parentheses, the open ed newsletter guy.

And it's just like that little bit of personalization that it's coming from an actual person, not a brand. Um, and I also have this motto and I've got a sticker on my desk here. It says, uh, that's probably going to reverse it, but you can see it says, finish your work and go outside. So I'm sure I have this idea like.

I've got a device, whether it's an iPad or my daylight computer, and it's like I hit send on the newsletter or something like I'm like, I'm finished, like, like I'm shipping it. And it's like, you know, putting, putting the last line on and then, and then sending it like.

I don't know exactly how I'd set that up, but that's just giving me some sort of something or other. Well, I think you're onto something in that, like, you've just described a character, right? Charlie the newsletter guy. And what are you going to tell us today, Charlie the newsletter guy, right like what's in the newsletter. Right. And this could all.

You can see how this is a universe now. Every day you're making short-form content about the sexy headline that is in your daily newsletter, theoretically. And it's all a feeder system to the same mechanism. And the fact that your CEO loves it too, now you're really playing with fire, right? That's a great idea of like that character that you pointed out in a quarterly strategy session.

That one little sign off I turned into a character for our short form media that now feeds into and publicizes the newsletter that you love so much, right? Like that's a great fucking story. And then this tactic can be the way in which you start to deploy it, among others, like we can, you know, over the next week maybe start to brainstorm like what could Charlie the newsletter guy.

Do on short form, like what is content around that character? Right. I mean, maybe it's like shutting the laptop and then like doing something outrageous, you know, like. Like, like, yeah, I don't know. It's like, like shutting the laptop and then getting on to some leisure activity or like doing push up or juggling or like climbing a tree.

Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, thinking about it from the audience's perspective, Charlie, the newsletter guy, signals to me, oh, am I about to get a new, is there something cool I can learn right now? Like, did he just send a new one? Or is he warning me? It's like that with the point of this video is, of like, oh shit, there's a new, he dropped a new story. That could be a way to do it. He could also- Oh, so sort of like a dramatic, like, like scent, you know, like, like hitting scent, like.

hit the send button. Yeah. Like I can, you know,

You know, a video of you by the creek fishing, just Charlie, the newsletter guy waiting for everybody to read his latest article just dropped, right? Like, Stuff like that, like that could be cool, that is kind of about you and about the newsletter. And man, that's getting real close to that Duolingo.

where it's like, Oh, that owl, we don't talk about the content, we talk about the creature that lives in the in, you know, in the HQ. And it's like, but it's it's it's an easy way to like build publicity and people fall in love with you. And then it's a whole

Yeah, but that boy, you know, hearing all of that, I'd say if the CEO already loves that idea, this is a really fucking great way. To sound responsive to that, right? Of like, you know, I took that little kernel that you enjoyed and I've now backwardsly deployed it to all of this other stuff. Right, right.

And then built tactics that you could use for anything, as we were 30 minutes ago, like this and green screen, but like now it has a character. And now that character has a reason to be. And that reason to be is to deliver.

I like it. I like it. That's, that's really good. Maybe, well, maybe I would love to see the Marvel thing, but like maybe, um, over the next week we both try to brainstorm on what Charlie, the newsletter guy could be doing. Yeah. Like, what could videos around his character be that are low effort as low effort as this, right? Like not a whole soliloquy, right? But like, how can we make Charlie the newsletter guy videos?

That sounds like a cool idea to me. Yeah, no, I like that. There was something else I wanted to say. I'm blanking on it. It'll come to me. But yeah, um, no, just to tie that thread before and then I can show you these, these marble. Marble statue things. And I think that maybe the marble statue thing, cause there's a little bit, I mean, uh, you know, I look like I'm like, I'm, I just, I'm look like a marble statue walking around all the time. I think there's a resemblance there.

Maybe that could be brought in. Let's see I brought this over this is not This one's a little freaky. I don't know why my nose looks so big here compared with the other one I'll bring these up side by side. Yeah, that's much better. This is much more Much more handsome. I like to think that I look more like this guy. So the lip syncing goes off the rails, but, oh wait, I'm not sharing my screen. I can't see. Oh, all right, all right.

Here we go. Okay, so this was the first one that I did and it's a 10 second limit on how much you can restyle in any one thing. And then you can you can do it on the next one. But for some reason the first few seconds got the lip sync and then the second part didn't.

Hard times create capable parents. Capable parents create easy childhood. Easy childhoods create anxious adults, and anxious adults create hard times. Well, the first part of that looked like it was going to be perfect. You can picture how that would work on anything, about any educational topic on planet Earth. Pretty much, right. Like that's a huge idea that you could also run with, yeah.

AI tutor or something and and I'm not sure I'm familiar enough. Was that they based the marble based on your face or all the marbles different or is that like actually the marble face from the edits app? No they based they do modify it to your actual face and okay great perfect yeah.

So that could be another character like we don't, we're still at the level of noodles against the wall, right? So we don't want to put all our our eggs in Charlie the newsletter guy, but And maybe even if it was a home run, we wouldn't do that. That you've got this other character now that can speak on behalf of your account, which is like, we can give him a name, right? Whoever it is.

But it could be, you know, we give him a name and he is this like, and now he can say anything you would like the world to hear. Right, right, right, whether it is actually a quote from somebody, or it is something that you've written, and then you're off to the races dude, like, you could talk about pop culture you'd like an article can be behind this.

I did experiment with like finding some quotes. Maybe this one was actually this one This is a real quote from some ancient Greek thinker. I don't know exactly who And the lip sync on this one I think is not as good, but let's see. The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled.

Not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled. Lip-sync sounds great to me. I mean, I think that's good enough. I mean, that's enough to keep your attention. Okay. There's slightly different voices here. I don't know if you... Moonlight as a voice coach, but maybe you could give me some some pointers. Well, I I liked I liked the first one. We are better, probably. I think that's really well done.

Okay, I'll practice that one a little bit. Hard times create capable parents. Yeah, that one is weird. And is that... This is shot on the phone, yeah? Yep, in the app. I think you can upload from your camera roll and still do everything. Okay, if you can upload from your camera, I don't want to make this too complicated. No, it's the audio that I hear from your microphone. Yeah. One of the technical rabbit holes I would go down personally is like you sound fantastic.

On your zoom microphone, right, right, right. Even if you plug that into your phone, which should be possible if that's a USB microphone, this one's not I've got little lavalier mics that would be better. Okay. But, um, you know, it could also be kind of funny if like

Marcus Aurelius is talking into a lavalier. Yeah, that is funny. If he had, I think, um, or, or like going in the other direction, not trying to be stoic, but, but like, You know, going in the opposite direction of kind of the classic influencer thing. And he's, you know, pointing up here like, like, like, that's funny. That's actually really just blew my mind.

That's funny. There's this guy I just started following on TikTok. He's like a de-influencer guy and he has nailed the vocal fry of influencer ladies of like, come with me to the best bar in Asheville, North Carolina. What's his name? I need to see this. I got it. Let me see if I can find him. It's so funny.

And then what was the one you were talking about earlier? I have to, let me take him up. First of all, let me find him first. He's on Instagram. I follow him, so I should go into my followers.

It's a design guide. Design.

Yeah, made by James, made dot by dot James. And he looks.

Yeah, okay. Is he mainly YouTube or mainly Instagram? I always see him on Instagram. Okay, cool. So like, look, he's doing the thing where he, okay, so he's doing the pointing, right? But you can see where he started, right? With just the pointing. And now it's even more elaborate.

Yeah, but you can see that that's how he started. Right, right. And that's where you're at, too. And you can see how you can expand it into like, no longer is it a gimmick to like game the algorithm. It is a whole universe of Charlie Chaplin-esque, I'm not gonna talk, but I'm gonna get my message across. And it turns out he may be talking now because I've caught him on live streams now where he does just talk.

I believe he's British. Am I remembering this correctly? I don't know. I also, I like this style. Static posts, but like. This kind of thing, I have terrible handwriting, but when I try, it can actually be decent and somewhat style. But I kind of want to get, you know, I've got a pad of graph paper and I do want to try. Maybe I could do them as videos though, with my actual handwriting.

Hold on, let me see if I can find David Wilson. Ah, here he is. This guy... This is the world. So if you search New York City Influencer on TikTok, we come up like three times. It's this guy? His name's Daddy D A A D I?

Oh wait, no, that's not him. They stole his content. Hold on a second. That's not him.

Followers across TikTok and Instagram. I would love to be a fly on the wall.

See, TikTok is like...

The influencing voice guy.

Oh, maybe it is him. Sorry.

It is him. Okay. It is him. D-A-A-D-I. D-A or D-A? D-A. D-A. D-D. No, D-A-A-D-I. Two A's. Okay. And the ones that always pop up for me are the ones where he starts. No, D, A, let me show you. I think I can. Oh, it is. It is snacks in the handle. Okay. Oh, is it? Yeah. Oh, I guess it is. Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute. No, no, no. Hold on. Is this right?

I see that. Oh, yeah, that is it. Okay. Okay. Got it. And so it looks like all of the thumbnails are like, not him. But it's him talking to the camera. Okay. 10 out of 10. Then why is this the face you made when you try to Got it. I'll check this out. This looks good. Yeah, it's really funny. Especially when he's doing the de-influencing voice. I just fucking lose it. Because I do, I hear these guys. What do you mean de-influencing?

You just mean like not No, no, he's so his philosophy is that influencers are tragically horrible. Okay. And, and that like, you know, the, there is a style of influencer girl. Right, right, right. That I'm obsessed, you know, like, it's that. Come with me to this mom-and-pop burger spot called Bunshine. I'm just trying to, uh, shine a light on all the embarrassing moments.

Oh, and even just like his hair is good. It's yeah. Curiously being in it. What's funny is, is this like actually a snack company where he just. That's hilarious. It's a South- Is that how it started? South Asian popcorn, family recipe, hand ground Indian spices. But he just- He's just pivoted. Yeah, well, or maybe, I mean, it still drives traffic or yeah, I don't know. That is wild.

That's still the Lincoln bio, and that's still kind of like his monetization. That's interesting. I haven't gone that deep on him. I just... You just see it. That is really funny. So an influencer posted their weekly planner... Wish me luck. Come with me!

...to address a hate comment from an influencer. So two weeks ago, I posted the story of the influencer who inspired me to start... That's when Morgan here, a food influencer, with no first-hand knowledge of ...message from an influencer. Get ready with me! Like it's so...

I met one of these girls in the wild recently, actually. There was this girl that I had heard about. Her name was Anastasia or something, here in Charlotte. And I came across these three really well-dressed women, but they were dressed in kind of a more glamorous style that wasn't tattoos and all the kind of stuff I would normally photograph.

But my wife has been encouraging me to step out of the tattoo universe and try to like, focus on like, just normally attractive, beautiful people. And I was like, okay, so I've been But I have a bad track record. Every time I ask these people, it always goes south. It's never the interaction I want. Sure enough, came up to these people. One of the girls, after she posed for one photograph, she's like, okay, I'm done. She walks off.

But what one girl said turns out that's the Anastasia girl. Turns out she has way the fuck less followers than me. And I'm looking into her account and now I like hate watch her shit because it's so bad. It's so like... her just showing off her body in a bikini or showing these like low rent cosmetics that somebody sent her for free and it's like it's a fucking scam and

I can't publish the video even if I wanted to because the fact that the one girl walked off and acted shitty, I can't edit around that. People would roast them, and I don't want to be an asshole. But it's funny, I've seen this in the wild, in person, and when you do, it's like, Jesus.

They're not real people. I gotta give you give me another rabbit hole to go down. But I won't let it distract me from the mission at hand.

Yeah, so I would say the, I think there's really something to the marble thing too. On a technical level, do you understand why that first clip you showed me? But you run the risk with that, that it's going to style you a little bit differently. So you can see in the version that I did there, the hair changes a little bit.

No, not that one, this one. Look from here, and there it changes. I wouldn't worry about that. I think that's just. For now, I would say that's just an idiosyncrasy of our times, you know, the way that like 1999 cameras look a certain way, it's like, all right.

Yeah, okay. Like, I think it's interesting that we'll look back and be like, remember when AI used to like change the way we would look subtly in between cuts? It's like, cool. Yeah. Alright, and then this one, this was the most recent one and this is actually probably the best talking horse we've gotten so far. His teeth, his yellow teeth are a little bit like freaky creepy.

I love macaroni and cheese. That is why they call me Kraft.

I love macaroni and cheese. That is why they call me Krabs. It's still weird to me. I don't know. I think you've got more opportunities with the other things we've seen so far, honestly. Sounds good. The horse thing seems like it's going to be so much trouble to boss.

Yeah, I think you're right. All right, cool. I'm excited about this. I feel like this feels like a more promising direction. Gives me something to really play with and own a little bit more. Yeah. So take, take a look at how you can do more of these and, and, and start publishing like between now and Friday, like get one or two of them out the door.

Yeah. You know, just do these like find an article that you're about to publish in a newsletter or that you just published last week and make something about that with a sexy little headline. Yeah. And I can start I can start doing them inside of restyle too.

If I, if I get savvy at sort of, you know, just save the image to my camera roll, upload it as the background, whatever, I think I should do that. Cause then I can nail the captions and all that without bothering with the script. And then I would say in that same vein, take a look at that, what that was it, what was it designed by James, whatever that yeah, that guy.

And see how he's extended that. Okay. Right. That like, that's his first shot. And then he has another shot or two after that about like, and I'm talking about this and I'm talking about that. Right, right. It might start with this, and then the second shot is you, camera phone, looking at a screen, and you're pointing at the Open Ed signup page or something. I don't know.

Right, right, right, right, like, or some, you know, packet of goodies you can download, whatever it is, it's like, you can, I would ape some of his. Like format, this is good. This is good. I'm looking at one more right now. I'll just share it with you. Because I can kind of imagine you know, I've got my graph paper or my

Whiteboard or something. Wait, let me start that over.

How to get more leads. And then he uncovers AKA clients, boom, zooms in. And then there's like a little, and this kind of stuff I can do too. Yes. Just recording the screen. Yeah. Oh, this is good. This is good. So something to think about, like the construction of this. How would one go about even planning for this?

Right? Especially in the beginning, we're like, I think like when it filmmaking is not like a bread and butter thing of you, I would say the easiest way to think about this is on a shot per shot basis. And I would just bullet point, right? bullet points of like me pointing

Second bullet point, reveal the little text I was covering with my hand. Third bullet point, zoom in on my profile. Fourth bullet point, A little annotation on this part of the pro, you know, like I would make a bullet. Those are that's a shot list. I would make a bullet pointed shot list so that one year you have the whole story in front of you and then you can go out and just execute.

You can shoot this. And then you shoot that, and then you shoot the profile. Like, you know, you could do all those things in an order and then your camera roll is filled, shot by shot of all the things that you need. Versus. What I sometimes see somebody like my wife doing, which is she'll shoot one, she'll shoot two, she'll start editing, she'll realize she needs more shots, she'll go and shoot more things. It's like, holy fuck, this is like

It's just hard to even contemplate what the story is because I'm shooting them asynchronously in a way, like I don't know what the story is yet. It's like a bullet-pointed shot list really tells you. Do I understand the story? Yeah. Yeah. I'm also wondering to what extent I can kind of weave this into our current SEO strategy, where I don't even need to necessarily link to the content.

But as long as we're doing like we're going to be doing a bunch of content on just like for the blog and whatnot You know first grade curriculum ideas Second grade curriculum ideas third grade, you know that kind of thing where I could do, you know Make that shot list I get like have my set up which is like sharpie on graph paper or something and then You know come up with the shot list for for all the curriculums that we feature in the blog post

And write the shortened condensed version of the blog post in the description or something, something like that. I mean, I think all of this is like you could experiment with how much of this is, is like overtly a feeder to the newsletter. And like you can dial that to taste. Sometimes you have a video where it's like, I didn't even know OpenEd was selling. And then other times you're gonna have videos where it's like, oh, clearly this is a push to.

Some kind of conversion, whether it's to go to the newsletter or the site or whatever it is. You can start to support almost anything you want. The other thing I would think about is... For you and I, and maybe made by James, you know, black marker on on graph paper makes sense. But in an open ed universe, what if it were

Crayola crayons or markers, right? Like, and it's not one or the other, do it all. You can see, like, if you're talking about first grade curriculum, it'd be great if you were doing them with different color markers. Did it feel a little bit more school-age? That's just some subtle branding stylization that you could roll into that.

And you can pick your battles. Like, when am I gonna use crayons and markers and when am I gonna use black Sharpie or whatever? And I think that's super cool. That's what this could become. And you can see how this guy has built an entire account around a simplistic idea like that. But I'm going to not talk.

And I'm going to just like draw and write my information with pointing and signs and stuff. Yeah, yeah. No, just one more idea to get it on the record for my meeting notes. You know, my kids have like a little painting easel with a bunch of construction paper on the roll. I could imagine kind of like, you know, do so and maybe speed up or chop up the footage so that they don't have to watch me writing out the whole thing.

But you know, like draw down the construction paper from the roll, write something on there. And I could even, you know, put my kids facing Me, so it's just the back of their heads or something. They're like watching me, right? It's like, I'm up there at the front of the classroom or. Dude, that's a great idea. What if you pre wrote it all in or rolled it back up? Right, right, right.

Brought it down, meh, brought it down again, meh, you know, like it's so there's no need to even watch the writing. It could be, you know, you're showing an animation by revealing through the pole. And that's a whole gag. You can imagine that being, yeah, that could be 110 different videos of like, oh, look, he just reveals stuff.

by pulling down this pre-written role. Yeah. Like, and, you know, they're different font sizes or they say, like, it could be unexpected. Like there's a line that says, but then, and you pull it again, you know, this happened, right? Like there's all kinds of fun stuff you can do with that.

All right, I think that's a good start. Any more ideas and my head will explode.
