## PRODUCTION NOTES

### Batch Filming Setup:
- Write all 20 on paper first
- Stack easel pages
- Film in order
- 4 minutes per message × 20 = 80 minutes filming
- NO RETAKES unless major error

### Distribution Strategy:
- Post 2 per day = 10 days of content
- Mix patterns daily (don't do all "Stop" messages in a row)
- Test which patterns get highest CTR
- Revise titles/thumbnails for any with CTR < 4%

### Pattern Mix for Daily Posts:
**Day 1:** Stop + Observation
**Day 2:** Value + Question
**Day 3:** Pop Culture + Struggle
**Day 4:** Rule + Aspirational
**Day 5:** Normalize + Command
**Day 6:** Wordplay + Calendar
**Day 7:** Observation + Value
**Day 8:** Question + Pop Culture
**Day 9:** Stop + Normalize
**Day 10:** Aspirational + Observation
