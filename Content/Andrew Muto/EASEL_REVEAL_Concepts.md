# Easel Reveal Format - "Dude with Sign" for OpenEd

**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Format**: Writing on easel with back to camera, turn around to reveal message
**Production Time**: 2-5 minutes per video
**Setting**: Picturesque homestead background

---

## FORMAT MECHANICS

### Setup:
1. Easel positioned with picturesque homestead background
2. You stand with back to camera, writing with big permanent marker
3. Sound of marker writing (ASMR element)
4. Turn around to reveal message
5. Hold for 5-8 seconds (allows replays)

### Why This Works (Andrew Muto Principles):
- ✅ **Topic signal** through sound and motion
- ✅ **Hook quickly** - reveal creates curiosity gap
- ✅ **5-8 seconds** = multiple replays = algorithm boost
- ✅ **McDonald's Test** - text must be instantly readable
- ✅ **Authentic setting** - homestead = real life proof
