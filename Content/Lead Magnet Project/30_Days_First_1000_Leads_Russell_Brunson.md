## The Foundation: Why Email Lists Matter

### The "Money Is in the List" Math

**The funnel breakdown (how gurus actually make money):**
- 30,000 people on email list
- 10,000 open the email
- 5,000 click the link
- 1,000 click the order form
- 300 buy a $100 product
- **Result: $30,000 from one email**

### The $1/Month/Subscriber Rule

> "You should be able to average $1 per month per name on your email list."

- 1,000 subscribers = $1,000/month
- 10,000 subscribers = $10,000/month
- 100,000 subscribers = $100,000/month

**Brunson's proof:** Built 217-person list in college, made $300 first month—compared to $150,000 duplex that only cashflowed $200/month.

### Real Results Example

- One of Brunson's lead funnels: 58% opt-in rate
- Generated 185,186 leads
- "One of the most profitable properties in the world"

## Week 1-2: List Building (Days 1-14)

### Day 1: Identify Your Dream Customer

**The critical question:** Who do you actually want to serve?

- Don't create something and attract the wrong customers—you'll end up hating your business
- Brunson's story: Had customers he hated, woke up wishing he had a boss who could fire him
- **The simple answer:** Your dream customer is YOU from 5 years ago
  - You've grown, you've learned things
  - Those are the people you contribute to with your new knowledge

**Why this matters:** First 2 weeks = serving without selling. If you're not excited about these people, you won't last.

---

### Day 2: Create Your Lead Magnet

**Definition:** The bait that gets your dream customer into your world in exchange for their email address.

**Key insight:** Lead magnets can be SIMPLE.
- Brendon Burchard's "One Day Productivity Planner" = **one piece of paper**
- Built a list of millions from a single-page PDF

**The test:** What would YOU from 5 years ago have given your email for? What would you have borrowed someone's credit card to buy?

**Creating it:**
- AI can help generate it quickly
- But add your own stuff—AI content is "okay," not exceptional
- Add video, your unique perspective, your voice

---

### Day 3: Build Your Lead Funnel

**Structure:** Only 2 pages required.

1. **Squeeze Page:** "Here's the lead magnet, give me your email"
2. **Thank You Page:** Deliver the download + optional video explanation

**That's it.** Takes about 3 minutes to build in ClickFunnels or similar tools.

---

### Day 4: Social Media Reset

**The mindset shift:** Stop being a CONSUMER of social media. Become a PRODUCER.

**Step 1: Optimize Your Profile**
- Cover photo = explains what you do / promotes your lead magnet
- First pinned post = link to your lead magnet funnel

**Step 2: Join 5-10 Facebook Groups**
- Search for groups where your dream customers congregate
- Target groups with 100,000+ members each
- 10 groups × 100,000 members = access to 1 million+ potential leads

**Example:** Photographers → search "photographers" → join groups with 11K, 49K, 96K, 215K members

---

### Days 4-14: The Value Machine (DO NOT SELL)

**Daily activity per group:**
- 1 value post
- Answer 3 questions

**If you're in 10 groups:** 10 value posts + 30 answered questions per day (can reuse same value post across groups)

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't spam "Download my free thing!" the moment you join
- That's like walking into a party and immediately pitching everyone
- You'll get kicked out, blacklisted, and mocked

**What happens instead:**
- You provide value → people notice → "Who is this person?"
- They click your profile → see your banner → see your pinned post
- They click → opt in → join your list

**The funnel math:**
- 1 million people in groups
- 100,000 see your posts
- 10,000 click your profile
- 1,000 join your email list

**Brunson's proof:** Did this exact strategy in forums 20+ years ago (before Facebook, before MySpace, before Friendster). Built list from 0 to 10,000 in 90 days with zero ad spend.

## Critical Note: List Building Never Stops

> "I'm in business now 22 years and I still focus every single day on list building."

**When businesses fail, this is usually why:**
- They stopped driving traffic
- They stopped bringing in new leads
- They just sell to existing customers over and over
- Attrition shrinks the list → business collapses

---

## Week 3: Pre-Launch Week (Days 15-19)

You now have ~1,000 leads who trust you. They've received value but haven't been sold anything. They WANT to give you money.

**The beauty:** Your audience will tell you exactly what to create.

### Day 15 (Pre-Launch Day 1): Ask What They Want

**Email to your list:**
> "I'm putting together a course/training about [your topic]. What's the #1 thing you want to know about [specific thing]?"

**Key:** Be SPECIFIC in your question.
- Bad: "What's your #1 question about making money?"
- Good: "What's your #1 question about adding 500 people/day to your email list?"

Sit back and let them respond. They'll tell you exactly what to create.

---

### Day 16 (Pre-Launch Day 2): Build Anticipation

**Email:**
> "The response was INSANE. Got 20+ questions. This is becoming the outline for my course. Thank you! If you have more questions, send them now so I can finalize."

---

### Day 17 (Pre-Launch Day 3): Create Accountability

**Email:**
> "In the past I'd push projects out for months. I want you to hold me accountable. I'm launching this NEXT TUESDAY. Put it on your calendar. We're doing this no matter what."

This builds:
- Anticipation
- Excitement
- They see YOUR excitement
- A real deadline

---

### Day 18 (Pre-Launch Day 4): Early Bird List

**Email:**
> "Tuesday is happening. I just put up an early bird page. If you sign up, you get access 1-2 hours before everyone else."

**Why this matters:** You're segmenting your hottest buyers.
- 1,000 leads → maybe 100 sign up for early bird
- Those 100 are your most eager buyers

---

### Day 19 (Pre-Launch Day 5): Close the Early Bird List

**Email:**
> "Last chance to get on the early bird list. We go live Tuesday. If you want early access, sign up NOW."

Push to get as many as possible from your 1,000 onto the early bird list (goal: 100-200).

---

## Week 4: Launch Week (Days 20-25)

### Day 20 (Launch Day 1): Early Bird Launch

**Email to EARLY BIRD LIST ONLY:**
> "The course is LIVE. You get access now—2 hours before everyone else. Go sign up!"

**This is where majority of sales often come**—before the cart even officially opens to the public.

---

### Day 21 (Launch Day 2): Full List Launch

**Email to ENTIRE LIST:**
> "We're officially launched! The course is ready. Go sign up now."

Emotional buyers have already bought (Day 1). Now we start working on logical buyers.

---

### Day 22 (Launch Day 3): The "Why"

**Email:**
> "I created this because I've been in these groups for months, and everyone keeps asking the same questions. I wanted to put all the answers in one spot."

Share your story. Why does this exist? Why should they care?

---

### Day 23 (Launch Day 4): The ROI

**Email:** Share facts and figures on what they GET from buying.

**ROI isn't always money:**
- Business course: "Buy for $1,000 → make $10,000"
- Dating course: "ROI = you find a girlfriend"
- Fitness course: "ROI = better health"

Help them justify the purchase logically.

---

### Day 24 (Launch Day 5): Urgency & Scarcity

**Email:**
> "Tomorrow the cart closes. This is your last shot to buy."

Start introducing the deadline pressure.

---

### Day 25 (Launch Day 6): Cart Close / Last Call

**Email(s):** Send 3-4 emails on this day.
> "Last call. The order form comes down at midnight tonight."

**Pattern Brunson sees:**
- Day 1 (early bird): Big spike
- Day 2 (full launch): Another spike
- Days 3-5: Steady sales, slight decline
- Day 6 (cart close): **HALF of all sales come on this day**
