## The Origin Story: How Hormozi Discovered Lead Magnets

- Tried building a webinar for 8 weeks to get gym owner leads—spent $500 on ads, made zero money
- Got a bunch of email opt-ins from people who never watched the webinar
- Called those people directly, closed some deals, realized there had to be an easier way
- Saw another marketer's 13-minute screen-share case study (not a polished webinar)—just showing exactly how he ran a retargeting campaign with real numbers
- Thought: "I can do this"—made a simple screen recording showing how he filled a San Diego gym with 212 sign-ups in a month
- Included: the ads, landing page, scheduler, script, how many they sold, picture of gym owner saying thanks
- **The leads started pouring in**

**Key insight:** The right lead magnet for the right avatar was a massive lever. If you're not getting enough leads, your lead magnet isn't attractive enough to your ideal audience.

---

## What Is a Lead Magnet (Definition)

> A lead magnet is a **complete solution to a narrow problem** given away at a **significant discount or free** to attract ideal customers.

- It's NOT your core offer (the thing you make the most money from)
- It's a stepping stone that solves one problem and **reveals the next problem**—which your core offer solves

---

## Why Lead Magnets Work: The Trust Mechanism

**Without a lead magnet:**
- Show 25 people your core offer cold → maybe 1 buys (low trust, high friction)

**With a lead magnet:**
- Show 25 people a free valuable thing → percentage opts in
- They consume it, think "this guy's pretty good"
- You reveal the bigger problem → make core offer to **high trust** audience
- Significantly higher take rate

**The real reason:** A person who pays with their time now is more likely to pay with their money later.

**Costco samples analogy:**
- They're not giving away free food to be nice—it drives sales
- You try 20 things, really like one, buy it
- Without the sample, you'd have bought nothing
- Cost of samples = cost of delivering lead magnet, but profit from purchases more than covers it

---

## The Problem-Solution Cycle

**All problems when solved create a new problem.** This is the engine of business:

1. Leads problem → solved → creates sales problem
2. Sales problem → solved → creates delivery/churn problem
3. Churn problem → solved → creates scaling operations problem
4. Scaling problem → need to go back and increase traffic

**Lead magnet strategy:** Pick a narrow problem that, when solved, naturally reveals the next problem your core offer solves.

**Home seller example:**
- Big problem: Sell their home
- Narrow problems leading up to it: What's my house worth? How do I increase value? Pictures? Cleaning? Landscaping? Staging?
- Pick ONE narrow problem, solve it for free
- They now trust you more than competitors who didn't help them
- You turn a lead into a customer

---

## Three Types of Lead Magnets

### Type 1: Reveal the Problem (Diagnosis)

**Think: Assessment, audit, analysis**

- Works great for problems that **get worse while you wait**
- Built-in urgency the moment you reveal the problem

**Examples:**
- Website speed test—shows page load time vs. what it could be
- Posture analysis—posture gets worse over time if they don't know
- Termite inspection—longer you wait, more expensive to fix

### Type 2: Free Trial (Taste)

**Think: Costco sample, limited version**

Limit one or more components:
- Number of uses
- Quantity
- Time they have access
- Or combination

**Examples:**
- Hook them up to faster server, show improved leads, then charge to keep it
- Give them one adjustment, fix posture temporarily, explain they need ongoing treatment
- Fun-sized packaging for consumables

### Type 3: One Step of Multi-Step Process

**Think: First of many steps**

- Book that gets you to $1M profit (next steps = what they invest in companies for)
- "10 things we can do to improve your website speed—I'll do the first one free"
- Back treatment: cracking is free, but full treatment includes electro, massage, stretching

**Important:** These buckets matter less than thinking creatively. There are no rules—these just neatly fit most solutions.

**The drug dealer model:** First hit's always free. Product is exceptional, people get immediate results, creates desire to come back.

---

## Four Delivery Mechanisms

### 1. Software (Give them a tool)
- Spreadsheets, calculators, dashboards
- Example: Gym owner dashboard comparing their stats to industry averages—"The delta is the value we can unlock"

### 2. Information (Teach them something)
- Courses, lessons, expert interviews, keynote presentations
- Live events, mistakes/pitfalls lists, hacks, tips
- Example: Mini course on how to write ads for gyms—they learn ads, but then need landing pages (your next offer)

### 3. Services (Do work for free)
**Hormozi's favorite, almost "secret and dirty" because it works so well:**

- Adjust their back, perform website audit, apply first layer of sealant, transform video into ebook
- **Why it works:** People know it cost you something → generates massive goodwill → disproportionate persuasion power
- Also: high interface time = more opportunity to soft sell
- Example: "I'll run your gym's ads free for 30 days, get you leads for free, prove I know what I'm doing"—after they make money, they want to keep making money

### 4. Physical Products (Something they can hold)
- Posture assessment chart, supplement sample, bottle of garage sealant, boxing gloves
- Books, branded merchandise

**Critical caveat:** The lead magnet must be **close to the thing you sell**.
- IT services company giving away branded t-shirts? People want t-shirts, not necessarily IT services—bad fit
- Same t-shirts from an apparel white-labeler? Natural lead to more apparel—good fit

---

## Naming Your Lead Magnet (This Is HUGE)

**The 5-second example:**
- Same video, tanked at 4,000 views
- Chopped and redid first 5 seconds only
- **850,000 views**—200x increase from reframing how people perceived the value

> "After you've written your headline, you've spent 80 cents of your advertising dollar." — David Ogilvy

**Hormozi's actual A/B tests for 100M Leads book:**
- "100M Advertising" vs "100M Promotion" → Advertising won
- "Advertising" vs "Leads" → Leads won
- "Leads" vs "Marketing" → Leads won again
- "How to get more people to want to buy your stuff" vs "How to get strangers to want to buy your stuff" → Strangers won
- "How to get more strangers..." vs "How to get strangers..." → **70% vs 30%**—removing ONE word = 2.5x more clicks

**How to test names:**
1. Run ads ($50 can get enough sample size)
2. Run polls on your audience
3. Post and ask for comments "1 or 2"
4. DM followers/friends for directional feedback

**Golden signal:** When someone asks "When is this coming out?"—that's your winner.

---

## Make It Easy to Consume

**Key stat:** Hormozi has nearly perfect 25/25/25/25 split between ebook, audio, video, and physical book consumption.

- If he only offered physical, he'd miss 75% of his audience
- Or worse: people opt in but don't consume → leads without conversions

**By delivery type:**

- **Software:** Accessible on phone, computer, Android, Apple
- **Information:** Multiple formats—Kindle, Audible, podcast, video course
- **Services:** Available more times, more ways, more days (don't be "only available 7am Mondays for the free thing"—the guy down the street who's flexible gets the lead)
- **Physical products:** Simple to open, simple to use—think Apple packaging (so elegant people keep the boxes)

---

## Make It Good (Zero Fluff)

**Core principle:** Give away the secrets, sell the implementation.

**What if you only have one valuable thing?** Learn something else valuable. Give that away free, sell the other thing. Reframe "I only have one thing" as a skill deficiency and fix it.

**Why free stuff quality matters more than you think:**
- 99.9% of people who see your stuff will never buy from you
- But they'll have an opinion
- Their opinion impacts the people who WILL buy
- Your reputation compounds

**The sucky fluff alternative:**
1. You discourage people who would've bought
2. When someone texts a friend "Is this guy legit?"—the friend says "I got his free thing, it sucked"
3. Now you've lost a sale from word of mouth

> People judge the value they'll get from your paid thing based on the value of your free thing.

**Purchasing decisions are predictions of future value.** Best way to get someone to predict value after they buy? Give them value BEFORE they buy.

---

## Create the Next Steps (The CTA)

**Don't forget to actually ask for the sale.**

CTA requirements:
- **Clear, simple, direct language**
- **Be clear, NOT clever**

**Example:** "If you're a company doing $1-10M in profit, apply at acquisition.com"

**Add reasons to act now using:**
- **Scarcity** (limited quantity): "I only made 10 of these hats"
- **Urgency** (limited time): "This ebook won't be available after tomorrow"
- **Both** is ideal

**The Fraternity Party Planner Frame:** Any reason is more compelling than no reason.
- "Timmy got his wisdom teeth out—kegger!"
- Doesn't matter what the reason is, just have one.

---

## What Makes a Great Lead Magnet (Summary)

1. **Engages ideal customers** when they see it—they think "I want that"
2. **Gets more people to engage than core offer alone**—lowers cost per customer
3. **Valuable enough that people actually consume it**—not just opt-in and ignore
4. **Makes the RIGHT people more likely to buy**—kicks out the bad as much as attracts the good

**End result:** More people show interest, you make more money, you improve your brand—all simultaneously.

---

## Quick Reference: Hormozi's 9-Step Framework

1. **Pick WHO** you're solving the problem for
2. **Pick WHAT** narrow problem you're solving
3. **Pick HOW to solve it** (reveal problem / free trial / one step of many)
4. **Pick HOW to deliver it** (software / information / services / physical)
5. **Name it** (test headlines, 80% of your advertising dollar)
6. **Make it easy** (multiple formats, convenient access)
7. **Make it good** (zero fluff, give away secrets)
8. **Create next steps** (clear CTA with scarcity/urgency)
9. **Test and iterate**

# PART 2: 30 Days to Your First 1,000 Leads - Russell Brunson

**Source:** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56oBqiDiIfY)

---

## The Core Promise

- **Goal:** 1,000 leads → $1,000 in 30 days
- **Time commitment:** 60 minutes per day
- **Cost:** $0 (no paid ads required)
- This is the exact process taught in Brunson's highest-level coaching programs for launching projects, funnels, and webinars

---

## The Foundation: Why Email Lists Matter

### The "Money Is in the List" Math

**The funnel breakdown (how gurus actually make money):**
- 30,000 people on email list
- 10,000 open the email
- 5,000 click the link
- 1,000 click the order form
- 300 buy a $100 product
- **Result: $30,000 from one email**

### The $1/Month/Subscriber Rule

> "You should be able to average $1 per month per name on your email list."

- 1,000 subscribers = $1,000/month
- 10,000 subscribers = $10,000/month
- 100,000 subscribers = $100,000/month

**Brunson's proof:** Built 217-person list in college, made $300 first month—compared to $150,000 duplex that only cashflowed $200/month.

### Real Results Example

- One of Brunson's lead funnels: 58% opt-in rate
- Generated 185,186 leads
- "One of the most profitable properties in the world"

---

## Week 1-2: List Building (Days 1-14)

### Day 1: Identify Your Dream Customer

**The critical question:** Who do you actually want to serve?

- Don't create something and attract the wrong customers—you'll end up hating your business
- Brunson's story: Had customers he hated, woke up wishing he had a boss who could fire him
- **The simple answer:** Your dream customer is YOU from 5 years ago
  - You've grown, you've learned things
  - Those are the people you contribute to with your new knowledge

**Why this matters:** First 2 weeks = serving without selling. If you're not excited about these people, you won't last.

---

### Day 2: Create Your Lead Magnet

**Definition:** The bait that gets your dream customer into your world in exchange for their email address.

**Key insight:** Lead magnets can be SIMPLE.
- Brendon Burchard's "One Day Productivity Planner" = **one piece of paper**
- Built a list of millions from a single-page PDF

**The test:** What would YOU from 5 years ago have given your email for? What would you have borrowed someone's credit card to buy?

**Creating it:**
- AI can help generate it quickly
- But add your own stuff—AI content is "okay," not exceptional
- Add video, your unique perspective, your voice

---

### Day 3: Build Your Lead Funnel

**Structure:** Only 2 pages required.

1. **Squeeze Page:** "Here's the lead magnet, give me your email"
2. **Thank You Page:** Deliver the download + optional video explanation

**That's it.** Takes about 3 minutes to build in ClickFunnels or similar tools.

---

### Day 4: Social Media Reset

**The mindset shift:** Stop being a CONSUMER of social media. Become a PRODUCER.

**Step 1: Optimize Your Profile**
- Cover photo = explains what you do / promotes your lead magnet
- First pinned post = link to your lead magnet funnel

**Step 2: Join 5-10 Facebook Groups**
- Search for groups where your dream customers congregate
- Target groups with 100,000+ members each
- 10 groups × 100,000 members = access to 1 million+ potential leads

**Example:** Photographers → search "photographers" → join groups with 11K, 49K, 96K, 215K members

---

### Days 4-14: The Value Machine (DO NOT SELL)

**Daily activity per group:**
- 1 value post
- Answer 3 questions

**If you're in 10 groups:** 10 value posts + 30 answered questions per day (can reuse same value post across groups)

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't spam "Download my free thing!" the moment you join
- That's like walking into a party and immediately pitching everyone
- You'll get kicked out, blacklisted, and mocked

**What happens instead:**
- You provide value → people notice → "Who is this person?"
- They click your profile → see your banner → see your pinned post
- They click → opt in → join your list

**The funnel math:**
- 1 million people in groups
- 100,000 see your posts
- 10,000 click your profile
- 1,000 join your email list

**Brunson's proof:** Did this exact strategy in forums 20+ years ago (before Facebook, before MySpace, before Friendster). Built list from 0 to 10,000 in 90 days with zero ad spend.

---

## Critical Note: List Building Never Stops

> "I'm in business now 22 years and I still focus every single day on list building."

**When businesses fail, this is usually why:**
- They stopped driving traffic
- They stopped bringing in new leads
- They just sell to existing customers over and over
- Attrition shrinks the list → business collapses

---

## Week 3: Pre-Launch Week (Days 15-19)

You now have ~1,000 leads who trust you. They've received value but haven't been sold anything. They WANT to give you money.

**The beauty:** Your audience will tell you exactly what to create.

### Day 15 (Pre-Launch Day 1): Ask What They Want

**Email to your list:**
> "I'm putting together a course/training about [your topic]. What's the #1 thing you want to know about [specific thing]?"

**Key:** Be SPECIFIC in your question.
- Bad: "What's your #1 question about making money?"
- Good: "What's your #1 question about adding 500 people/day to your email list?"

Sit back and let them respond. They'll tell you exactly what to create.

---

### Day 16 (Pre-Launch Day 2): Build Anticipation

**Email:**
> "The response was INSANE. Got 20+ questions. This is becoming the outline for my course. Thank you! If you have more questions, send them now so I can finalize."

---

### Day 17 (Pre-Launch Day 3): Create Accountability

**Email:**
> "In the past I'd push projects out for months. I want you to hold me accountable. I'm launching this NEXT TUESDAY. Put it on your calendar. We're doing this no matter what."

This builds:
- Anticipation
- Excitement
- They see YOUR excitement
- A real deadline

---

### Day 18 (Pre-Launch Day 4): Early Bird List

**Email:**
> "Tuesday is happening. I just put up an early bird page. If you sign up, you get access 1-2 hours before everyone else."

**Why this matters:** You're segmenting your hottest buyers.
- 1,000 leads → maybe 100 sign up for early bird
- Those 100 are your most eager buyers

---

### Day 19 (Pre-Launch Day 5): Close the Early Bird List

**Email:**
> "Last chance to get on the early bird list. We go live Tuesday. If you want early access, sign up NOW."

Push to get as many as possible from your 1,000 onto the early bird list (goal: 100-200).

---

## Week 4: Launch Week (Days 20-25)

### Day 20 (Launch Day 1): Early Bird Launch

**Email to EARLY BIRD LIST ONLY:**
> "The course is LIVE. You get access now—2 hours before everyone else. Go sign up!"

**This is where majority of sales often come**—before the cart even officially opens to the public.

---

### Day 21 (Launch Day 2): Full List Launch

**Email to ENTIRE LIST:**
> "We're officially launched! The course is ready. Go sign up now."

Emotional buyers have already bought (Day 1). Now we start working on logical buyers.

---

### Day 22 (Launch Day 3): The "Why"

**Email:**
> "I created this because I've been in these groups for months, and everyone keeps asking the same questions. I wanted to put all the answers in one spot."

Share your story. Why does this exist? Why should they care?

---

### Day 23 (Launch Day 4): The ROI

**Email:** Share facts and figures on what they GET from buying.

**ROI isn't always money:**
- Business course: "Buy for $1,000 → make $10,000"
- Dating course: "ROI = you find a girlfriend"
- Fitness course: "ROI = better health"

Help them justify the purchase logically.

---

### Day 24 (Launch Day 5): Urgency & Scarcity

**Email:**
> "Tomorrow the cart closes. This is your last shot to buy."

Start introducing the deadline pressure.

---

### Day 25 (Launch Day 6): Cart Close / Last Call

**Email(s):** Send 3-4 emails on this day.
> "Last call. The order form comes down at midnight tonight."

**Pattern Brunson sees:**
- Day 1 (early bird): Big spike
- Day 2 (full launch): Another spike
- Days 3-5: Steady sales, slight decline
- Day 6 (cart close): **HALF of all sales come on this day**

---

## The Complete 30-Day Timeline

|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Setup | Identify dream customer |
| 2 | Setup | Create lead magnet |
| 3 | Setup | Build 2-page lead funnel |
