## The Origin Story: How Hormozi Discovered Lead Magnets

- Tried building a webinar for 8 weeks to get gym owner leads—spent $500 on ads, made zero money
- Got a bunch of email opt-ins from people who never watched the webinar
- Called those people directly, closed some deals, realized there had to be an easier way
- Saw another marketer's 13-minute screen-share case study (not a polished webinar)—just showing exactly how he ran a retargeting campaign with real numbers
- Thought: "I can do this"—made a simple screen recording showing how he filled a San Diego gym with 212 sign-ups in a month
- Included: the ads, landing page, scheduler, script, how many they sold, picture of gym owner saying thanks
- **The leads started pouring in**

**Key insight:** The right lead magnet for the right avatar was a massive lever. If you're not getting enough leads, your lead magnet isn't attractive enough to your ideal audience.

## What Is a Lead Magnet (Definition)

> A lead magnet is a **complete solution to a narrow problem** given away at a **significant discount or free** to attract ideal customers.

- It's NOT your core offer (the thing you make the most money from)
- It's a stepping stone that solves one problem and **reveals the next problem**—which your core offer solves

---

## Why Lead Magnets Work: The Trust Mechanism

**Without a lead magnet:**
- Show 25 people your core offer cold → maybe 1 buys (low trust, high friction)

**With a lead magnet:**
- Show 25 people a free valuable thing → percentage opts in
- They consume it, think "this guy's pretty good"
- You reveal the bigger problem → make core offer to **high trust** audience
- Significantly higher take rate

**The real reason:** A person who pays with their time now is more likely to pay with their money later.

**Costco samples analogy:**
- They're not giving away free food to be nice—it drives sales
- You try 20 things, really like one, buy it
- Without the sample, you'd have bought nothing
- Cost of samples = cost of delivering lead magnet, but profit from purchases more than covers it

## The Problem-Solution Cycle

**All problems when solved create a new problem.** This is the engine of business:

1. Leads problem → solved → creates sales problem
2. Sales problem → solved → creates delivery/churn problem
3. Churn problem → solved → creates scaling operations problem
4. Scaling problem → need to go back and increase traffic

**Lead magnet strategy:** Pick a narrow problem that, when solved, naturally reveals the next problem your core offer solves.

**Home seller example:**
- Big problem: Sell their home
- Narrow problems leading up to it: What's my house worth? How do I increase value? Pictures? Cleaning? Landscaping? Staging?
- Pick ONE narrow problem, solve it for free
- They now trust you more than competitors who didn't help them
- You turn a lead into a customer

## Three Types of Lead Magnets

### Type 1: Reveal the Problem (Diagnosis)

**Think: Assessment, audit, analysis**

- Works great for problems that **get worse while you wait**
- Built-in urgency the moment you reveal the problem

**Examples:**
- Website speed test—shows page load time vs. what it could be
- Posture analysis—posture gets worse over time if they don't know
- Termite inspection—longer you wait, more expensive to fix

### Type 2: Free Trial (Taste)

**Think: Costco sample, limited version**

Limit one or more components:
- Number of uses
- Quantity
- Time they have access
- Or combination

**Examples:**
- Hook them up to faster server, show improved leads, then charge to keep it
- Give them one adjustment, fix posture temporarily, explain they need ongoing treatment
- Fun-sized packaging for consumables

### Type 3: One Step of Multi-Step Process

**Think: First of many steps**

- Book that gets you to $1M profit (next steps = what they invest in companies for)
- "10 things we can do to improve your website speed—I'll do the first one free"
- Back treatment: cracking is free, but full treatment includes electro, massage, stretching

**Important:** These buckets matter less than thinking creatively. There are no rules—these just neatly fit most solutions.

**The drug dealer model:** First hit's always free. Product is exceptional, people get immediate results, creates desire to come back.

## Four Delivery Mechanisms

### 1. Software (Give them a tool)
- Spreadsheets, calculators, dashboards
- Example: Gym owner dashboard comparing their stats to industry averages—"The delta is the value we can unlock"

### 2. Information (Teach them something)
- Courses, lessons, expert interviews, keynote presentations
- Live events, mistakes/pitfalls lists, hacks, tips
- Example: Mini course on how to write ads for gyms—they learn ads, but then need landing pages (your next offer)

### 3. Services (Do work for free)
**Hormozi's favorite, almost "secret and dirty" because it works so well:**

- Adjust their back, perform website audit, apply first layer of sealant, transform video into ebook
- **Why it works:** People know it cost you something → generates massive goodwill → disproportionate persuasion power
- Also: high interface time = more opportunity to soft sell
- Example: "I'll run your gym's ads free for 30 days, get you leads for free, prove I know what I'm doing"—after they make money, they want to keep making money

### 4. Physical Products (Something they can hold)
- Posture assessment chart, supplement sample, bottle of garage sealant, boxing gloves
- Books, branded merchandise

**Critical caveat:** The lead magnet must be **close to the thing you sell**.
- IT services company giving away branded t-shirts? People want t-shirts, not necessarily IT services—bad fit
- Same t-shirts from an apparel white-labeler? Natural lead to more apparel—good fit

## Naming Your Lead Magnet (This Is HUGE)

**The 5-second example:**
- Same video, tanked at 4,000 views
- Chopped and redid first 5 seconds only
- **850,000 views**—200x increase from reframing how people perceived the value

> "After you've written your headline, you've spent 80 cents of your advertising dollar." — David Ogilvy

**Hormozi's actual A/B tests for 100M Leads book:**
- "100M Advertising" vs "100M Promotion" → Advertising won
- "Advertising" vs "Leads" → Leads won
- "Leads" vs "Marketing" → Leads won again
- "How to get more people to want to buy your stuff" vs "How to get strangers to want to buy your stuff" → Strangers won
- "How to get more strangers..." vs "How to get strangers..." → **70% vs 30%**—removing ONE word = 2.5x more clicks

**How to test names:**
1. Run ads ($50 can get enough sample size)
2. Run polls on your audience
3. Post and ask for comments "1 or 2"
4. DM followers/friends for directional feedback

**Golden signal:** When someone asks "When is this coming out?"—that's your winner.

## Make It Easy to Consume

**Key stat:** Hormozi has nearly perfect 25/25/25/25 split between ebook, audio, video, and physical book consumption.

- If he only offered physical, he'd miss 75% of his audience
- Or worse: people opt in but don't consume → leads without conversions

**By delivery type:**

- **Software:** Accessible on phone, computer, Android, Apple
- **Information:** Multiple formats—Kindle, Audible, podcast, video course
- **Services:** Available more times, more ways, more days (don't be "only available 7am Mondays for the free thing"—the guy down the street who's flexible gets the lead)
- **Physical products:** Simple to open, simple to use—think Apple packaging (so elegant people keep the boxes)

---

## Make It Good (Zero Fluff)

**Core principle:** Give away the secrets, sell the implementation.

**What if you only have one valuable thing?** Learn something else valuable. Give that away free, sell the other thing. Reframe "I only have one thing" as a skill deficiency and fix it.

**Why free stuff quality matters more than you think:**
- 99.9% of people who see your stuff will never buy from you
- But they'll have an opinion
- Their opinion impacts the people who WILL buy
- Your reputation compounds

**The sucky fluff alternative:**
1. You discourage people who would've bought
2. When someone texts a friend "Is this guy legit?"—the friend says "I got his free thing, it sucked"
3. Now you've lost a sale from word of mouth

> People judge the value they'll get from your paid thing based on the value of your free thing.

**Purchasing decisions are predictions of future value.** Best way to get someone to predict value after they buy? Give them value BEFORE they buy.

---

## Create the Next Steps (The CTA)

**Don't forget to actually ask for the sale.**

CTA requirements:
- **Clear, simple, direct language**
- **Be clear, NOT clever**

**Example:** "If you're a company doing $1-10M in profit, apply at acquisition.com"

**Add reasons to act now using:**
- **Scarcity** (limited quantity): "I only made 10 of these hats"
- **Urgency** (limited time): "This ebook won't be available after tomorrow"
- **Both** is ideal

**The Fraternity Party Planner Frame:** Any reason is more compelling than no reason.
- "Timmy got his wisdom teeth out—kegger!"
- Doesn't matter what the reason is, just have one.

## What Makes a Great Lead Magnet (Summary)

1. **Engages ideal customers** when they see it—they think "I want that"
2. **Gets more people to engage than core offer alone**—lowers cost per customer
3. **Valuable enough that people actually consume it**—not just opt-in and ignore
4. **Makes the RIGHT people more likely to buy**—kicks out the bad as much as attracts the good

**End result:** More people show interest, you make more money, you improve your brand—all simultaneously.
