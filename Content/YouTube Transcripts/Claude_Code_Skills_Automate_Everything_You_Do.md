Hey guys, my name's Brandon and I have a
confession. I'm addicted to Claude Code
Skills. And by the end of this video,
you're going to be addicted to Claude
Code Skills, too, and know how to create
skills to automate your own workflows.
And just in case you haven't heard of
Claude Code Skills, it's a brand new
feature released by Claude where you can
teach it your custom workflows. And as
soon as Claude understands what you
want, it'll save it to a set of custom
instructions. And then every time going
forward, Claude will be able to do all
the hard work for you and automate the
entire process. And personally, I've
been using Claude code skills to
automate everything in my life. All the
way to helping me come up with titles
and hooks for my YouTube videos. All the
way to automating the boring task inside
of my startup, Shipkit.AI.
Basically, if there's something I'm
doing more than once, you can bet I'm
creating a Claude code skill to help me
out because they let me move faster,
more efficiently, and make my life a
thousand times easier. And by the end of
this video, you're going to be addicted
and be creating them, too. And most
importantly, to help you wrap your head
around creating amazing Claude code
skills, in today's video, I'm going to
be walking you through the six-step
framework I've created called Master,
which helps you make amazing Claude code
skills to automate your own task. So, in
the rest of this video, we're going to
go through step by step what the heck is
this six-step framework. Then at the
very end, we're going to take everything
and put it to practice and actually
build out a claude code skill together
so you can see just how easy it is. So
if you've never created a cla code skill
or you're looking to level up your
automations, you're going to learn so
much in this video. So without further
ado, let's go ahead and dive into the
six-step master framework for creating
your own cloud code skills. Okay, so
let's break down the sixstep master
framework, which the whole goal of this
is to help us create claude code skills
that are amazing. And what we're going
to do in this part is break down
everything step by step so it all makes
sense. And I think the easiest way to
understand it is to actually as we go
look at an example of a real world use
case. So let's break it down so that we
understand how it all connects and so
that you can create your own amazing
well ststructured claude code skills. So
here's what we're trying to do inside of
this process. The very first thing that
we want to do is we manually want to use
clawed code to help us perform a task.
So in this example, if we're trying to
write an email, what we could do is say,
"All right, step one, I want to write a
subject line. Here's how I like to
create subject lines, and you know,
Claude code, please create a subject
line for, you know, introducing me to
this other, you know, other software
developer cuz I think we could
collaborate together." So then, you
know, Claude Code is going to come up
with different tasks. So that's
performing step one. We're telling
Claude Code to do the work for us. But
as you know, as we both very well know,
AI is phenomenal but needs feedback. So
that's where step two comes in, where
along the way, we are going to be
providing feedback to cloud code. So on
upon every step, we're going to say,
"Oops, nope, that wasn't right. I like
to do this instead." Well, that was
better. However, it still wasn't
perfect. Try it again. So we're at every
step providing feedback. And we're just
doing this every step along the way. So
as soon as we get step one done, we have
a great title or subject line for our
email. Fantastic. We'll now go to part
two where we're going to start working
on writing the body of the email where
we're going to have like, "Hey person, I
saw you did this. I would love to
collaborate. Here's how I think we could
probably work together." And it would be
a win-win for everybody. And as we know,
Claude Code is going to do a good job,
but it's not going to write like us. So
then we're going to say like, "Hey, I
don't speak like that. I usually do, you
know, exclamation marks. I'm usually I
like to be conversational, really
excited. like I have a ton of different
ways that I like to write emails. So
over and over and over we provide
feedback once again and we go through
this whole process and then maybe at the
very end we're saying like hey you know
I like the content of the email but I
like to make it readable. So, like, can
you add in some like bold text so it's
easier to skim, you know, just like some
maybe fine like last minute tweaks? And
we would say, all right, this is my
three-step process for writing emails.
And along the way, we've done the task
and we provided feedback all in one cla
session. And what's phenomenal is now we
have set ourselves up to actually turn
all of our key lessons learned into a
systematized skill. And at this point,
all you have to do is say, "Hey, Claude
Code, please turn everything that we
just did for writing emails into a new
Claude Code skill. Ask me as many
questions as you need so that you can
convert my writing style and this entire
process into a skill." And Claude Code
is, they did a phenomenal job on making
this very easy. It'll go, "Oh, yeah, of
course. I can see what you did was
broken down into three key steps. Let me
go ahead and start planning out making
this skill. Now, what's super super
important and you're going to see this
in a minute is it we're going to
basically when we're creating the claude
code skill, we are going to do it in
planning mode. What I mean by that is by
using claude code plan mode, it's going
to have a bunch of questions for us. So,
it's going to say, hey, like, do you
want this to apply to all emails? Do you
only want this to apply to personal
emails? You know, so we're basically
going to train it by answering a bunch
of questions about the skill itself.
Then as soon as we cross out all of
these, we have a very well-trained first
version of our Claude code skill. And
now this is where the magic of Claude
code skills come in. Because now what we
can do going forward is say, great, I
need to start working on a new email.
Please help me use the email writer
skill and help me write an email to this
new person. and we're going to go
through the same process again. Is it
going to be perfect attempt number two?
The answer is no. There are still going
to be a few issues where we detect new
edge cases. We are in a different
situation and we're going to update our
subject line. We're going to update our
body or the way we structure the email.
And once we get done writing that email,
we are going to enhance our claude code
skill to say, "Hey, can you see all the
changes I just asked for? Well, as you
can see, we want to do rule A, B, C, and
D differently. So, make sure next time
you write an email, you pay attention to
these special edge cases. So, then
Claude Code is going to say, "Of course,
I would be happy to update the skill for
you." And the cool part is every single
time you perform an action using your
skills, you update your skills so that
they get smarter and smarter every
iteration. It's basically like training
an employee to where eventually after
having them do the task three to five
times, they're dangerously good at doing
their job. And going forward, boom,
crank out an email, it's done in seconds
versus done in, you know, 10 minutes. So
this is, you know, the first few skills.
Then optionally, obviously, what you can
do is roll it out. So what I mean by
that is well at this point you have a
skill that you can use yourself but if
you want to really be an impact user of
AI you can do multiple things you can
roll it out to other people inside your
business you can start to share it if
you're you know growing your own startup
you can say and basically transfer down
these skills so that you can have like
let's say your like community manager
well now your community manager can help
write emails just like you. So cool
thing here is every time you perform an
action, you're basically creating the
standard operating procedures to do that
task and then you can roll it out or
share it with anyone else who you want
so that they can start to do the job at
your level of quality going forward.
This just blew my mind the second I
started using it which is why I use
cloud code skills to help me do
everything going forward. So, with now
that we've covered the basics of the
sixstep framework, let's go ahead and
take this into action. And I'm going to
show you how I'm using Claude Code
skills to help me work on my startup
shipkit.AI to help me cut releases
faster. So, instead of me manually
clicking around for 20 minutes, I can
now get it done in like two. So, let's
go ahead and hop over to a real world
demo. So, we'll break it down and then
we'll actually start going through the
six-step process together. So, without
further ado, let's hop on in. Okay. So
before we just start automating
everything, I want to give you a bit of
context on the problem and workflow that
we're trying to automate so it all makes
sense. So here's the issue. I have a
startup called Shipkit.ai where I teach
developers how to build AI applications
in days instead of months. Inside of
Shipkit.ai, there's a ton of pre-built
projects for AI chat, rag templates, ADK
templates, and a bunch more projects to
make it super easy for developers to
launch real world applications stupid
fast. In addition to that, there's a ton
of courses walking them through the
entire process from beginning to end.
And we actually use AI to help with
every step along the way to where AI is
doing most of the work and you're just
answering questions and then hey, AI
builds it for you. Now, here is the core
issue that is sucking up a bunch of my
time and that I want to automate. As you
just heard, there was a ton of pre-built
projects that people are using. Now, as
developers are using these different
projects, I'm adding new features,
functionalities to make it as easy as
possible for them. On top of that, every
now and then, a user will find a bug.
So, it is my job to continually update
these projects and make them as easy as
possible to use. So, every time a new
fix or improvement comes in, I have to
cut a new version of the project. I have
to then update the website to say, "Hey,
you know, here's a new feature for you
guys that you can use." So realistically
what this looks like because this is a
multi-step process. Here's really what
the process that I'm trying to automate
with cloud code skills. First I have to
go in and either do a code fix or I have
to add in new functionality. As soon as
I make that fix I have to update the
local project to keep track of the
change so that the user can tell like
cool my project number is version 2.4 4.
But as you know me, the main contributor
as I'm adding in new project versions, I
might say, "Okay, cool. Well, now we're
on version 2.6. So, I have to update
this project. I have to add in new
change logs. Everything down here." Then
what else do we got to knock out? Well,
every time I then update the change log,
I have to create a new commit to say
what happened wrong and what new
functionality they get. I then have to
use git to tag a new version. So I might
have to say like get tag version 2.6.
After that I have to then go into GitHub
create a new release so that people can
properly download and you know quickly
update to the new version. Then finally
I have to go update the actual shipkit
website to add in a new entry to say
like hey on version 2.6 you got some new
cla code commands or new cla code
skills. So these are this is a a process
that I have to do every week to make you
know basically shipkit best project out
there for building AI applications. Now
this takes up so much of my time even
though it's dead simple it still takes
up a bunch of time to do all of this. So
what you're going to see me do is in the
rest of the video I'm going to be
applying our master framework that we
just covered and I'm going to show you
exactly how we can apply this framework
to automating this process. and you're
going to see this thing's an absolute
beast. So, without further ado, let's go
ahead and hop over to Claude Code and
start automating this process so you can
see the master framework in action.
Okay, so now it's time for us to apply
the master framework to the project so
you can actually see everything in
action. So, here is a quick to-do list
of everything that we're about to do so
you can see it all in action and laid
out. So, at this point, we're going to
say that, hey, I'm already working on a
project, and I've made a ton of code
changes. Just a quick heads up. So, all
the code changes are for a new project
template that I've adding to Shipkit.
It's the number one most requested new
type of project template where people
are going to learn how to build
background jobs so that they can have
their NextJS applications kick off
longunning task in the background,
whether that's longunning AI workflows
or just regular longunning jobs. And
basically this was what people really
really wanted. So that's what I've been
working on building. So what I am trying
to do is say, "Hey, I made a ton of
changes on building this out so that
it's going to be ready very soon."
Speaking of, if you want to use Claude
Skills, get $50 off when purchasing
Shipkit. I'll have a link down in the
description below. But outside of that
out of the way, what we want to do now
is we want to start actually documenting
our process so that we can have Claude
Code make a skill for us. So, here is
exactly what I'm going to do. I'm going
to paste in a request. And here's
basically what we want to start doing.
We want to start updating our change
log. So, specifically, here's our change
log. We're currently on version one. And
there is only, you know, there's no new
things yet. So, here's exactly what
we're going to do. We're going to kick
off clawed code. And at this point, what
it's going to do is start to look at all
of the changes that we've made since the
initial release, which was, you know,
1.0. And this is all testing because
it's not fully public yet. But at this
point, what it's going to do is say,
"Okay, I will happily start to look
through all of your recent changes. Let
me go check out to see what the current
version is. I'm going to go check to see
what the update logs are. I'm going to
also just check basically everywhere.
And at this point, what I'm going to do
is start to provide a little bit of
feedback. So going back to our initial
workflow, I manually do the work, then I
start giving feedback every step along
the way. So I'm just watching Claude
Code do the work. And here's a few
things that I think are interesting. I
never saw it use the GH CLI tool to
actually go check GitHub. So did you
ever use the GH CLI tool to look at the
most recent public release for this
project to actually figure out what were
the official release notes? So this is
us providing feedback and uh it
misspelled it ghi. So then we'll kick
that off. And at this point, you know,
it's already made some changes. So we're
definitely going the right direction. It
did auto increment it, which is awesome.
That's exactly what we wanted. What is
weird is normally I like the change log
to go inside or go the other order. So
that is another quick thing that I want
to change. So at this point, we're
basically just, you know, we're starting
to figure out, hm, for doing task one,
you kind of messed up a few things, and
we're going to instruct it on what it
needs to do differently. So it's going
to go, ah, I can see. So it can see on
the official GitHub page, what we had
was just some like an basic boilerplate,
you know, cuz this is an unofficial
release yet. So hey, everything says
example, but I see, however, I should
use GitHub release in the future. So
we'll just say great in the future. Make
sure that you use GitHub release. Also,
I do not like the way that you're
updating the change log first. I like to
have the order be ascending and you've
made it descending. So, please fix that.
Then, what we can also do is see all the
other changes. So, it's saying, "Hey,
add complete uh transcript workflow to
trigger.dev file upload job management
summaries." So, I like the change log.
Like, that's a that's a pretty good
message. So, I'm very happy with the way
it created the change log. So, at this
point, yeah, you can see it flipped the
order. That is fantastic. So, at this
point, we have updated the change log to
accurately reflect what we're working
on. So, what we want to do now is create
a new commit. So, we're going to say,
fantastic. Can you please use git add
and get commit to store the new updated
shipkit change log and push it to
GitHub? So we'll kick that off. Now this
is, you know, something I normally have
to do where I'm manually having to
create the commit. I'm manually having
to update the shipkit JSON. So this is
what I normally would do manually. So we
are crushing it. We are cruising on the
manual side and we're cruising on the
analyze and get feedback. And at this
point it's trying to add a new git
commit message and I'm totally fine with
it doing that. And then very very soon
we should say success. I've committed
and pushed the changes. Everything is
looking good. Fantastic. So now what we
can do is move over to the next step. So
we can say great. Now can you please tag
the current new version using the
following command and then what we're
going to do is just tell it that it
should do get tag and then the name of
the new version. So, and I'll just say,
and just for context, this tag version
is the updated version you just applied
to the change log in shipkit.json. So,
now it's going to then kick that off.
So, let's see. It's trying to actually
point out the the file. So, we're going
to say fantastic. Now, what it's going
to do is it's going to be like, of
course, I will happily tag it. So, now
it's going to update and actually run
the tag command. So you can see it's
running the tag command for me and I'm
happy for it to do that. So yes, please
proceed. And then it's going to push the
tag. I didn't have to tell it to do it.
It just knew to do it. If obviously if I
didn't want this, I would correct it,
but I do. So fantastic. So at this
point, we have now tagged the new
version and we have applied and pushed
the change to GitHub. So if we actually
hop over to GitHub real fast and we go
over to ShipKit and look at this exact
project. Let's see. I think I went a
little too deep. Let's see. GitHub
Shipkit. And then we'll actually go over
to the project. Yeah, wrong repository.
Yeah. So, you can now see if we go
inside of here, we have a new tag. So,
our new tag is version 1.1.1. That is or
1.0.1. That is perfect. So, now what I'm
going to do is say, great, you did that
perfectly. Can you please use the GH CLI
tool to create a new release for this
new tag? Do not actually do it yet. Just
show me what you would do for the title
of the change log and the, you know, the
actual body of the change logs so I can
review your work. So, I'm going to kick
that off cuz I don't want it to actually
run the command yet. And this is where
we as, you know, developers who are
doing this workflow constantly, we
probably have a few examples that we
could automatically pass in. So, that's
exactly what I'm going to work on. So
I'm going to go over to maybe an
existing tag that I've just worked on
recently. So we'll just go over to the
rag application and then I will go copy
another release just so it can have
reference files. So I will actually and
heck I'll just tell it that cuz it's
like you could always pass screenshots
if you have access to other existing
reference material that way or you can
just say hey by the way if you want to
see examples so you better understand
what to do please use this. So, what I'm
going to tell it real fast is say that
is looking great. However, I would like
you to match the style of how I normally
create titles and bodies. So, please use
the same CLI tool to look up the most
three recent releases for the and then
we'll pass it in rag SAS application or
we'll say repo just so you can get a
feel of what I like. And if you have any
questions, please let me know. if not
update your change log to reflect the
new style. Fantastic. So, this is a
great meta lesson real fast to where
when you're actually going through and
giving feedback or manual instructions,
you can always add in existing reference
material. So, if this is your first time
doing it, you could, and we were going
back to the email example, you could say
like, "Hey, here's seven previous emails
that I've used in the past. Feel free to
go ahead and steal inspiration for
these." Or if you're giving feedback,
you could once again say, "Hey, here are
three example references of what I've
done in the past. Update what you have
done to reflect this new approach." So
that's what it's doing now. It's going
to say basically, am I cool to start
searching through using GitHub to look
at the most previous releases for your
other project? And you can see it's
grabbing the three previous examples,
doing a phenomenal job. It's
understanding what the title style is.
It's understanding what the body is. How
I usually like to use headers and make
it very easy to read what was updated,
if there was any big impacts. Now that
it understands exactly what it wants,
it's going to say, "All right, great.
Here is the updated version of the
body." So, hey, title, we have a new
one. It's following the exact format. It
does a high-level overview of what was
in the change. then it does a really
good job of breaking things down into
what's new. So this is perfect. So I'm
going to say yes, that looks fantastic.
Can you please use the GitHub CLI tool
and create a new release for the new
tag? And if you have any questions,
please let me know. Fantastic. So at
this point, it's going to proceed to go
through the process and we are almost
done. We are on the very last code step
and eventually we're going to hop over
to updating this on ShipKit. So, we're
very very close to being done with the
manual process. And it's going to ask if
it's cool to start creating new GitHub
releases. The answer is yes. So, very
soon what we should see is for Shipkit
over on the new worker repository, we
should see it's made a new release. So,
tada, it has done it. That is fantastic.
So, it is successful. So, here's what
we're going to do next. Great. We are
now on the final step. Can you please
use the Superbase MCP server to go forth
and look at the shipkit project and
specifically the change log table and
can you please create a new change log
for this project. If you have any
questions, please let me know. And just
as a quick update while that's going to
load, what we're trying to do now is we
want to have and basically update our
change log. And we're using Superbase
and I have an MCP server running. So
what's awesome is Cloud Code can
actually directly write to my database
and create new changes. So that's
exactly what we're about to run in just
a second. So let's hop on back. And what
we're going to do is kick this off. But
I'm instantly going to pause it just
because I had yet to actually hook up
any MCP servers. So that was a quick
mistake. So what I'm going to do is kill
this very, very quickly. Then I'm going
to restart it because I had to add back
in my cloud code, you know, MCP servers
to where I was adding back in the
superbase MCP. So this is just hooking
up to my Shipkit project is basically
what's happening. So now whenever I type
in MCP what would happen is it's going
to say tada you are connected to
everything. Perfect. That's exactly what
we want. Now what we can do is go to
resume and we can actually you know kick
back off where we left things where we
have our most recent instruction. So we
can say proceed now. Now what it's going
to do is it's now going to start to use
the MCP server to start looking at
shipkit projects and the change log
table. So at this point it's like hey
are you cool with me listing the tables?
Yeah, sure. Please go ahead look at the
different tables, look at the different
schemas. We can actually look in here to
see what it's seeing. So, it's seeing
all of my different tables inside of
Shipkit. I hit control O to do that, by
the way. Now, it's going to say, all
right, are you cool with me actually
making a query to your database?
Personally, when using MCP, I never
allow execute SQL. I always manually
review the SQL command. So, I'm going to
say, yeah, you can do it, but not
permanently. just for this one command,
you're good to select my most previous
entries. So, at this point, what it's
going to do is it's going to say, let's
see, it's going to go through the
process, and it's basically trying to
look through and just find other
examples. So, I'm just going to keep
letting it do its thing to find how
we've done change logs for previous
workflows. So, at this point, it's
saying, "All right, I'm just going to do
a few more tasks to figure out, you
know, what your style is." And you know
at this point it understands the whole
format. So fingers crossed it's actually
going to start to create a new change
log for our new project. So we're going
to give this just a second cuz I think
we are almost there. And it's now saying
all right here is what I'm going to do.
I am going to run this SQL command
that's going to insert. Here's the new
title. Here is the body and everything
else. So that looks fantastic to me. So,
I'm going to say yes, you can proceed.
And sorry, it's spazzing out. I
shouldn't have resized. But now, what
it's doing is it's writing that new
entry. And it's going to say, "Tada, we
have done that." So, if we actually hop
back over to, in our case, shipkit, and
we go to change log. When we zoom in
now, what we should see is let's
refresh. Give this a second. So, now
you'll see change log. We have the, you
know, thing like we never had to click
inside shift kit. We never had to click
inside GitHub. We did the entire process
through Cloud Code. So guys, give
yourself a pat on the back cuz this is
knocking out a manual task. We provide
feedback along the way. Now, at this
point, we are done with the first two
steps. And we're now over to the
systemize into a skill. This is one of
the most important steps to make sure
you get things set up properly right
here between, you know, setting up the
skill and training it. So, here's
exactly what you're going to do inside
of Cloud Code, the exact same instance.
What you want to do is make sure you hit
shift tab to turn on plan mode. Plan
mode inside cloud code basically does a
phenomenal job of asking you questions
to make sure it fully understands what
you want it to do before taking action.
Awesome tool. So we're going to say
fantastic. Thank you so much for helping
me go through the process of, you know,
documenting my code changes, updating
the project change log, committing
everything, tagging it, also committing
a new GitHub release, and then finally
updating Shipkit with the specific
change log. Can you please help me make
a new clawed code skill that will
systematize this entire process? Please
ask me as many questions as you have so
that we can be on the same page before
creating this new skill. Fantastic. Now,
at this point, we're going to kick it
off and I'm hoping you guys can kind of
see the power of this because this
session is filled with gold. It
understands our request, what we wanted
to do correctly, incorrectly, and you
know the entire seven or six steps to
actually do the task we want at hand.
And the second we get this done right,
we are good to go to actually use this
every time going forward. So, I'm hoping
you can see how fast we're going to be
able to move the second this is done.
Okay. So, it's going to say, should the
skill automatically determine the
version bump? So, I'm going to basically
say this is where you shine as a
developer because this is where you get
to decide exactly what you want and the
more context you provide, the better.
So, I'm going to say yes, you should
always default to a patch. But if the
user says they want to do a minor or
major update, obviously you should
listen to that. But always default to
looking at the specific shipkit.json
file, looking at the cart version and
incrementing the patch. Okay, so that's
what we're going to do. Oops, I put that
in the wrong spot. So let's copy this
over. Paste that in. Then what we're
going to do, hit enter. Now, it's going
to say, "All right, so how should the
skill generate the GitHub release title
and body?" So, we're going to say what
we should do is always use the in our
case, show me a draft review first, just
because before we create the release, I
just want to make sure that like, do I
like that name? So, that's what we're
going to ask for here. Then, should this
skill handle multiple templates at once
or do things one at a time? So we're
going to say support batch mode. So I'm
going to say I would like to support
batch mode because there are numerous
times when I have worked on updating all
of the templates by providing features
across the board. So you should also
handle that approach too. So basically
the ideal workflow would be I would say
please go to work on project work SAS or
chat SAS and then you would just take it
from there. Okay. And then we're going
to do that. And then it's going to say
what should happen when superbase change
log entry creation. We're going to say I
think I would always like for
confirmation first just to make sure but
you know you can obviously do it your
own what you want to do. So once you
have answered all of the questions at
this point it's going to maybe ask with
a few more follow-up questions or if it
has enough context it'll just proceed.
So this is the best part about plan mode
is it makes sure it fully understands
what you need before taking action. All
right. So now obviously we introduced a
new concept of updating multiple
projects at the same time. So it's going
to say all right I have a few questions
on this. So when it comes to batch mode
with working on multiple projects.
Should the skill process all specific
templates and show me all release drafts
at once for review or handle them one at
a time? So we're going to say handle
sequentially. Should the skill
automatically detect when templates have
been changed since they're last released
or should I always explicitly specify
which templates to process? So I think I
will always specify like hey you need to
work on project A and project B. Then
finally when analyzing commits for
change log should the skill look at all
commits since the last release? And
we're going to say yes all commits. And
finally where should cloud code skills
live? though it's going to say do you
want this new skill to live in your
current project directory or do you want
this skill to apply to all of your
projects and this is very specific to
the current project. So we're just going
to say yeah this is only for the current
project. Fantastic. So at this point we
have done a phenomenal job guys of
systematizing and training the new skill
thanks to plan mode. Now we are in the
home stretch where we're going to
basically be able to go through
enhancing through iteration. So this is
will be the very final step. It's asking
a few final questions. And at this
point, I'm just going to say we'll do
create release. Uh we'll do shipkit
create release. Yeah, like this. And
then change log. We'll just say auto
detect submit. Okay, fantastic. So at
this point, if it ask anything else, I
will just say, hey, you're good to go.
So it's now going to present with me the
entire plan to make the new skill. So
this is an awesome opportunity for us to
at this step to start providing feedback
on the final results. So maybe it
misunderstood something, but 90% of the
time for stuff like this, I'm just going
to say I just want to start using the
template and I'll adjust from there. I
don't want to spend another 3 minutes
reviewing everything manually. Just
like, hey, you got a good idea of it.
Probably this was not complicated. It
was seven steps with some tweaks. So I'm
pretty sure you absolutely crushed it.
So, what it's going to do is the second
you start to make Claude Code Skills,
especially if this is your first skill,
what you would expect to see is in
whichever project directory you're
working in, you will see inside the
Claude folder, you will see a brand new
skills folder. Inside of this skills
folder, you will see all of the specific
skills that you have created so far to
help you accomplish your work. So, this
is going to take a few seconds, but we
will eventually have the ship kit
release skill. So, we'll pause and then
we'll review it together as soon as it's
done. All right, guys. So, we just
created our first skill. However, I want
to point out a major mistake made by
Claude Code. So, you if you ever run
into the same issue, you can fix it
yourself. So, here is what went wrong.
You'll see that it says, "Hey, I created
this new skill for you. It does
everything that you asked me to do." And
what you can do is basically
specifically call out this skill by just
running forward slash shipkit-refs.
So what basically happened is claude
code mistaked this as a command for
claude code instead of a skill for
claude code. There is obviously there's
it's getting a little complex now in cla
code. However, we can easily fix this
and you can tell if something went wrong
if inside of skills you directly see a
markdown file like this. you know,
clawed skills are not in markdowns.
They're supposed to be in files or
sorry, in folders like this. So, here is
what I did and here's what you can do to
fix this very easily. So, what you can
do is say, "Hey, please use a tool or an
MCP tool called Context 7 and look up
how to create cloud code skills and can
you just make sure that the brand new
skill that we created follows best
practices. If you don't have this set
up, by the way, you can always set up
context 7 like this. Super super
straightforward to do. This is the most
powerful MCP server for AI development.
Definitely recommend you just grabbing
that snapshot, adding it to your
project. But once you do that, it's
going to go fantastic. I'll of course
look look this up for you and I know
exactly how to create Claude Code skills
now. And I'll review yours. And after
reviewing yours, I can see yeah, this
was a mess up. Claude code skills are
not standalone markdown files. What
should be happening is we need to you
know change it. So it it gave me some
recommended actions and I was like yeah
just keep it a skill and make sure you
fix all the errors you pointed out. And
here is what we will end up with. So
here's our news file where it has a name
and a description which makes it super
easy for claude code to at all point
look up. Oh, okay. I can see the current
user is trying to automate and work on
and deploy a new release for a shipkit
template. Fantastic. I know that I need
to trigger this skill. So skills get
triggered more implicitly rather than
like doing forward slash like you
normally would with cloud code. And what
I mean by that forward slash like this
is how you can call commands like all
these are commands but you can't do
forward slash and then call you know
shipkit release. It doesn't skills don't
work like that. So now that we have that
set up, you know, the rest of the skill
includes everything that's needed for
actually, you know, working on
performing all the instructions. So now
what we can do is take this for a spin
and we will actually delete this old
one. And things are looking great. So
fantastic. So we're now going to take
this for a spin. I'm going to make some
code changes and we'll test it out so
you guys get to see the final step of
enhance and roll out. So let's go ahead
and hop over and make these changes. All
right. So, I just cranked out a bunch of
code changes for you guys. So, now we
get to try out our skill one more time.
And just a quick reminder, we are now
officially in the enhance through
iteration phase because we already have
the skill. Now, we're going to iterate.
So, here's what we're going to do. We're
going to open up a new instance of
Claude. So, what we can do is open up
Claude. And just quick side note, if
you're interested in how I'm just like
quickly opening up new instances of
claude code and how I'm basically
keeping my hands on the keyboard to be a
much more efficient software engineer, I
have a free resource that you can grab
down below. It's a Claude code cheat
sheet. 100% recommend you checking out.
A lot of developers inside of my school
community and Shipkate community have
absolutely been loving it. I'm sure you
guys will too. So just it'll be one of
the first links down below. But back to
the task at hand. So what is interesting
is at this point when we're trying to
use this skill, what you can't do is do
forward slash and say shipkit release.
You cannot do claude code commands. You
have to make the request that basically
you know is implicit to say hey I'm
trying to do this task and claude code
will go oh I know what you're trying to
do. You're trying to run this skill. So
here's what we're going to do. I just
made a bunch of changes to the and then
I'll call it out. It is the worker SAS
project. Actually, you can probably just
call it out this way. Worker SAS.
Fantastic. Can you please help me cut a
new release for this project? And if you
have any questions for me, please let me
know. Now, at this point, we're going to
kick it off. And ideally, what should
happen here in just a second is it'll
go, okay, I can see, oh, I did it
perfectly. I can see you're trying to
cut a new release. Let's examine the
current state. Boom. At this point, it's
going to start detecting the skill. So,
it knows exactly what instructions it
needs to do, and it's starting to do it,
guys. Like, this is the crazy part. So,
it's going to say, "All right, I can see
you're at version 1.0.1."
Now, what we're going to do is start
working on making improvements. So,
here's what it's going to do. At this
point, it's trying to make a request to
start looking at the latest release. So,
we're going to say, "Sure, go ahead.
Yes, look at the latest release." And
you can see, all right, cool. GitHub is
at 1.0.1. Now, it's going to start to
check to see what the difference is. So
here is a issue potentially is it's
looking at the old version. So it's
looking at version here's what's going
on. It's looking at version you know
1.0.1
and comparing that to 1.0. But basically
we have to correct it. So this is where
we iterate and we're going to say
basically this is where I'm going to say
hey here's what you're doing wrong. Okay
so what you're doing wrong is I have
changes that I have pushed and I have
not cut a new version for them yet. So,
you were supposed to look at the actual
changes I've made locally in additional
commits that I've made and compare it
against our latest version. You're not
supposed to be comparing release against
release. What questions do you have for
me so that you can update your process
and actually do what you're supposed to
do. Fantastic. So, this is the iterate
stage. So, this is exactly how you
create dangerously effective cla
templates or claude code skills. It's a
mouthful. So at this point you can see
okay I can see you know you're
absolutely right I messed up and what we
have to do is in the back of our mind we
know we need to update the skills. So as
soon as we get done going through this
task we need to say hey look at what you
did wrong now help me do it again. So
here is what it's going to do. It has a
few questions for us based on the
changes we made. This is just a new
patch. Fantastic. So it is nice. It's
like hey this is kind of a bigger
change. So like a minor might be
effective, but this project hasn't been
released yet. So I'm just doing small
patches. So ideally, I'll actually reset
everything to version 1.0 afterwards
whenever it fully goes live here
hopefully in the next 2 weeks. But right
now, we're just still practicing. So
fantastic. So at this point, we'll
release it. Now, here's what we have to
watch non-stop is we have to make sure
that it's following the process step by
step. So, we have to correct it because
going back to our task from a second
ago, it is skipping a lot of the steps
that it was supposed to do. So, this is
where you have to come in and start
correcting it. So, I'll show you going
back to our scratch folder. So, uh let
me show you what it's supposed to do.
So, you know, at this point, I'll just
copy it in and basically just say like,
hey, here is the process you supposed to
follow. So I'm going to say so here is
the process you were supposed to follow.
First you were supposed to update the
change log. Then you were supposed to
look at making a new commit after
updating the change log. Then create a
tag then start working on the GitHub
release. You're kind of going out of
order. So please realign and update
based on these instructions. And if you
have any questions please let me know.
So this is one of the once again we are
just iterating and refining and the more
step by step the process the better. So
it's like oh yep I can see exactly
what's going on. So what we should see
it do here in just a second is start to
update our shipkit.json with our new
version and you know it's basically like
training a new employee where they're
like ah I think I know what to do or no
I don't. So you can see yep uh app
update transcript viewer multiiformat
downloads eventbased tracking. Yep
that's exactly what we worked on. It did
create the new version. At that point,
it's now trying to actually push the
changes. Now that it made a commit, then
it's going to tag it, which is exactly
what we want. So, we're going to say
yes. So, at this point, we are almost in
the home stretch of like, you know,
we're cruising at this point. Now, it's
going to push it. That's also what we
wanted it to do. Now, it's going to
start to work on trying to create that
new release. So, you can see it's going
in the right order now that it's been
corrected. So now before I create the
release, just one chance for you to
review it. And this new release looks
fantastic. So we're going to say looks
great to me. Fantastic. So now we are in
the home stretch. And ideally what it's
going to do after making that GitHub
release, we can actually go check it
out. And while we're doing that, what
was pretty cool is just so you can
understand the changes that it's talking
about, it's these. So I should be able
to like upload a file for the project.
Actually, it's not fully fully fixed.
Still still working on it. Oh, it's not
running. That's why. Silly me. But long
story short, you can upload videos and
it gets the transcript. So at this
point, it's going to try to actually cut
the release. So we're going to say yes,
proceed. And if we head over to GitHub,
so GitHub, we should start to see in
just a second a new release for our new
project. So you can see version 1.0.2.
It worked. It properly did it. Now what
it's going to do is now that that's
done, we can say great. And the next
step is that you are supposed to use the
superbase MCP to update the shipkit
change log. That's the very next step
you need to work on. So at this point,
we can kick it off. And what I want to
show you at the very end as soon as this
is over is how we can iterate
effectively cuz we're going to go back
to using the plan tool to update the
skill. So it's a very, like I said, it's
a very iterative process. So we're going
to allow it to properly understand who
is the author for the new change. Then
it's going to start to insert a new
change log. And we can see in this
change log what it's trying to do is
make a new event and it has the proper
values. I just want to make sure that
it's attaching it to the right project
which is worker SAS and it is perfect.
So we're going to say you can insert it.
Now if we hop back over to our change
log over here and start refreshing you
can see ta it did the full process end
to end which is awesome. Like that's
this is what the skill is supposed to
do. So, here's what we're going to do
now that we're finally at the end. We're
going to turn on plan mode. So, you can
do that by hitting shift tab a few
times. And we're going to say, "Great.
So, when going through this skill, you
made numerous errors and did not follow
the to-do list in the appropriate order
and you just missed out on steps. What
questions do you have for me so that you
can properly update the skill going
forward so that it works properly next
time?" And at this point, we can
probably also just call out the exact
skill. So this is the skills right here.
Boom. So now we can kick it off. And
this will start to iterate and once
again take us through the plan cycle.
And this is the like you will do this.
Every time it makes a mistake, you will
go through this. And after like two to
three attempts, this thing is going to
work like an absolute charm. So when
you're, you know, future you is trying
to do this, you just say, "Hey, I'm
trying to make a change." And just boom,
boom, boom, boom, it's all done. So, as
you can see, it's starting to ask a few
questions. And let's see. So, first off,
it did clearly articulate what it did
wrong, which is great because it's going
to make sure it doesn't do that in the
future. Let's actually make this full
screen so you guys can see it a little
bit easier. So, we'll go down to the
bottom and zoom in. So, let's see what
errors did it make. So, it properly it
tried to do things in the wrong order.
Yeah, it basically just it followed a
ton of things that were in the wrong
order. So, when it comes to step two,
analyze changes. The skill says to use
GitHub releases to view the latest tag
to get the most recent release. But in
this case, there was no GitHub release
yet, only the tags. So when it comes to
step two, that is not true. There were
GitHub releases. I can actively see them
right now whenever I hop over to GitHub.
So I think you might have just been
using the command wrong, but the GitHub
releases and tags were both there. And
obviously it was your job to compare the
changes we made against that latest
tag/release. Next, when it comes to step
five, you know, the skill says to show a
draft review before making the changes,
but you corrected mem.
I'm not sure what you're asking on step
five, to be honest. Yeah, just basically
simplify your questions and you should
tell me what you're planning on changing
on updating the skills so I can review
it before you actually make the change.
Now, this is just a quick way to like,
you know, just have the AI to like cut
things down to be a little bit more
simpler for us just because sometimes it
gets a little in the weeds and doesn't
clearly articulate what it's trying to
do. So, we'll give this a second.
Okay, so here's the final quick things
is it's saying all right, so when it
comes to step two, it's going to fix the
GitHub releases. It's saying it used the
wrong command. So that is totally fine.
So we're going to say, yep, your step
two fixes. Sounds great. Then when it
comes to step five, think we're on the
same page. Use your best judgment based
on what I've said so far because I
usually do like to view the draft. But
this was an odd edge case just because
you were going out of order. So just use
your best judgment based on the correct
approach that we ended up implementing
towards the end. Outside of that, I'm
pretty happy with the changes that
you're suggesting. So now we'll just
kick it off. And at this point, what
should start to happen is Claude code is
going to go, okay, fantastic. So I'm
going to use best judgment. And you can
always just say use best judgment
because this is iterative. like you
don't it doesn't have to be perfect
today cuz when you do it again next time
we're going to make it better again. So
this is this is the hard part about
refining a broken process. So here is
the updated change. So here's what it's
going to do. So it's going to add a new
requirements so that it fully
understands all the changes that were
made. From there it's going to figure
out the GitHub release. Then it's
skipping some steps. I'm just going to
say looks great. Proceed. Then we're
going to kick that off. And now what's
going to happen is we actually hop over
to our skill. What we should start to
see here in just a second is it's going
to make all of those necessary changes
to where it's going to update the steps
to appropriately reflect what we wanted
it to do. So, we're going to say yes.
And from that point forward, we are
setting ourselves up to, you know, do
this one over and over and over again.
And finally, definitely not going to
like we don't have to show this one. But
at this point, you guys are set up for
success. So, if after going through
iterate and it works perfect, boom, you
guys can start to share it with other
developers on your team so that they can
move faster. If you have employees who
are under you, you can share it with
them so that they can, you know, start
to work and perform tasks at your level
and to your liking or if you are, you
know, hiring new people to help you out.
Boom. You already have working standard
operating procedures that you can just
say, "Hey, go do this for me next time."
Or if you want to be a one agent man
army, hey, no need to roll it out. you
can just crank out with all the skills,
all the work yourself using AI because
you're going to move 10 times faster by
automating stuff that takes time that
you shouldn't even have to do in the
first place. So yeah, so that is a quick
wrap on getting your skills iterated and
getting yourself and your cloud code
skills working like a charm. So that's a
wrap for this video guys. I hope you
enjoyed seeing how you can create your
own claude code skills using the master
framework. If you have any questions,
feel free to drop a comment down below
