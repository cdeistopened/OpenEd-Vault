# Claude Skills explained: the most POWERFUL AI tool you're not using

**Source:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFGK0IvPaNc --- --- Claude skills is the most powerful AI tool that you're not using right now. It makes both Claude and Claude code 10 times more powerful. In this video, I'll go over what Claude skills are, why they're important, and then I'll walk you through building five skills that will instantly make your workflow much better. You're going to be building and creating products 10 times faster after this video. If you're building anything right now with Claude or Claude code, this is a mustwatch video up until the very end. Let's get into it., what are Claude skills? Why is the entire internet talking about them right now? Claude's skills instantly make Claude and Claude code much more powerful. You become Neo in the Matrix in the scene where he's plugging the USB into the back of his head and then he learns kung fu. You're doing the exact same thing with Claude where you're plugging into Claude and it instantly learns brand new tools and skills that it could start using while you're building. It allows you to control exactly how Claude and Claude code performs. If you wanted to become worldclass designer, you plug in a designer skill. If you wanted to become a world-class product planner, you plug that in. If you wanted to become a world-class content writer, you plug that in. It's simple. It's easy and it's powerful. We're about to walk through all of it. They're unbelievably easy to create in Claude.
 I'll show you exactly how to do that.
 Then you can take those skills you built, plug it into Clawude Code, and all of a sudden it'll be 10 times smarter. Which skills should you be creating though? That's a good question. Which skills should you be creating? any workflows inside of Claude or Claude code that you do over and over and over again designing products, building out components, building road maps, naming your apps, writing content, whatever it is. Things you do over and over and over again, you should turn into skills that Claude performs exactly how you'd want it to., here are five skills we're going to build in this video and at the end will make Claude much more powerful for you.
 We're going to build an idea validator skill. will teach Claude how to validate ideas that when you're about to build with Claude or Claude code, it can tell you if your ideas are good or not. A launch planner that will plan out your entire road map and everything you should be building., it learns how to build those road maps for you. We're going to build a product designer skill, which is going to be my favorite. If you ever thought that AI creates disgusting UIs, we are going to teach Claude how to design way better UI that everything it builds is beautiful. We're going to build a marketing skill it becomes a way better marketer it builds you better tweets, blog posts, announcements, LinkedIn posts, whatever you want. We're going to teach Claude and Claude code how to be a way better marketer. And then we're also going to teach Claude how to be a product manager it can help you decide what features you should be adding to your product, what features you should be building out. We'll turn Claude into a worldclass product manager. We'll plug in the USB to the back of its head and going to know how to manage your product for you. These are all five skills that I've built out myself that I've totally validated to make sure that they're helpful., you should stick with me to the end you get all these skills and make Claude perform way better for you., let's get into building some of these skills. I'm going to hop into Claude now. All right, we're in Claude and we're going to build out our first skill. One of the best things about Claude, they have all these features, sub agents, hooks, all this.
 The best part about Claude is you can ask Claude to build these things for you. It's simple., we're going to start building out these skills in Claude. We're going to have Claude build them out for us. The first skill we're going to build is the idea validator skill. The reason why I love this skill is it helps you validate ideas before you build them out. If you're anything me, you love building in Claude code. You love coming up with side projects to build out. But one thing many people don't do is they don't validate their idea before they build out. Is there a market out there?
 Is there an actual challenge you're solving? This skill we're about to teach Claude is going to help us validate ideas., we always make sure we're working on good ideas., let's do this. Let's plug in this prompt here.
 I'm going to also put this down below as well., feel free to copy and paste this in. Create a skill called idea validator that gives me honest, quick feedback on app ideas before I invest time building evaluation criteria. Is the market too crowded? Who else is doing this? What's different? Demand. Do people want this or do they say they do? Feasibility. Can a solo builder ship this in two to four weeks? Monetization. interest factor.
 Are there other people interested in this? We tell it to be brutally honest., it doesn't affirm everything we're saying and it gives us an output format. What this is going to do is build the skill for us and implement it into Claude., we're going to hit send. And now Claude is going to get to work building this skill out. And what the skill is is a markdown file that plugs into Claude. Right? That's the USB in the matrix that they plug in the back of his head. is a markdown file that explains what this skill is and how it should work., first thing it's doing is reading the skill creation guidelines., it's reading its own guidelines on how to create skills and it's going to build it out for us. It's now creating a skill.mmarkdown file.
 This is what we can plug into Claude and Claude code to teach Claude how to do things for us, including validating our ideas. Perfect. The skill has been created and packaged successfully., in a second, it's going to give us an entire folder of files that we're going to download. We can plug into Claude, which I'm going to show you how to do, and we can plug in a Claude code, which I'll also show you how to do. I'm telling you, if you stick with me and do these five skills, Claude is going to perform much better for you, and the apps you build will be much better. Okay, to create the idea validator skill here, we download that. Once that's downloaded, we're going to go back into our settings.
 We're going to go into capabilities again. We're going to scroll down and you're going to see skills. You click upload skill and you're going to choose that file you downloaded. I open that skill up. It's now installing into claude. We're jacking the skill into claude Neo skill uploaded successfully. And there it is. Idea validator skill. It is turned on and we're good to use it. Now, if I go back in and I create a new chat, you can see it automatically references it. Right?, there's nothing special we have to do now. All we have to say is please come up with an idea for us., I'm going to leave that default prompt in there and I'm going to say my idea for an app is an app store for vibecoded apps. I'm going to hit send on that and it is going to automatically know to use that skill that we plugged in. And now it's going to be able to validate our skill much better., before we created this skill, if you said, "Hey, can you validate this idea for us?" It would guess how to validate ideas. It wouldn't have any guidelines. it wouldn't know what to do.
 It'd probably Google the internet first and see, okay, how do I validate ideas, but now that we gave it a very specific skill set for validating ideas, it knows exactly how to validate ideas for us and can give us much better results. for this idea we came up with, the quick verdict is to skip it. I love that. I see this is something new, right? A lot of the time the issue with Claude in chat GPT is they affirm everything you say. No matter what you say, go, "Oh, great idea, Alex. You're amazing. Incredible idea. The best ever." Now, it's going to give you critical feedback. It's going to say, "Hey, I looked at the market.
 There's too many competitors. There's not enough use here. You're not solving a challenge. You should skip this.", it goes into other similar products that already exist. And it goes into, okay, if you want to build this, here's how you would make it stronger.
 Pivot to creator tools marketplace.
 Instead, focus on selling Claude Skills.
 That's not a bad idea. Okay, what if I create a Claude skills marketplace? That's pretty good. I that idea. Maybe we build that out right now., it's looking the idea validator worked, right? It went in, it researched other existing products. It gave me ideas for what would make it stronger. It researched the challenge that we're trying to solve. And it wouldn't have done this if we didn't create that skill. It probably would have gave a generic, "Yeah, I that idea. Go ahead and build it.
 Good luck." Right? that's all it would have done. But now it has a complete structure of how to valid ideas which is amazing. we built our first skill. Now anytime you ever come up with ideas of what you want to build, you can validate it out here and Claude will do the research for you. Let's move on to the second skill we're going to build in this workflow. The next skill we're going to do is a launch planner skill. This is a skill that once we validate an idea, this skill will help us plan out the launch, come up with the ideas, the road map, all of that. let's build this skill out. here's the prompt. Again, it's down below. You might as well follow along with me and copy and paste. Build these skills out that you don't have to waste time after doing that. do it with me here. Here's the skill. Create a skill called launch planner that helps take app ideas and turn them into shippable MVPs. Include my product philosophy, my preferred tech stack, which is Nex.js Superbase Versel., this is going to make it super easy. Always use the same tech stack, always have the best design philosophy, MVP scoping, what's going to help us come up with the MVP design.
 It's going to avoid common mistakes building features no one asked for or overengineering which is a lot of time it will do this when having it build out a roadmap and then we will instruct it okay every time we give you an idea give us the PRD give us starter prompts for claude code and keep me focused on shipping it's going to teach claude how to help you launch your apps we're going to hit send on that and it's going to get to work building that skill out for us once this is done right we're going to take our validated idea give it back to Claude and it's going to use its launch skill skill to help us build the product requirements document, make sure we have the scope fully built out, make sure we have an MVP built out, and make this whole process a lot smoother for us. I'm also going to show you once these skills are done, how to plug them into Claude code, which is extremely easy to do, right? Right now, it's automatically plugging into Claude.
 We're going to take these and then plug it into Claude code., when we start writing our apps and our code, it can use these skills as well. All right, it's all built out. It has It knows how to scope out MVPs. It knows how to build PRDs. It knows how to create claude code prompts now. Excellent. We're going to download this as well. Once that's downloaded, we can then go over and plug it in. Again, we're in the matrix, which is sick. We're going to go to settings. I'm going to go to capabilities and we're going to upload that skill. Launch planner. Open that up. And we are good to go. We now taught Claude a brand new skill. We're making Claude smarter., I went into a new chat. I'm going to say please use the launch planner skill to plan a launch for an app store for vibecoded apps. I want an MVP where people can submit their vibe coded apps and it gets displayed in the store and I'm going to hit send and it's going to know to use that skill. The thing here here is you don't need to explicitly say use this skill. It's going to know moving forward that whenever you talk about launch plans for an app to use that skill. That's a great part here is you skill, use that skill. It's going to know which skills to use as you're asking questions to Claude or Claude code, which is great. I'm for the sake of an example saying use this skill., here we go. Right. It came up with the one problem we're solving here that we can always focus on. It gave us examples of how we know this works and it's giving us an entire product requirements doc that we can save and use when we start building Claude code, which I'm going to show you how to do in a second here. And the next three skills I show you after this is done are going to help you launch this much quicker.
 It gives us an entire post-launch iteration plan. It gives us key decisions we have to make. It even gave us the entire database schema. Right? If we were to go in without the skill and say, "Hey, plan a launch." It might give us a couple ideas for a road map. But now that it has this new launch planning skill, it does all of these decisions for us automatically, which is amazing., now that we have the product requirements doc, we have the database schema, we can start building out this app. But here's the thing. If we were to go straight into clawed code and say, "Hey, build this app out for us." It would probably build a heinously ugly app, right? You get the blue and the purple gradients. Every app AIS make are always ugly. But not after we teach Claude code our new design skill., let's go back in and create our third skill that's going to be amazing for us, and that is the Claude design skill., I'm going to create a new chat here. I'm going to use this prompt, which again down below in the description, copy and paste it, put it into Claude for yourself right now you can build this out with me. But what this is going to do is create a design guide skill that teaches Claude how to make nice looking designs for apps, right? No more blue and purple gradients, no more disgusting colors. This will learn how to make beautiful designs you get incredible UIs right off the rip with Claude Code.
 I'm going to hit send on this and it's going to create that skill. And what I'm going to do after this is show you how to install these skills, not into Claude, but also Claude code.
 And then we're going to build out our app from the PRD we made in the last chat. And I'll show you how much better these designs are now that we're teaching Claude how to design apps. This might be my favorite skill of them all.
 And then wait till you see the skills we build out after that. We're going to teach Claude how to create marketing materials. We're going to teach Claude how to be a product manager he can build road maps for us. We're putting our own employee through training to be the best employee ever.
 We're turning Claude from a junior employee to a senior employee, all with a few skills. It is unbelievable.
 Not many people are taking advantage of Claude skills. All right, looks the design skill is all done. Let's download this and then we're going to hop into Claude Code and install the skill in., I click download. File is all downloaded. Let's pop open Claude Code and start installing our skills in., I'm inside Visual Studio. You can do this inside of Cursor if you want.
 Whatever way you want to do this. My preferred workflow at the moment is Claude Code extension inside of Visual Studio Code. There's no reason. It works best for me. But if you want to use the CLI inside a cursor, if you want to use CLI inside Visual Studio plugin inside cursor, whatever you want, it's up to you. I the Claude Code extension inside Visual Studio Code at the moment. I open that up., let's do this. Let's create a new Claude folder. This is the directory where Claude always works anytime you run any prompts. Inside here, we are going to create a new folder for skills.
 Rename your design guide.skill to design.zip.
 Hit enter on that. Usezip. And then we're going to unzip that. And then we are going to click inside that folder is our skill.mmarkdown file that describes how the skill works. And we click and drag that into our skills folder right there. boom, there it is. We have our skill. It's inside skills. And now we can start building out our app and using that skill. let's go into Claude Code and let's build it out. I'm going to go into our last chat where we had our launch planner skill which has our starter prompt we're going to put into Claude. I'm going to take that.
 I'm going to copy it and I'm going to paste that into Claude code. And I'm going to add on real quick use the design guide skill to design this. I want to make sure it uses it. And then I'm going to hit enter and say this is great. It's going to ask if it can use the design guide skill. I'm going to say yes. And now it is going to get to work. It is going to use all the design guide principles we taught it. It's going to use all the building principles we taught it. And now it's a superpower. Right? Before we taught it these skills, the design was probably going to be terrible, right? It was probably going to be the blue and purple gradients. It's going to look awful. But now that we plugged in the matrix, taught it this new design skill, it's going to design much better apps for us. As this is cooking, if you're learning anything at all, make sure to leave a, subscribe, and turn on notifications for way more videos this. Also, check out the free newsletter in the description below as well., this is going to build out our V1, and then we're going to get into two more skills that is going to make this workflow even more powerful than it is now, if you can believe that. This is building out our app. I'm going to build out our other two skills now. Then we're going to come back and to see how that design went.
 The next skill we're going to make is a marketing skill. Claude will learn how to be a marketer. as we're building our app, it'll make us tweets, LinkedIn posts, blog posts, hooks, landing page content. All it'll design our landing page for us, which is pretty amazing. Here is the prompt again down below. Copy and paste it. Build this along with me here. create a skilled car called marketing writer that's going to have our brand voice that is going to build us landing pages, tweet threads, product hunt descriptions, launch emails, all of that. I hit send, copy and paste it down below, put into Claude, it'll build the skill out for you and this will build a new skill for us that we will plug into Claude code. once our app is built out in a second, we can start generating the landing page and all the marketing content very easily. Again, if you would have asked Claude Code to build out the marketing content, if you didn't have this skill, it would build out very generic AI content, but now it's going to build super powerful marketing content for us, which is going to be amazing., it's building out this skill. It even has examples of copy the AI should write in here. It's creating its own examples. It's even creating writing tips, it knows how to create, it knows how to write better marketing content. It's showing examples of how to write emails. This is amazing.
 It's going to be much smarter after we install this. All right, looks it built out the marketing skills. Now it knows how to analyze codebase, writing your voice, landing page, tweet threads, product hunts, launch emails, voice guidelines. Love it. Let's download it. We're going to now plug this into Claude Code as well., we can write this content inside of Claude Code., here we go. We're back inside of Claude Code. We have our skills here.
 I'm going to install that skill in the same skills folder. again, we are going to rename marketingwriter.skill to marketing writer.zip. Then we are going to unzip that we can put that file into the skills folder. I double click it, unzips it. Now I click and drag this into skills and boom, there's our marketing writer skill with all the references for marketing it could write. That's amazing. All right, looks the app finished building. let's do this. Let's check out the work it did. Let's see if the design skill worked and if this looks better than that generic blue and purple mess that the AI always makes. If it worked, we'll then test out the marketing skill we made. And then as a final step, we'll build out the fifth and final skill that you can implement into your workflow to start getting way better app., let's check out the app. Then, we'll test out the other skills., I'm going to move this over and we're going to run this. Boom. Look at that. This looks clean. This looks clean., this is the Vibe app store. I that logo.
 Clean text. I the font. Nice. And of course, there's there's no blue and purple gradients, which is nice., you have app thumbnails that are blue and purple. AI cannot get rid of blue and purple. I don't know what it is., I'm going to forgive it. It's not part of the gradients or the default stuff they do, but this design is clean.
 I the way this looks, the buttons, the look, the feel. It is clean.
 Clearly, the design worked. Clearly the design skill made this much nicer because this is better UI than the AI would do by default. the design skill worked. Let's now test out the marketing skill we built and then we'll build our fifth and final skill that you can copy and implement into your workflow.
 let's pull this open. I'm going to start a new chat here and we're going to say please make us marketing materials using the marketing writer skill. And again moving forward you'll have to set you can say make me marketing materials or write me LinkedIn posts and it'll know to automatically use the skill for demonstration purposes I'm mentioning the skill but now it is going in and is looking at the skill and it is now going to write us marketing materials that we can use to tweet out advertise our app make a landing page things that. that's going to be great. That's a skill you're going to be able to use a ton anytime you're building out your app and you want to share what you're doing on social media or build out your landing page. That's going to be great., what's great about the skill is it analyzes your codebase and looks at your app, right? You don't need to describe your app or tell if you were to go into Claude right now and say, "Hey, build me a landing page." You'd have to describe everything about your app. But because we built this skill out, it knows to look at your code, look at what your app does, look at the advantages, and base all your marketing on that. it may it saves you a lot of time as well, as well as creating much better content. it's giving me a menu of what it can build. Let's say build me number one, landing page sections. And it is going to go and it is going to based on our app build us all the landing page copy we need without us having to describe the advantages and everything the app does.
 this is going to be sick. All right.
 Looks it built an entire marketing landing page for us and boom. It gives us the headline, gives us the sub headline, the call to actions, everything. Wow, that is indepth.
 It built us out the entire landing page base in our app. We didn't need to describe our app or anything that.
 Let's do this. We've tested out four of the skills far. We showed how awesome those skills are and how it can improve your workflow. Let's go into the fifth skill. Now, again, prompt for this down below. Feel free to copy and paste it. I highly, highly encourage you to build this out alongside with me. But we are going to create a skill called the road map builder., a product manager skill. We're going to teach it how to be a product manager. And what's going to allow us to do is come up with a road map for our app. It's going to guide us on new features we should build out based on what the core value ad of our app is why people are using the app only core features that get people to become more sticky and use the app more often. We are teaching it how to be a product manager. It is jacking into the matrix and now it is a product manager. use this prompt again down below. Copy and paste it. Build this out with me. This will build the skill.
 We'll download the skill. put it into Claude Code and we can have Claude Code, come up with the features, design the features, implement the features for us.
 We're making Claude Code our senior employee. All right, that, the skill is done. Let's download this. Let's put this into Claude Code and let's test out our product manager skill we built., same thing. Go in here. Let's rename this zip. Hit enter. Usezip. Unzip it by double clicking. We have our road map builder.
 We pull open claude code again. We drag road mapap builder into our skills folder. And now learn the skill. that. simple, easy. Let's start a new chat and say, "Please build us a road map for our app using the road map builder skill." I hit enter and now it's going to use our new skill to build out a road map. Do we want to proceed with this skill? Yes, we do. All right.
 Looks it's all done. Let's see.
 Right now, it's telling me, all right, which features we should not include. It has what might be worth including for our MVP., this is specifically for our MVP, edit, delete, search, and filtering, and then high impact features we can implement right away for our MVP.
 Analytics,, social preview, and then high impact, high effort, simple search, categories, tags. All right, it breaks down a whole bunch of features into different categories for us based on where we are in the app currently.
 totally customized for what we're doing and we have a product manager working with us now working on features we can build out. We taught Claude code every role in our company.
 Be the product manager, be the marketer, be the designer. We plugged in all these different skills for it to use and now it builds our app much more effectively than if it was a blank AI that we said, "Hey, build this out for us." Claude skills are critical critical to learn. It is going to make your experience with Claude better. It's going to make your experience of Claude code better. The apps you build will come out much better. You need to be implementing them now. Save the prompts down below for all those skills you can start using it immediately.
