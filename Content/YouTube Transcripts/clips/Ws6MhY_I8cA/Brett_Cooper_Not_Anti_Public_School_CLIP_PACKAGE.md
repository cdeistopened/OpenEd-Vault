## Context

Brett Cooper was homeschooled from 3rd-8th grade. She tried public school for 9th grade because she "bought into the idea of the American stereotypical high school portrayed in movies." She despised it - academics and mental health suffered. She ranked first in her class of 1,200 without trying, but lost her joy of learning. She finished the rest of high school homeschooled.

This isn't anti-public school. Most schools are just... awful.

This isn't an anti-public school rant. Most schools - public AND private - are failing our kids. Not because teachers are bad, but because the system was never designed for how kids actually learn.

The good news? More families are discovering there's another way.

Brett Cooper ranked first in her class out of 1,200 students - without even trying.

But she lost something more important: her joy of learning.

"I felt like I was sitting in a room for eight hours while I was being talked at."

This isn't an anti-public school position. Most schools - public and private alike - struggle with the same structural limitations. They weren't designed for how learning actually works.

The shift happening now isn't about being against anything. It's about being for kids - for personalized learning that adapts to the child, not the other way around.
