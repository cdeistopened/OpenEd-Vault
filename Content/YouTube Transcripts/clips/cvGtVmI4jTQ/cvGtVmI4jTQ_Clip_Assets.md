COVID forced families home—and parents discovered something they didn't expect.

Their kids weren't falling behind. They were actually happier than ever. The daily grind of getting them out the door, the homework battles, the stress—all of it was gone. And nothing bad happened.

"All this heavy lifting that I thought the conveyor belt education system was doing wasn't doing any of it."

What did you discover about your kids during COVID? Did they surprise you?

My 16-year-old said he wanted to try school.

So we got out a whiteboard. "What do you actually want?"

Money. Friends. Freedom.

We mapped where he'd get the most of what he wanted.

He tried it. Then dropped out to go work. No diploma. No regrets.

My 16-year-old said he wanted to try school.

Instead of saying no, we got out a whiteboard. I asked him: "What do you actually want?"

He said: money, time with friends, freedom to explore.

We went down the list—where does he get the most of what he wants? School? Work? Something else?

He tried school. Liked it okay. But at the end, he said, "Eh, I'm just going to drop out and go work."

No diploma. No high school credential. Just a kid who knows what he wants and isn't afraid to go get it.

What would happen if you asked your teen what they actually want?

"Are your kids going to go to college?"

My answer: "I don't know. It's up to them, not me."

By that age, they don't need me making decisions for them.

People always ask me: "Are your kids going to go to college?"

My answer surprises them: "I don't know. It's up to them, not me."

My hope is that by the time they're that age, they don't need me making decisions for them. They'll have a compelling reason—or they won't.

Either way, it's their call.

What decisions are you still making for your kids that could be theirs?

She had anxiety attacks every day in first grade. Stomach hurting. Miserable.

So we pulled her out.

By age 10, she started her own dog walking business. Made thousands of dollars.

It's a job she would do for free anyway.

My daughter was having anxiety attacks every day in first grade. Her stomach hurt. She was miserable.

So we pulled her out. We asked ourselves: how do we want to spend these hours?

By age 10, she started her own dog walking business called "Paws." She's made thousands of dollars as a 10, 11, 12 year old.

The best part? It's a job she would do for free anyway. She just gets to play with dogs—and people pay her for it.

That has been an education in and of itself.

Has your kid ever surprised you with what they could do when given the space?

"You want $100,000. What do you plan to do with it?"

That's what a bank would ask for any other loan.

But for college? They just hand it over.

The real question: Could you get that job without a degree?

Most people don't know the answer.

#### Facebook

If you walked into a bank and asked for $100,000, they'd ask: "What do you plan to do with it? What's the payback period? How long will it take you to earn that back?"

But for student loans? They just hand it over. No questions asked.

Here's what Isaac Morehouse wants you to consider:

What job are you trying to get? Could you get that job without a degree?

Most people don't know the answer to either question.

So why would you take out a loan to get a job you can't even define?

The degree isn't the investment. The skills and experience are. Make sure you're getting those—with or without the diploma.
