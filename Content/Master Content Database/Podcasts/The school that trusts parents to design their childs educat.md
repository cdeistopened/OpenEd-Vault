"We don't want your child to fit our system" – this simple statement from OpenEd Academy challenges how we've approached education for over a century.

Most "personalized" education isn't actually personalized. Whether it's a traditional classroom or a virtual school, the same fundamental problem persists: they create a system first, then expect your child to fit into it. Some offer minor accommodations or a few elective choices, but the core approach remains rigid, standardized, and top-down.

At [OpenEd Academy](http://openedacademy.com), we asked a different question: What if we built education around the child instead?

## Beyond "Moving School Online"

When the pandemic hit, we watched as traditional schools simply transferred their existing structures online. Same schedule. Same curriculum. Same one-size-fits-all approach. Just through a screen.

Even today, most virtual schools follow this model. "Here's your courses, your schedule, your pacing, and your standardized curriculum – we hope it works for you!"

As Teresa King, leader of OpenEd Academy explains: "What we're trying to build and what we've put into place is a buffet. In so many settings, virtually or traditionally, you sit down and you're handed a menu and you literally have like three choices to pick from. What we want for the OpenEd Academy is for it to be a buffet where you leave what you don't want and you take what you do."

## Building Education From the Ground Up – Around YOUR Child

After 15 years of helping over 100,000 students through our district partnership model, we've learned one fundamental truth: parents know their children better than any system or expert.

That's why OpenEd Academy operates on a different premise than other virtual schools. We start with your child – their strengths, interests, learning style, and goals – and build education from there.

Here's what makes our approach different:

### 1. You Choose the Curriculum That Works for YOUR Child

Most virtual schools hand you their curriculum and expect you to make it work. At OpenEd Academy, you select from multiple curriculum options for each subject based on how your child learns best.

"Generally when you enroll in a virtual school, it again starts to feel very top down," says King. "They say, 'Okay, well, here's your grade level, so here's your schedule, and all the curriculum comes from this place, and it all looks the same, and hope you like it.' That's not that much different than the traditional in-person school structure. It just is in a virtual setting."

Instead, OpenEd Academy gives families options between visual learning, text-based approaches, and more interactive curriculums – because different children learn differently.

### 2. You Set Your Own Schedule and Pace

The traditional school year makes little sense for many families. Why should your child's education be constrained by arbitrary start dates, end dates, and daily schedules?

At OpenEd Academy, you decide:

- When courses start and end
- How quickly to move through different subjects
- When to take breaks
- When learning happens each day

As King explains, "If your child is very advanced in math, loves doing math, always only wants to do math, you can tell us like, 'Hey, listen, we're going to probably fly through this math class and we're going to finish it in about four months. Is that OK?' Yes, that's OK. And you can also say, 'I have to kind of drag him through this English course. We might take 11 months to do this English course. Is that OK?' Yes, that's OK."

### 3. Real Life Learning Counts as Real Learning

One of the most valuable elements of our model is giving transcript credit for real-world learning. Traditional schools largely ignore the valuable skills acquired outside the classroom.

"So many students are doing so much learning outside of any kind of curriculum," says King. "What I mean by that is like community service projects, entrepreneurial things that our kids have started. The things that kids learn outside school should count as learning inside school."

At OpenEd Academy, work experience, travel, entrepreneurship, community service, and other real-life learning can count toward transcript credit. When your teen works as a shift leader, travels abroad, or starts a business, they're learning skills that deserve recognition.

### 4. Education Built on Trust, Not Control

Perhaps the most fundamental difference in our approach is our foundation of trust.

"Schools don't typically seem to trust parents," observes King. "What does it look like when a school trusts parents to know their child and then works with them to create the education that the parent and child are saying to them that they need, that they want, and that would work best for them? That's really where we want to start."

This trust extends to how we interact with students, too. We don't require daily attendance checks or rigid schedules. We provide structure and support when you want it, but we trust families to know what works for their child.

## The Results: Education That Celebrates Uniqueness

When education adapts to the child instead of forcing the child to adapt to the system, something remarkable happens: learning becomes joyful, natural, and effective.

Children who were frustrated in traditional settings flourish when given the freedom to learn at their own pace, in their own way, with support tailored to their needs.

At a starting price of $2,900 per year, OpenEd Academy makes this personalized approach accessible to families nationwide, providing accredited transcripts and diplomas that open doors to college and beyond.

## Open Education, Reimagined

For too long, we've accepted that children should conform to educational systems rather than the other way around. OpenEd Academy represents a fundamental shift in that thinking.

As King says, "We're not just taking traditional structures and moving them online. That's actually the last thing we want to do. What we want to do is leverage a lot of different options that being online lets us do in order to build the options around your child."

If you're tired of education that tries to fit your unique child into standardized boxes, join us for a different approach – one built on trust, flexibility, and the recognition that each child deserves an education as unique as they are.
