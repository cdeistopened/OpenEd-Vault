## Summary
Zach Koon traded his house for an RV classroom. PLUS: The coding bootcamp helping homeschoolers earn college credits.

## Content

‍

Zach Koon's son loves geology. So instead of reading about rocks in a textbook, he collects them at Zion National Park while his dad explains how rivers carved the canyon over millennia.

"Science isn't just a subject in a book—it's something they experience every day," [Zach told Ela on the latest podcast from his RV](https://opened.co/blog/he-sold-his-house-to-homeschool-in-a-300-square-foot-rv-with-3-kids) (currently parked somewhere in America).

A few years ago, he and his wife decided their house felt too cramped for their growing family. Instead of buying a bigger house, they moved into the RV and turned the world into their extended playground/classroom.

How's that working out for them?

## Roadschooling on a Roll

[The pandemic pushed homeschooling from 2.65 million students in 2020 to 3.7 million in 2021](https://brighterly.com/blog/homeschooling-statistics/), but the RV subset grew even faster. Families are selling houses in expensive markets, buying $80,000 RVs, and using the difference to fund years of travel education. "Roadschooling" [Facebook groups have thousands of members](https://rvlife.com/7-best-roadschool-groups/). RV parks now offer dedicated "school rooms," traveling families organize regular meetups, and [states like Texas, Florida, and South Dakota have become go-to domicile states for their RV-friendly homeschool laws](https://campersmarts.com/ultimate-guide-to-roadschooling-in-an-rv). The movement even has its own dedicated curriculum companies now offer "travel-friendly" packages for families with spotty internet.

## Bottega's full-stack coding bootcamp

[Bottega University's full-stack coding program](https://bottega.edu/full-stack-development-certificate/)is one of the most popularinstructor-led, skills-based curricula available atno cost through OpenEd. [Students can begin their coding foundations course as early as 8th grade, and continue with their 4-part curricula](https://opened.co/marketplace?providers=product_provider-p42iai99k6vhkugzz1utr1kt) (RV not required).
