## Summary
Deborah Pratt of SO School of Music reframes the “practice or quit” mindset, explaining why just showing up to lessons builds brains, identity, and lifelong musical skill.

## Content

Most parents have the same thought when their kid stops practicing:** “Why am I paying for music lessons if they won’t practice?”**

**‍**It feels responsible to quit. Like we’re teaching accountability.

Because we’re doing the math: **Money + Lessons + Practice = Skill.**

**‍**And if practice disappears, the whole deal feels broken.

But what if music lessons were never just about producing a musician? What if the real payoff is something deeper—something your kid can’t get any other way?

Deborah Pratt, a music teacher of 30+ years who runs a school with 172 students, told me this: **music lessons are often less about mastery and more about giving a child something to go deep on.**

## The Parable of the Bass Player

Deb shares a story that completely upends the "Quit if they don't Practice" rule.

She had a student who started piano at age eight. He was... okay. He didn't practice much.Then he switched to guitar. He was okay at that too.Then ukulele.Then *back* to piano because he realized he needed to read notes better.

For **eight years**, this kid showed up to lessons, hung out, played a bit, and didn't do much at home. By traditional standards, his parents wasted thousands of dollars.

Then, at age 16, he walked in and said: **"I bought a bass."**

Something clicked. The patterns of the bass matched his brain. He started practicing hours a day on his own. He had found *his* thing.

"If I had been on him about practicing," Deb says, "or if his parents had required him to practice to have lessons, **he would never have reached this.**"

He needed music to exist in his life long enough for him to mature into it.

## The "Container" Theory of Lessons

We tend to view music lessons as "Instrument Training." Deb views them as something broader—a space for growth that goes beyond the notes.

Even without daily practice, the weekly act of:

1. Sitting with a mentor (Deb emphasizes the relationship aspect).
2. Reading a new language (notation).
3. Physically coordinating hands and eyes.

...is building habits and neural pathways that transfer to other areas of life.

### **The Neuroscience of "Just Showing Up"**

Music is one of the few activities that lights up the entire brain simultaneously.

Deb points to the **Corpus Callosum**—the bridge of nerve fibers connecting the left and right brain hemispheres. Research shows this structure is [significantly larger in musicians](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/3/1282).

This supports development in:

- **Emotional Regulation:** (Teenagers playing guitar to process angst).
- **Math Skills:** (Rhythm is physical math).
- **Executive Function:** (Tracking multiple inputs at once).

That said, music isn't the only path to these benefits. The key is finding *something* that asks your child to show up consistently, struggle productively, and grow.

## When to Push vs. When to Pivot

If music does feel like the right fit for your family, Deb offers guidance on navigating the hard moments:

**1. The "Frustration Spike" (Don't Quit Here)  "**A lot of times they've just hit a spot where they have to step it up," Deb says. "But it won't stay that way if they persist." Help them through the spike, give it time, then reassess.

**2. The "Interest Lull" (Pivot Here) **If they are bored or disengaged, don't quit music—**pivot the instrument** or **pivot the expectation**.

- *Switch to drums.*
- *Switch to "just for fun" mode.*
- *Switch to "social" music (choir/band).*

Deb recommends committing to a full school year before making any decisions. "If you just do a month or two and say, I don't like it, you don't really know if you like it or not yet."

## The Long Game

Deb's own perspective shifted because of her daughter. She had her quit trumpet lessons in high school because she wasn't practicing. Decades later, her daughter told her: "I really wish you'd let me continue to take lessons because I could be playing today."

That moment taught Deb something about continuity over perfection. The lesson her daughter needed wasn't about trumpet mastery—it was about staying connected to something long enough to discover what it could become in her life.

**The Takeaway: **the goal isn't necessarily a recital or a scholarship. It's giving your child the experience of going deep on something difficult, pushing through frustration, and discovering they're capable of more than they thought.

Music is one beautiful way to do that. The discipline transfers. The confidence stays.

## KEY MOMENTS

### The Brain Science That Changes Everything

Music is the only activity that lights up your entire brain. The corpus callosum—the bridge between your brain's two hemispheres—is physically larger in musicians. This structural brain development supports math, literacy, emotional regulation, and persistence across every domain.

### The Practice Paradox

Deborah's biggest lesson came from her own daughter, who quit trumpet in high school because she wasn't practicing. At 35, her daughter told her: "I could be playing today if you had let me keep playing." This shifted Deborah's philosophy—sometimes just staying in lessons keeps a child connected long enough for breakthrough to happen.

### Never Quit at the Frustration Point

Every musician hits a wall. Suddenly they have to play with both hands, or tackle a new technique. The child wants to quit. This is exactly when parents should push through. Help them past that spike, give it time, then reassess.

### Piano as Universal Language

If you're starting from scratch, begin with piano. Unlike guitar (where "the notes are kind of all equal"), piano visually maps music theory. After a year of piano, a child has a mental scaffold that accelerates learning any other instrument. This is the single most important curriculum decision parents make.

### The 8-Year Discovery

One of Deborah's students tried piano, guitar, ukulele, and came back to piano before discovering bass at age 16—and finally practicing on his own. Eight years of showing up created the conditions for genuine passion.

### The Social Glue

Kids don't quit activities where their friends are. The real secret to music persistence isn't parental pressure—it's building community. Group classes, bands, and choirs transform music from isolated practice into *doing something with other people*. That's the motivation that lasts.
