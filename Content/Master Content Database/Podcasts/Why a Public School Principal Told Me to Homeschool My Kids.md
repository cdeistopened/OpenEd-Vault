Do homeschool kids end up with gaps in their learning? This public school administrator says otherwise.

## From FBI Rejection to a Classroom Mission

Dave came to education almost by accident. He studied Spanish and communications because he wanted to join the FBI. He made it to the final interview with nine agents, failed, and suddenly had a degree with no plan. “I figured I’d teach while I waited,” he told me. “And I never reapplied. I started subbing in Salt Lake City, then we moved to Southern California so I could launch a full-time teaching career.”

He fell in love with the classroom fast. “I couldn’t believe I got paid to do it,” he said. He coached basketball and water polo, ran peer tutoring, covered hospital-homebound instruction — anything the school needed. Teaching Spanish, he refused to march page by page with the textbook. He cracked jokes, slowed down when the class needed it, and created the kind of room where teenagers begged to stay. This is the part of Dave’s story that sounds familiar to every great teacher I know. They live to watch the lightbulb flicker on.

## The Homeschooling Turn That Started in Kindergarten

The plot twist arrived with kindergarten. Dave and his wife, Diana, enrolled their oldest daughter in a charter school run by friends. Within weeks, their bubbly five-year-old turned sassy and distant. “We shadowed the class and thought, ‘There’s nothing happening here we couldn’t do at home,’” Dave said. “Her two younger sisters missed her like crazy. So we brought her back.” They tried first grade the next year; same result. Eventually the Hoffmans stopped trying to make conventional school fit. They joined local co-ops, stacked library cards, and slid toward full-time homeschooling.

To be precise, they slid toward unschooling. “If it looked anything like school, we threw it out,” Dave said. “Schooling and education are different things.” They stopped worrying about grade-level benchmarks and started chasing curiosity. The kids picked their own homeschool curriculum piecemeal: a welding class at the district’s ALC here, a debate league there, water polo with the local high school, mock trial sponsored by OpenEd. “We mixed and matched everything,” Dave said. “If something stopped working, we quit. If something lit them up, we doubled down.”

## Inside the Charter School Machine

Meanwhile, Dave climbed the administrative ladder. He wanted a bigger paycheck — six kids, one income — but he also wanted a larger impact. The reality was darker. “Half my time was discipline or damage control,” he said. “Parents came in hot. Teachers melted down in my office. I had the police on speed dial at supposedly ‘good’ charter schools. We dealt with theft, drugs, even staff affairs. The soap opera never stopped.” He loved assemblies, dances, and the rare hours spent observing great teachers. But the job made him an enforcer more than an educator.

## School Choice as an Education Freedom Strategy

That’s when the dissonance between the system and his own family became impossible to ignore. Dave watched his kids thrive in a homeschool community built on choice, while his campuses fought to keep attendance from slipping. He describes himself as a market realist. “Choice is already reshaping everything, and that’s a good thing,” he told me. “Education Savings Accounts and vouchers force every school — public, charter, private — to become the place families actually choose. Once schools operate in a competitive environment instead of a monopoly, innovation follows.”

Critics argue that school choice lets the privileged escape while everyone else stays stuck. Dave pushed back hard. “It’s limited thinking,” he said. “We had at least twenty percent special education students in every school I led — just like the neighborhood campuses. We took whoever came. We couldn’t turn them away even if we wanted to.” He pointed to the new wave of ESA programs leveling the financial playing field. “For decades I paid taxes into a system I never used because we homeschooled. Now those dollars can follow kids to micro-schools, pods, private campuses — whatever fits. Choice isn’t about skimming the cream. It’s about acknowledging families have different needs and letting them pursue them.”

## Designing a Mobile Homeschool Curriculum

What does pursuing it look like? In the Hoffman house, it looked like packing up and moving — repeatedly. Because Dave could get a teaching or principal job in any district, he treated geography like a curriculum. The family lived on five acres with chickens one year, downtown in another state the next. “All of it counted as education,” he said. They Googled local homeschool groups, walked into curriculum stores, and let one introduction lead to a dozen more. “My oldest daughter only attended the local high school for two hours a day, but she was still homecoming queen,” he laughed. “She toured with a choir, competed in pageants, and did debate. The boys played sports, learned welding, knocked out college math online. We just kept asking, ‘What do you want to try next?’”

## The Myth of Learning Gaps

If you’re a rule-following parent, you might break out in hives hearing this. I did. Dave and Diana decided their kids would learn to read when they were ready, not when a scope-and-sequence said so. “All their Sunday school teachers worried because they couldn’t read at six,” Dave remembered. “We’d say, ‘We’re good. They’ll read when they’re ready.’ They all started around seven or eight, and then they never stopped. They still devour books.” When other parents warned that unschooling would leave “gaps,” Dave had a stock answer: “Everybody has gaps. The question is, can they learn and can they solve problems?”

That obsession with problem-solving might be the thread that ties Dave’s two lives together. “I work with grown adults who can’t think past, ‘What do you want me to do?’” he said. “They’ve been trained to wait for instructions.” His antidote is to let kids solve real problems early — build something, run an event, negotiate a schedule. That’s why he didn’t panic when his son struggled with algebra. “Now he does laser-leveled excavation for construction companies,” Dave said. “He calculates things that actually matter. None of my kids have gone to college. They all make more money than I do, and they’re happy.”

## BYU Independent Study and the New Homeschool Tools

Dave’s day job now is at BYU Independent Study, where he helps families stitch together custom learning plans without surrendering structure. The program has 215 middle and high school courses — everything from STEM to nine different language tracks to niche PE like cycling. But the secret sauce is a design framework he calls KSA: Knowledge, Skills, Attributes. “In biology, for example, they still learn the standards, but they also practice critical thinking and explore resilience,” he explained. Students can even earn micro-credentials for going deeper, a digital badge they can attach to scholarship apps or resumes. It’s the opposite of conveyor-belt schooling. It’s an à la carte menu for families who want academic rigor without losing flexibility.

And yes, he still breaks rules. “I work for a big institution — we’re not always agile,” he admitted. “We have set policies, and I buck them on behalf of the customer.” Last week he pushed through a scholarship for a fourteen-year-old foster student to take psychology. “Technically against policy,” he said. “But she’s about to age out. If she can take college classes now, she’ll see she’s smart enough to keep going. So I broke the policy, got her the scholarship, and she starts this year.” That, to me, is what real school leadership should look like: say yes first, then figure out the paperwork.

## Parents as Education Designers

If Bari Weiss were ghostwriting this piece, she’d probably end on a manifesto: Parents, reclaim your children. I’m not quite that declarative — yet. But I am persuaded that the most interesting educators in America are the ones refusing to pick sides in the old wars of public versus private versus homeschool. Dave Hoffman is still in the building. He’s also at his kitchen table. He’s designing programs at BYU while telling parents to pull their kids out if that’s what the child needs. The surprise isn’t that a principal supports homeschooling. The surprise is how obvious he makes it sound.

So here’s my invitation to you, especially if you feel your child is wilting in a classroom that was never built for them: become an education designer. Talk to the homeschool community down the street. Audit an online course. Ask for the exception. Bend the rule that isn’t serving your kid. The future Dave describes isn’t one where schools disappear; it’s one where they have to earn our trust every single day. That’s a future worth choosing — and it starts with parents willing to do what the Hoffmans did: follow curiosity, trust competence over compliance, and say yes to the adventure.
