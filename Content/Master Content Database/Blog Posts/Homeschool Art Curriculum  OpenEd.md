# Homeschool Art Curriculum

When it comes to teaching art, there's no answer key.

With math, you can check their work. With reading, you measure fluency and comprehension. Even science has a method—hypothesize, test, observe.

But art? The definition is so broad it practically dissolves under scrutiny. Drawing, painting, sculpture, digital design, crafts, appreciation, history—each with different methods, different markers of "success," different aptitudes required. A kid might be a natural with charcoal but hate watercolors. They might have zero interest in realism but spend hours on anime. What counts as progress? How do you know when you’ve done enough (or too much)?

This ambiguity makes art uniquely daunting and risky. Unlike most subjects, it's easy to turn what should be a lifelong love into a chore. Push the wrong curriculum too hard at the wrong time, and you can watch a child's creative confidence evaporate. (Ask any adult who decided at age 11 that they "weren't artistic.") But leave it out, and you might fail to identify and nurture a gift.

The upside is that you have more flexibility here than anywhere else in your homeschool. There are no tests. No required sequence. Just a kid, some materials, and the permission to explore.

This guide gathers recommendations from OpenEd's teachers and veteran homeschool families—programs that have been tested at actual kitchen tables, organized by age and learning style.

## Types of Homeschool Art Curriculum

Art curriculum comes in more formats than most subjects. Before you commit to anything, it helps to know what's out there.

### By Format

**Subscription Boxes** — Everything arrives at your door: supplies, instructions, artist background. You open the box and go. Zero prep, zero craft store runs. (Examples: [Homeschool Art Box](https://www.homeschoolartbox.com/), [iCreate Art Box](https://icreateartbox.com/))

**Video-Based Instruction** — Someone else teaches while you handle the other kids. DVD or streaming, usually with a supply list you source yourself. (Examples: [Creating a Masterpiece](https://creatingamasterpiece.com/), [Atelier](https://www.artsattack.com/atelier/), [Masterpiece Society Studio](https://masterpiecesociety.com/))

**Book-Based Curriculum** — Traditional workbook or textbook approach. Often written directly to the student for independent work. (Example: [Artistic Pursuits](https://artisticpursuits.com/))

**In-Person Classes** — Local art studios, community centers, and museums often run homeschool-specific sessions during school hours. Google "[your city] homeschool art classes" to see what's available. (Seriously, just do this. You might be surprised.)

**Co-op Art** — Many homeschool co-ops include art as a group subject. A parent with some background (or just enthusiasm) teaches a rotating group of kids. The social element matters here as much as the instruction.

**Online Live Classes** — Real-time instruction with a teacher and other students. [Outschool](https://outschool.com/) is the biggest marketplace, but individual artists run their own as well.

### By Philosophy

**Process vs. Product** — The great dichotomy of early art education. Process art values the journey (finger painting, clay squishing, no rules). Product art values the outcome (follow these steps to draw this bird). The best programs blend both—though if you have to pick one for young kids, err toward process.

**Picture Study (Charlotte Mason)** — Instead of drilling artist names and dates, you study one artist deeply. The child looks at a painting for several minutes, then describes it from memory. This trains observation skills that transfer to science, writing, and every other subject.

**Unit Studies** — Art as the visual language of whatever else you're studying. Learning about the Civil War? Draw 1860s architecture. Studying anatomy? Sketch skeletal structures. This lets art reinforce other subjects rather than competing with them for schedule space.

**Waldorf / Nature-Based** — Heavy emphasis on natural materials, seasonal rhythms, and process over product. If your kid is outside collecting pinecones and berries anyway, this might be your lane.

## Kindergarten Homeschool Art Curriculum

At this age, kids are in what psychologist [Viktor Lowenfeld](https://thevirtualinstructor.com/blog/the-stages-of-artistic-development) called the "schematic stage" of artistic development. Lowenfeld literally wrote the book on art education (it’s called “[Creative and Mental Growth](https://www.abebooks.com/9780023721106/Creative-Mental-Growth-Lowenfeld-Viktor-0023721103/plp?ref_=ps_ms_267691761&cm_mmc=msn-_-comus_dsa-_-naa-_-naa&msclkid=f531fa0704f61c796a479337a7fe7002),” if you’re curious). They draw what they *know*—a house is a square with a triangle roof, a person is a circle with stick legs—not what they actually see.

And that's exactly right. Trying to teach realistic rendering to a five-year-old is like teaching calculus to someone who hasn't learned multiplication. You're working against developmental reality.

The goal at this stage is to build hand strength (those fine motor muscles they'll need for writing), form positive associations with creativity, and stay out of the way. Provide good materials—real clay, decent crayons, not the waxy garbage that breaks on first use—and let them explore.

### Staff Pick: iCreate Art Box

Recommended by OpenEd's Ashley Teerlink, [iCreate Art Box](https://icreateartbox.com/) is a monthly subscription that eliminates the midnight craft store runs for that one specific type of glue you don't have. Everything arrives: supplies, instructions, video lessons. You open it and go.

The curriculum is designed by actual art educators (16+ years of experience) and works well for the "I am not an art person" parent who still wants their kid to get real instruction.

### Other Options

[**Art for Kids Hub**](https://www.youtube.com/user/ArtforKidsHub) (YouTube) — Free and massive. Want to draw a specific Pokémon? They have it. Great for filling a 20-minute gap or letting your kid choose what interests them.

[**My Zoo Box**](https://www.myzoobox.com/) — Combines zoology with hands-on crafts. If your kid is animal-obsessed (and when are they not?), this gives art a hook.

[**Crafty Kids Club**](https://www.youtube.com/@AishusCraftyKidsClub/videos) (YouTube) — Another free option with step-by-step craft tutorials designed for young children.

## Elementary Homeschool Art Curriculum

Somewhere during elementary years (the timing varies; could be 7, could be 10), something shifts. Kids start wanting their drawing of a horse to actually look like a horse (perhaps even a bespectacled education company mascot named Ed). When it doesn't, many decide they "have no talent" and quit entirely.

Lowenfeld called this the transition from the "schematic stage" to the "dawning realism" stage. The technical term doesn't matter. What matters is this: kids become self-critical, and if they don't have tools to bridge the gap between what they imagine and what they can execute, they give up.

The opportunity here is technique instruction. Not rigid, soul-crushing drills—but actual skills that give them new capabilities. Perspective. Shading. Proportion. Mixing colors intentionally instead of accidentally.

Some kids sail through this transition naturally. Others need support. Watch your kid; they'll tell you which one they are.

### Staff Pick: The Great Artist Program (K-6)

Endorsed by OpenEd's Jen Johnson – our curriculum team lead, [The Great Artist Program](https://www.greatartistprogram.com/) offers short lessons (30-45 minutes) combining an artist biography with a hands-on project.

The design assumption is that you, the parent, are *not* an artist—which is freeing. It also works well for co-ops or multi-age families; you can teach a 1st grader and a 5th grader at the same time. Over a million students have used it since 2003, so they've figured out what works.

### Other Options

[**Artistic Pursuits**](https://artisticpursuits.com/) — The most recommended book-based curriculum across homeschool forums. Blends art history with technique, and it's written directly to the student so they can work independently. Different books for K-3, 4-6, 7-8, and 9-12. If you want a "spine" for art education that a motivated kid can largely self-direct, this is probably it.

[**Deep Space Sparkle**](https://www.deepspacesparkle.com/) — Originally designed for classroom art teachers by Patty Palmer. Her site is a treasure trove of vibrant projects sorted by grade level. If you want "Pinterest-worthy" results (be honest, we all want this sometimes), this is it.

[**Yellow Spot Sun**](https://www.yellowspotsun.com/) — Integrates beautifully with classical history cycles. Their "Architects of the Ancient World" course pairs with ancient history; "Kingly Kingdoms" pairs with medieval. If you're doing a classical rotation anyway, this lets art reinforce your history instead of competing for time.

[**Art Makes Me Smart**](https://artmakesmesmart.com/) — A favorite of OpenEd mom [Cassie Shepherd](https://www.homecenteredlearning.com/) at Home Centered Learning. AMMS is more than just art tutorials—it's an entire creative resource library with around-the-world studies, artist and composer studies, imaginative play prompts, and unit studies all centered around creating.

As Cassie puts it: "I am someone who draws stick figures and has very little artistic talent, so trust me when I say…anyone can use this resource no matter your art skills!"

The lifetime membership means you can pull from it whenever you need something—quick project or deep dive.

[**Art for Kids Hub**](https://www.youtube.com/user/ArtforKidsHub) (YouTube) — Still great at this age. Recommended by OpenEd's Wendy Robison. Free, engaging, and the "I want to draw THIS specific thing" library is unmatched.

## Middle School Homeschool Art Curriculum

Middle schoolers want, above all, to be taken seriously. (Shocking, I know.)

This is the time to introduce professional-grade materials and actual technique. Treat them like apprentices—people learning a craft—rather than kids doing crafts. The distinction matters more than you think.

### Staff Pick: Creating a Masterpiece

[Creating a Masterpiece](https://creatingamasterpiece.com/) is the most-recommended video-based art curriculum across homeschool forums, and for good reason. Sharon Hofer has been teaching art for three decades, trained at world-renowned studios, and somehow manages to be both rigorous and gentle (imagine Bob Ross mixed with Tony Robbins—motivational, but not overbearing).

Materials include soft pastels, acrylics, and copper tooling. The results are often "mantle-worthy"—the kind of thing you actually frame and hang, not just refrigerator fodder.

The program is self-paced with short video segments, so it fits into almost any schedule. Works for ages 5 through adult, but middle school is where it really shines.

### Other Options

[**Atelier**](https://www.artsattack.com/atelier/) — DVD-based (or streaming now), 6 lessons per module. Thorough instruction with art appreciation built in. The DVDs are a bit dated aesthetically, but the content is solid, and the disks hold their value well if you decide to resell.

[**Masterpiece Society Studio**](https://masterpiecesociety.com/) — Online membership with multiple course tracks: drawing, watercolor, acrylics, pastels. Founded by Alisha Gratehouse, a homeschool mom who got tired of the uninspiring options that existed and built something better. Nice feature: supply lists are inside the portal, so you know what you need before you commit.

If your middle schooler is obsessed with anime, don't roll your eyes—leverage it. [**Anime Art Academy**](https://animeartacademy.com/) is rigorous figure drawing disguised as pop culture. It teaches anatomy, expression, and storytelling through a style they actually care about.

Learning [**Procreate**](https://procreate.com/) on an iPad goes beyond entertainment—it builds genuine career skills in digital art.

## High School Homeschool Art and Art History Curriculum

At this stage, the path splits three ways.

Some students just need a fine arts credit for graduation (if they're on a diploma-seeking route). Others are building a portfolio for art school. And others are beginning to pursue art for its own sake—not professionally, but as a meaningful part of their lives.

Each path calls for something different.

### For the Generalist

If the goal is cultural literacy and checking a graduation box, you have options that integrate art with other subjects:

[**You ARE An ARTiST (Chalk Pastel)**](https://chalkpastel.com/) offers high school tracks that pair with history and literature. If your teen is doing a Renaissance unit study anyway, they can earn an art credit at the same time.

[**The Annotated Mona Lisa**](https://www.amazon.com/Annotated-Mona-Lisa-Third-Prehistoric/dp/1449482139/ref=sr_1_1?crid=23EOEYXZ6WHFG&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.5UEKopmlQH3qFP1qqNdbbf8c17h3A3b3Lmd-fav-gsWPpA_F6lyllRjf-AC8D3zzRa94hQduihpvY8sgZ7Enm0BTA6cvwW9WI5hBRdkuTFnynT7Gw5A03DZgg3vvDYbPbvw3iIkW07cV28AhGgnEQw.xhKBdYVK_9Tas_h_WcCtVOVu6VRX45gqP6RLse-g1JE&dib_tag=se&keywords=The+annotated+Mona+Lisa.&qid=1764794207&s=books&sprefix=the+annotated+mona+lisa.+%2Cstripbooks%2C165&sr=1-1) is a fast-paced visual tour of art history—works well as a "spine" for a history-of-art credit.

**AP Art History** is there for the academically ambitious. [UC Scout](https://www.ucscout.org/) and [One Schoolhouse](https://www.oneschoolhouse.org/) both offer accredited courses that look good on a transcript.

### For the Aspiring Artist

If your student is serious about art school, admissions officers want to see one thing above all: *observational drawing*. Drawing from life, not from photos. They want to see how a student translates three-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional surface.

[**Ashcan Art**](https://www.ashcanart.com/) and [**New York Art Studio**](https://www.nyartstudio.com/) offer online intensive portfolio prep that mimics the rigor of art school itself.

For feedback before submitting applications, look for ["Portfolio Review" classes on Outschool](https://outschool.com/search?q=portfolio%20review)—professionals who will critique student work 1:1 honestly (we hope). [Note: Families enrolled in OpenEd get discounts on the Outschool platform.]

### For the Independent Creator

Here's where the principles of [open education](https://opened.co/book) matter most.

Not every artistically inclined kid wants to go to art school or needs a transcript credit. Some just want to create—and the best thing you can do is get out of their way while providing resources and community.

YouTube is an underrated art school. Channels like [Proko](https://www.youtube.com/user/ProkoTV) (figure drawing), [Marco Bucci](https://www.youtube.com/user/marcobucci) (painting fundamentals), and countless others offer professional-level instruction for free.

Community college art classes are often open to dual-enrollment high schoolers—real instruction, real feedback, for a fraction of private lesson costs.

Local artists sometimes take apprentices or offer mentorship. It's worth asking around.

The point: by high school, your student can largely curate their own art education if they're motivated. Your job shifts from "finding the curriculum" to "opening doors and staying curious about what they're making."

## Free & Budget Resources

Not everything costs money. Some of the best options are free:

[**Art for Kids Hub**](https://www.youtube.com/user/ArtforKidsHub) (YouTube) — Massive library, free, great for all ages.

[**Crafty Kids Club**](https://www.youtube.com/@AishusCraftyKidsClub) (YouTube) — Step-by-step craft tutorials for younger kids.

[**Under the Home**](https://underthehome.org/) — Free K-5 online curriculum covering art history, music, and studio art.

[**Oak National Academy**](https://www.thenational.academy/) — High-quality free video lessons for all ages. UK-based but universally applicable.

**Your local art museum** — Many offer free or low-cost homeschool programs. Call their education department; you might be surprised what exists.

## Logistics: Keeping the Sanity

Finally, remember that art can be… messy. If you're terrified of the mess, you'll never actually do it. Here's how veteran homeschoolers manage:

**The Art Cart** — Keep everything on a rolling cart. Roll it to the table for "Art Time," roll it into a closet when done. If setup takes 20 minutes, you won't do it. The [IKEA RÅSKOG](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/raskog-utility-cart-white-20382932/) ($35) is the classic choice—three tiers, holds everything, rolls easily, and comes in colors that don't look terrible in your living room.

**The Digital Archive** — You don't need to keep every doodle. Photograph their work, upload to a digital folder (or one of those digital picture frames), recycle the physical copy. Keep only the absolute best in a single portfolio binder.

## Start with Community

If you're enrolled with [OpenEd](https://opened.co), your family has access to [Creative Studios](https://opened.co/community-and-clubs)—free virtual art sessions where kids create together with real teachers. Past sessions have included Snowy Owl Art, Nature Sun Catchers, and Heart Cupcake Decorating.

It's the easiest first step. No curriculum to buy, no supplies to gather. Just show up.
