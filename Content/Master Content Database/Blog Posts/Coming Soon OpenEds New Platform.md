You’ve asked, we’ve answered.

OpenEd is replacing InfoCenter with a brand new platform to use for the 2025-2026 school year and beyond!

While the rest of the 2024-2025 school year will operate through InfoCenter like you’re used to, we couldn’t be more excited to show you what we’ve been working on for OpenEd’s next chapter.

The freedom and flexibility that the new OpenEd platform offers is a total game-changer – it’ll help you open up your education in ways that have never been possible before.

**An Experience That Fits Your Family’s Needs**

In designing our new platform, we’re keeping one goal front and center: *put parents like you in the driver’s seat of your children’s education. *

After listening closely to your feedback about managing your students’ learning in InfoCenter, we’re making improvements that we’re confident you’ll love.

Here’s what that’ll look like:

- **A streamlined experience. **
We’ve intentionally simplified a number of our core processes, including how you’ll access courses and receive reimbursements. We’re making it as easy as possible to get the resources your student needs.

**Tailor-made to your student’s unique learning style. **

- Instead of a one-size-fits-all schedule format, our new education plan builder lets you customize a plan in whatever framework is right for your family. Your homeschoolers don’t think inside the box – that’s why we’re giving you a *sand*box with unlimited potential.

**More user-friendly.**

- Our new platform is geared from the ground up to be **intuitive **and **easy to use**. Our early testers are loving the major upgrades – and letting us know where we can make things even better.

**Ensuring a Seamless Transition from InfoCenter **

For the rest of this school year, *nothing’s changing about how OpenEd works*. We’ll keep using InfoCenter exactly as it is, and your family won’t see any differences in the program.

Per usual, our **Intent to Re-enroll **will open up later this Spring; we’ll send you an email in the next few weeks to let you know when that process is getting started.

When the Intent to Re-enroll gets rolling, you’ll see a popup in InfoCenter asking you to head over to the new OpenEd platform to let us know whether your students will be joining us again next year.

*Don’t worry* – your accounts, educational records, and any other relevant data that currently lives in InfoCenter will be seamlessly migrated over to the new platform when the time comes to make the shift. You’ll even be able to log in using your existing username and password from InfoCenter!

The 2025-2026 school year will run entirely on the new OpenEd platform, including applications and enrollment. We’ll **keep you informed every step of the way** so you know exactly what to expect.

**What Comes Next**

We’re racing to get all of our awesome OpenEd families access to our new platform – our team’s hard at work to welcome you in as fast as we can!

We also want to **make sure that you have a** **great experience** when you join. That’s why we’re conducting some testing over the next few weeks, asking some parents to check out a beta version of the new platform and tell us how we can make it even better.

These changes are just the first step though! We’re sure there’s even more we could improve, and **that’s where we need your help**. If you have any thoughts, concerns, or feedback on the new experience, you can reach out to our head of product Dave Wasmer directly at [dave@opened.co](mailto:dave@opened.co), and he’ll make sure we address it. This is *your program*, and we’d love your help to shape it into something even better for all OpenEd families.

You joined OpenEd to gain access to the enriching resources necessary to create a flexible, student-focused learning experience. With our new platform, we hope to clear away the roadblocks to personalized learning, giving you a powerful toolbox to create a curriculum that steers your learners toward success.

Thank you for your dedication to open education and all of your amazing feedback along the way.

More to come!

Isaac Morehouse

OpenEd CEO
