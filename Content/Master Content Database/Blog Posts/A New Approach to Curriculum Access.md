## Summary
OpenEd launches curriculum marketplace: Mix and match resources from top providers with pre-filled libraries, flexible ordering, and direct wallet funding.

## Content

We know that mixing and matching curriculum resources and instructional support to meet the needs of each individual student is the key to open education. That’s why we’re excited to bring you a marketplace full of resources from the curriculum providers you know and love.

**Start with a Personal Library **

Your library of resources will come pre-filled with standards-aligned resources for core subjects. Add to it anytime with resources you order from the OpenEd marketplace.

**Comprehensive, Supplemental, and Everything in Between**

Whether you’re looking for a little extra math facts practice or a full semester of early college courses, the marketplace has something for every student. Each marketplace listing will be individually priced, allowing you to mix and match resources across subjects with complete freedom.** **

**Resources When You Need Them**

Ordering in the marketplace is a different process than submitting your education plan. This means no more pressure to make all your curriculum decisions during the summer months! Orders are funded directly from your OpenEd wallet and follow the same funding guidelines as reimbursements. You can use wallet funds for anything that supports your plan.

**Pre-orders Available**

Just because you don’t *have* to order during the summer doesn’t mean you* can’t*. Pre-order at early bird rates, and our team will process access as soon as your wallet funding becomes available.

**Discovery and Discounts**

The marketplace will help you find the right resources for your students by searching and filtering, and buying there can save you money compared to sourcing materials yourself outside of the platform. We're working hard with partners to ensure that OpenEd families have great pricing to make every dollar stretch further! Plus, with marketplace purchasing, you won’t have to wait to get reimbursed!

**A Universe of Possibilities**

Your student is never limited to only those items available in the marketplace! Combine **marketplace** purchasing with **direct orders** from Amazon and Rainbow Resource and with **reimbursements** for qualifying educational expenses, and your student can truly access a universe of possibilities.

**Marketplace Sneak Peek Coming Soon!**

Keep an eye out for an exciting sneak peek into our marketplace listings, including several brand new options for 2025-2026. If you have any favorites you’d love us to consider, send me an email at [jjohnson@opened.co](mailto:jjohnson@opened.co). I’d love to hear from you!
