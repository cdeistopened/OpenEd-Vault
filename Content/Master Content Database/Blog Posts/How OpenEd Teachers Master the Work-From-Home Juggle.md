## Summary
22 teachers share battle-tested strategies for working from home with kids. Get practical tips for boundaries, schedules, and turning chaos into productivity.

*When OpenEd teacher Megan J. asked her colleagues how they balance remote work with kids at home, the response was overwhelming. Twenty-two teachers shared their battle-tested strategies, revealing a masterclass in creative problem-solving and boundary-setting. Here's what we learned.*

Jordan S. was in the middle of her big presentation to the business staff. She'd worked hard on it, prepared every detail. And that's when her 3-year-old Miles decided to have an epic, screaming meltdown.

"I was mortified," she recalls. "I apologized at the end, and Andrea said something I will never forget—something along the lines of, 'I love when people can see your kids, it humanizes us.'"

That moment captures something essential about the modern work-from-home parent experience: We're all doing our best in unprecedented circumstances. And sometimes, our best includes a soundtrack of toddler protests.

But here's what's remarkable: When Megan posted her question in the OpenEd teachers' Slack channel, asking "How do *you* make it work with kids at home?", the flood of responses revealed something unexpected. These parents aren't just surviving—they're thriving. They've developed systems, strategies, and philosophies that turn potential chaos into productive harmony.

## The Early Bird Revolution

Multiple teachers have discovered the power of the pre-dawn hours. Liz K. sets her alarm for 4:10 AM—yes, you read that right—to squeeze in two solid hours of uninterrupted work before her kids wake up.

"I can have coffee and work until 6:10-6:30 fairly uninterrupted doing things like grading logs, answering Slack/email, and administrative duties," she explains.

Juliann A. follows a similar pattern, rising at 5 AM for 3-4 hours of focused work. "My kids are 12 and 10," she notes. "I assign them their independent homeschool tasks for the day. If I teach a club or have a meeting, I let them know to bookmark anything they need help with and move on."

## The Art of Strategic Presence

One theme emerged repeatedly: being intentionally present during non-work time makes work time more manageable.

"I try to be VERY present when not working," Liz emphasizes. "So we are actively doing lessons, playing a game (no phone or computer near me), cooking together, whatever it is, so that I don't feel as bad when I do need to be looking at a phone/computer even while they are there."

This intentionality extends to how teachers communicate with their children about work boundaries. Becca M. has established a simple but effective rule with her kids aged 6-11: "If mom's door is closed, she is probably on a Zoom call and they need to wait until it is opened."

## The Office Is Everywhere

Perhaps the most creative solutions involve reimagining what a workspace looks like. These teachers have liberated themselves from the traditional home office concept.

Hayley B. has turned her local gymnastics facility into a coworking space: "Our local gymnastics place has open gym every week for 2 hours, and I just sit there and work while they play."

Julie F. maximizes travel time: "I will also work a lot in the car while my husband is driving. We do a lot of things outside of the home as a homeschooling family, and the drive time helps me a ton!"

Liz K. has stopped being a spectator at her children's activities: "I no longer watch their tumbling practice and don't accompany them to their Spanish class or piano and instead sit in the car and work."

## The Magic Box Method

Nicole A., with a 4-year-old and 18-month-old, developed what might be the most brilliant strategy of all: the special work-time-only activity box.

"I have a box full of things she does when I am working, and that is the only time that box comes out. It makes it a little more exciting for her."

The contents? Puzzles, books, kinetic sand, bubbles, a Leapfrog tablet, and lacing animals. The key is exclusivity—these aren't everyday toys, they're special work-time treasures.

## Embracing the Mess

Rachael D., a lead teacher, has learned that sometimes the path to productivity is paved with... mud?

"I set up a fun activity ahead that I know will keep them occupied like bubble foam, mud pit in the yard, kinetic sand, etc. They make a mess, but it buys me an hour of time to work completely uninterrupted."

Emily B. shared one of Rachael's most ingenious hacks: "Get dry erase markers and have them make a masterpiece on the washer or dryer!"

## Teaching Independence

Several teachers mentioned that work-from-home life has accelerated their children's independence in positive ways.

"A huge flex was teaching them to make their own lunches," Hayley notes, "since a lot of meetings/events fall during those hours."

Tammy M.'s family has integrated technology as a family assistant: "We make good use of our Alexa. They add items to the shopping list (better to be on the Alexa list than languishing in mom's memory!) and we use it as an intercom."

## The Schedule Flex

Understanding that traditional 9-5 doesn't work for everyone, many teachers have completely reimagined their work schedules.

Morgan B., who works in a brick-and-mortar school during the day, has claimed the evening hours: "I generally work from 7:30/8:00 pm until about 11:00 pm. It is the best because I am able to make some extra money to do fun things for my kids but not feel like I am sacrificing time with them."

Jessica K. maximizes nap time, preschool hours, and grandparent visits. "I try to not work when they are awake and around if possible. It's not always easy, but I think it's important to interact when they're awake."

## The Reality Check

Not everyone sugarcoats the experience. Sunny, a single parent with kids aged 6 and 9, offers refreshing honesty:

"To be very honest—my kids watch a lot more TV than they would if I wasn't a single, full-time working parent. I do give them a to-do list but they often complete it in under an hour."

But here's her key insight: "Instead of beating myself up for time they spend on screens during work hours, I focus on being the most present I can in all of the hours I'm not working. As soon as I'm clocked out, the screens get put away and we have bike rides, hikes, outings, projects, etc."

## The Support System

Many teachers emphasized the importance of building in regular support. Liz utilizes "help with friends and family at least once a week so I can have a 5-6 hour stretch with no kids and my sole purpose is to work."

Sometimes the best childcare is... more children. As Liz discovered: "Sometimes I watch my friends' kids and it is the best because they are all entertained for 2-3 hours doing their own things and I just have snacks accessible."

## The Bigger Picture

What emerges from these 22 responses isn't just a collection of tips—it's a philosophy of integration rather than separation. These teachers aren't trying to pretend their children don't exist during work hours. They're creating systems that acknowledge and embrace the reality of their lives.

As Tammy M. beautifully puts it: "One of the best things is having the kids pop in and say hi when I am in a meeting. It's great that we are seen as parents/grandparents/fur parents and that those we love are welcome to be a part of OpenEd."

Jordan S.'s conclusion resonates throughout the thread: "I AM SO GRATEFUL for a company that prioritizes family and flexibility. I wouldn't have the opportunity to do this amazing job if they didn't!"

## Your Turn

These strategies work because they're real solutions from real parents facing real challenges. They're not Pinterest-perfect or Instagram-worthy—they're practical, sometimes messy, and always evolving.

What's your best work-from-home-with-kids survival strategy? We'd love to add your voice to this conversation. Because if there's one thing this thread proves, it's that we're all in this together, figuring it out one day (or one Zoom call) at a time.
