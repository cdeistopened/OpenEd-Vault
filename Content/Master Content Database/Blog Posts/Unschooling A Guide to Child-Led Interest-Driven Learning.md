## Summary
What is unschooling? Learn how child-led, self-directed education works, and whether this homeschooling approach fits your family.

## Content

When Dr. Phil devoted an episode to what he called ["the fastest growing trend in American education"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S98fZa6Bh1Y), the comments section exploded.
">
The segment featured a family on a farm where children learn by building fairy villages, managing fires, and caring for livestock. No curriculum. No grades. No classroom.

"Educational neglect!" some viewers cried. "Save these children!"

But then the teachers started showing up.

"I'm a former public school teacher with a Master's Degree in Education," wrote one. "I left teaching in 2021... and I believe without a doubt that unschooling is the future of education."

Another: "We live in a day and age where information is free... It's up to us as parents to take our children's education into our own hands."

This is the debate millions of families are walking into. One side sees chaos and irresponsibility. The other sees freedom and common sense.

This approach goes by many names - unschooling, deschooling, self-directed education, or natural learning. At OpenEd, we use the term [**open education**](https://opened.co/open-education) to describe the broader category: families stepping outside the industrial-conveyor-belt schooling model to build learning pathways that actually fit their children (using whatever combination of resources is available).

Unschooling is one powerful approach within that framework. To understand whether it's right for your family, it helps to distinguish between the philosophy, the transition process, and what it looks like in practice.

## What is Unschooling?

In the 1970s, an educator named John Holt noticed something that bothered him. The students who learned the most weren't the ones who sat still and followed instructions. They were the ones who couldn't stop asking questions - the "problem" kids, the ones who got bored, the ones who wanted to touch everything and wander off-topic.

Holt started to wonder if the problem wasn't the kids but rather the system. He spent the rest of his career advocating for what he called "unschooling" - an approach where children direct their own learning based on their natural interests, questions, and real-world experiences. As Holt wrote, "Children learn from anything and everything they see. They learn wherever they are, not just in special learning places."

Not every child struggles in traditional school. But for those who do, the data is striking. Dr. Peter Gray, a research professor at Boston College, has tracked a pattern: [every year, teen mental health improves in late May when school ends](https://opened.co/blog/every-august-youth-mental-health-crises-spike-every-june-they-plummet-its-not-a-coincidence). Emergency room visits for anxiety and mood disorders drop. Psychiatric hospitalizations decline. Then August hits, school starts, and it all comes roaring back. When researchers asked teenagers what stresses them out, 83% cited school. Nothing else came close.

Holt became one of the leading voices in the modern homeschooling movement, and unschooling flourished in that setting because parents have total freedom to follow their child's lead. But the philosophy is increasingly showing up in places traditionally associated with more structure.

Self-directed learning centers like [North Star Teens](https://northstarteens.org/) in Massachusetts have operated on unschooling principles for nearly 30 years. The [Liberated Learners](https://liberatedlearners.net/) network has spawned similar centers worldwide. Microschools are embracing child-led approaches too - from democratic [Sudbury schools](https://zenademocraticschool.org/) to entrepreneurial [Acton Academies](https://www.actonacademy.org/), from Montessori-inspired [Wildflower Schools](https://wildflowerschools.org/) to the micro-pod model of [Prenda](https://www.prenda.com/).

In the context of open education, families blend unschooling with other methods - following their child's lead in some areas while providing more structure in others.

The core premise is that children are born curious. Given the right environment and support, they will learn what they need to know - often more deeply, more enthusiastically, and more permanently than they would through forced instruction.

## Unschooling vs. Neglect

Critics sometimes conflate unschooling with educational neglect. [A December 2025 New York Times essay brought this confusion into sharp relief](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/opinion/home-school-isolation.html). The author, novelist Stefan Merrill Block, described being "unschooled" by his mother in the 1990s - but what he actually experienced was isolation and enmeshment with a parent in crisis, not child-led learning.

Block's mother kept him home alone while she processed her own struggles. He spent his days with her - not exploring interests, not engaging with community, not following curiosity into the world. He was isolated from peers, exposed to online predators, and used to fill his mother's emotional void.

This is a tragedy. But it's not unschooling.

John Holt's vision was the opposite of isolation. Holt advocated for *expanding* a child's world - connecting them with mentors, community, real-world experiences, and their own curiosity. "Children learn from anything and everything they see," he wrote. "They learn wherever they are, not just in special learning places."

Real unschooling looks like:

- A child obsessed with Minecraft discovering programming, which leads to math
- A teenager at North Star Teens designing courses and teaching them to peers
- A family following their daughter's passion for horses into biology, business, and writing

What Block experienced - a contracted world, a dependent relationship, no connection to community - is the opposite. His pain is real. But unschooling didn't cause it. A struggling parent did.

The distinction matters. Unschooling is about trusting children to direct their learning while *supporting* them with resources, mentors, and access to the world. It's about expansion, not contraction. Critics who conflate the two do a disservice to both the children who suffered genuine neglect and the families practicing genuine unschooling.

Amanda Schenkenberger, an OpenEd mom and homeschool coach in Oregon, put it simply in [a recent Fox News interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8jCQcIZQWc): "Unschooling is pursuing a level of learning and following my kids' lead to what they're curious about and diving deeply into the subject as long as their curiosity is alive about it."

Her boys do take standardized tests - Oregon requires them - and they score in the top 10 percent nationally.

"It's very interesting," she says. "When you allow your child to lead their learning, what they're being tested on does come along with this."

## Unschooling vs. Deschooling

These terms get tangled together, but they describe different things.

**Unschooling** is an ongoing approach - how you educate long-term.

**Deschooling** is what happens first. It's the transition period when a child (and often their parents) unlearns the habits and assumptions picked up from traditional schooling.

The term comes from philosopher Ivan Illich's 1971 book [*Deschooling Society*](https://www.amazon.com/Deschooling-Society-Open-Forum-S/dp/0714508799). But today, homeschooling families use it more practically: it's what happens when kids leave school and need time to decompress.

Kristin and Ginger, former teachers who now run [SKOLA](https://opened.co/blog/lost-art-of-play) - a nature-based microschool in Minnesota - [discovered this applied to them too](https://opened.co/blog/lost-art-of-play). "Just like there had to be some undoing for us, there is this undoing process" for students, they explain. Their rule of thumb: "For however many years you're in a system, it's going to take that many months to actually shed everything off before you can rebuild it back up." After 16 years of teaching, Kristin gave herself 18 months to unlearn her own assumptions about what education should look like.

John Taylor Gatto understood why this matters. He taught in New York City public schools for 30 years and won Teacher of the Year two years in a row. The second time he won, he accepted his nomination and resigned - in the pages of the New York Times. He wrote that he felt like he was doing more harm than good.

In his book [*Dumbing Us Down*](https://a.co/d/dVkroiM), Gatto [identified the "secondary lessons" of schooling](https://opened.co/blog/5369) - the implicit curriculum baked into how school is structured, regardless of what's officially being taught. Your success depends on pleasing authority. You must wait for permission to speak, move, or use the bathroom. Your worth is measured by test scores. Learning happens in 50-minute increments - when the bell rings, stop thinking about math, start thinking about history.

[Hannah Frankman](https://opened.co/blog/episode-006-deschooling-your-mind-with-hannah-frankman), founder of Rebel Educator, calls deschooling "unlearning all the bad habits you picked up in school." Being passive instead of taking initiative. Waiting for permission instead of acting. Deferring to authority instead of trusting your own judgment. Learning to the test instead of learning to *do* something. Doing the bare minimum instead of caring about outcomes.

A common guideline in the homeschooling community: one month of deschooling for every year spent in traditional school. During this time, kids often sleep more, play more, and show zero interest in anything "academic." This terrifies parents. But advocates argue it's a necessary reset - the system has to clear before something new can grow.

Even kids who never set foot in a classroom absorb these lessons. "We live in a very schooled society," Frankman says. "I was homeschooled from first grade through 12th, and I still had all kinds of mindsets I had to unlearn."

## The Unschooling "Curriculum"

So what do unschoolers actually *do* all day? The honest answer: it depends on the kid. The "curriculum" is whatever captures their attention - a library card, a YouTube rabbit hole, a broken lawnmower engine, an obsession with ancient Rome. The learning emerges from living.

Some families do this entirely on their own. Others find community at self-directed learning centers - places that offer structure without coercion.

[Kenneth Danford](https://opened.co/blog/what-happens-when-a-teacher-tells-teens-to-stop-going-to-school) has been running [North Star Teens](https://www.northstarteens.org/) in western Massachusetts for 29 years. When a struggling teenager shows up at his door, he says something that shocks them:

"You don't like school? Don't go back. Don't ever go back in the building. Send someone in to get your books."

North Star functions like a gym or social club - attendance is encouraged but optional. There are no grades, no transcripts, no roll call, and no diploma. Members can take classes in history, math, writing, or the arts. They can get rigorous one-on-one tutoring. Or they can show up, grab a bowl of ramen, curl up on the couch, and read.

"You're accountable to yourself," Danford tells them. "Is this the life you want?"

Most who seek refuge at North Star have good reason. They might be on the autism spectrum and need a calmer environment. Perhaps they've been bullied, and don't feel safe at school. Or they're just your "non-conformist, skateboarder-poet-musician kids who roll their eyes at school," as Danford puts it. "We tend not to get your football player, cheerleader, sports team kids who want to be popular. But we get all the kids they pick on."

One recent arrival, Marley Bernstein, had missed 120 days of school the previous year due to bullying her school couldn't stop. At North Star, she found something different. "I feel better being here," she said. "You can walk around, you can kind of do whatever you want and not have to look over your shoulder every two minutes."

Beneath the apparent freedom, there's often quiet purpose. Students write and produce plays at local theaters. They take service learning trips to Washington, D.C. They design courses and teach them to each other - last year, young people taught three different classes on Dungeons & Dragons.

"Just take the year, breathe, wonder what you should be doing," Danford advises. "Meanwhile we're gonna unlock the door and give you a couch - and we'll be nice to you. Turns out that's really healthy and responsible."

## Is Unschooling Right for Your Family? Structure With Flexibility

Not everyone agrees that extended deschooling or radical unschooling is the answer.

[Jean Lee is a neuroscientist](https://opened.co/blog/how-to-homeschool-year-round-without-burnout) who homeschools her own children and runs the [Academy of Chaos](https://www.theacademyofchaos.com/), where she helps other families design their education. She's not anti-unschooling - but she's skeptical of long breaks.

"If you take too long of a break, it's a nightmare to get them back on track," Lee warns. "Everybody's fighting, and nobody wants to do the work. Kids function better when they have a schedule and clear expectations. They feel safer knowing their boundaries."

Lee advocates for structure with flexibility. She plans out the entire year in one weekend, mapping every lesson - but builds in so much buffer that she can take spontaneous snow days without guilt. Her kids have their own logins to see their schedule and check off work. Even her four-year-old.

"It is your responsibility to own this, not your parents'," she tells her students. "They don't have the instructions - it's yours."

The apparent contradiction dissolves when you realize: unschooling and structure aren't opposites. The question is who's driving. In Lee's model, kids own their education - you just give them the map.

When her daughter found an insect she needed to identify, they stopped all of her other lessons for that day. They used [Google Lens](https://lens.google/) - a tool that lets you "search what you see" - inspected the bug, and talked about it the whole drive. That spontaneity is possible *because* of the structure, not despite it.

## Unschooling Within Open Education

This flexibility matters when gaps appear. In our OpenEd Slack community recently, a teacher named Stacy asked: "Does anyone have a good recommendation for a spelling and writing curriculum for a 4th grader with ADHD, who has mostly been unschooled up until now?" Within minutes, other families and teachers weighed in with resources that had worked for their kids. Unschooling doesn't mean you can never add structure or formal curriculum - it means you add it when *your child* needs it, not when the calendar says so.

Most families don't adopt unschooling as a rigid philosophy. They treat it as one method among many - following their child's lead in some areas while adding structure where it helps.

A child obsessed with Minecraft discovers programming, which leads to math. A child passionate about horses learns biology, business, and writing without anyone calling it "school." The academics emerge when children are engaged and supported.

OpenEd exists to remove the financial barriers that make this kind of learning hard. When your child's passion for astronomy leads to wanting a telescope - OpenEd can fund it. When their obsession with coding calls for a specialized tutor - covered. When they're ready for a pottery class, a robotics camp, or a trip to a living history museum - we're here. No requirement to follow a particular curriculum. No standardized testing mandates. Just support for building the education that fits your child.

## FAQ: The Practicalities

**Is unschooling legal?
‍**Yes. Unschooling is a form of homeschooling, which is legal in all 50 U.S. states. Regulations vary by state - some require portfolios and standardized testing, others require nothing. The [Home School Legal Defense Association](https://hslda.org/legal) maintains a state-by-state guide.

**How do unschoolers get into college?
‍**Many paths exist. Some pursue GEDs. Others build portfolios of projects and real-world experiences. Community college transcripts can demonstrate academic readiness. Colleges are increasingly seeking students who show genuine passion and initiative rather than just good grades. A [study by Peter Gray and Gina Riley](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/hc_pubs/480/) found that 83% of grown unschoolers said the approach gave them an advantage in higher education.

**Is this only for wealthy families?
‍**Historically, alternative education has had financial barriers. This is exactly the gap OpenEd was created to fill - providing funding so that interest-led learning is accessible to everyone, not just families who can afford to pay out of pocket.
