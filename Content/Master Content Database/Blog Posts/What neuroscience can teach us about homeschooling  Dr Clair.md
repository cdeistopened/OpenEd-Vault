When Dr. Claire Honeycutt held tenure at Arizona State University, she made a decision that shocked her colleagues: she quit to homeschool her kids. As a biomedical engineer specializing in neuroscience, her unique perspective offers insights into how children's brains actually learn – and why traditional education often works against natural development patterns.

## The Professor Who Left It All Behind

Dr. Honeycutt's journey to homeschooling began in an unlikely place: a high-level research lab at Northwestern University. There, she received an NIH grant to study something most professors never get: how to actually teach. While her colleagues focused on research, Honeycutt dove deep into the science of learning.

Her credentials grew impressive: a joint PhD from Georgia Tech and Emory School of Medicine, groundbreaking work at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, and finally, tenure at Arizona State University. She ranked in the top 5% of faculty and won multiple teaching awards for her innovative approaches to biomedical engineering education.

But watching her own children navigate traditional schooling revealed a troubling disconnect. The very practices she was discovering to be ineffective at the university level – passive learning, rigid schedules, one-size-fits-all approaches – dominated her children's education from the start.

## What COVID Revealed About Learning

The pandemic became an unexpected catalyst for change. When her children came home during lockdown, Honeycutt witnessed a transformation that would alter their family's trajectory forever.

"My oldest was really struggling," she recalls. "I didn't understand how much until she came home. And suddenly she was just this different child."

Within weeks, behavioral issues that had seemed permanent simply disappeared. Her daughter's natural curiosity emerged, replacing the resistance to learning she'd shown in traditional school.

The change was so profound that when Honeycutt's husband asked what she wanted for her 40th birthday, her answer surprised them both: **"I want to homeschool our kids."**

The transition wasn't immediate. They tried returning to traditional school after the initial lockdown. "It lasted four weeks," Honeycutt says. "I couldn't do it. I couldn't send them back to a system I knew wasn't working with their natural development."

"I was healed by the presence of my children," she reflects. "We were having these beautiful moments together, and I realized this is how learning should be. How could I go back?"

## The Brain Science of Writing

When you think about the brain, typing and handwriting engage completely different neural systems. Dr. Honeycutt's research reveals how handwriting activates multiple brain regions simultaneously in ways typing cannot replicate.

"When you're handwriting, you're actually having to deal with the postural control system, which is a lower part of your brain. And you're also having to use the parts of your brain that encode for speech," Honeycutt explains.

This integration creates four key differences:

- How different brain regions activate during writing "When kids are young, one of the most important things is trying to get as many parts of the brain to connect to each other as possible," notes Honeycutt.
- Impact on memory and learning Studies show people are more creative when writing by hand, and they've demonstrated this effect specifically in writers and students.
- Why typing creates different neural patterns "When you're typing, you create very specific motor patterns. When I think about typing the word 'can,' my hands move exactly in the same positions," Honeycutt explains. This is why we often mistype the same words repeatedly – our brains load incorrect motor programs.
- Modern applications for parents While technology has its place, handwriting remains crucial for early learning. Even college students are returning to handwritten notes because they consolidate information better this way.

## Language Development: Why Shakespeare Works for Kids

Perhaps most surprising is Honeycutt's approach to language development. Her eight and ten-year-old children study Shakespeare – not simplified versions, but original texts.

"My kids are really into Shakespeare," Honeycutt shares. "The children just love this language. They don't even fully understand what it means, but it's so beautiful the way it sounds."

Shakespeare carefully created word combinations that required specific timing and rhythm. This intentional language structure helps develop sophisticated neural pathways in young brains.

## Rethinking Math and Memory

Traditional math practices like long division might seem obsolete in the age of calculators. However, Honeycutt explains their hidden value: "The capacity to do times tables in your head or more specifically deconstruct - division is deconstructing. It's like, okay, 60. Well, 60 is one in 60. It's also two in 30."

This type of mathematical thinking isn't about getting the right answer – it's about training the brain to:

- Break down complex problems
- Recognize patterns
- Develop number sense
- Build mental flexibility

"Is it necessary to memorize a bunch of stuff? No. Does it train the brain in a very specific way? Yes," Honeycutt emphasizes.

## Creating the Right Learning Environment

Dr. Honeycutt's research and experience reveal that motivation and environment shape learning more powerfully than any specific curriculum. "For young kids, if you're into it, they're into it," she explains. "But that changes around age twelve."

This insight transformed her approach to teaching. Rather than forcing her daughter to read when she was resistant, Honeycutt focused on reading aloud engaging stories. "Each chapter was a cliffhanger. She'd say 'keep reading,' and I'd say 'chapter's over, I have to go to bed.' Then she'd grab the book herself."

The most effective learning environments focus on connection before content, showing genuine enthusiasm while allowing choice within boundaries. They build in time for play and exploration, keeping direct instruction brief – just 5-10 minutes for young children.

## Key Takeaways for Parents

"Most parents worry they're not qualified," Honeycutt notes. "I had a PhD and still felt that way at first. But remember: kids are beginners, not stupid. Treat them like intelligent beginners in any subject."

The path forward is less about specific techniques and more about understanding core principles: focus on brain development rather than traditional metrics, balance structure with freedom, and create opportunities for natural learning. Above all, trust your instincts about what works for your child.

"You don't have to know everything a teacher knows," Honeycutt emphasizes. "But you know your child, and you'll fight to make sure they get what they need."

## Next Steps for Parents

Want to transform your child's learning experience? Start by observing your child's natural learning patterns and create an environment that supports their curiosity. Focus on connection and engagement before content. Most importantly, trust the process – learning happens naturally when the environment supports it.
