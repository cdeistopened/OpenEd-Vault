In our latest podcast episode, Dalena Wallace shares her story of transformation from homeschooling mom to microschool founder. "Ten years in, homeschooling my six kids, I started to realize, hmm, this is really hard. I need support, I need community," she explains.

What began as simply opening her home to a few friends for shared teaching duties has blossomed into something much bigger. "Three families became five, then ten, then a co-op with 16 families," Wallace recalls.

Her story is part of a seismic shift happening across America's educational landscape – a 220% increase in parents considering microschools and hybrid learning options in the past year alone.

Welcome to the microschool revolution, where everyday people are reimagining what education can be.

## What Exactly Is a Microschool?

At its core, a microschool is a small, personalized learning community serving anywhere from 5-150 students. Unlike traditional schools with rigid structures and standardized curricula, microschools offer flexibility, individualization, and innovative approaches to learning.

What sets microschools apart from traditional educational models?

- **Small by design**: With typically fewer than 15 students per adult, microschools foster meaningful relationships between educators and learners.
- **Mixed-age groupings**: Rather than separating children strictly by grade level, many microschools allow students of different ages to learn together, creating opportunities for mentorship and deeper social development.
- **Personalized learning**: Microschools can adapt to individual student needs, interests, and learning styles instead of forcing everyone to move at the same pace.
- **Flexible scheduling**: Many offer part-time options (1-4 days a week) rather than demanding full-time attendance, allowing families to blend different educational approaches.
- **Educational innovation**: Free from many constraints of traditional systems, microschools often incorporate progressive educational philosophies and cutting-edge practices.

Microschools exist on a spectrum of structure – from highly organized programs with specific curricula to more self-directed models where student interests guide the learning journey. This diversity is what makes the movement so powerful: there's a microschool model to match virtually any child's needs.

## The Stunning Growth of Microschools: By the Numbers

The numbers tell a compelling story about the changing preferences of American families when it comes to education.

According to the National School Choice Awareness Foundation, here's how parent interest has shifted just in the last year:

**⬇️ Traditional public schools in neighborhoods:** 22% decrease

**⬇️ Traditional public schools outside neighborhoods:** 12% decrease

**⬆️ Public charter schools:** 7% increase

**⬆️ Public magnet schools:** 18% increase

**⬆️ Private or faith-based schools:** 24% increase

**⬆️ Full-time online schools:** 17% increase

**⬆️ Homeschooling:** 39% increase

**⬆️ Microschooling/hybrid learning:** 220% increase

What might have been initially dismissed as a pandemic-driven trend, the sustained, explosive growth in microschools now signals a fundamental shift in what families want from education.

Dalena Wallace, founder of [Wichita Innovative Schools and Educators (WISE)](https://wisetogether.org/), notes: "We've realized we don't have to have traditional private school options. They don't have to be so expensive. They don't have to be five days a week. They don't have to be in a traditional brick and mortar school."

This freedom is proving contagious. Once parents see others creating educational experiences that truly fit their children's needs, they begin to ask, "Why not us too?"

## Real People, Real Schools: The Faces Behind the Revolution

When you picture someone who starts a school, who comes to mind? A team of education PhDs? A wealthy philanthropist? A state education department?

The reality of the microschool movement is far more democratic. As Wallace observes, "I've definitely seen an explosion of individuals who are starting something. Your everyday people – some of them might have been educators, but moms, dads, pastors, businessmen – people who just see a need and have a vision for what education should look like."

These founders aren't waiting for reformation within traditional systems. They're taking action, creating solutions that work for their communities now.

Wallace's own journey exemplifies this grassroots approach. After homeschooling her six children for years, she recognized both the challenges and the potential for improvement. She opened her home for collaborative teaching, which grew organically into a cooperative learning environment. Later, she launched a [Prenda](https://prenda.com/) microschool in her home as part of a pilot program.

"It completely turned me on to the idea that anybody can do this," she explains. "We can organize families and we can start a school."

This accessibility is what makes the microschool movement so powerful. You don't need specialized credentials or million-dollar budgets to create meaningful learning environments. You just need to care enough to start.

## Popular Educational Approaches in Microschools

One of the strengths of the microschool movement is its diversity of educational approaches. While some founders create entirely unique models, many draw inspiration from established educational philosophies that have proven effective over time.

Here's how different approaches translate to the microschool environment:

### Acton Academy

Founded in 2008, [Acton Academy](https://www.actonacademy.org/) views each child as a "hero" on a personal journey. The approach blends Montessori principles with Socratic dialogue to cultivate autonomous learners. They call themselves a "one-room school house for the 21st century."

**Key features:**

- Learner-driven environment with "guides" rather than teachers
- Project-based learning through "quests" that integrate multiple subjects
- Self-paced mastery of core skills, often using adaptive technology
- Student governance system that teaches real-world responsibility
- Strong emphasis on entrepreneurial thinking and character development

Acton typically operates as a five-day program to build consistent culture and community.

### Montessori-Inspired Microschools

Based on Dr. Maria Montessori's century-old approach, these microschools emphasize hands-on learning, independence, and respect for each child's natural development.

**Key features:**

- Specially designed materials that allow self-teaching and concrete learning
- Multi-age classrooms where younger children learn from older ones
- Teacher as observer and guide rather than lecturer
- High student autonomy within carefully prepared environments
- Focus on practical life skills alongside academics

The Montessori approach works especially well in microschools because of its inherent flexibility and respect for individual pacing.

### Waldorf-Inspired Microschools

Drawing from Rudolf Steiner's holistic philosophy, Waldorf-inspired microschools integrate arts throughout the curriculum and align learning activities with developmental stages.

**Key features:**

- Rich integration of storytelling, music, movement, and visual arts
- Teacher-led approach with warm, nurturing relationships
- Delayed academic instruction in favor of imaginative play in early years
- Emphasis on nature connection and limited technology
- Creation of beautiful main lesson books rather than using textbooks

Waldorf principles add warmth and creativity to the microschool environment, particularly for families seeking an arts-rich experience.

### Reggio Emilia-Inspired Approaches

Originating in Italy, the Reggio approach sees children as capable co-constructors of their learning journey and emphasizes project-based inquiry.

**Key features:**

- Learning emerges from children's interests and questions
- Projects that incorporate multiple disciplines
- Documentation of learning through photos, recordings, and artifacts
- Environment as the "third teacher" - beautifully arranged to inspire exploration
- Strong parent and community involvement

This approach works particularly well in early childhood microschools, where deep projects can replace traditional pre-K curricula.

### Hybrid and Customized Models

Many microschools don't adhere to a single educational philosophy but instead create custom approaches that blend elements from multiple traditions while adding unique innovations.

**Key features:**

- Flexible scheduling options (from one to five days per week)
- Combination of structured learning and self-directed exploration
- Integration of online learning with in-person experiences
- Focus on specific areas like STEM, outdoor education, or entrepreneurship
- Customization based on the specific needs of the community served

This flexible approach allows microschool founders to create truly personalized learning environments tailored to their students' needs.

## Finding Space: Creative Solutions for Microschool Locations

One of the biggest challenges for new microschool founders is finding affordable, appropriate space. But creative educators are turning this obstacle into opportunity by reimagining abandoned spaces as vibrant learning communities.

Dalena Wallace highlights several innovative approaches:

#### Home-Based Beginnings

Many microschools, including Wallace's, start in the founder's living room before expanding.

"To me, I feel like that's the easiest, most simplified, most cost-effective way to do that," she explains. "But it's not gonna be for everybody because you talk to those founders and they're like, 'I want my space back.'"

Still, starting at home allows founders to test their approach with minimal overhead before investing in a dedicated facility.

#### Church Partnerships

Churches often have ample space sitting empty during weekdays, making them natural partners for microschools.

"I know churches are really open to that," notes Wallace, though she adds that alignment of values is important for these partnerships to work well.

Many churches view hosting educational programs as part of their community mission, providing affordable space for learning.

#### Repurposed Commercial Spaces

With commercial real estate facing high vacancy rates, opportunities abound for microschools to repurpose these spaces.

"In Wichita specifically, we have had six closed schools, public schools that closed in the past year," Wallace shares. "School buildings aren't really good for anything as much as a school."

#### Victorian Homes and Unique Properties

Some microschools transform residential properties into learning spaces. Wallace points to Northfield School of Liberal Arts in Wichita, which operates from two Victorian homes near a college campus.

"No one lives in these homes. This home has just completely been used as their school, and they get creative and they take classes down at Friends University, and they kind of do these hybrid models."

#### The Shopping Mall Revolution

Perhaps the most intriguing possibility Wallace discusses is the potential of abandoned shopping malls.

"A lot of these shopping malls are just going like totally ghost town, you know, and just vacant," she observes. This creates an opportunity to reimagine these spaces as educational hubs.

"You have a different class in each store and you roller skate in between them," Wallace suggests with a laugh. "And then the food court, you have all your options there, and it's just like your education. You have all your schools to choose from, take a class à la carte here and there."

The creative repurposing of underutilized spaces not only solves the location problem for microschools but can actually enhance the learning experience by providing unique environments beyond traditional classrooms.

## 8 Benefits of the Microschool Approach

The rapid growth of microschools isn't just about dissatisfaction with traditional education—it's about the tangible benefits these small, personalized learning communities provide:

#### 1. Truly Personalized Learning Paths

With low student-to-teacher ratios (often 8-15 students per adult), microschools can customize education to each child's needs, interests, and pace. A student struggling with math can receive targeted support while another races ahead in science—without the constraints of moving an entire class at the same pace.

#### 2. Strong Community Connections

"When I hear of someone who's dreaming of something, I think the best thing to do is to take them by the hand," says Wallace about the microschool movement. This community-centered approach extends to the classroom, where children develop deep relationships with peers and mentors across age groups.

#### 3. Flexible Scheduling Options

Unlike traditional schools that demand five full days each week, many microschools offer part-time options—perhaps two or three days in-person with home learning on alternate days. This flexibility allows families to blend different educational approaches and accommodate other commitments.

#### 4. Cost Efficiency

While private schools can cost $15,000-30,000 annually, many microschools operate at a fraction of that price—often $5,000-12,000 per year—while providing more personalized attention than traditional private education.

#### 5. Passion-Driven Learning

When students pursue topics that genuinely interest them, engagement and retention soar. Microschools have the flexibility to incorporate student passions into the curriculum, whether that's coding, art, nature studies, or entrepreneurship.

#### 6. Multi-Age Collaboration

Unlike age-segregated traditional classrooms, many microschools group children of different ages together. Older peers inspire younger students, while older students reinforce their knowledge by teaching concepts to younger ones—a win-win arrangement that builds confidence and deepens understanding.

#### 7. Real-World Skill Development

Freed from standardized test pressures, microschools can emphasize skills that matter in today's world: critical thinking, collaboration, communication, creativity, and adaptability. Projects often connect to real community needs rather than theoretical exercises.

#### 8. Increased Student Engagement and Ownership

When children have agency in their education, they develop intrinsic motivation that serves them throughout life. Microschools foster this ownership by giving students voice in their learning journey, teaching them to set goals, track progress, and reflect on their growth.

These benefits explain why families are increasingly drawn to microschools—they offer an educational experience that's responsive to individual needs while building the skills and mindset needed for success in a rapidly changing world.

## Getting Started: Resources for Aspiring Microschool Founders

If you're inspired to create your own microschool, you're not alone—and you don't have to start from scratch. Here are resources to help you begin your journey:

### Connect with Existing Networks

"Finding someone who's kind of in that same space would be my advice," suggests Wallace. "Maybe like a form of mentorship, but it's more like just coming alongside and partnering with you."

Regional networks like Wallace's [wisetogether.org](http://wisetogether.org/) in Wichita provide directories of creative schools, meeting opportunities, and mentorship connections.

National networks include:

- [VELA Education Fund](https://velaedfund.org/) - Grants and resources for education entrepreneurs
- [National Microschooling Center](https://microschoolingcenter.org/) - Research, resources, and community
- [LiberatED](https://www.liberated.org/) - Kerry McDonald's podcast and network highlighting innovative education models

### Consider Franchise-Like Options

For those who want structure to start with, several organizations offer frameworks that simplify the process:

- [**Prenda**](http://prenda.com): A microschool network that provides curriculum, training, and administrative support for home-based or community microschools
- [**Acton Academy**](https://www.actonacademy.org/): Offers a proven model with training and support for founders who align with their educational philosophy
- [**Wildflower Schools**](https://www.wildflowerschools.org/): A network of Montessori microschools with teacher-leader support

### Transition from Co-op to Microschool

Many microschools evolve from homeschool co-ops, as Wallace's did. To make this transition:

1. Start with shared teaching among a small group of families
2. Gradually formalize the structure and schedule
3. Consider obtaining LLC status or nonprofit designation
4. Explore options for dedicated space beyond homes
5. Develop clear policies, procedures, and financial models

### Explore Funding Options

Microschools can be funded through various models:

- **Tuition-based**: Parents pay directly for services
- **Public partnerships**: In some states, charter or innovation school status may be possible. [OpenEd](https://opened.co) can reimburse certain forms of microschool tuition in the states where we operate.
- **Education Savings Accounts (ESAs)**: In states with school choice programs
- **Scholarships and sliding scales**: To ensure accessibility
- **Hybrid funding**: Combining multiple sources for sustainability

### Start Small and Grow Organically

"We had some other friends who would find out what we were doing, and they were like, 'You're doing some classes in your home. This is great. Can we join you?'" recalls Wallace. This organic growth allowed her to refine her approach as the community expanded.

Beginning with a small group of committed families allows you to test your model, make adjustments, and build a strong foundation before scaling up.

### Learn from Those Ahead of You

As Wallace emphasizes: "I love facilitating tours and taking people around so you can visit. When I hear of someone who's dreaming of something, I think the best thing to do is to take them by the hand and say, 'I love it. Let me show you what's happening over here. Maybe you'll get some more ideas.'"

Visiting established microschools provides invaluable insights that no book or article can replace. Most founders are generous with their time and advice for those just starting out.

The path to creating a microschool requires vision, dedication, and community support—but as thousands of successful founders have demonstrated, it's entirely possible for "regular people" to build extraordinary learning environments.

## Is a Microschool Right for Your Family?

While microschools offer numerous benefits, they're not one-size-fits-all solutions. Here are key considerations to help determine if a microschool might be the right fit for your child:

### Consider Your Child's Learning Style

Microschools work particularly well for:

- Children who thrive with individualized attention
- Students who learn at a significantly faster or slower pace than peers
- Individuals with strong interests that traditional schools can't accommodate
- Learners who benefit from mixed-age social environments
- Children who need movement and hands-on learning opportunities

However, some children prefer the larger social environment of traditional schools or thrive with more structure than some microschools provide.

### Evaluate Different Educational Approaches

Different microschool models suit different children:

- **Self-directed approaches** (like Acton) work well for intrinsically motivated students who can manage their time
- **Montessori-inspired models** benefit children who enjoy hands-on, concrete learning
- **Arts-integrated programs** (like Waldorf-inspired) appeal to creative, imaginative learners
- **Project-based environments** suit curious, collaborative children

Visit several models to see which resonates with your child's temperament and learning preferences.

### Consider Your Family's Schedule and Involvement

Microschools vary significantly in their time commitments and parent participation requirements. While some programs require full-time, five-day-a-week attendance, others offer more flexible schedules with 1-3 days of in-person learning complemented by home learning activities. Parent involvement also varies widely across different programs - certain microschools encourage parents to participate as co-teachers or volunteers, while others operate independently with professional staff. When evaluating options, it's essential to carefully consider how the school's schedule and involvement requirements align with your family's work commitments and available time.

### Try Before You Commit

Most microschools understand the importance of finding the right fit and offer several ways to experience their model before full enrollment. Families can typically arrange shadow days for their children to visit and observe, participate in summer programs or camps, attend special workshops and events, or even start with part-time enrollment options. These opportunities provide valuable firsthand experience to help determine if a particular microschool environment suits your child's needs.

### Plan for Transitions

When considering a microschool, it's crucial to think about how this educational choice fits into your long-term planning. Key considerations include whether the microschool's curriculum and approach will adequately prepare your child for future academic steps, what systems are in place to document and track learning progress, and how successfully alumni transition to traditional schools or colleges. Understanding these aspects helps ensure a smooth educational journey for your child.

Understanding the answers to these questions helps ensure continuity in your child's educational journey.

The best educational environment is one that recognizes and nurtures your child's unique strengths, challenges, and interests. For many families, microschools provide exactly this personalized approach, creating joyful learning experiences that traditional settings simply cannot match.

## The Future is Open

The microschool revolution represents a fundamental shift in how we think about education—moving away from standardized, one-size-fits-all models toward personalized, community-based learning environments.

As Dalena Wallace reflects, "I think the freedom, it's really catching. When you hear about and you see others who have all the freedom in the world to design and to curate their child's education experience...it's just, it's very catching and contagious."

This contagious freedom is opening education in ways that were hard to imagine even a decade ago. Parents now have unprecedented options to create learning experiences tailored to their children's unique needs and interests—without necessarily having to do it all themselves.

The microschool movement embodies what OpenEd has always believed: that education works best when it's personalized, flexible, and community-supported. By opening up educational options, we open up possibilities for every learner to thrive.

Whether you're considering enrolling your child in a microschool, starting your own, or simply incorporating elements of these innovative approaches into your current educational path, you're part of a growing movement that's reimagining what learning can be.

The future of education isn't closed and standardized—it's open, diverse, and full of possibility.
