## **Passion, Purpose, and People: The Three P's of Career Success**

Tanya Wright, star of *Orange is the New Black* and founder of the [**Hairiette of Harlem**](https://bighairhairiette.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=054-why-your-gpa-might-not-matter-anymore-according-to-google) series, shares a simple but powerful formula for finding fulfilling work:

1. **Follow your curiosity.** Let your passions guide you.
2. **If it doesn't exist, create it. **Entrepreneurship is about solving real problems.
3. **Find your tribe.** Surround yourself with supporters and collaborators.

These "Three P's" – Passion, Purpose, and People – aren't just career advice. They're a roadmap for a life well-lived.

## **Google Says GPAs are "Worthless" for Hiring (#facts)**

[**Google's senior VP of people operations, Laszlo Bock, says GPAs and test scores are "worthless as a criteria for hiring” (CNET)**](https://www.cnet.com/culture/google-gpas-are-worthless/?utm_campaign=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=later-linkinbio). With the exception of recent graduates, Google will no longer asks for GPAs or test scores, except for recent graduates.

"We found that they don't predict anything," referring to traditional academic metrics. He adds, "You want people who like figuring out stuff where there is no obvious answer."

The percentage of Googlers without college degrees has also been increasing, as Google now focuses on "behavioral interviewing" to assess real-world problem-solving skills.

*Hashtag #Facts*

The company's famous "brainteaser" interview questions have also been abandoned. Bock calls them "a complete waste of time," adding that they "serve primarily to make the interviewer feel smart." It turns out that both GPAs and the ability to calculate how many golf balls it would take to fill the moon are equally useless in predicting an employee's productivity.

This reinforces what we've been saying about the "hidden curriculum" most schools aren't teaching. While closed education often focuses on memorization and test-taking, the real world demands problem-solving skills, creativity, and the ability to navigate ambiguity.
