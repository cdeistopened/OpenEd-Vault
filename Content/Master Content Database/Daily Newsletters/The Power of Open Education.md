## Summary
5 tidbits you might have missed this week

## Content

It’s Friday – you made it!

That means time to look back at the past week of the OpenEd Daily, and clear out all those old emails you’re not planning to read. (But seriously, if you only want to receive the weekly digest – like this one – you can change your email preferences [**here**](https://share.hsforms.com/1e70j6rWTRSSw2dPqCXZxSgrd4fh?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=3-quick-bites&_bhlid=86f8aee817971cfd7a5d0c885726ee005c4d4225).)

**In this edition:**

- Meet Isaac – the homeschooler-turned-CEO of OpenEd 🚀
- Why the term "homeschooler" is less clear cut than people think 🏡
- What parents and kids really want from school 📊
- Your favorite educational resources (from YouTube explosions to outdoor adventures) 📚
- **Sneak peek:** What's next for OpenEd (including a new book!) 🔮

If you haven't been following our every word, here's what you missed this week:

#### **Meet the New CEO: Isaac Morehouse**

Incoming CEO Isaac Morehouse is spearheading our evolution from My Tech High to [**OpenEd**](https://opened.co/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-weekly-rundown). Homeschooled in Michigan the 80s and 90s "when it was barely legal," and now homeschooling his own four kids, Isaac has experienced nearly every educational model imaginable.

With a decade of friendship with founders Matt and Amy Bowman and a wealth of experience in alternative education, here's what he wants you need to know:

- The core program remains unchanged, with added flexibility
- Founders Matt and Amy Bowman are still involved, focusing on advocacy and writing (more on this later)
- The rebrand reflects our mission to open up educational possibilities for every learner

Which brings us to…

### **The Power of Open Education**

[**In the latest podcast**](https://youtu.be/qW9sseQvzYg?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-weekly-rundown), Matt and Isaac dive deeper into the evolution of education, questioning whether traditional labels like "homeschooler" still capture the diverse learning landscapes families are creating.

**Key points:**

- Education today defies simple categorization, blending online and offline, structured and unstructured approaches
- The 'Eclectic' approach, as highlighted in [**Pam Barnhill's homeschooling podcast**](https://player.fm/series/homeschool-better-together-with-pam-barnhill/what-i-really-think-about-homeschool-methods?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-weekly-rundown), combines elements from various methods to create truly personalized curricula
- OpenEd aims to provide language and concepts that reflect this educational shift

One OpenEd student's message to Matt on LinkedIn perfectly illustrates this new reality:

"I'm a homeschooler enrolled in OpenEd (which partners with a public school). I also split-enroll in my local school for band class, and I'm pursuing a competency-based associate degree through Southern New Hampshire University."

Is this homeschooling or something else? 🤷‍♂️ We just call it ‘Open Education.’

### **What Parents and Kids Really Want**

Recent studies confirm the shift. Here's what we're learning:

- 48% of K-12 parents are "Open-minded," with 26% of those being "Customizers" who mix and match educational options ([**2024 Choose to Learn report**](https://tytonpartners.com/choose-to-learn-2024-press-release/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday))
- [**A Danish study**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/loniatimagineif_pbl-projectbasedlearning-activity-7196757683188707329-5NHr?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-weekly-rundown) found that kids crave more creativity and hands-on learning:62% want creative use of technology
- 56% desire learning outside the classroom
- 51% want more hands-on, creative activities

**What do kids want less of? **Passive lectures, individual work, and standardized online learning programs.

### **Community Engagement: Your Resources and Stories**

We've been overwhelmed (in a good way) by the response to our call for your favorite educational resources. From [**Mark Rober's YouTube experiments**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY1kMZp36IQSyNx_9h4mpCg?ybp=-gEqYS1mZXctcXVlc3Rpb25zLWFib3V0LXRoZS1sYXVuY2gtb2Ytb3BlbmVk&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-weekly-rundown) to [**the 1000 Hours Outside podcast**](http://1000hoursoutside.com/podcast?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-weekly-rundown), your recommendations span a wide range of topics and perspectives.

As with curricula, our goal is to open up a world of possibilities for you to choose from – not mandate or endorse any single approach.
**Share Your Story, Shape the Future**
We're also eager to hear your personal education stories. How have you customized your child's learning journey? What unique combinations of learning have you created? Your experiences could inspire other families to explore new possibilities. **Reply to this email and share your experience!**

### **Looking Ahead**

As we continue to evolve, we're excited about upcoming content and initiatives:

- Matt and Amy Bowman are working on a book to share lessons learned and inspire more families to open up education for their children
- We're developing programs for families in states where our current program isn't offered
- Future newsletters will feature deep dives into various educational approaches, innovative curriculums, and alternative pathways to knowledge and experience.

That’s it for this week.

Don't forget – [**you can adjust your subscription settings to receive only program-related emails if you prefer**](https://share.hsforms.com/1e70j6rWTRSSw2dPqCXZxSgrd4fh?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=3-quick-bites&_bhlid=86f8aee817971cfd7a5d0c885726ee005c4d4225). We're here to support you in whatever way works best for your family.
