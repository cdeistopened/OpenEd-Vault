💡 THOUGHT
## **From Struggling Reader to Published Author**

Jennifer Jenkins loved stories long before she could read them easily. After discovering she had dyslexia in college, everything changed: she fell in love with reading, became an author, and now leads [**StoryCon**](https://storycon.org/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=breaking-writing-rules-with-purpose-127), one of the largest young writer events in the country.

In [**the latest OpenEd podcast**](https://youtu.be/bz1Hu-KMEm8?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=breaking-writing-rules-with-purpose-127), Jennifer shares 4 rules for *breaking* the rules:

1. Start with "what if?" (but don't stop there)
2. Build your world with endless "whys"
3. Create curiosity through what you DON'T show
4. Know when to plot and when to "pants"

She reminds us that great authors master the rules before breaking them. Want to learn how?

📝 WORD OF THE DAY
## **chi·as·mus (kī-ăz′məs)**

From the Greek letter "chi" (X), chiasmus is a writing technique where words, grammar, or concepts are repeated in reverse order, creating a satisfying X-shaped pattern.

Examples:

- "Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country." - JFK
- "I meant what I said and I said what I meant." - Dr. Seuss
- "Whether you think you can or think you cannot, you are right." - Henry Ford

That’s all for today!
