**Greetings Eddies!**

There is a subtle but pervasive myth in education reform [that if we just find the right *structure*](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7397722283420602368/) – the perfect voucher system, the ideal "Common Core" standards, or flawless charter policy – everything else will fall into place.

The truth is, none of this matters if we're building on a faulty foundation stemming from a lack of trust.

Let's unpack that.

**THOUGHT: **Directing The River**
TREND: **The Trust Deficit**
TOOL: **Guitar Hero For Real Life

# Directing The River

Every parent wants to influence their children. We want them to be healthy, happy, and wise. But often, our attempt to *influence* looks a lot like an attempt to *control*.

Joshua Fields Millburn offers a helpful metaphor on [this clip from The Minimalists podcast](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C19mmVZr8_m/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D): You can't direct a river if you don't know which way it flows.

“Parents who understand their children's desires have a much better chance of influencing them," he says. "And the only way to actually understand their desires is to start to get curious about **what they want, why they want it, and what they think it's going to do for them.**"

Control tries to build a dam. Curiosity maps the current. Once you know where the energy is going, you can guide it. But you have to get in the water first.

# The Trust Deficit

We have an obsession with "fixing" education. Every few years, a new wave of solutions arrives: Charters. Vouchers. ESAs. Microschools.

We call this innovation, but Grant Hewitt (VP of Partnerships at OpenEd) says it's merely iteration. Over on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7397722283420602368/), Grant argues that while we change the names, we rarely change the "core operating system." And the default OS is built on a lack of trust.

We design systems assuming people—educators and families—can't be trusted, so we wrap every "freedom" in a suffocating blanket of compliance, metrics, and oversight.

There's no shortage of educational models. Open education embraces them all. But until we fix the foundation—and shift our mindset to one of trust—we are just "building new rooms on the same cracked slab."

# Yousician: Guitar Hero IRL

Learning an instrument usually starts with the boring stuff: scales, theory, and clumsy fumbling. It’s high-friction and low-dopamine.

[**Yousician**](https://yousician.com/) flips the script.

Think of it as *Guitar Hero* for real instruments. You play along to songs you actually like, and the app listens to your real guitar, piano, or ukulele, giving you instant feedback on timing and accuracy. It gamifies the hardest part of learning music: the practice.

By replacing the "eat your vegetables" approach with immediate wins, it helps kids build the habit *first*. The theory can wait. Just play.
