## Summary
One parent's dilemma sparks a discussion on non-traditional paths to college and career success. Plus: How our CEO got into college without a diploma!

## Content

Last week, we got an email from a parent named JoAnna, who was wrestling with a familiar dilemma:

“My student did 9th grade last year on the diploma path, but we are planning to do* non-diploma-seeking status* this year. My child needs options and flexibility more than we felt was available on the diploma seeking path. However, I worry a lot about not following the traditional, “earn-a-diploma-and-go-to-college-path.” I would love help specific to college and/or other training when doing school through OpenEd.”

– JoAnna

JoAnna is not alone. Many parents struggle with this decision, and society has long pushed a linear path:

**High school diploma → college degree → good job → success!**

But as education and work evolve, so must our approach to preparing kids for the future.

### Here's what you need to know:

1. **You can still get into college without a traditional diploma.** In fact, our CEO did! Colleges often accept alternatives such as:
- A well-documented homeschool transcript
- GED
- Standardized test scores (SAT/ACT)
2. **You can create your own diploma.** It doesn't have to be from a public or private school (you can even create it in MS Word). What matters more than this piece of paper is demonstrating readiness for college-level work.
3. **Early college credits are a game-changer.** OpenEd students have earned associate's degrees through programs like Southern New Hampshire University while still in high school.
4. **Non-traditional paths can lead to amazing opportunities.** For instance, another student started a successful dog-breeding business at 15, earning $30,000 in profit within six months.
5. **There are many alternatives to traditional college.** These include vocational training, apprenticeships, entrepreneurship, and structured gap year programs.

- How non-traditional students can prepare for college
- The new landscape of post-high school options (college isn’t the end-all-be-all)
- Specific alternatives to the traditional college path
- Resources like the "Own It!" mini-course that can help students navigate their unique educational journeys
