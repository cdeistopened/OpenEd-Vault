## Summary
Why we're OpenEd now, the rise of the microschooling ecosystem, and the decline of public school enrollment

## Content

It's tl;dr Tuesday, folks - where we turn educational think-pieces into tweet-sized tidbits. Think of it as your weekly multivitamin for the brain (minus the chalky aftertaste).

**In this edition:**

- ICYMI… Why the name change to “OpenEd”? 🎙️ highlights
- How microschools are redefining the educational landscape 🧩
- Public schools are facing a new normal – declining enrolling since 2020 📉

Let’s dig in.

### 🎙️** ICYMI… What’s in a name? (podcast recap)**

[**In the latest podcast**](https://opened.co/%F0%9F%8E%99%EF%B8%8F-opened-podcast-episode-002-when-someone-asks-if-you-homeschool/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-great-enrollment-shuffle-tl-dr-tuesday), Matt and Isaac go deeper into the evolution from My Tech High to [**OpenEd,**](https://opened.co/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-great-enrollment-shuffle-tl-dr-tuesday) explaining the name change and why our current language around options in education falls short.

**Here are 3 things you need to know:**

#### **1/ Traditional educational labels are outdated.**

The rise of hybrid learning models and new personalized education paths has outpaced our current vocabulary. Students are creating their own educational adventures and don't know what to call themselves.

Matt relays a LinkedIn message he received from a student who described herself as: "a homeschooler enrolled in OpenEd (which partners with a public school).”

She also split enrolls in her local school for band class and is pursuing a competency-based associate degree.

So, what do we call *that*? (**Hint:** we call it OpenEd)

#### **2/ Language shapes the future of education.**

"Language is a type of network effect,” notes Isaac.

“The more people using certain language to talk about a problem or solution, the more valuable that language becomes."

**Translation: **Just speaking *openly* about '*open* education' can actually *open* it up for more families.

#### **3/ A book is in the works.**

Matt and Amy Bowman are crafting a guide to share their experiences and inspire more families to embrace open education.

### 🚸** Busting the Myth of Educational Either/Ors**

Remember when picking schools felt like a multiple-choice test with only two answers? Public or Private. Or, at best, maybe three: Public, Private, and Charter.

Some of us tossed the test and decided to homeschool.

But [**a recent article on *Getting Smart***](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2024/05/09/small-schools-big-umbrella-expanding-defining-and-scaling-the-microschool-ecosystem/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-great-enrollment-shuffle-tl-dr-tuesday) notes the explosion of educational models – from microschools and co-ops to part-time enrichment programs, virtual academies, and workplace-based learning centers.

We take it a step further: open education isn't just about picking from a wider menu of school types, but rather empowering learners to create their own educational recipe from scratch.

### 📉** Quick Bite: What’s behind declining enrollment?**

For the first time in decades, [**according to Brookings**](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/breaking-down-enrollment-declines-in-public-schools/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-great-enrollment-shuffle-tl-dr-tuesday), public school enrollment is *falling*:

- 59-69% of schools saw enrollment declines between 2019-20 and 2022-23
- Total public school enrollment dropped about 2% nationwide since 2019
- The states with the largest drops: Kentucky (-8%), South Carolina (-7.4%), Alaska (-7%)

Like the rise of the microschooling ecosystem (☝️ see above) the trend signals growing demand for flexible, personalized learning. Which is what OpenEd aims to provide.

That's all for this edition.
