## **THE INVISIBLE WORKFORCE**

"Just 1.5% of Americans feed 300 million people three times daily... When the most critical jobs that allow civilized life to happen are struggling to recruit, we don't have a skills gap—we have a priorities crisis."

## **BLUE COLLAR ARBITRAGE**

While [**universities push degrees of questionable ROI**](https://opened.co/blog/is-college-worth-the-cost-a-nuanced-look-at-educational-roi/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=weekly-roundup-the-college-roi-question), the jobs that make modern civilization possible are facing catastrophic worker shortages.

"For every five tradespeople who retire this year," Rowe notes, "two will replace them."

The average skilled tradesperson is now over 55. The American Welding Society projects a shortage of 400,000 welders by 2026. One defense contractor alone is looking for 100,000 skilled workers in the next decade.

But what some call a massive market inefficiency, we call an opportunity. It’s just basic supply and demand: **reduce the supply of workers, and the price (wage) rises.**

While millions of college graduates compete for oversaturated white-collar jobs, skilled trades offer immediate employment, zero debt, and often six-figure incomes within a few years.

The arbitrage won't last forever. Smart teens are already moving into Career and Technical Education. The question is whether we'll correct course before our infrastructure—literally—falls apart.
