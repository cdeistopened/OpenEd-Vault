💡 THOUGHT
## **“We are not dispensers of all the knowledge”**

If you ever feel overwhelmed trying to be the perfect teacher for your kids, you’ll find Connor Boyack’s message in this video refreshing: **stop trying to be an expert at everything.**

The [***Tuttle Twins***](https://tuttletwins.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-boys-are-falling-behind-126) author reminds us that our job isn't to have all the answers – it's to help our children find them. Think of yourself as a learning *facilitator* rather than an all-knowing *instructor*.

We Don't Need To Be Knowers Of All The Things

What does this look like in practice?

- Be a great resource finder (aka "professional Googler")
- Ask guiding questions rather than giving lectures
- Help them develop independent research skills

You're not failing if you don't know everything. You're succeeding when you show your children how to learn anything.

## Boys, Books, and Breaking from College

[**Boys Need a New Playbook →**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerrymcdonald/2024/11/21/boys-are-falling-behind-but-new-school-models-can-help/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-boys-are-falling-behind-126) Boys are labeled with ADHD 2x more than girls, reports Kerry McDonald. Soar Academy claims that movement is the solution that has allowed 90% of their previously medicated students to stop taking their ADHD medication.

[**Gen Z's $30k Reality Check →**](https://libertas.institute/education-empowerment/gen-zs-new-path-skip-college/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-boys-are-falling-behind-126) 1 in 4 college grads over 25 are earning less than $30k/year, and 6 in 10 employers are firing recent grads within months. Is it time to normalize trade schools, apprenticeships, and entrepreneurship as first-choice options?

[**Paper Makes Perfect? →**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1747938X18300101?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-boys-are-falling-behind-126) A new meta-study shows we process information more deeply when reading on paper versus screens. This advantage holds across ages and has actually grown stronger over time.

## **Mentava: Teaching Toddlers to Read... But at What Cost?**

A new AI-powered reading app has caught the attention of both high-achieving parents and Silicon Valley investors. [**Mentava**](https://www.mentava.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-boys-are-falling-behind-126) claims it can teach 3-year-olds to read at a second-grade level using adaptive software and real-time feedback.

**What Parents Love:**

- Phonics-focused approach with 44 English sounds
- Short, manageable 15-minute lessons
- Progress tracking and fun "dance party" rewards

[***Check out the reviews on ProductHunt***](https://www.producthunt.com/products/mentava/reviews?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-boys-are-falling-behind-126)

**Concerns:**

- High price point ($500/month)
- Some parents report bugs and technical issues
- Questions about screen time for very young children

For families seeking an alternative to private tutoring ($1000+/month) or elite preschools ($2500+/month), Mentava might offer an intriguing tech-driven option. But the steep price tag and mixed reviews suggest trying the 7-day free trial before committing.
