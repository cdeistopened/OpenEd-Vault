## **EDUCATION IS OPENING UP IN KANSAS**

OpenEd is thrilled about [**our new partnership with Augusta Public Schools**](https://opened.co/kansas?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-to-live-a-fulfilled-life-136), bringing personalized learning to K-8 students across Kansas.

To our early OpenEd families: You saw it first. The flexible, personalized approach you helped pioneer is becoming mainstream. Forward-thinking districts like Augusta aren't fighting the shift away from one-size-fits-all education – they're embracing it.

As Augusta Superintendent Matt Ward puts it: "The landscape for education has changed, and it will continue to evolve."

And this is just the beginning. Know a family in Kansas who’s ready to build an education that fits their child? Tell them about [**OpenEd**](https://opened.co/kansas?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-to-live-a-fulfilled-life-136)!

## THE MCCULLOUGH STARTER PACK

In case you were wondering, yes, David McCullough Jr. – the high school teacher who delivered the famous graduation speech – is the son of the late historian David McCullough Sr., who left us an incredible toolkit for teaching history in a way that captures young minds.

The best history isn't about memorizing dates – it's about understanding human stories and learning from them.

That’s all for today!
