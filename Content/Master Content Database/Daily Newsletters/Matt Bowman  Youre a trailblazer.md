## Summary
(and here's why your friends need to know)

## Content

This week, I got a chance to do a radio spot about OpenEd and our mission to personalize education for every child. It's an exciting opportunity to spread our message, but here's the thing: many parents who hear it might not know where to begin.

**That's where you come in.**

When people hear you are doing education differently, some might question your choice.

I know that feeling well. When my wife Amy and I started customizing our own children's education many years ago, we got plenty of raised eyebrows. But you know what? We felt it was right then and we celebrate the choice you've made today.

In fact, we think you're a pioneer, too.  A true modern-day trailblazer.

Our world has changed dramatically over the past century, but our education system has clung to its industrial-era roots. While we've revolutionized how we work, communicate, and live, we're still trying to educate our kids using a model designed to produce factory workers.

You saw the mismatch. You recognized that your child is unique, with their own passions, learning style, and potential. You dared to believe that education could be different - more engaging, more personalized, and more relevant to the world our kids will inherit.

**You were right.**

Every day I hear stories from families like yours who have embraced personalized learning:

- The "struggling" student who blossomed when allowed to learn at their own pace
- The "troublemaker" who became a leader when given real-world projects to tackle
- The "average" kid who discovered hidden talents and passions when they found the right curriculum

These stories aren't exceptions - they're what's possible when we open up education.

Sadly, there are still so many families out there who are frustrated with the status quo but don't know there's another way. They're watching their children's curiosity and love of learning slowly fade, and they feel powerless to stop it.

While our radio spot might reach some families who are struggling, many more **won't** hear it. That's why we need your help to amplify our message and reach those who might not tune in.

OpenEd has created a new personalized education toolkit - a free resource designed to help families understand their options and take those first steps toward a more engaging, personalized approach to learning.

I'm reaching out to you - our early trailblazers - to help us spread the word. You've lived this journey. You've seen the transformation in your own children. Your voice carries weight.

**Here's how you can help:**

1. [**Download the toolkit for yourself.**](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/OpenEd-Toolkit.pdf?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=matt-bowman-you-re-a-trailblazer)

3. Tell your story. Let others know why you chose this path and how it's impacted your family, or reply to this email, and we can showcase your story in this newsletter.

Your experience could be the catalyst that changes a child's entire future.

Here's to opening up education for every learner,
