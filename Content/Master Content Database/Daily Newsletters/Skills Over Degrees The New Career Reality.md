### 💡 DEEP DIVE

## **ARE YOU PROJECTING YOUR FAILURES ONTO YOUR KIDS?**

Ken Coleman, bestselling author of [***Find the Work You're Wired to Do***](https://ter.li/krbn8l?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stop-stressing-start-designing-a-mom-of-7-explains) and host of Front Row Seat with Ken Coleman, recently [**shared a question on the OpenEd podcast**](https://opened.co/blog/7-things-career-expert-ken-coleman-says-parents-get-wrong-and-how-to-fix-them?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stop-stressing-start-designing-a-mom-of-7-explains) that might make you uncomfortable:

**"Does my opinion, my belief or my desire for them have anything to do with regrets in my own life?"**

It's a dark question, Ken admits. But parents need to ask it because of how much influence they have over their kids' futures.

The stakes are real. A 27-year-old woman once called Ken’s show, miserable in her job with no direction. Ken he asked what she'd dreamed about as a teenager.

"Working with horses," she said.

When he asked why she didn’t pursue that, she said it was her parents’ response:

**"You'll never make any money doing that and you'll struggle your whole life," **her father said.

The woman broke down crying on air. "I love my dad. He's a good dad. I don't think he meant anything by it, but he crushed my heart."

There’s a fine line between tempering a child’s more fantastical notions and squashing their dreams. (We haven’t met many astronaut firefighters lately, but with the way things are headed… who knows??)

This projection of parental regrets is just one of seven mistakes Ken brought up in the interview. Others include pushing well-roundedness when the world rewards specialists, fixing weaknesses instead of developing strengths, and believing degrees guarantee success when 81% of employers now prioritize skills.

When these align, work doesn't feel like work. It’s how you

### 🔨 TOOL OF THE WEEK

## **GET CLEAR CAREER ASSESSMENT: A COMPASS FOR CONFUSED TEENS**

Ken Coleman's [**Get Clear Career Assessment**](https://ter.li/krbn8l?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stop-stressing-start-designing-a-mom-of-7-explains) isn't another personality quiz that tells your kid to be a forest ranger or accountant. Instead, it's a 10-15 minute deep dive into what Coleman calls your "three wires"—the unique combination that points toward fulfilling work.

The assessment measures:

- **12 talent categories** - What you naturally do better than others
- **15 passion categories** - Work that makes two hours feel like 20 minutes
- **6 mission categories** - The results that fire you up

Then, it generates a “personalized purpose statement” that brings all three together. No vague statements like "you should work with people!" Real clarity.

**What parents are saying:**

- "I gave it to 2 family members who just graduated high school. I hope they find it as useful as I did." - SB
- "I was miserable at my current job... until I took the get clear assessment." - AW
- "It serves as a guideline to help you find where/how to apply yourself instead of telling you what kind of job to get." - LW

With 81 reviews and a 4.7-star rating, parents praise how it motivates without dictating. book includes the assessment code, plus Coleman's framework for turning results into action.

Perfect for teens asking "what should I major in?" or young adults feeling stuck. At $34.99, it's cheaper than a single college application—and might save years of wandering.

I would sit there, 13, 14, 15 years old, and think: 'I'll show you all.'"**](https://www.instagram.com/openedhq/reel/DKe751aCe2v/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stop-stressing-start-designing-a-mom-of-7-explains) - Gary Vee got D's and F's, now mentors Fortune 500 founders. Some kids turn labels into fuel.

[**We remember 95% of what we teach others, but only 10% of what we read**](https://opened-daily.beehiiv.com/p/why-do-we-focus-on-the-10-when-kids-remember-95) - Edgar Dale's research explains why your kid forgets Friday's test but remembers every Minecraft detail they explained to friends.
