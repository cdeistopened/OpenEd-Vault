TGIF, open educators!

Another week, another chance to open the world for every learner.

We've covered everything from near-burnouts to coding prodigies, proving once again that the world of open education is anything but boring.

**In this edition:**

- Meet the 8-year-old wizard coding circles around adults 🧙‍♂️
- Do you need a diploma for success? (***tl;dr:*** no) 🎓
- From teacher burnout to personalized learning pioneer 🔥

Let's peel back the layers of this week's educational onion, shall we?

### **🧙‍♂️ Move Over, Hogwarts: 8-Year-Old Codes Magic**

Remember when making a potato clock was considered peak childhood innovation? Well, hold onto your wands, folks:

An 8-year-old recently conjured up a Harry Potter chat app in just 10 minutes using AI-assisted coding.

The video is going viral because, well… it’s adorable. But even moreso, it's a powerful example of what happens when you combine project-based learning with cutting-edge tech.

### **🎓 The Great Diploma Debate: Do You Really Need One?**

A parent's email sparked a lively debate in our virtual office this week: Is a high school diploma necessary for success?

**Here's what we can all agree on:**

1. College is possible without a traditional diploma (our CEO is living proof!)
2. DIY diplomas are a thing – and they can be just as valid
3. Early college credits are an excellent substitute and/or add-on. Some of our students have earned associate's degrees before senior prom.

But remember, there's a whole world beyond college too. From vocational training to gap years, the possibilities are endless.

### 🔥** From Burnout to Breakthrough: Andrea Fife's Journey**

On [**this week's OpenEd podcast**](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-005-she-almost-gave-up-on-education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=she-almost-gave-up-on-education), we sat down with our very own VP of Learning, Andrea Fife. Her story is a rollercoaster ride through the education system:

- 5 years ago: On the brink of quitting teaching altogether
- Today: Spearheading our personalized learning revolution

Andrea's journey from college dropout to educational innovator is a testament to the power of rethinking education. As she puts it, "I went from feeling suffocated by the system to helping others breathe new life into learning."

[**Tune in to Andrea's full story & leave us a review!**](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-005-she-almost-gave-up-on-education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=she-almost-gave-up-on-education)
