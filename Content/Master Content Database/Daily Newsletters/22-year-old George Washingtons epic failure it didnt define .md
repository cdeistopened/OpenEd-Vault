### 📊 2 TRENDS

**1. YOU–THE AUDIENCE—ARE NOW GREENLIGHTING MOVIES** - [**Angel Studios' "Young Washington"**](https://www.angel.com/giveaway/young-washington?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=22-year-old-george-washington-s-epic-failure-it-didn-t-define-him) is slated to hit 2,000+ theaters on July 4, 2026, but not because Hollywood greenlit it.

As Benton explains:

**"Angel Studios is putting the power of the gatekeepers in the viewers' hands. Hollywood is run by a few people deciding what gets made. Angel Studios lets viewers decide what stories should be told."**

Their 1.2 million "Angel Guild" members vote on projects globally. Ticket pre-sales opened today—a year early—to demonstrate audience demand.

**2. THE MOST AMERICAN GIVEAWAY EVER** -

[**Pre-order your movie ticket**](https://www.angel.com/giveaway/young-washington?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=22-year-old-george-washington-s-epic-failure-it-didn-t-define-him), and you could win a restored Ford F-250 in honor of America's 250th birthday.

Today only: Each ticket earns 97 (!) bonus entries. (Because nothing says "American independence" like voting with your wallet and maybe winning a classic American truck.)
