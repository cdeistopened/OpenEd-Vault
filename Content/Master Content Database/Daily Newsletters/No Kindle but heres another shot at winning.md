## Summary
Bad news first: You didn’t win the Kindle we were giving away at StoryCon. But you did unlock something pretty cool just by signing up.

## Content

**Bad news first:** You didn’t win the Kindle we were giving away at StoryCon. (I know, I was rooting for you.)

But here’s some good news—you *did* unlock something pretty cool just by signing up.

I’d love to introduce you to **the** **OpenEd Daily**—a punchy 2-minute-read that helps families chart a clearer course through the realm of personalized education.

## **Wait…what’s **[**OpenEd**](https://opened.co?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=no-kindle-but-here-s-another-shot-at-winning&_bhlid=3fa2ada089ff2a980fb8d7e45e10a7655af6ebe5)** again?**

Glad you asked! [OpenEd](https://opened.co/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=no-kindle-but-here-s-another-shot-at-winning&_bhlid=2a6ace48e79af15588c6ccaf6e1263f570ef9500) is a program that helps families design a flexible, self-directed learning path that works for them.

✅ Students get access to funding for learning resources—including curricula, in-person classes, technology, and tutoring.
✅ Families can use our teaching staff for guidance *or* fully chart their own course.
✅ 10,000+ homeschoolers, self-directed learners, and families are using OpenEd as a flexible, supportive alternative to the standard school model.

If you:

- Know a K-12 student struggling in school,
- Have a gifted kid who’s bored out of their mind, or
- See a young person with a passion that school doesn’t make room for,

…this is the kind of thing you’ll want to keep tabs on.

**And hey, there's even a way to win something today!** If you refer three people to this newsletter who subscribe, we'll send you a **$10 Amazon gift card**—enough for a paperback, a fancy coffee, or whatever else fuels your curiosity. Here's how:

1. Forward this email to someone who might be interested in OpenEd.
2. Tell them to sign up using your unique referral link below (copy and paste, or just direct them to the link)
3. If three people sign up with your link, we'll automatically send you your gift card!

**Pro tip for sharing:** When forwarding this to friends, add a personal touch like "Just found this newsletter about alternative education that's actually pretty cool—plus if you sign up with my link, I get closer to a free book."

If three people sign up with your link, we’ll automatically send you your gift card!

## Upcoming Rewards

For each referral you drive, you will unlock rewards when you hit milestones.

So while the Kindle may not be yours this time, you’ve still got a shot at winning something—*and* discovering an exciting new way to approach education.

Stay curious,
Isaac Morehouse
CEO, OpenEd
