‍**💡 THOUGHT**
## **"But I Work Full-Time..."**

Last week, we shared [research on the “ROI” of homeschooling](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.hqn5fvRZGNlF5Uv2NRQYleumk5kEk5K_4mpEDgDEwf2KmBafUTuSFchWOx1Es1A2C7J-jPflYmPw-tqdb4DAO4yXkv2Je1LPcmWhlAv48YAGgigdJyZBq-GOn-5NmDJ3Vwn-qqO9dMQOz5TmGD76lXhYGvsEehZ03cRe-gxAfYaTXyVkrmdwoYHoFxxafA8OUDmkPMBnOES5WXr_PrsQWCZajXrce6SPxn7D0XMfm-xbesWwhtMpVXRgg1TO8be5gTnwJaU44qpeSi-s69Rk4bV0dztdjFO4Lx5UgNvfGdQ/4av/ZXE40ilHRVCd2MHhmmoOew/h7/h001.HwJyyDoYCsTrP446VQYBfcErvr2yoHsseXZeBfqqOdQ?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=064-custom-education-for-single-and-working-parents&_bhlid=783691ff0b80c132e2690d8b83752a6be03ff78c), showing how it can be more affordable and effective than traditional private education. But a reader, Virginia, replied with an important reality check:

*"I work in technology, and I've been unable to find a work-from-home position that would allow the flexibility to homeschool. My husband and I both work outside the home... it is 100% of the reason I am not homeschooling my kids."*

She's right – the "true cost" of homeschooling must include the opportunity cost of reduced work hours or staying out of the workforce entirely. And that's a deal-breaker for many families.

But here's the good news: **You don't have to choose between work and personalized education.**

[Meet Sunny Simkins](https://youtu.be/Y5U8Hm0iei4?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=064-custom-education-for-single-and-working-parents&_bhlid=9e1583d823de8fdef860acf17aab893c0cda34c5), a single working mom with two kids in public school, who works in OpenEd’s Learning division.

"Public school provides the daytime support I need," she explains. "But I've identified my kids' learning styles and interests... and I make sure they have outlets for all of that. I don't just assume school will handle it all."

Her solution? Strategic add-ons and after-school programs:

- Mathnasium for her daughter who needs extra help with math
- Ninja Warrior classes for her son who needs movement
- Community theater for creative expression (who doesn’t need that?)

If you can't homeschool... If you need to work full-time... If public school is your only option... You can STILL customize your child's education. The secret isn't fighting the system. It's getting creative with the pieces you have.

## **Gaming Gets Serious About Digital Literacy**

A conversation between [AEI's education scholar Rick Hess](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/this-group-is-trying-to-teach-digital-literacy-heres-how/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=064-custom-education-for-single-and-working-parents&_bhlid=e45799001f4f696b40116750fa5c7fd636da3dac) and a former Stanford professor just revealed how Microsoft's Minecraft – the world's best-selling video game with over 300 million copies sold – is tackling one of education's biggest challenges: digital literacy.

The Digital Inquiry Group (DIG), founded by former Stanford professor Sam Wineburg, has partnered with Microsoft to teach kids something more valuable than building virtual worlds—how to navigate the *real* digital world. Through interactive lessons and Microsoft's new "Search Coach" browser, students learn to spot unreliable sources and identify conflicts of interest.

We were ahead of this curve with [our Minecraft STEAM Foundations course (available for grades 3-8)](https://launchpad.neolms.com/visitor_catalog_class/show/4742474?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=064-custom-education-for-single-and-working-parents&_bhlid=9da5eb0d83b2ed7b4607b64c1cafbce8e88739d4), which blends creative exploration with real-world problem-solving. Students tackle engineering challenges, design sustainable cities, and even explore historical sites – all while gaining access to Microsoft Office 365 tools to document their journey.


🛠️ TOOL
## **The Sacred Hour**

Whether you're homeschooling full-time or supplementing after school, here's a powerful technique we've heard from dozens of families: Create a "sacred hour" for learning.

**The concept is simple:**

- Pick one consistent hour
- Make it completely distraction-free
- Be fully present (no multitasking!)
- Treat it like an important appointment

**For example: **If your child struggles with math, make 4-5 PM your "sacred math hour" every Tuesday and Thursday. No phones, no dishes, no distractions – just focused learning time.



That’s all for today!
