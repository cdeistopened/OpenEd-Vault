💡 THOUGHT
## **Learning, distilled**

***Learning = reducing cycles between feedback loops.***

☝️ A deceptively simple formula from our COO, Jared Fuller, who recently joined the [**Deskooled podcast**](https://www.deskooled.com/p/homeschooling-becomes-mainstream?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-hidden-power-of-feedback-loops-123) to share OpenEd's vision for transforming education.

When you understand this principle, you start to see why traditional schooling might be missing the mark with long gaps between lessons and feedback.

## **When Physics Meets the Pavement**

In Florida’s [**Surf Skate Science**](https://www.surfandskate.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-hidden-power-of-feedback-loops-123) program, Newton's Laws aren't abstract concepts – they're the difference between landing a kickflip and eating concrete. Students learn physics and other STEM concepts through direct experience: each attempt, success, or fall provides instant feedback that no textbook can match.

Instead of schools trying to be everything to everyone, we're seeing the rise of specialized, part-time ‘*a la carte*’ programs like Surf Skate Science that do one thing exceptionally well. These programs work precisely because they shrink the time between learning and application. When you can immediately see how force and momentum affect your ride, concepts stick.
