ICYMI, [the New York Times ran a guest essay last weekend that was critical of unschooling](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/opinion/home-school-isolation.html), and we have some thoughts (see more below).

# DEEP DIVE: UNSCHOOLING

Last Sunday, the New York Times published a guest essay titled "[The Home-Schooled Kids Are Not All Right](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/14/opinion/home-school-isolation.html)." The author calls for mandatory registration and check-ins for all homeschoolers, based on his own painful childhood experience with unschooling-gone-wrong.

We went to our community to help guide [our response](https://opened.co/blog/you-can-do-this-what-the-new-york-times-misses-about-unschooling). This comment, from neuroscientist turned homeschool mom [Dr. Claire Honeycutt](https://substack.com/@hippymomphd) captures something essential about why open education is more than a trend:

"The biggest problem in education today is the assumption that there is one perfect way to learn that suits all children everywhere under all conditions. That's never been true. No single school - or education model - will fit all kids.

If you want people to return to public school, make it something worth returning to. Until then, let the parents who are upending their entire lives to be with their children do their work in peace. They are not the problem."

Coincidentally, we had already planned [our deep dive for this week on (you guessed it) unschooling](https://opened.co/blog/unschooling-a-guide-to-child-led-interest-driven-learning). We don't endorse unschooling any more or less than [the many other approaches to personalized education](https://opened.co/open-education). But we think it's important for families to understand the range of options available to them.

The reason open education is attracting more families each year precisely because it refuses rigid adherence to any single approach. That flexibility lets us look clearly at what works and admit when something has flaws - whether that's unschooling, [classical education](https://opened.co/open-education/classical-education), or the traditional school system.

Isaac's [full response to the New York Times piece points to the Nirvana Fallacy ](https://opened.co/blog/you-can-do-this-what-the-new-york-times-misses-about-unschooling)at the heart of the essay - a comparison between the authors real (and tragic) story to an imagined ideal. Three weeks earlier, the same New York Times published "[America's Children Are Unwell. Are Schools Part of the Problem?](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/24/magazine/youth-mental-health-crisis-schools.html)" - one in four teenage boys now diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety spiking as early as age six.

Our message to parents is simple: you don't have to be perfect to do better than the status quo if school is failing your kid. [Your Kids Will Be Alright](https://opened.co/blog/you-can-do-this-what-the-new-york-times-misses-about-unschooling)

# PODCAST HIGHLIGHT:

[WATCH: *She Did Everything Right - Her Daughter Still Couldn't Read*](https://opened.co/blog/child-struggling-to-read-what-actually-works)

[Janssen Bradshaw (@everydayreading)](https://www.instagram.com/everydayreading/) had every advantage. Former librarian. English major. Thousands of books in her home. Her first daughter tested at a 12th grade reading level in kindergarten.

But her second daughter was barely at grade level in first grade... and drifting lower.

"Learning to read is just really hard for some kids," Janssen told Ela.

Then she discovered what researcher [Benjamin Bloom called the "Two Sigma Problem"](https://opened.co/blog/new-post-1b5f) - students who receive one-on-one tutoring outperform 98% of students in regular classrooms. The solution wasn't more hours or harder curriculum. It was 25-minute sessions, four times a week, meeting her daughter exactly where she was.

By fifth grade, her daughter was reading at an 11th-grade level.

The approach she used was systematized into the method now employed by [Savvy Learning](https://savvylearning.com/) - an online tutoring company founded by Janssen to deliver intensive 1:1 and small-group practice in small doses. The program is accessible via the OpenEd Marketplace, and is our top recommended resource for kids who struggle with reading.

# TRENDS WE'RE FOLLOWING

[Readers Are Now the Minority](https://x.com/paulg/status/2000671836992884746) - Paul Graham shares data that should alarm anyone who cares about literacy: "Readers used to outnumber non-readers 2 to 1. Now non-readers outnumber readers 3 to 1." A complete inversion within a generation.

[Parents Want Skills, Not Scores](https://www.edchoice.org/2026-fall-polling-finds-parents-value-durable-skills-development-in-schools/) - EdChoice finds 85% of parents rate "durable skills" - communication, critical thinking, adaptability - as extremely important. 45% say emphasis on these affects enrollment decisions. Meanwhile, 73% of school parents now support Education Savings Accounts.

[The Engagement Gap](https://www.the74million.org/article/student-engagement-is-key-defining-and-measuring-it-is-the-challenge/) - 92% of students say engaging lessons make school more enjoyable, but only 63% feel "highly engaged." There's a 20-point gap between what students report and what teachers perceive. Engagement is a precondition for learning - not a nice-to-have. (*The 74 Million)*

[The 8-Hour Day Is Made Up](https://x.com/AdamMGrant/status/1192198752527929345) - Organizational psychologist Adam Grant says: "The 8-hour work day was not ordained from above for all time. It was dreamed up by humans. We can be as productive and creative in 6 focused hours as in 8 unfocused hours." Anyone who's watched their kid finish a full day of school in two hours at home already knows this.
