## **The Only 3 Non-Negotiables in Education**

[**Parents sometimes ask us, "What subjects can't we skip?"**](https://youtu.be/cBf3u0U1NQ8?si=TtqULy5O-fU8BdjH&t=1538&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=090-the-3-r-s-are-all-you-need) We tend to favor a simple (if boring) answer: reading, writing, and basic math – the old-fashioned “3 R’s.”

Now before you picture dreary workbooks and five-paragraph essays, hear us out.

Reading might look like following game instructions or sports articles. Writing could mean texting friends or scripting YouTube videos. Math might happen through coding or running a lemonade stand. One OpenEd student learned writing by transcribing their favorite athlete's game highlights. Another mastered it by documenting their gaming strategies.

Think of these basics as tools, not torture. We tell our kids: "Trust me, this will make your life easier." No teenager wants to struggle calculating tips as a server because they skipped basic math. No adult wants to feel anxiety about sending a simple email.
Almost everything else can flow naturally from your child's curiosity and interests. The key isn't forcing traditional methods – it's finding ways to engage with these foundational skills that actually matter to your child.📊 TREND
## **AP Courses: Education or Industry?**

When you follow the money in education, interesting patterns emerge. Take the College Board, for instance – the "nonprofit" that controls Advanced Placement (AP) courses and the SAT.

According to [**a new Goldwater Institute report**](https://www.goldwaterinstitute.org/the-college-board-academic-rigoror-progressive-grift/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=090-the-3-r-s-are-all-you-need), this educational gatekeeper:

- Reported over $1 billion in revenue in 2022
- Paid its CEO $2 million (30x a typical teacher's salary)
- Controls curriculum for millions of students
- Is subsidized by taxpayers in 26 states (as well as anyone who takes the SAT)

Too often, in the K-12 system, students aren't really the customers – they're the product. The true customers? College admissions offices and the massive $12 billion college prep industry.

This manufacturing mindset creates a cycle: Teachers focus on test prep over authentic learning. Curriculum serves college requirements rather than student needs. And engagement plummets.

Some states are pushing back. Florida is exploring alternatives to AP courses. Other states are questioning why they're required to accept AP scores for college credit.

Of course, many students will still choose the traditional college path. If that's your child's goal, they'll likely need to play the game. The College Board offers [**free practice tests through their SAT Suit**](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/practice/practice-tests?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=090-the-3-r-s-are-all-you-need)e (might as well get our money’s worth!).

## **Stop Taking Bad Notes: A Teacher's Guide to What Actually Works**

Remember frantically copying every word from the board, only to find your notes incomprehensible later? [**High school teacher Mr. Battaglia has a better way**](https://k12blog.hillsdale.edu/note-taking-in-history-a-classical-guide/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=090-the-3-r-s-are-all-you-need). Instead of trying to capture everything, focus on three key elements:

1. **The Big Question** - Start with the main question you're trying to answer. For example, if studying the American Revolution, write: "Why did the colonists rebel?" This gives your notes purpose and direction.
2. **Key Evidence -** Rather than copying entire slides, jot down just the critical points:Names
3. Dates
4. Core concepts *Example:* "Stamp Act (1765)" instead of three paragraphs about it.
**Tell It Back -** At the end of each study session, write 4-6 sentences summarizing what you learned in your own words. This helps move information from short-term to long-term memory.
Some teachers call this the QUEN method – **Question, Evidence, Narration** – but the name doesn't matter (how is that even pronounced? “Queen”? “Kwen”?).

If you're a parent helping your child with this, start small. Pick one subject they're studying and try this method for a week. You might be surprised at how much better they retain information when they're not trying to write down every word.

That’s all for today!
