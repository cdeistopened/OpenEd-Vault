And the future is now:

## **THE $200,000 VACATION**

Modern media mogul Gary Vaynerchuk distills a complex question into simple math: Is college worth it?
[](https://www.instagram.com/p/DHHZ3H6BSDw/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-math-is-broken-college-s-roi-problem)
His answer isn't anti-college, but pro-analysis: "My point of view on college is based on unemotional math." For decades, college was ROI-positive for most careers because a degree guaranteed returns. That reality has shifted for many—though not all—fields.

Gary acknowledges that certain professions still require degrees: "Do you need a degree for certain professions if you want to be a doctor, lawyer? I understand all that."

Today's question isn't whether college is universally "good" or "bad" – it's whether the specific investment matches your child's desired outcome. Each family needs to calculate their own ROI equation.

Meanwhile, as colleges face enrollment challenges and[** campuses close at record rates**](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/a-new-problem-with-four-year-degrees-the-surge-in-college-closures-7f68c4aa?st=fnry5247fjnwzew&reflink=article_email_share&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-math-is-broken-college-s-roi-problem), it's worth having this honest conversation before making a $200,000 decision.

## **SKIP COLLEGE, START APPRENTICING**

When OpenEd CEO Isaac Morehouse created [**Praxis**](https://discoverpraxis.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-math-is-broken-college-s-roi-problem) over a decade ago, he had a radical idea: you don't need a college degree to build an awesome career.

Hundreds of students later, the results speak for themselves. Through 6-month apprenticeships with growing companies, Praxis participants get real skills, actual experience, and a job. No debt required.

Now, with their recent acquisition by [**Libertas Network**](https://libertas.org/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-math-is-broken-college-s-roi-problem), they're scaling up to help even more young adults break free from the college conveyor belt.
