💡 THOUGHT
## **LIONS HUNT IN SPRINTS**

"We're not meant to graze all day, right? We're meant to hunt like lions."

Naval Ravikant

Humans aren't cattle. So why do we structure education and work/study like we are?

[**Naval Ravikant points out the obvious**](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHbf3-qAOLw/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=study-like-a-lion-not-like-a-cow): intellectual performance doesn't follow a linear 9-to-5 pattern. What matters is intensity, not duration. Quality, not quantity.

The most effective approach: **Train hard. Sprint. Rest. Reassess. Repeat.**

Stop grazing. Start hunting.
📊 TREND
## **82% CAN'T DO MATH**

**BREAKING:** 82% of students in Newark can't do math at grade level. 70% can't read at grade level.

[**Educators call these results "disappointing,"**](https://www.wbgo.org/news/2025-02-19/nj-educators-ponder-next-moves-after-disappointing-test-scores?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=study-like-a-lion-not-like-a-cow) which is a bit like calling a tornado a "stiff breeze."

To be clear: There's nothing inherently wrong with a child developing at their own pace, mastering concepts when they're ready rather than when an arbitrary system dictates. Children aren't standardized, and their learning shouldn't be either.

The traditional education system itself created and enforces these grade-level standards. It's failing by its own metrics.

At what point do we acknowledge that our educational shortcomings are based less on funding problems than a misalignment with how children actually learn?
🔨 TOOL
## **SCREEN BEFORE YOU STREAM**

For $5/month, the [**YouTube & Podcast Screener**](https://podtubescreener.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=study-like-a-lion-not-like-a-cow) gives you visibility into content before your kdis watch or listen, analyzing videos and podcasts for:

- Language concerns
- Violence
- Sexual content

Alternatively, if you are willing to jump through a few hoops yourself, try this:

1. Open any YouTube video
2. Open the description and click "Show transcript"
3. Copy the entire text (Ctrl+A, then Ctrl+C)
4. Paste (Command + V) into an AI model of your choice along with this prompt:

Analyze this content for language concerns, violence, sexual content, and other themes inappropriate for children,

And bingo! You just saved $5.

For podcasts, most platforms now offer transcripts you can analyze using the same approach.

That’s all for today! See you tomorrow.
