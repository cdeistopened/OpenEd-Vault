💡 THOUGHT
## **Boredom: The Ultimate Creative Fuel**

Picture two boys wandering the hills of a film set, exploring while their dad directs scenes for Angel Studios' latest hit film and series. This wasn't a field trip - it was a typical school day for the Smallbone family.

After OpenEd founder Matt Bowman stumbled upon this scene, he learned something fascinating: Both Ben Smallbone (director) and Ben Kasica (producer) of [***Homestead ***](https://www.homestead.tv/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-to-make-movies-without-a-200k-degree-119)were homeschooled. The secret to their creativity? The freedom to be bored growing up.

In [**our latest podcast**](https://youtu.be/ImwEs65Vxuo?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-to-make-movies-without-a-200k-degree-119), they revealed how unstructured time led them to follow their curiosity and eventually build careers that many film school graduates only dream about. No permission needed. No waiting to be “picked.”

## **“Go make stuff.”**

**Film School: **$200k to learn "how" to make movies

**Alternative path: **Actually making movies at 16

**Film school grads:** "I'm waiting to be discovered"

**Your homeschooled teen:** "Check out my YouTube channel"

The portfolio you build matters more than the diploma you buy.

The democratization of content creation has accelerated this shift: With tools like smartphones and YouTube, young creators can build impressive portfolios before they're old enough to vote. The key ingredient? Time and space to experiment – something that flexible, personalized education models excel at providing.

Ben Kasica – producer of *Homestead* and former lead guitarist for the band *Skillet – *makes the crucial point:

"When you're homeschooled, you have a lot of free time... you can actually make a living as a teenager making stuff on YouTube, entering filmmaking contests, entering festivals."

Are you still waiting for someone to pick you?
Maybe it’s time to just go make stuff.🛠️ TOOL
