💡 THOUGHTS
#### The new success formula for teens:

**Real projects + Work experience + Self-education + Networking = Job offers. **

In a world where 52% of recent college grads are underemployed, being an average graduate doesn't signal much anymore.

#### Curiosity > Curriculum

Humans are born learners. Just look at a toddler’s natural curiosity. When a child uses an object in a new way (like standing on a footstool they've only seen used for sitting), they're making analogies and connections – demonstrating a deep, intuitive grasp of the world. When you allow kids to follow their curiosity, they can't help but learn.

#### Rethinking risk
