## **The ROI of Personalized Ed**

We keep hearing that personalized education is "too expensive." But what's the real cost?

Jonathan Chizik, a co-founder of SmartPath, [runs the numbers](https://smartpath.school/the-roi-of-homeschooling?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=061-the-roi-of-personalized-education&_bhlid=6d94c7052f0ce85546a928192cf8c9749d3675c2):

- Traditional private schools: $12,000-30,000/year
- Customized learning at home: $500-2,500/year

Meanwhile, Chizik notes [that homeschooled students score 15-30 percentile points higher on standardized tests than their traditionally schooled peers](https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=061-the-roi-of-personalized-education&_bhlid=cfc71b09e944c177ef82d7a1dc04be4fe458f962). (Not that standardized tests are the gold standard—we're more interested in creating lifelong learners than expert test-takers.)

**Think about that: **Better results. Lower costs. More flexibility.

With today's tools like Khan Academy, Outschool, and Time4Learning (to name just a few), personalized education isn't just more affordable – it's more effective.

Why do we think that learning must happen in expensive buildings, or that personalization is a luxury?

## **"They're in the 8th Grade"**

We've covered *Dirty Jobs *host [Mike Rowe's campaign to bring attention to the shortage of skilled trade workers](https://opened.co/uncategorized/mike-rowes-case-for-career-and-technical-education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=061-the-roi-of-personalized-education&_bhlid=b644ac927652b2a3ff967334771cb6ae61d9fbd3). Here’s his latest alarming stat:

**"For every five tradespeople who retire this year, two will replace them."**

One company building nuclear submarines needs to hire 100,000 skilled workers in the next nine years. When [a newscaster asked Mike where to find these workers](https://x.com/Holden_Culotta/status/1848751959827698048?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=061-the-roi-of-personalized-education&_bhlid=b39ed307fd0cb25da2e6d452c1449f1c6bba7055), his answer was perfect:

**"They're in the 8th grade."**

While traditional schools push students toward four-year degrees, companies desperately seek skilled workers for six-figure jobs that don't require college diplomas.

The jobs are there. The salaries are there. But our education system isn't preparing students for these opportunities.

## **AI Meets Curriculum Planning: SmartPath Beta**

Finding the right mix of resources for your child can feel like solving a puzzle with too many pieces. That's why we're intrigued by [SmartPath](https://smartpath.school/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=061-the-roi-of-personalized-education&_bhlid=6dd8d2925250689b963eefb30f759ad627852b29), a new AI-powered tool entering beta testing.

The concept is simple: Answer a few questions about your child's needs, interests, and learning style, and SmartPath's AI suggests a curated list of homeschooling resources and options.

While the platform is still in beta (and we're eagerly awaiting our chance to test it), early feedback from parent testers sounds promising:

### (PIC) OF THE DAY

[Hat tip to Jeremy Wayne on X](https://x.com/JeremyTate41/status/1848930215545716911/photo/1?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=061-the-roi-of-personalized-education&_bhlid=9ea717e5f1ad04a8fac469642e3aef4496937f1f)

Pop Quiz! Think eighth grade was easier in 1912? Take a peek at some questions from this graduation exam:

- "Define longitude and latitude and give boundaries of the five zones."
- "Find cost at 12½ cents per sq. yd. of kalsomining the walls of a room 20 ft. long, 16 ft. wide and 9 ft. high, deducting 1 door 8 ft. by 4 ft. 6 in. and 2 windows 5 ft. by 3 ft. 6 in. each."
- "Name and locate these cities: Mobile, Quebec, Buenos Aires, Liverpool, Honolulu." (Without Google Maps!)

And here we were, thinking "kalsomining" was just a typo. It's actually a type of whitewash paint (we had to look it up).



That’s all for today!
