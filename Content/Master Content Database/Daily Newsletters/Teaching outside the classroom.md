## Summary
Meet the mom who went back to school to better support her kids' unique learning needs

## Content

I recently got an email that left me so inspired I asked the sender if I could share it with you. It's the story of an OpenEd parent who never thought she’d homeschool.

She had successfully raised six children through the public school system and was, in her own words, "a great public school mom."

But her family's journey took an unexpected turn when they adopted four children from foster care. They were, as the mom described, "very cute, but very sick."

Traditional schooling wasn't going to cut it. Neither was traditional homeschooling for that matter. These kids needed time to heal, to be kids, to learn at their own pace and in their own way.

So, this mom took a leap of faith and decided to create a more tailored educational experience.

**In the six years that they’ve been with OpenEd, this family has:**

- Traveled to nearly every state in the U.S. (plus the Galapagos Islands)
- Joined a musical theater group that performs for those who can't easily access theater
- Completed a 2-week triathlon challenge as a family in 10 days (riding 124 miles, hiking 26.2 miles, and swimming 2.4 miles)

Three of the four kids are now teens. The oldest graduated high school last year and just got an opportunity to earn a certificate in CNC (computer numerical control) and machine milling.

Of course, it hasn't all been smooth sailing. The mom candidly shared, "It is exhausting. I have never prayed, searched, and planned so hard in my life."

*She even went back to school herself, earning a degree in therapeutic recreation to better support her kids’ needs.*

What struck me most wasn't the list of family adventures (though those are impressive). It was this mom’s openness and commitment to meeting each child where they were, integrating opportunities for healing alongside learning.

"There are very messy, hard days," she wrote, "and very beautiful moments and times in this journey. There are days and weeks where I want to send them all back to public school.”

But, she says, “I'm not willing to give up our freedom and the experiences together to do that.”

### **Your Turn: Share Your "Aha!" Moment**

I’d love to hear your own stories – whether you're in the OpenEd program or not:

- How and when did you realize that the status quo approach to education didn't work for one or more of your kids?
- What challenges did you face?
- How did you pivot?

Share your experiences so we can inspire each other to create the best possible educational experiences for our children.
