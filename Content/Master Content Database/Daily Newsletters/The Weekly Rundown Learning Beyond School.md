## Summary
3 quick tidbits you might have missed this week

## Content

Well, another week has flown by.

I've condensed this week's educational insights into a bite-sized digest to peruse as you transition into weekend mode.

From unexpected homeschooling journeys to Mike Rowe's impassioned plea for Career and Technical Education, it's been quite a ride.

So, grab your beverage of choice, find a comfy spot, and **let's dive into this week’s open education learnings.**

**In this edition:**

- The mom who turned adoption into a globe-trotting educational adventure 🌎
- Mike Rowe's case for embracing the jobs that make civilized life possible 🔧
- The abilities that'll have tech employers sitting up and taking notice (plot twist: coding isn't everything) 💻

#### 🌎 **The Unexpected Worldschooler**

[**Meet the mom who went from self-identified "great public school parent" to open education pioneer**](https://opened.co/daily/%f0%9f%8d%8e-opened-daily-when-someone-asks-if-you-homeschool/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-weekly-rundown). Her journey with four adopted children has included:

- Cross-country adventures (and a field trip to the Galapagos)
- Performances with a community-minded musical theater group
- A family triathlon challenge that puts most of our weekend plans to shame

Our takeaway? The most powerful learning (and the necessary healing) often happens outside the classroom. We invited our readers to share their stories in the hopes of inspiring others. **Reply to this email to share yours!**

#### 🔧** Rethinking "Good Jobs" with Mike Rowe**

Remember the $200k/year pig farmer from "Dirty Jobs"?

Mike Rowe is still making waves, this time advocating for [**Career and Technical Education (CTE)**](https://opened.co/uncategorized/mike-rowes-case-for-career-and-technical-education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-weekly-rundown).

**Here's the short version:**

- ~10 million unfilled jobs in skilled trades and technical fields
- CTE programs offer hands-on experience in high-demand areas
- Think beyond construction & plumbing – we're talking healthcare, IT, and robotics

Rowe's message? It's time to celebrate the essential skills that keep our society running.

#### **💻 Decoding the Tech Industry's Wishlist**

[**On the podcast**](https://opened.co/podcast/%f0%9f%8e%99%ef%b8%8fepisode-003-the-truth-about-tech-careers-in-2024-no-degree-required/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-weekly-rundown), Knowledge Pillars CEO Aaron Osmond gave us the inside scoop on what tech employers are really after:

- Critical thinking skills are the new coding bootcamp
- Real-world problem-solving beats theoretical knowledge
- The ability to work *with* AI is becoming as important as traditional programming (but isn’t making it redundant)

**The bottom line:** Tech careers are evolving, and education needs to keep pace. [**Listen, watch, or read**](https://opened.co/podcast/%f0%9f%8e%99%ef%b8%8fepisode-003-the-truth-about-tech-careers-in-2024-no-degree-required/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-weekly-rundown) the transcript and summary.
