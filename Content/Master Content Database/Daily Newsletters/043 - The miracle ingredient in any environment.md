Mark Hyatt on trust. Plus: the danger of comparisons and sensory processing in neurodivergent kids

💡 THOUGHT
## Trust: The Miracle Ingredient

Our recent episode with Mark Hyatt of Falcon AeroLab seems to have struck a chord, so we wanted to highlight [another potent quotable](https://www.instagram.com/p/DAjTTtevVhu/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=043-the-miracle-ingredient-in-any-environment&_bhlid=ad0c1f75bdd1d853c4abb39ec20731a2e7d531c5) from that conversation:

"Trust is the miracle ingredient... If we don't operate with trust, in an environment of trust, it doesn't work."

- Mark Hyatt

While trust matters everywhere, it matters even more in high-stakes environments like aviation. As a pilot, you're not just making split-second decisions; you're managing emotions, solving problems in real time, and navigating potentially tense situations. You're holding lives in your hands.

In these scenarios, character isn't just important—it's essential. As Mark notes, he has to trust his mechanics, his air traffic controllers, and his instructors. Without this foundation of trust, the whole system falls apart.

But it extends beyond flying. Whether in a steel mill handling dangerous materials or any high-performance team, trust is the cornerstone of excellence. It requires every team member to do their absolute best.

Thanks for the reminder, Mark!

## Keeping Up with the Johnsons

I've lost count of how often I've heard this at our meetups: *"Oh, we're not doing anything special. Not like the Johnson family..."*

Here's the thing: The Johnsons probably said the same thing about you.

I've noticed a trend. The families doing the most innovative, inspiring things often don't realize how amazing they are.

Why? Because to them, it's just Tuesday. It's just what works for their kids.

They don't see that:

- Their creative history project could revolutionize how others teach
- Their unique way of blending online and community classes is groundbreaking
- Their approach to hands-on science experiments is inspiring other families

If you're thoughtfully crafting an education that fits your child, you're doing something extraordinary.

You're pioneering the future of education.

So next time you feel like you're not doing enough, remember that your "normal" might be someone else's breakthrough.

## Tl;dr - The World of Sensory Processing

Ever wonder why some kids struggle with loud noises or can't sit still? According to [a free training](https://sarahshotts.substack.com/p/sensory?r=7cpjq&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true&_bhlid=cda61954101ee31edf6458f5c6c23d48cbeed040) by educator Sarah Shotts, the answer might lie in sensory processing. "Neurodivergent brains are conscious of more sensory input,” says Shotts. “This can be a strength, but without supports, it can make everyday tasks difficult or even painful."

Here’s the tl;dr:

- Sensory processing involves 8 senses, including the often-overlooked vestibular (balance) and proprioceptive (body awareness) senses
- Neurodivergent brains process sensory input differently, leading to over- or under-responsiveness to various stimuli
- Meltdowns and shutdowns are often the result of cumulative sensory overload, not a single triggering event

That’s all for today!
