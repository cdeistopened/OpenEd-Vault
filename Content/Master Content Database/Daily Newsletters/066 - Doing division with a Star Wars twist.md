## Summary
How Charlynn Chambers uses real-world interests to teach math; plus the benefits of year-round learning

## Content

‍**💡 THOUGHT**
## **Real Life = Education. Education = Real Life.**

OpenEd parent ambassador Charlynn Chambers didn't set out to revolutionize education. But somewhere between the pandemic and pancakes, she stumbled upon a profound truth: **education isn't separate from real life.**

For her children, traditional schooling had been a struggle. Sitting still, focusing on worksheets, and regurgitating facts for tests seemed to dim their natural curiosity. At home, though, a different story unfolded.

Charlynn found learning opportunities everywhere. Division wasn't just numbers on a page; it was splitting up Stormtrooper armies in Star Wars scenarios. Fractions weren't abstract concepts; they were measurements in a favorite recipe. Leadership wasn't a buzzword; it was taking charge of making breakfast for the family.***‍***

***How to Transform Everyday Moments into Powerful Learning Experiences - Ep. 16 with Charlynn Chambers ***

"Education isn't about being able to just score all the right things on all the right tests," Charlynn realized. "It's about really being more of a whole individual."

📊 TREND
## **The case for year-round schooling**

Ask most kids about the idea of year-round schooling, and you'll likely be met with wide-eyed horror. It seems to violate a sacred rite of childhood: the long, lazy days of summer.

But when every day of learning is an adventure, the idea of year-round school doesn’t sound so bad anymore. Charlynn practices year-round schooling as a way to cultivate "an attitude of continuous learning."

“If we live intentionally, there's so much more to be learned while doing the same everyday activities,” she says.

It also relaxes some of the pressure to cram as much into each day.

What’s your rhythm? Do you take certain months off altogether, or does the learning never stop?


🛠️ TOOL
## **5 tips from Parent Ambassador Charlynn Chambers**

We get it. Not everyone has time to listen to a full podcast. Here are 5 practical takeaways from [the latest episode](https://youtu.be/B-QhN5mf2cQ?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=066-doing-division-with-a-star-wars-twist&_bhlid=55c1c6502673523fb70aee1e1a0ed01ca49e9412):

1. **Subject-Specific Game Containers:** "We have little containers for each subject. If we need to fall back on it, I can say 'go pick something out of the math container to do, go pick something out of language arts.'"
2. **Morning Basket and Menu:** "We do a morning basket and menu with certain things we want to cover daily."
3. **Interest-Based Math Problems:** "When my son and I were first getting into division... I was giving him questions about like, if we had 10 stormtroopers and we needed to have two armies, then how many stormtroopers would be in each army?"
4. **Real-Life Application Lessons:** "Today we made pancakes. I told the kids we didn't really have time, so if we were going to do it, it had to be part of school. My son practiced leadership skills by being in charge and giving directions to his sisters."
5. **Educational Technology Mix:** "We use online resources like [Math Basecamp](https://www.legendsoflearning.com/math-basecamp/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=066-doing-division-with-a-star-wars-twist&_bhlid=2c32fac15aead74f17dcca24dc165e93207cf0ed), [Education.com](https://Education.com?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=066-doing-division-with-a-star-wars-twist&_bhlid=f8f8589e939d7a643b51533ada580514a3e3a872), and [Reading Eggs](https://readingeggs.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=066-doing-division-with-a-star-wars-twist&_bhlid=b3815385f1829aa85d20f331a5ae6ee76a7c3ec8). Having educational games and activities readily available is helpful for days when our usual plans get derailed."

**(WORD) OF THE DAY**
## **Neuroplasticity (noor-oh-pla-STIS-i-tee)**

**Neuroplasticity** is the brain's ability to form new neural connections and reorganize itself, especially in response to learning or experience.

The term borrows from the concept of plasticity in materials science. Plastic is malleable because its molecular chains can slide past each other when force is applied, allowing it to change shape without breaking.

Your brain is even more adaptable than plastic! Unlike physical materials, the brain can:

1. Create entirely new connections (synapses) between neurons
2. Strengthen or weaken existing connections based on use
3. Repurpose areas for new functions, especially after injury



That’s all for today!
