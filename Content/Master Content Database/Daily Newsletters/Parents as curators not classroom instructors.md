### 💡 1 THOUGHT

## **FROM CHAOS TO CONTROL**

"I am not gonna let eight-year-olds run me out of town. This is ridiculous."

After a disastrous first year teaching 36 of Baltimore's most challenging second-graders, [**Michelle Rhee faced a choice**](https://opened.co/blog/what-to-do-when-your-students-dont-respect-you-michelle-rhees-story?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=parents-as-curators-not-classroom-instructors): quit or transform. Instead of giving up, the future DC Schools Chancellor spent her entire summer planning. She partnered with another teacher. The next year, they combined their 60 students and played to their strengths—one taught reading, the other math.

The results? Students who started at the 13th percentile reached grade level in two years.

**The lesson for every overwhelmed parent-educator:** When you've lost control of your ‘classroom,’ don't go it alone. Find your teaching partner (whether that's another parent, online resources, or a co-op). Lean into your strengths. And remember—real transformation takes time.

### 📊 2 TRENDS

**1. WHAT DO YOU CALL THE NEW HOMESCHOOLING?** - [**Leo Linbeck III says we need to retire the term "homeschooling."**](https://leo3linbeck.substack.com/p/the-artists-formerly-known-as-homeschooler?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=parents-as-curators-not-classroom-instructors) Today's parents mostly aren't teaching at kitchen tables—they're curating from Khan Academy, microschools, online academies, and local co-ops. He calls it "Parent-Curated Education." We call it [**Open Education**](https://opened.co/book?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=parents-as-curators-not-classroom-instructors). Whatever the name, the shift is real: parents as educational architects, not classroom instructors.

**2. MICHELLE RHEE SEES A "PERFECT STORM" FOR ED TECH** - The former DC Schools Chancellor turned venture capitalist is betting big on VR and AI. "I started asking parents about VR," Rhee [**shared on our latest episode**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPt2M3AuRHM&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=parents-as-curators-not-classroom-instructors). "Every single parent said either 'Yes, they have a headset' or 'They're bugging the crap out of me for one.'"

Combined with AI's rapid advancement, Rhee believes we're approaching what she calls "the perfect storm" for education transformation. After years of cynicism about education reform, she's found renewed optimism: "Every day I meet with founders who feel like they are going to change the world through what they're building."
