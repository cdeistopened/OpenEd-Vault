## **The Power of 'Yes, And'**

Stop picking sides. Start picking what works. That's open education.
📊 TREND
## **Breaking Down Education Walls**

OpenEd has long championed flexible education, with students mixing home-based learning, community classes, and public school courses. Now, with [**Utah's new education funding program**](https://yeseverykidfoundation.org/why-public-schools-should-love-esas/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=095-the-power-of-yes-and), more public schools are embracing this approach.

Case in point: Canyons School District just announced they're opening their doors wider for part-time students. Want to take just engineering? Done. Need access to the robotics lab? No problem. Looking for marching band or sports? Come on in.

## **Growing Readers Naturally**

The conventional approach says: First, learn to read, then read to learn.

The alternative path says: Fall in love with stories first. The skills will follow.

### (CORRECTION) OF THE DAY

**Two quick fixes from yesterday's newsletter:**

1. [**Infinite Mind**](https://infinitemind.io/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=095-the-power-of-yes-and) is actually a free app (not $199 as we stated). It's available at no cost in both Apple and Android app stores.
2. Utah families: The link to express interest in Falcon AeroLab's summer aerospace camp was temporarily disabled. You can express your interest [**here**](https://forms.gle/BMKoQhE83RwitPVm8?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=095-the-power-of-yes-and). We apologize for any confusion!

That’s all for today!
