💡 THOUGHT
## **Yes, you are qualified to teach your kids**

Homeschooling dad M.A. Franklin has a good reminder not to let anyone make you feel inadequate about your ability to teach your children.

His insight touches on something we see often at OpenEd: Parents doubting their ability to guide their children's education, despite having unique insights into how their kids learn best.

Here's what we know from thousands of families:

- The most important qualification is caring deeply about your child's development
- Enthusiasm for learning is contagious
- You don't need to know everything - you just need to know how to find resources

The question isn't whether you're qualified. It's about finding the right mix of tools and approaches that work for your family.

## **Career-Connected Learning (the numbers don't lie)**

[**A program in Guilford County, NC is showing**](https://www.the74million.org/article/connecting-learning-and-careers-to-build-the-workforce-of-tomorrow/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=070-yes-you-re-qualified-to-teach-your-kids) what's possible when we break down walls between education and real-world experience. Their "Signature Career Academies" let students earn industry credentials while still in high school. The results:

- 2020-21: 2,966 credentials earned
- 2021-22: 7,118 credentials earned
- 2022-23: 10,766 credentials earned

At the same time, the district's graduation rate hit 92.2% – an all-time high.

Why? Because when learning feels relevant, students show up. When students see the direct connection between their education and their future, they engage.
