## Summary
Why parents choose the wrong school (it's not about the kids). PLUS: AI forces the education question no one wants to answer.

## Content

Greetings!

Today we unpack Matt’s recent [conversation with SmartPath co-founders Robert Gamble and Jonathan Chizick](https://youtu.be/fuydqbIVXZs?si=64FcV1PFH0hNyoeW). Why do smart parents make educational choices based on fear - even when they know it's not working? How is AI forcing parents to confront uncomfortable questions about the educational status quo? And what simple first steps can families take toward change?

Let's dive in.

**THOUGHT**: The Confidence Transfer
‍**TREND**: AI as the Great Clarifier
‍**TOOL**: SmartPath.School

# The Confidence Transfer

Parents don't always choose a particular form of schooling because it's best for their kids.

Sometimes they choose what feels safest for themselves.

"The natural parenting instinct is [to think], ‘We're never quite measuring up to the Joneses next door,’" Matt observed [on the SmartPath podcast](https://youtu.be/fuydqbIVXZs?si=Ieqn_fa6OPn6FUJW).

"Every parent has insecurity around that comparison that by default, but no one criticizes you for just dropping your kids off at your local school."

Instead of building confidence in their ability to guide their child's education, parents transfer that confidence to an institution. The school becomes the expert, and the parent becomes the chauffeur.

# AI: The Great Clarifier

Beyond just changing how kids learn, AI is also exposing what traditional education actually produces.

"AI is making parents feel uncomfortable about just defaulting to a traditional education," Matt explained.

“They’re terrified, not knowing where their kid is going to be able to apply test prep skills."

If AI can handle the main output of twelve years of schooling (test-taking, essay completion, standardized responses), then what exactly has the system been teaching?

Meanwhile, Matt's [Young Entrepreneur Award](https://www.yea.education/) finalist was a 14-year-old running an AI consulting company for local small businesses. His developer was 12.

**Think about this:** There are more AI native 14-year-olds with consulting businesses than there are AI native consultants at McKinsey.

# SmartPath.School

The biggest barrier to alternative education in 2025 is no longer finding resources - it's navigating the overwhelming number of options.

[SmartPath](https://smartpath.school/) solves the "restaurant menu problem." You know the feeling: you open a menu with 300 items and suddenly want to eat somewhere else. Choice paralysis is real, especially when the choice affects your child's future.

SmartPath's [free "Matcher" tool](https://smartpath.school/homeschool-curriculum-matcher) helps families map their specific needs to the right resources from a database of thousands of curricula. In just a few minutes, you get a curated path based on your child's learning style, your family's values, and your practical constraints.

# Got a minute?

We want to know more about **your **approach to education. [This survey takes less than a minute](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdCO-iIqRBpGvvsDZi2lFhQNKUP2ymOCaa4dPd2mHTealXgXw/viewform)! It's just 3 questions:

1. How long have you been homeschooling (if applicable)?
2. What terms do you use when talking about your child's education?
3. What homeschooling styles or approaches do you identify with?

[Take the survey here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdCO-iIqRBpGvvsDZi2lFhQNKUP2ymOCaa4dPd2mHTealXgXw/viewform).
