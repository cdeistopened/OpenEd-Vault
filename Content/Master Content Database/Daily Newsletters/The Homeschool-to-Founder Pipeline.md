Let's dive in, shall we?

### 🎙️** ICYMI… Why AI won't replace humans in tech (podcast recap)**

[**In the latest podcast**](https://opened.co/podcast/%f0%9f%8e%99%ef%b8%8fepisode-003-the-truth-about-tech-careers-in-2024-no-degree-required/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday), Isaac chats with Aaron Osmond, CEO of [**Knowledge Pillars**](https://knowledge-pillars.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday), about the future of tech careers and why AI won't make human skills obsolete.

**Here are 3 things you need to know:**
**1/ AI is a tool, not a replacement for human skills.**
While AI makes things happen faster and more efficiently, it doesn't solve every problem. Aaron emphasizes that understanding how to leverage AI effectively is becoming a crucial skill in itself.
**2/ Problem-solving and critical thinking are more important than ever.**
The tech industry doesn't just need coders; it needs people who can think critically about how to apply tools to solve real-world problems.

"If you don't learn problem-solving and critical thinking skills, you will not be successful in any career, regardless of whatever tool you want to use."

Aaron Osmond
**3/ Employers want hands-on, practical experience.**
Forget multiple-choice tests about coding theory. The most valuable certifications put you in the driver's seat, coding in real time and solving actual problems.

### 🚸** LiberatED edupreneurs**

One of our favorite podcasts (besides our own, of course) is [**LiberatED**](https://www.liberatedpodcast.com/podcast?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday), hosted by Kerry McDonald of the Foundation for Economic Education.

[**Note**: To those who might accuse OpenEd of jumping on the "-ED" bandwagon, we can only say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery – and that great minds think alike.]

Each episode features inspiring conversations with microschool founders and other “edupreneurs.” This week, we're highlighting a guest who embodies OpenEd's mission.

**Meet Nasiyah Isra-Ul: **homeschool graduate, education advocate, and founder of [**Homeschool EmpowerED**](https://www.homeschoolempowered.org/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday) (yes, there's that "-ED" again!) – all before 25. Her journey from creating curricula for her brother at 14 to serving 1,100+ families showcases the power of unconventional education in fostering entrepreneurship.

"I wouldn't have had the time to focus on entrepreneurship, learn about innovation, and start working as an online tutor at 14 if I hadn't been homeschooled.”

Nasiyah Isra-Ul

Here’s her advice for empowering young entrepreneurs:

1. **"Find your people":** Build a supportive community that believes in your vision from the start. Look beyond traditional networks to find mentors, collaborators, and supporters who share your passion.
2. **"Work on your pitch"**: Clearly communicate your ideas to gain support and resources.
3. **"Embrace being unique"**: See your youth and perspective as assets, not liabilities. Your fresh viewpoint and digital-native skills can be powerful advantages in solving problems.

Listen to the full episode [**here**](https://www.liberatedpodcast.com/podcast/episode/1a14007f/youth-entrepreneurship-and-empowerment-with-nasiyah-isra-ul?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday) and check out the trailer for Nasiyah’s new documentary about homeschool life in Virginia.

### 📉** Quick Bite: 5 Ways Audiobooks Boost Kids' Learning**

[**A recent article from *The 74* highlights how audiobooks can be a powerful alternative to screen time**](https://www.the74million.org/article/want-to-spur-your-childs-intellectual-development-use-audiobooks-instead-of-videos/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday) for nurturing your child's intellectual growth.

Here are five ways they enhance learning:

1. **Spark imagination:** Unlike videos, audiobooks encourage kids to visualize stories, training their "mind's eye" and boosting problem-solving skills.
2. **Sharpen listening:** Active listening to audiobooks improves focus and concentration.
3. **Expand vocabulary:** Exposure to rich, varied language in context helps children learn new words and proper pronunciation.
4. **Foster independence:** Following complex narratives and making connections promotes self-directed learning and improves study skills.
5. **Protect eyesight:** By eliminating screens, audiobooks give children's eyes a much-needed break, potentially reducing vision problems.

**Bonus tip:** Audiobooks are great for car rides, bedtime routines, or engaging reluctant readers. Many are available for free through local libraries or apps like [**LibriVox**](https://librivox.org/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday).

That's all for this edition.
