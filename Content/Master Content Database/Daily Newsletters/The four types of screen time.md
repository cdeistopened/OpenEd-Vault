### 💡 1 THOUGHT

We highlight a variety of perspectives on screen time, and don’t take sides on the issue. But there’s a lot of wisdom in [**Jeremy Kauffman’s breakdown**](https://x.com/jeremykauffman/status/1903821170970919094?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1903821170970919094%7Ctwgr%5E1621c8292cce00839c89a25b23948f5eeedf4b09%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fopen-ed%2FOpenEd-Daily-12362bf05db941c8bdfa2286401c7fef%3Fp%3D210afe52ef5980dfa719f43577ae1b36pm%3Ds&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-four-types-of-screen-time) into four distinct categories, along two axes: **engaged vs. passive**; **educational vs. non-educational**.

### 📊 2 TRENDS

**1. **[**Standardized Tests Strike Back**](https://www.dailysignal.com/2025/04/14/the-standardized-testing-pendulum-swings-back/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-four-types-of-screen-time)** - **After a pause during the pandemic, elite universities like Harvard, MIT, Brown, and Johns Hopkins are reinstating SAT/ACT requirements.
