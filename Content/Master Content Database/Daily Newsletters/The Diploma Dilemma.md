## Summary
One parent's worry about straying from the traditional path. PLUS: When employers don't understand homeschooling (and how one grad proved them wrong).

## Content

Greetings!

A few months ago, an OpenEd parent reached out with a familiar dilemma. [Her student had done 9th grade on the diploma path, but she was switching to non-diploma-seeking status for more flexibility](https://opened.co/blog/to-diploma-or-not-to-diploma).

Yet she had still had some concerns. "I worry a lot about not following the traditional, earn a diploma and go to college path."

Society has pushed one linear path for so long: diploma → college → job → success.

Except that path is just one among many. This week, we came across a story that helps clarify the "diploma vs. no diploma" question.

Let's dive in.

**THOUGHT: **Education as a Canvas, Not a Checklist**

TOOL: **How to Create a Valid Diploma

# Education as a Canvas, Not a Checklist

Here's what we've been told: Follow the traditional path or risk your child's future. Get the diploma. Check the box. Move to the next checkpoint.

But [sometimes seeking a diploma imposes limits that exceed its value](https://opened.co/blog/to-diploma-or-not-to-diploma).

What's more, the definition of a "traditional path" is becoming more and more slippery. Colleges and employers care more about demonstrated skills, portfolios of work, and real-world experience.

A diploma proves you can complete requirements. A portfolio proves you can do something useful. Approach education as a canvas for growth, not a checklist of requirements.

# When Employers Don't  Understand Homeschooling

James Isabele Jr. began working in manufacturing shortly after graduating high school. 15 years later, he had certifications in inventory management, shipping and receiving, and forklift operation—everything required for a new job opportunity that came up. The interviewer loved his experience and everything seemed to be going well... until they asked for his "state-issued homeschool diploma."

[James called the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), which sent a letter to the company noting that there's no such thing as a "state-issued homeschool diploma" in most states](https://hslda.org/post/employer-asks-homeschool-grad-for-state-issued-diploma-it-doesn-t-exist). Instead, *parents* are empowered to issue diplomas.

Lucky for James, his mom had kept records and documented his entire high school program. Shortly after receiving HSLDA's letter with those documents attached, James got the job.

**The lesson**: Keep records. Keep transcripts. Even if your teen isn't going for a diploma now, these might come in handy!

# How to Create a Valid Diploma

If you wish to issue a diploma yourself, here are some options:

**Quick DIY**: Canva (search "homeschool diploma"), Google Docs templates, Twinkl

**Professional print**: [HomeschoolDiploma.com](http://homeschooldiploma.com/) (starts at $34.99), DiplomaPrints

**What to include**: School name, student's full name, graduation statement & date, parent signatures, optional seal

**California note**: Most CA homeschoolers use a Private School Affidavit (PSA)—you're legally a private school and can issue diplomas.

**Need a notary?** Generally no. Transcripts and signatures matter more.

# WORD OF THE DAY

**Credentialism** (noun): The practice of overemphasizing credentials—especially academic degrees—in hiring and admissions, often at the expense of practical skills or real-world experience.

**Example**: "James had 15 years of proven manufacturing experience, but credentialism nearly cost him the job when compliance fixated on a diploma that doesn't exist."
