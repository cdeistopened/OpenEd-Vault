**IN THIS EDITION**

🍎 From career-ending tremor to creative triumph.
🍎 Montessori: Fad, philosophy, or free-for-all?
🍎 Homeschooling's surprising surge: a deeper look.

### 💡 1 THOUGHT

Phil Hansen’s hand shook. Badly.

For a pointillist—an artist of tiny dots—it was over. Years of dedication, gone. He quit.

But the itch to create stayed. So he came back. This time, he let the tremor lead.

The art wasn't what he planned, but it was *his*. Born from the shake.

He found freedom in his biggest limit.

*Watch Phil Hansen's TED Talk, "*[***Embrace the Shake***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrZTho_o_is&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=his-tremor-tanked-his-art-then-it-made-him)*"*

We all have our tremors. Our 'fatal flaws.' What if we let them lead?

### 📊 2 TRENDS

**1. Montessori: What's In A Name?** Once a buzzword, now a question mark for some. A major Montessori-inspired chain is shrinking. Is it the economy? Charter school competition? Or that "Montessori" isn't trademarked, meaning quality can be a crapshoot? EdSurge asks: [**Is the Montessori magic fading?**](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2025-06-09-montessori-schools-are-hot-until-they-re-not-what-does-that-mean-about-education?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=his-tremor-tanked-his-art-then-it-made-him).

**2. The Real Reason Some Families Homeschool.** It's not always about curriculum choice. For a growing number of parents, especially those with kids needing special accommodations, homeschooling is a lifeline to tailored support that traditional schools can’t provide. So, parents build their own systems—microschools are booming.
