### 💡 THOUGHT

## **EARN THE PRIVILEGE**

"I actually see more parents create entitled children," says homeschooling coach Meg Thomas, mother of seven. "Parents give their kids all of these liberties... without having to work for it."

The 12-year-old who gets a phone "just because" learns a dangerous lesson: *I deserve things without effort.*

Coach Meg’s approach? Make privileges contingent on responsibility. If your 13-year-old wants mall privileges without adult supervision, work with them master necessary skills—like tracking spending and demonstrating trustworthiness.

While younger children benefit from instant gratification (clean room, then toys), teenagers (and adults, ahem) need to understand *delayed *gratification.

### 📊 TREND

## **THINKING BEYOND THE GPA**

Forget GPAs. A new USC study found that "transcendent thinking"—the ability to connect personal experiences to bigger ideas—predicts teen brain development and future happiness, regardless of IQ or socioeconomic status.

"You have to go through the work of growing yourself," says researcher Mary Helen Immordino-Yang. Teens who showed more of this thinking had more brain growth over two years, which led directly to greater life satisfaction.

The kicker? Our current educational system "actually punish[es]" this kind of deep, questioning thinking in favor of "unquestioning compliance."

### 🔨 TOOL

## **THE PRIVILEGE CONTRACT**

Transform Meg Thomas's approach into action with a simple Privilege Contract system:

**For younger kids (5-10):** Instant trades

- Clean room → Screen time
- Finish homework → Park visit
- Help with dishes → Choose dessert

**For tweens/teens (11+):** Earned privileges

- Phone = Demonstrate responsible communication for 3 months
- Mall trips alone = Master budget tracking + safety protocols
- Later bedtime = Consistent morning responsibility

**The key:** "I want you to win," Meg emphasizes. Work together to identify skills they need to master, then celebrate when they achieve independence through effort.

That’s all for today!
