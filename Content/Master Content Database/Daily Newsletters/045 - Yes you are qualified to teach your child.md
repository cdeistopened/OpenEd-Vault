💡 THOUGHT

## **"Why don’t I feel qualified to teach my child?"**

*You're more qualified than you think.*

Your job isn't to be an expert in every subject. It’s to curate experiences and create an environment where learning can flourish. You're already doing that every day.

Humans are naturally curious. Your child doesn't need you to impart everything from your brain to theirs. They're learning because that's what humans do. Your role is to be a curator, protector, and guide.

Resources are nearly endless - from online platforms to books to community-based learning. Your job is twofold:

1. find the right resources for your child
2. remove the roadblocks to their natural curiosity.

Relax, and trust in your child's innate desire to learn.

## **“Can Homeschoolers Go to College?”**

**Fun story:** I don't have a high school diploma. I never took the ACT or SAT. Yet I have an associate's, bachelor's, and master's degree.

I started at a community college in high school (they didn't care about diplomas) and transferred those credits to a four-year college, which also didn’t care about a diploma because I already had college credits.

So, can homeschoolers go to college? **Absolutely.**

Will they be limited in their future? **Not at all.**

Now, pretty much every college has a homeschool pathway for applications. Don’t just take my word for it – [**a 2015 article in Business Insider calls homeschooling the “New Path to Harvard”**](https://www.businessinsider.com/homeschooling-is-the-new-path-to-harvard-2015-9?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=045-yes-you-are-qualified-to-teach-your-child) (yes, that Harvard). Colleges value self-directed learners over applicants who wait to be told what to do.
