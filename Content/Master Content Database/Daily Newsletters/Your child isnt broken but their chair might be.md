💡 THOUGHT

## **EDUCATIONAL EXODUS**

[**Alternative education podcaster Kerry McDonald recently joined the Hannah Frankman Podcast to talk about unexpectedly large decline in public school enrollment**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXuzYFenDGU&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=your-child-isn-t-broken-but-their-chair-might-be):

"We knew there would be a dip in enrollment," notes McDonald, citing the decline in birth rates, "but that dip has been far deeper than expected because families are choosing alternatives."

Nearly 6% of U.S. students now homeschool—matching public charter school attendance—while new categories like microschooling and open education are growing even faster.

"Parents are fed up with one-size-fits-all education," McDonald explains. "They want something responsive to individual needs and aligned with their values."

Thankfully, a growing number of public schools are also adapting and embracing the open education model of flexible, hybrid, customized options.
