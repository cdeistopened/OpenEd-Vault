### 💡 1 THOUGHT

## **CORRECTION**

**"I never let my schooling interfere with my education."**

– *Not actually Mark Twain.*

Well, shoot. We shared this quote misattributed to Mark Twain last week. But according to the meticulous sleuths at [**Quote Investigator**](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/09/25/schooling-vs-education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=mark-twain-summer-reading-edition), the real credit likely belongs to Grant Allen, a Canadian science writer who was railing against rote schooling in the 1890s. Did Twain ever echo this powerful sentiment?

The debate is murky. Some say he advised a friend with a young son, “*Don’t let his schooling interfere with his education,”* but we can’t find any hard evidence or primary source (if you can, we’ll send you a free Ed the Horse t-shirt).

Does it actually matter who said it? The words are no less powerful. And while we aren’t any less likely to pick up a Mark Twain book for summer reading, we *are *more likely to look into this Grant Allen character.

### 📊 2 TRENDS

[**School Districts Ban Deepfake Creation**](https://www.wmur.com/article/bedford-schools-ban-deepfakes-52825/64908792?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** **-** **Speaking of convincing fakes: Bedford, New Hampshire joins a growing list of school districts prohibiting students from making or sharing AI-manipulated images, with punishments up to suspension or police action. While the trend itself is worrisome, the strict legal enforcement and “zero tolereance” also raises some questions about the appropriate punishments for what in some cases might amount to a youthful indiscretion.

[***Why “Sit Still and Pay Attention” Doesn’t Work***](https://lauragraceweldon.com/2024/05/05/why-sit-still-and-pay-attention-doesnt-work/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=mark-twain-summer-reading-edition) - Laura Grace Weldon reminds us that kids learn better when they have ample time for movement. From crawling to cartwheeling, the body teaches the brain what to do. Grant Allen would approve. So would Tom Sawyer, we suspect.
