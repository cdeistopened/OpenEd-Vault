💡 THOUGHT
## My son's sandwich business taught him more than a semester of economics

My 10-year-old wanted to sell gourmet sandwiches. 4 weeks later, he shut it down.

Here's what happened in between:

- **Week 1:** Sold out. "They only bought them because I'm cute." **Lesson: **Novelty isn't a sustainable business model.
- **Week 2: **Sent surveys and customized orders. **Lesson: **Market research matters.
- **Week 3: **"They want more meat, not fancy meat." **Lesson:** Your taste isn't always the market's taste.
- **Week 4:** Added chips and drinks. "The margin is way better!" **Lesson:** Diversify your offerings.

**Final decision:** "To make real money, I'd have to make sandwiches I wouldn't eat myself." **Lesson: **Know when to pivot or quit.

**Bonus lesson:** He learned his values. Quality over profit.

No textbook teaches this. Only experience does.

What real-world "classes" could your kids be taking?

## Brave New Words: Will AI Revolutionize Education?

The word “revolution” gets thrown around a lot. In a recent interview with Bill Gates, Sal Khan (yes, that Khan from Khan Academy) says the AI revolution is already here:

"I think we're going to see it next year; while the teacher is lecturing or whatever they're doing, if you're confused by something they just said, you just ask the bot in real time. It's like whispering to your friend without disrupting the classroom."

– Salman Khan

In the future (soon), Khan envisions parents and teachers as the architects of learning while AI acts as a powerful tool or assistant. In fact, this vision is already a reality. Khan recently demoed a new AI model, helping him guide his son through a tricky trigonometry problem.***‍***

***GPT-4o (Omni) Human interaction demo w/ Sal Khan ***

We’re still working our way through Khan’s new book, [*Brave New Words: How AI Will Revolutionize Education*](https://www.amazon.com/Brave-New-Words-Revolutionize-Education/dp/0593656954?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=033-thought-trend-tool-tl-dr-tuesday-edition&_bhlid=9ff518998154f65c6739d1b19c9ec90ef5d286f6), but as soon as we finish, you’ll be the first to get the tl;dr.

## 25 ways to socialize kids outside of school

[Grace Smith at Renegade Educator](https://renegadeeducator.com/25-ways-to-socialize-kids-outside-of-public-school/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=033-thought-trend-tool-tl-dr-tuesday-edition&_bhlid=5d046b089bd94a7cc461a19910545d295b200fbd) posted a great list of programs and activities where young people can connect with peers outside the confines of the classroom walls:

- Sports
- Community classes
- Boy Scouts/Girl Scouts
- Community service projects
- Summer camps
- Classes at local parks
- Recreational centers
- Library activities

- Choir/band
- Start a social group
- Internships
- Apprenticeships
- Shadowing professionals
- Swimming pool
- Art/pottery classes
- Forest School/Our Outdoors

- Community theater
- Nationality/religious groups
- Odyssey of the Mind
- Dual enrollment at local school
- Online classes and clubs
- Discord servers
- 4-H
- ESL conversation groups
- Creative, niche activities

Our personal favorite? 'Creative, niche activities.' Because nothing says 'well-adjusted' like a teen who's a champion pickleball player and part-time yodeler.

### (MEME) OF THE DAY

Remember, whether it's education or art, AI is here to assist, not replace. We'll start worrying about the AI takeover when it learns to draw hands without extra fingers.



See you tomorrow!
