### 💡 THOUGHT

## **BEYOND THE LABELS**

Ever notice how education discussions can devolve into philosophical cage matches?

"I'm a classical homeschooler."

"Well, I'm Montessori all the way."

"That's cute. We're unschoolers." [*Chairs start flying*]

Open education takes a radically reasonable approach: it means choosing from all available options to create a unique experience for every student.

Public school band program? Grab it. Khan Academy physics? Snag it. Private school debate team? Add it. Uncle Bob's welding lessons? Why not!

No labels. No tribal allegiances. No philosophical purity tests.

Just one question: What helps YOUR unique child thrive right now?

Your child doesn't fit in a box. Why should their education?

### 📊 TREND

## **THE ALGORITHM LOVES US (AND SO DO ACTUAL HUMANS)**

The numbers are in: *Open Education* hit #1 in TWO Amazon categories within 6 hours of launching.

What categories, you ask? Oh, just little ones like "Homeschooling.”

But this movement goes way beyond homeschooling. What's driving this groundswell? Parents are realizing:

1️⃣ The standardized education system was designed in the 1800s for factory workers (and it shows)
2️⃣ Your child isn't an assembly line product with a manufacturing defect
3️⃣ Educational resources have never been more accessible
4️⃣ Success paths have multiplied exponentially

[**Matt Bowman put it perfectly in yesterday's launch Q&A:**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DliJ_5mBPg&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=1-bestseller) "If our children needed something different, how in the world does a system try to educate every child the same?"

The message is resonating from public school parents to unschoolers and everyone in between. What unites them all? The recognition that education works best when it adapts to the child, not vice versa.

### 🔨 TOOL

## **YOUR FREE OPEN EDUCATION TOOLKIT**

Because hitting #1 deserves a proper celebration, we're giving away our 12-page Open Education Toolkit to everyone.

[*Download the toolkit*](https://45961901.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/45961901/Open%20Education%20Toolkit%20(Bonuses).pdf?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=1-bestseller)

This isn't some fluffy "10 educational philosophies explained" pamphlet. It's a hands-on workbook with practical tools you can start implementing *today *(even if you haven’t read the book yet):

- The Sticky Notes Exercise that makes parents say, "I had no idea my kid was interested in THAT"
- Needs Mapping Guide
- Resource Analysis (leveraging what you already have)
- Learner-Driven Sprints (creating momentum without burnout)

[Download the toolkit](https://45961901.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/45961901/Open%20Education%20Toolkit%20(Bonuses).pdf?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=1-bestseller)

That’s all for today!
