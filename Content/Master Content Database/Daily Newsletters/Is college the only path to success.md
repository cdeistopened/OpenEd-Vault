### 💡 DEEP DIVE

## DEAD-END OR DO-OVER?

Remember when the path to a "good job" felt like a straight line? High school, then college, then career. Simple. But the map is being redrawn.

This week, we saw a convergence of ideas challenging that old linear model, urging us to embrace a more dynamic, personalized, and, frankly, more interesting approach to what comes after high school.

The whispers are growing louder: is a four-year degree always the golden ticket? [**Only 58% of high schoolers believing a good job *requires* one**](https://katv.com/news/nation-world/us-high-schoolers-see-less-value-in-college-degrees-survey-shows?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=is-college-the-only-path-to-success). Some teens are prioritizing on-the-job training and certifications. And who can blame them when we see headlines like [***The Wall Street Journal*'s "High Schoolers Landing $70,000 Jobs"**](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/skilled-trades-high-school-recruitment-fd9f8257?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=is-college-the-only-path-to-success)? Companies facing skilled labor shortages are increasingly looking to diligent, hardworking high schoolers to fill well-paying roles.

This new landscape calls for a new mindset. As Rose Ybaben—founder of [**Soaring2College**](https://soaring2college.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=is-college-the-only-path-to-success) and career planning expert for teens—beautifully [**put it in our recent podcast**](https://opened.co/blog/college-and-career-advice-for-teens-with-rose-ybaben-and-danielle-rose?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=is-college-the-only-path-to-success), we need to start celebrating the dead ends.

The end of the linear path often means meandering your way to a fulfilling career. In this framework, learning what you *don't* want to do feels less like failure and more like data collection. Each "no" refines the search, steering young people (and, let's be honest, many adults too!) towards paths that genuinely fit. Education isn't about following a predetermined path—it's about discovering your own.

When OpenEd’s VP of Learning Andrea Fife says, “Adulthood is just one do-over after another,” she means that as a *positive*; something for teens *to look forward to*.

We need to be reminded that detours aren't failures but opportunities for clarity. The most fulfilling careers often emerge from the courage to explore unconventional routes.

This is just as true for the teen who opts for college: just because you pick a certain school or decide on a major doesn’t mean you can’t change course.

#### **So how do we prepare younger children for this more dynamic, exploratory world? The answer might be counterintuitive: step back and do less.**

Abigail Weidmer, a homeschool mom from Montana, [**discovered this truth after a year of overwhelming herself**](https://letgrow.org/free-play-fridays-weidmer/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=my-kids-learned-more-when-i-backed-off) trying to teach her kindergartener everything from emotional health to financial literacy. When she found her daughter spontaneously creating museums and teaching her younger brother about ocean zones during free play, Weidmer realized:

***"My kids actually learned more when I did less."***

This insight led her to embrace Let Grow's [**"Free Play Friday"**](https://letgrow.org/program/anxious-generation/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=is-college-the-only-path-to-success#:~:text=TO%20THERAPY%20PAGE-,FREE%20PLAY%20FRIDAYS,-Every%20Friday%20from) concept—a weekly gathering where neighborhood kids play without adult interference. The results? Her clingy kindergarten son began engaging socially. Her daughter launched her own after-school art class. The kids resolved their own disputes and developed creative solutions to challenges.

How does this connect to career exploration?

When we step back and allow for self-directed discovery—whether it's a 7-year-old designing rockets or a 17-year-old trying different internships—we provide the space for learning and purpose to emerge.

The challenge, then, is to equip ourselves and our children with the tools and mindset to navigate this more complex, but ultimately more rewarding, terrain. It means celebrating the dead ends along with the wins, recognizing that learning happens everywhere, and being open to the idea that "success" takes many forms.

### **What This Means for Your Weekend**

- **Discuss a "Dead End":** Share a story with your teen about a time you pursued something that didn't work out. What did you learn from that "dead end"? How did it redirect you?
- **Explore Career Tools:** Pick one of the career assessment tools from our list this week (like[** CareerOneStop**](https://www.careeronestop.org/ExploreCareers/Assessments/self-assessments.aspx?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=is-college-the-only-path-to-success) or [**O*NET**](https://www.mynextmove.org/explore/ip?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=is-college-the-only-path-to-success)) and explore it together. No pressure, just curiosity.
- **Research Local Opportunities:** Look up one local skilled trade program, apprenticeship, or community college certificate program. What surprising options are available nearby?
