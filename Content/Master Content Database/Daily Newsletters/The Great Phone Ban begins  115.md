New Jersey kicks off 2025 by kicking phones out of schools. But there's a catch...

Welcome back! This week we're exploring a growing crisis in American education. While the adults argue about phones, grades and, test scores, students are... livestreaming hallway fights for TikTok clout.

Something's got to give.

- 💭 Why protecting kids from everything might be the riskiest move of all
- 📊 The surprising connection between learning schedules and screen addiction
- 🔬 What cognitive science tells us about how kids actually learn
- 🏫 Plus: When passion for education becomes a crime

And now, let’s take a look back at the week that was.
💡THE BIG IDEA
## **The Pressure Cooker Problem**

We've created the most supervised, scheduled, and "safe" generation in history.

And they're cracking.

This week, we saw it from every angle:

- [**48% of teachers report student behavior in schools is "a lot worse" than pre-pandemic**](https://x.com/MrDanielBuck/status/1877474470757106134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1877474470757106134%7Ctwgr%5Ec664c8167a8bd5d5bcaa5f592f6138628e89fed8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fopened-daily.beehiiv.com%2Fp%2Fthe-hidden-psychology-of-education-shamers-112&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-great-phone-ban-begins-115)
- [**Jonathan Haidt's research**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvrMNDv6iYU&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-great-phone-ban-begins-115) shows kids spending record time "sitting on their beds with devices"
- States rushing to ban phones while ignoring the deeper issue

What's fascinating is where the problems surface. Not during structured class time, but in those brief moments of freedom – hallways, lunch periods, right after school.

It's not rebellion. It's release.

Think about it:

- Wake up, screens
- School, more screens
- After school, even more screens
- All while sitting still, inside, supervised

No tree climbing. No unsupervised play. No natural ways to test boundaries or release energy. Just pressure building in a system with no release valve.

Then we act surprised when it explodes.

Taking away phones in school might help, but it's like putting a lid on a pot that's already boiling over. The real solution might be simpler: let off some steam.

[**"Transformational learning is a process, not a singular event," writes Katie Martin at Learner-Centered Collaborative**](https://learnercentered.org/blog/learning-is-a-process-not-an-event/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-great-phone-ban-begins-115). Learning doesn't wait for school bells. It happens when kids fix bikes (engineering), argue about game rules (debate), or figure out how to earn money for something they want (economics).

Some schools are catching on. At [**Primer in Miami**](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/education/article296185394.html?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=is-your-child-using-outdated-study-habits-113), students aren't just studying business concepts - they're developing products for farmer's markets and launching coding projects. They're turning that pent-up energy into real-world results.

Maybe the answer isn't tighter lids on our pressure cookers. Maybe it's building more release valves.

### (TRIVIA) OF THE WEEK

The answer to yesterday’s trivia question, as 92% of you answered correctly, was **WIND**. Without stress from a strong breeze, trees never develop strong roots. There’s a metaphor in there somewhere.
*More proof that, when it doubt, the answer is usually ‘C’.*
Thanks for playing, y’all - come back real soon!
