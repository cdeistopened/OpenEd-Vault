### 💡 1 THOUGHT

“The world was telling me I was a loser. My teachers. My parents’ friends. I could see in their eyes they didn’t expect me to succeed…

But I wanted to prove them wrong. I would sit there, 13, 14, 15 years old, and look around the class and the teachers and think: ‘I’ll show you all.’”

—Gary Vee

Some kids break because of the labels their given. Others turn them into fuel.

Gary Vee got D’s and F’s in school. And yet—he built one of the most successful media companies, became a bestselling author, and mentored founders from Facebook to Coinbase.

Formal education told him he was failing. But real life had a different rubric.

### 📊 2 TRENDS

**1. Could fitness culture make a comeback in education?** P.E. is often considered an afterthought—or even a joke. But a recent [**viral clip**](https://x.com/HistoryInPics/status/1625593575257018368?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=everyone-said-he-d-fail-he-didn-t) from @HistoryInPics shows students at La Sierra High School in 1962 doing things most elite athletes can’t: 20-foot rope climbs, partner drills, parallel bar circuits, shirtless under the California sun. For the full story, check out the documentary [***The Motivation Factor***](https://www.dougorchard.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=everyone-said-he-d-fail-he-didn-t)—a love letter to the lost era of the Presidential Fitness Challenge.

**2. “Career Day” is going global and going deep**
Traditional career days tend to be local, linear, and mostly forgettable.

[**Inspire High**](https://inspirehigh.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=everyone-said-he-d-fail-he-didn-t) flips the model: students watch a short talk from a global creator—then reflect, respond to prompts, and share with peers worldwide. All in 40 minutes, no prep.

It’s career exposure as identity exploration. Among students:
– 87% reported clearer values and goals
– 121% boost in self-esteem after repeated useIt’s career exposure as identity
