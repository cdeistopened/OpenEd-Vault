### 💡 THOUGHT

"When in the real world do you only interact with people your age? I can't think of one scenario other than school."

Ana Lorena Fabrega (@anafabrega11)

Actually, we can only think of *one* other scenario – but we have to go back to 19th-century Prussian military camps (where modern schools got the idea).

## **Mixed-Age Learning Goes Mainstream**

Mixed-age learning used to be the domain of alternative schools like Montessori and Waldorf.

But [**according to Rasmussen**](https://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/education/blog/what-are-multi-age-classrooms/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=mixed-age-learning-takes-off-131), even traditional public schools are adopting multi-age classrooms. Why?

- Students show stronger social-emotional development
- Younger learners progress faster with older peers
- Older students deepen mastery through teaching
