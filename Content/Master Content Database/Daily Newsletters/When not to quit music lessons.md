Why mastering something—anything—might be the real lesson.

**Greetings Eddies!**

"Help! My 7-year-old loved piano at first, but lately it's been a daily argument. I don't want to give up on it, but I also don't want to create resentment."

[That plea popped up on Reddit recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1p1x929/how_do_you_keep_piano_practice_from_turning_into/), and dozens of parents chimed in with different answers. Some said push through, others said quit and find something else.

There's no one-size-fits-all answer. Music lessons work beautifully for some families and become a source of stress for others. But one music teacher's story offers an interesting perspective on patience and the long game of skill-building.

Let's dive in.

# When (Not) to Quit Music Lessons

**If your kid isn’t jazzed about lessons every week, you’re not failing—and the lessons may be doing more than you can see. **[Music teacher Deborah Pratt says the real value is the habit of showing up](https://opened.co/blog/the-wasted-years-of-music-lessons-and-why-they-matter), a relationship with a mentor, and confidence earned by doing hard things consistently.

One student started piano at eight, practiced inconsistently, and cycled through a few instruments as he grew. From the outside, it looked like a waste.

Then at 16, he walked in and said, “I bought a bass.” It finally clicked—the patterns matched the way his brain worked. He started practicing for hours, not because anyone pushed him, but because he’d found his thing.

**Deb’s takeaway**: if his parents had required practice to “earn” lessons, he might’ve quit before the breakthrough. Sometimes the click comes later—so don’t quit during a normal lull.

# The Corpus Callosum Effect

So why music specifically? [Because music is the only activity that lights up the entire brain simultaneously](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DR2MZ6bgoOw/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==).

It physically enlarges the** corpus callosum**—the bridge of nerve fibers connecting your left and right hemispheres. [ Research shows](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/3/1282) this structure is significantly larger in musicians.

This helps with:

- **Emotional Regulation** (Teenagers playing guitar to process angst)
- **Math Skills** (Rhythm is physical math)
- **Executive Function** (Tracking multiple inputs)

That said, music isn't the only path. The key is finding *something* that asks your child to show up consistently, struggle productively, and grow.

# Hoffman Academy & Practice Pie

From the [Reddit hive mind](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1p1x929/how_do_you_keep_piano_practice_from_turning_into/), two tools stood out for parents in the "practice trenches":

1. [**Hoffman Academy**](https://www.hoffmanacademy.com/): "My daughter loves Hoffman Piano online... she is doing this willingly after lots of struggles." It uses a gamified, video-based approach.
2. [**Practice Pie**](https://a.co/d/51W87WG)**:** A book recommended for reframing practice from a chore to a "slice" of the day.

**Bonus Strategy:** The Rebrand. One parent said: "I stopped calling it 'practice' and started calling it 'piano time' - somehow that small change made it feel more like an activity than a task."
