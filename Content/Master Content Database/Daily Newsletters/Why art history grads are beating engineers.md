**IN THIS EDITION**

🍎 A math-hating teen sprints to grade level in 90 days
🍎 A former teacher warns: “These kids cannot read”
🍎 Art history beats engineering in a surprise job market shift

### 💡 1 THOUGHT

My 30+ years in education have shown me that the most powerful learning happens at the intersection of three things:

– **Choice**: Some control over how, what, and when learners learn
– **Competency**: Adequate time and support to master key skills
– **Connection**: Learning tied to topics students care about and that relate to the real world

A story: Isaac’s son refused to do math for years. He considered it boring and irrelevant. Then at 13, he wanted to attend a part-time school program with his friends. The only catch? He had to be at grade level in math.

He said: *“I’ll catch up this summer.”*

What happened next surprised everyone.

Starting at the kindergarten level on Khan Academy, and spending just 1–2 hours a day, this teenager who “hated math” reached grade level in **less than three months**.

He wasn’t a prodigy. He just had:

- His own motivation (not external pressure)
- The right tools
- Freedom to progress at his own pace
- No artificial timelines

When kids have real motivation and the right environment, they learn faster than we expect. This is why I believe in learning sprints rather than endless marathons. Our new book [***Open Education***](https://geni.us/opened?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-art-history-grads-are-beating-engineers) shows how to create the conditions for this kind of breakthrough learning.
