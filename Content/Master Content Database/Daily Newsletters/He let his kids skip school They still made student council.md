## The Law of Exposure

Darryll Stinson has spent his career helping people break free from systems that don't serve them. But when it came to his children's education, he mostly just accepted traditional school as the only option. When Matt Bowman suggested he could pull his kids out for a couple weeks, he was skeptical. **"This dude is trying to get my kids expelled," **he thought.

But that conversation planted a question: What if there was a different way? Darryll describes what happened next through the lens of the "Law of Exposure": *the mind when stretched never returns to its original form.*

## 65% of schools suffer from chronic absenteeism

Nearly two-thirds of American schools now have over 30% of students missing more than 18 days per year. This kind of absenteeism isn’t about a thoughtful decision made by a student under the care of an engaged parent—it’s usually involuntary, unstructured, and rooted in frustration or disengagement. The surge began during COVID, when kids and parents alike pushed back against long hours in front of a screen. But even after schools returned to ‘normal,’ absenteeism rates stayed high. Unfortunately, most of the teens skipping school aren’t making the honor roll, starting businesses, or self-directing their education like Darryll’s kids. Still, we can’t help but wonder: *How many students would show up if they had more of a say in what learning looked like?*

## Darryll's #1 tip to instantly become a better speaker

"You have to be a thermostat, and not a thermometer," Darryll [tells his coaching clients](https://content.opened.co/e3t/Ctc/JA+113/d5pV-k04/VVt4wf7MY-g_W3KBXyW9jJV35W6L2xF55zG-nYN3S9PH63qgz0W7lCdLW6lZ3kQW3nfhvf1V17gWV9k3gd3nMjMgN52tQcgt2dLcW4mZdYd5CH32xW8LXrYM3Pw9D1W3y7rZ97R7hRZN3Zp701T-Xr3W72QN0n4cj14kVmkSPV3FmQLzW7RKdlZ6trQJJVcB-yF6jfn0dVmfKd448Z7MpW20rDWs63B4HQT4Mrj6YGG__W2P0jWG1_bYmpW4NlPFj5t_B5YW6_YJ0p4wSQB3W5lfqsp44-BMRW3JwDVj2lDcwvN1K4z129XpBFW1M4gmv8S6vZZW6QYlQQ8P59NVW1XV_9L7Bc_v_N7-HbMRtf0VYf8_t-Vz04). Imagine you show up to a half-empty conference room to give a talk. You could reflect the low energy in the room… or you could raise the temperature. *“People don’t move or take action unless they’re moved emotionally,”* he says. *“It doesn’t matter what you say—‘Open education, better pathway’—who cares, until they’re moved emotionally?”*

Note: This works just as well when you’re speaking to a crowd *or* defending your educational choices to skeptical relatives. If you get a chance to share your passion for open education, be like Darryll: **be a thermostat. Set the temperature.**
