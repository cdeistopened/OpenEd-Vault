**IN THIS EDITION**

🍎 Why most kids hate math (and it's not their fault)
🍎 Playful math returns & "brain rot" named Word of the Year
🍎 Three tools helping kids fall in love with numbers

### 💡 1 THOUGHT

“So many kids hate math, and can you blame them? **Math in school has nothing to do with reasoning.**” — Ana Lorena Fabrega

"I'm just not a math person."

How many times have you heard a child (or adult) say this? It’s the epitome of the fixed mindset that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

But what if the problem isn't the kids, but how we teach?

We've made math abstract, boring, and disconnected from real life. We've turned what should be a playground of patterns and puzzles into a joyless march through worksheets.

Kids who "hate math" will often spend hours on strategy games that involve resource management, spatial reasoning, and algorithmic thinking.

The difference? Context, visuals, and purpose. Change those three variables and you change the whole equation.

### 📊 2 TRENDS

**1. **[**PLAY RETURNS TO HIGH SCHOOL MATH**](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/63556/high-school-math-can-be-playful-too?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-most-kids-hate-math-and-how-to-fix-it) *(KQED MindShift)* – High school math teachers are bringing back play, and the research backs it up. A new study from Santa Clara University shows students who engaged in playful math learning demonstrated a 40% increase in both understanding and retention. For example, when students were asked to create expressions equivalent to integers 0-20 using only three numbers (like 3, 4, and 1), they discovered mathematical rules through exploration rather than memorization.

**2. **[**'Brain rot' named Oxford Word of the Year 2024**](https://corp.oup.com/news/brain-rot-named-oxford-word-of-the-year-2024/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-most-kids-hate-math-and-how-to-fix-it) *(Oxford University Press)* - We realize we're more than a year late on this one (forgive us for not being hip to the Gen Z lingo), but Oxford's Word of the Year 2024 was "brain rot." It's that feeling you get after scrolling TikTok for hours. But brain rot isn't limited to social media. We feel it when we're forced into repetitive tasks detached from meaning, like memorizing formulas without understanding their purpose. The solution? More engaging, interactive learning experiences that actually stick.

### 🔨 3 TOOLS

*Pulled from the r/homeschool thread ****“My 4 Best Math Resources; What are yours?”***

**1. **[**Numberblocks**](https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/shows/numberblocks?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-most-kids-hate-math-and-how-to-fix-it) - The secret weapon for early math that parents call "life-changing."

This animated series turns numbers into characters and mathematical concepts into adventures. Parents report toddlers learning to count and elementary students understanding square numbers and exponents naturally. Available on BBC iPlayer, YouTube, and Netflix in some regions.

**2. **[**Prodigy Math**](https://www.prodigygame.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-most-kids-hate-math-and-how-to-fix-it) - A math RPG that has kids begging for "just one more problem."

This game-based platform covers K-8 math aligned with curriculum standards. Kids battle monsters by solving math problems, with difficulty adapting to their level. The free version gives access to core features, while premium ($8.95/month) adds reports and extra content.

**3. **[**Synthesis Tutor**](https://www.synthesis.com/tutor?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-most-kids-hate-math-and-how-to-fix-it) – A visual, concept-first digital tutor built with Dr. James Tanton.

Unlike rote practice apps, Synthesis walks kids through *why* math works using interactive puzzles and stunning visuals. Parents say it’s pricey, but worth it for deep understanding (ideal for upper-elementary through early middle school).
