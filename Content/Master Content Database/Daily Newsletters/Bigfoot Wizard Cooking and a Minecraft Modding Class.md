### 💡 THOUGHT

## **NOT ALL SCREEN TIME IS CREATED EQUAL**

“We blame our kids for our issues. That’s what’s happening.”

That’s what Outschool CEO Amir Nathoo said in a recent [**conversation**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASuPwY3PSR0&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=bigfoot-wizard-cooking-and-a-minecraft-modding-class) with OpenEd’s Isaac Morehouse about our conflicted attitudes towards screen time.

Yesterday, we shared a *Wall Street Journal* article showing students now spend over 2 hours per day on school-issued devices (with the predictable fatigue among the students).

But Nathoo offers a more nuanced view:

***“Not all screen time is created equal. Just watching stuff on YouTube is completely different from building a virtual world or learning a tool.”***

An hour of passive screen consumption leaves kids dull and drained. But an hour [**designing mods in Minecraft**](https://outschool.com/classes/modding-with-minecraft-live-group-course-beginner-xiE0ykkw?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=bigfoot-wizard-cooking-and-a-minecraft-modding-class) or taking a live class lights them up.

We might also distinguish between *imposed* screen time *in* school, versus a topic freely-chosen from [**Outschool’s robust marketplace**](https://outschool.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=bigfoot-wizard-cooking-and-a-minecraft-modding-class).

Rather than asking *how much* time kids spend on screens, we should be asking: **What are they doing there?**

### 📊 TREND

## **THE ERA OF NETWORKED SCHOOLING**

Education is being unbundled — and reassembled in smarter, more personalized ways.

“Alternative education has blossomed into far more than homeschooling,” says Nathoo. “You’ve got part-time enrollment, dual enrollment, microschools… It’s harder now to define what someone is even doing.”

He calls it **networked schooling** — families connecting learning experiences across multiple people, platforms, and places, instead of relying on a single institution.

We call it open education. Isaac put it this way:

“The box is closed if you’re all in one school all day, every day. Anyone who’s doing two or more education approaches at the same time has basically opened the box…”

If you’re layering online classes onto public school, joining a co-op while using curriculum at home, or taking a hybrid approach — you’re already part of this new learning network. One that often works better than any single system ever could.

### 🛠️ TOOL

## **THE WEIRD AND WONDERFUL WORLD OF OUTSCHOOL**

When Isaac’s son wanted to learn Minecraft modding, neither parent knew how to help.

“I don’t know how to code,” Isaac recalls. “But I found a class on Outschool — six weeks, once a week.”

His son took the class, and by the end, he was showing *Isaac* how he built custom blocks.

This is what happens when curiosity meets access.

Outschool isn’t just a supplement to traditional curriculum — it’s a gateway to topics schools don’t touch.

Not generalists. They’re passionate nerds teaching what they love.
