💡 THOUGHT
## **Don’t smother the spark**

"Flexibility is one of the greatest gifts you can give both yourself and your child."

Hat tip to Colleen Kessler of [**Raising Lifelong Learners**](https://raisinglifelonglearners.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=058-how-to-get-your-child-to-take-you-seriously-as-the-teacher) for [**this thought of the day**](https://simplehomeschool.net/child-focused-approach/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=058-how-to-get-your-child-to-take-you-seriously-as-the-teacher).

Curriculum should be a springboard, not a straightjacket.

The magic of open education comes from molding lessons around your child's unique spark, not forcing them into a one-size-fits-all box.

📊 TREND
## **Fuzzy lines**

Have you noticed that the lines between "public," "private," and "homeschool" are getting fuzzier?

Independent study charter schools, part-time microschools, co-ops and learning pods (not to mention OpenEd) defy the old labels. Let’s unpack the forces behind this:

1. Technology enabling personalized and remote education
2. Funding following students, not systems
3. Demand for flexible attendance and scheduling options

Parents (and students) want customized educational experiences that incorporate elements of multiple approaches.

It’s a continuum, not an either/or.
🛠️ TOOL
## **How to get your child to take you seriously as the 'teacher'?**

[**Some parent advice**](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1g07vho/how_to_get_your_child_to_take_you_seriously_as/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=058-how-to-get-your-child-to-take-you-seriously-as-the-teacher) from the weird, wide world of Reddit:

1. **Consistency:** “My kids didn't take me seriously until I made us stick to a strict schedule." Try setting a routine: breakfast at 8:00, school starts at 9:00, with a predictable order of subjects.
2. **Engagement:** "I do my best to keep the quiet listening parts of lessons to no more than 10 to 15 minutes." Mix it up with movement and discussion to keep kids focused.
3. **Flexibility:** "Kids are allowed to have bad days, they're people too. So are you!" Don't beat yourself up if things don't always go according to plan.
4. **Agency:** One parent describes sitting down with their kids weekly to plan assignments: "Having those choices for themselves gives them a sense of ownership, teaches them time management and self-control."
5. **Natural Consequences:** "One rule in our house is that if you haven't finished the work you gave yourself for the day, screen time is at the parent's discretion." Let the punishment fit the crime, so to speak.

We would add that you don’t always have to think of yourself as a teacher. The resources available to parent–educators allow you to serve as more of a facilitator.
