💡 THOUGHT
## **THE POWER OF BOREDOM**

When was the last time you let your child get *truly* bored?

In our rush to fill every moment with structured learning, we often miss the magic that happens when children have nothing they *have* to do. That empty space is where genuine curiosity begins.

As Matt Bowman explains in [**our latest podcast episode**](https://opened.co/blog/stop-overscheduling-your-childs-learning-matt-bowman/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stop-overscheduling-your-child-s-learning), "Sometimes you need to let a child get bored enough to then wake up and say, 'I have nothing I have to do. What do I *want* to do?'"

## **YOUTH ENTREPRENEURSHIP: THE ULTIMATE EDUCATION**

Entrepreneurship isn't just about building businesses—it's becoming one of the most powerful educational experiences for young people.

Why? As Matt explains: "There's something unique you can learn from trying to be an entrepreneur that cannot be learned any other way."

Through entrepreneurship, young people develop skills that traditional education often misses:

- Applied problem-solving with real-world consequences
- Financial literacy through actual transactions
- Communication across diverse audiences
- Resilience through trial and error

This is exactly why [**the Youth Entrepreneur Award (YEA!)**](https://yea.education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stop-overscheduling-your-child-s-learning) was created, with its $5,000 prize pool for entrepreneurs 18 and under. Again, the deadline is March 15th!
🔨 TOOL
## **THE 20-MINUTE METHOD FOR OVERWHELMED PARENTS**

If you're feeling completely overwhelmed by your day, this minimalist approach can help you reset:

- 20 minutes of focused math
- 20 minutes of reading
- 20 minutes of writing
- 1 hour of free exploration between each

"If you're overwhelmed, your kids are gonna be feeling overwhelmed," explains Matt Bowman. "Take a break. Take a little time where you reduce whatever you're doing by 50%. Just cut in half whatever you're doing so that you can breathe a little bit."

Once you've established this sustainable rhythm and identified your child's genuine interests, you can gradually add more structured learning around those areas of curiosity.
WORD OF THE DAY
## **Kairos** (KAI-ross): *noun*

From ancient Greek, meaning "the right, critical, or opportune moment." Unlike chronos (sequential time), kairos refers to the perfect moment for action.

In education, it's recognizing when a child is truly ready to learn something—not when the curriculum says they should be.

That’s all for today! See you tomorrow.
