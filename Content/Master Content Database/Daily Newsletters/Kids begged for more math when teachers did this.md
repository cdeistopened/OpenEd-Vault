### 📊 2 TRENDS

**1. **[**HOW TO GET KIDS THINKING INSTEAD OF MIMICKING IN MATH CLASS**](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/64539/how-to-get-kids-thinking-instead-of-mimicking-in-math-class?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=kids-begged-for-more-math-when-teachers-did-this) *(KQED)* - The "thinking classrooms" model flips traditional math teaching on its head. Instead of rows of desks and worksheets, students work in groups of three at whiteboards, with new partners every day chosen by playing cards. Sixth graders who used to watch the clock now say "that was two periods already?" The key: when kids can't predict their group or role, they stop playing passive and start actually thinking.

**2. **[**TWIN STUDIES: NATURE VS. NURTURE REVISITED**](https://x.com/jonatanpallesen/status/1929904923899990058?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=kids-begged-for-more-math-when-teachers-did-this) *(@jonatanpallesen)* - Research comparing identical twins raised apart shows genetics play a larger role in outcomes than previously thought. While this doesn't mean parenting is meaningless, it does suggest that agonizing over every decision—organic vs. conventional, screen time limits, extracurricular choices—might matter less than we think. Maybe good-enough parenting is actually... good enough.
