💡 THOUGHT
## **REDEFINING SUCCESS**

"So your kid's 18, working at Pizza Hut, sharing an apartment with friends... not living the dream you imagined for them."

Some parents might feel a knot in their stomach imagining this scenario. But what if we're measuring success wrong?

[**In this week's podcast**](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-011-unplugged-and-unafraid-the-nature-kids-connection/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=this-mom-turned-a-van-into-a-microschool), Eleyah Knight challenges us to ask different questions:

"Are they happy? Healthy? Self-sufficient? Can they take care of themselves?"

Her insight cuts to the heart of modern parenting anxiety. We rush children through precious years of discovery, push them toward achievements that look good on applications, and wonder why so many end up questioning their path in their 30s (or ealrier).

"If you focus on a young person's holistic health while they're young," Eleyah explains, "they won't end up with chronic diseases, feeling like 'I never got to fully live my childhood because I was so busy trying to be an adult.'"

Maybe that's the conversation we should be having about education – not just what skills and knowledge our children acquire, but who they become in the process.

## **THE MICRO-COMMUNITY MOVEMENT: EDUCATION BEYOND WALLS**

While some dream of disrupting education with AI and virtual reality, Eleyah Knight had a different idea: a 14-passenger van.

"I decided I'm going to buy a van and I'm going to make an adventure school,” she explains in the latest

Her "Connected Teens" mobile microschool redefines what a classroom looks like for teens between the ages of 12 and 18. The weekly schedule reads like a choose-your-own-adventure book:

**Mondays:** Cooking, nutrition, and natural medicine (plus PE)
**Tuesdays:** Coding and theater
**Fridays:** Guest workshops and field trips based on student interests

But Eleyah's story is part of something much bigger – the educational micro-community movement that's growing 220% faster than any other educational model. Across the country, families are creating powerful learning environments outside traditional classrooms:

- [**Nature schools**](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-011-unplugged-and-unafraid-the-nature-kids-connection/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=this-mom-turned-a-van-into-a-microschool) in public parks in Utah
- Kitchen-table co-ops among neighborhood families
- Specialized passion-based learning groups like [**Surf Skate Science in Florida**](https://surfskatescience.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=this-mom-turned-a-van-into-a-microschool)

You don't need a van (or a teaching credential) to be part of this movement. Want to learn more about creating your own educational micro-community?
