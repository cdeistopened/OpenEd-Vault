💡 THOUGHT
## **Showing up ≠ learning**

Have you ever noticed how much of traditional education is built around simply being present? Show up at this time, sit in this chair, stay for this many hours.

But showing up ≠ learning. A child who is deeply absorbed in solving a real problem for 30 minutes can learn more than one passively sitting through a 2-hour lecture.
When we focus on creating the conditions for deep engagement – whether through hands-on projects, real-world problem solving, or following genuine curiosity – the clock becomes less relevant.📊 TREND
## **“A Nation at Risk”**

When [***A Nation at Risk***](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED226006&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=093-time-isn-t-the-teacher) arrived in 1983 from President Reagan's National Commission on Excellence in Education, it delivered a stark warning of a "rising tide of mediocrity" in American education. The report painted a dire picture of declining academic standards and global competitiveness, diagnosing the problem as simple arithmetic: our students weren't spending enough time at their desks. Never mind that American pupils already log 1,022 hours annually in class – more daily time than most developed nations, if spread across fewer calendar days. The solution, we were assured, was straightforward: More time translates into more learning.

But reality has a way of complicating our tidy assumptions.

Consider [**the Summit School in Colorado**](https://www.educationnext.org/time-for-school-assessing-inequality-access-instructional-time-united-states/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=093-time-isn-t-the-teacher), where students achieve two years of mathematical growth in a single year – while spending *less* time in traditional instruction. Their secret isn't quantity but quality: small groups, personalized pathways, focused attention on what works.

The pattern is spreading. Nine hundred school districts have now moved beyond the five-day calendar (up from 650 in 2020). Half of Colorado's districts have embraced scheduling flexibility. Microschools and learning pods continue to multiply, each proving that innovation doesn't require more hours.

## **Learning Sprints: A Better Way to Structure Your Child's Learning Time**

Forget rigid hourly schedules. Many OpenEd families are finding success with "learning sprints" - focused 1-2 week periods where children dive deep into topics they care about. Here's how to run one:

**Step 1: Sprint Planning (10-minute family meetup)**

- Help your child choose a topic they're excited about
- Define 3-5 key learning goals, and the resources required
- Pick a creative way to present findings (video, presentation, game design, etc.)

**Step 2: Mid-Sprint Check (10 minutes)**

- Quick progress review; adjust course if needed
- Celebrate small wins

**Step 3: Sprint Showcase (20 minutes)**

- Child presents what they learned
- Family celebrates both successes and "noble failures"
- **Simple self-assessment:** What was mastered? What needs more time?
- Save a sample for their portfolio

Keep the meetups short and fun (add snacks!), and consider inviting extended family to virtual showcases. The beauty of sprints is that they create natural momentum and clear finish lines.

### **(FACT) OF THE DAY**

Finnish students, who consistently rank among the world's highest performers, spend 5,500 fewer hours in class between ages 7-14 than American students – nearly two full years less instructional time.

That’s all for today!
