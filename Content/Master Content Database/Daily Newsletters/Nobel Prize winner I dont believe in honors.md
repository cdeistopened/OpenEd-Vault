💡 THOUGHT
## **THE REAL PRIZE**

"I've already got the prize. The prize is the pleasure of finding the thing out, the kick in the discovery, the observation that other people use it. Those are the real things."

[**– Richard Feynman**](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIwb3fdou_6/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)

Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman rejected the very honors that made him famous, preferring the joy of discovery over external validation.

The real prize was never the gold star or the grade—it was the thrill of understanding something he didn't before. When learning is driven by curiosity rather than credentials, children develop a relationship with knowledge that lasts a lifetime.

📊 TREND
## **IS THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BEING ABOLISHED?**

**Short answer: **No (or at least, not yet).

**Longer answer:** A [**recent executive order**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/improving-education-outcomes-by-empowering-parents-states-and-communities/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nobel-prize-winner-i-don-t-believe-in-honors) created plenty of dramatic headlines, appearing to herald the closure of the Department of Education, but the reality is far less radical. While staffing has been reduced, the Department of Education continues to operate.

By and large, the real changes in education aren’t happening through department reorganizations or policy debates. They’re happening through individual families discovering they have the power to build learning environments tailored to their children's needs—regardless of what happens in Washington.

🛠️ TOOL
## **NAVIGATING 6,700 HOMESCHOOL RESOURCES**

The [**Homeschool Resource Roadmap**](https://www.homeschoolroadmap.org/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nobel-prize-winner-i-don-t-believe-in-honors) offers an impressive — if somewhat overwhelming — database of 6,700+ educational resources spanning 300 content areas.

While the database excels at identifying whether materials align with Common Core standards (the project's original purpose), finding resources based on other important criteria can be challenging. The interface doesn't offer true filtering capabilities, making it difficult to narrow down options based on multiple preferences simultaneously.

For OpenEd families already facing information overload, having access to 6,700 options without those filtering tools might feel like being handed a phone book when you just need one number.
