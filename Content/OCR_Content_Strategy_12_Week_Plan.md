# AI OCR Tool: 12-Week Content Strategy

**Date:** 2025-12-20
**Product Positioning:** Context-aware AI OCR that outperforms ABBYY FineReader, Adobe Acrobat, and traditional OCR tools through semantic understanding

---

## Executive Summary

### Market Opportunity
- OCR market: **$12.25B in 2024** → **$51.23B by 2033** (17.23% CAGR)
- 74% of enterprises now use OCR tools
- 46% face integration challenges with legacy systems
- 38% of recognition errors come from poor image quality, handwriting, and multi-language docs

### Your Competitive Advantage: Context-Aware AI OCR
Traditional OCR fails because it treats documents as character streams, not semantic entities. Your tool's differentiator:
- **Semantic understanding** - knows an invoice total vs. a PO number
- **Layout intelligence** - recognizes tables, forms, mixed content
- **Context-aware extraction** - uses surrounding text to improve accuracy
- **Verbatim fidelity** - preserves exact formatting and meaning
