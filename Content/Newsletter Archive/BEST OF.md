## Pandemic Pods, KaiPods, and iPods | OpenEd

## ==💡 THOUGHT==

### ==Curiosity > Curriculum==

==Humans will and must learn. It can’t be stopped. From the youngest age, toddlers constantly observe their surroundings, watch what others do, and experiment themselves.==

==They push, pull, and test things, always asking: “What happens if I do this?”==

==They’ve seen people use footstools and they’ve seen people reach for things on high shelves. In a moment of inspiration, they combine these ideas: move the footstool to the shelf and use it as a step to reach what they want. This is learning in action—the perfect blend of theory and practice.==

==But there’s also complex reasoning at play. When a child uses an object in a new way (like standing on a footstool they’ve only seen used for sitting) they’re making analogies and understanding systems. They connect dots in ways that demonstrate a deep, intuitive grasp of the world.==

==When you let children explore their interests, they can’t help but learn.==

### ==The Rapid Rise of Pandemic Pods==

==The word “revolution” gets thrown around a lot. In a recent interview with Bill Gates, Sal Khan (yes, that Khan from Khan Remember when “pod” was just something you listened to on your morning commute? Well, times have changed, and now it might just be your kid’s new classroom. Since the pandemic of 2020-2021, these DIY learning groups have been popping up faster than sourdough starters. But unlike that bread you abandoned, these pods are proving they’re here to stay.== ==[EducationNext reports](https://www.educationnext.org/rapid-rise-pandemic-pods-will-parent-response-covid-19-lead-to-lasting-changes/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=034-pandemic-pods-kaipods-and-ipods)== ==that this trend has gone hand-in-hand with soaring enrollment in online learning platforms. (====[Outschool](https://outschool.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=034-pandemic-pods-kaipods-and-ipods)====, for example, saw a 275% increase.)==

==What does this tell us? Parents are eager to take charge of their children’s education, but they’re not going it alone. Pods provide the perfect mix: the flexibility of customized learning, the support of like-minded families, and a blend of online resources with good old-fashioned face-to-face interaction. For parents working part- or full-time, pods allow them to share their time commitment and create a sustainable learning environment that fits their schedules.==

## ==⚒️ TOOL==

### ==Edupreneur Spotlight: KaiPod==

==Speaking of pods, let’s talk about a tool that’s turning pandemic pivots into permanent possibilities:== ==[KaiPod Learning](https://kaipodlearning.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=034-pandemic-pods-kaipods-and-ipods)====, the brainchild of edupreneur Amar Kumar, helps passionate educators and parents launch their own personalized learning spaces, embracing a “choose your own adventure” approach to education.==

## Obsessive interest can be a superpower | OpenEd

[![](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Image06.jpg)](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Image06.jpg)

## ==💡 THOUGHT==

### ==“My kid is obsessed with just one subject. Should I be worried?”==

==**Our short answer:**== ==Feed your child’s interest with all the resources you can gather. It will likely shift over time. When kids do these deep dives, they’re learning how to learn. The obsessive approach often yields richer results than the traditional method of dividing subjects into neat 50-minute segments.==

==For example, Matt’s son once wanted to learn everything about diamonds—their history, value, and market appraisal based on colors and shapes. After a few weeks, he moved on to a different topic. Similarly, Isaac recently heard about an “unschooled” student who spent a whole year focused on fishing. Later, when he became interested in math, he applied the same “obsessive” mentality and learned it fast.==

==The ability to focus intensely and solve problems becomes a superpower in the real world.==

Some key points==

==Almost nobody is happy with one-size-fits-all models==

==Academic recovery since the pandemic is happening too slowly==

==Younger students especially, are falling behind==

_==“The time for incremental change has passed. Those with the power to make these critical shifts must act with urgency, creativity, and a deep sense of responsibility to all our students.”==_

==– Robin Lake, Executive Director, CRPE==

==The path forward, according to the report?==

1. ==**Flexibility**====: Schools must adapt to students, not vice versa==
2. ==**Personalization**====: Embrace new staffing and scheduling approaches==
3. ==**Technology**====: Leverage AI for tailored learning experiences==
4. ==**Transparency**====: Provide honest, accessible data on student performance==
5. ==**Urgency**====: Act now to prevent losing a generation to pandemic effects==

## The new success formula for teens | OpenEd

[![](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Image09.jpg)](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Image09.jpg)

## ==💡 THOUGHT==

### ==The new success formula==

==It hit me in a college classroom: I was buying a piece of paper. My classmates and I would all walk away with the same degree. But what did it really mean?==

==In a world where 52% of recent college grads are underemployed, being an average college graduate doesn’t signal much anymore.==

==Luckily, it’s not the only way to showcase your value to the world.==

==Here’s the formula for career success in 2024:==

==**Real projects + Work experience + Self-education + Networking = Job offers**== 

==A degree may signal some of those things, but not very well. You need more! Of course, college can still be a great choice for some. The key is, college or not, to start building a== _==body of work==_==.==

### ==Jay-Z Supports a PASS for PA Families==

==The education landscape is shifting faster than you can say “Y to the E to the S.”==

==In an unexpected plot twist that has education policy wonks scratching their heads, Jay-Z threw his weight behind== ==[the proposed $100 million PASS program](https://whyy.org/articles/jay-z-roc-nation-philadelphia-private-school-vouchers/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=032-the-new-success-formula-for-teens)== ==that would provide scholarships to students in Pennsylvania’s lowest-performing schools.==

==Let’s break it down:==

- ==First, these aren’t your Uncle Milton’s vouchers. Families could use the funds for private schools, yes, but also for various educational services and resources.==
- ==It’s less about abandoning ships and more about “building more lifeboats.” The goal is to expand options for families with the greatest needs.==
- ==As more states experiment with flexible funding models, the lines between traditional public, private, and alternative education options are blurring.==

==With Jay-Z in the mix, the education reform debate just got much more interesting. Who knows, maybe we’ll see Beyoncé leading a task force on STEM education next? 🐝==

## 🍎 OpenEd Daily: Is a college degree still worth it? | OpenEd

[![](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Artboard-8.jpg)](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Artboard-8.jpg)

==One of the most common worries we hear from parents is around college readiness.==

- ==Am I doing enough to prepare my child?==
- ==Will he/she be competitive with other applicants if they don’t have a traditional diploma?==
- ==Is college even worth the price of admission these days?==

==**Let’s explore…**==

### ==In this edition:==

- ==📜 What’s a diploma worth without the skills to back it up?==
- ==🎓 How do homeschooler’s get into college?==
- ==🚀 Early College Programs: Earning Your Degree While Still in High School==

==Before getting into the advantages homeschoolers often have in college admissions (including the flexibility to take college courses early), let’s take a step back and ask: Is college the best path for everyone?==

==Here’s a sobering stat:== ==**52% of college graduates are underemployed.**==

==Now, let’s get real about what a degree actually does for you in the job market. Outside of fields where it’s legally required? Not much. There are often better ways to showcase your skills to employers. (====**Pro tip:**== ==Send a video pitch demonstrating your abilities. Nine times out of ten, they won’t even ask about your degree.)==

==So why the near-universal push for college? Often, it’s parents feeling the heat pressure to signal to society they did a good job.==

==There are plenty of good reasons to go to college, but social pressure isn’t one of them!==

==Make sure you know what your goals are and whether it’s truly the best way to reach them.==

### ==🎓 College Admissions Myth-Busting: Homeschoolers Edition==

==If your child is determined to go to college, the question arises…== ==[how do homeschoolers get in?](https://www.joinprisma.com/blog/how-do-homeschoolers-get-into-college?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=is-a-college-degree-still-worth-it)== ==The Prisma blog debunks the myth that you need a traditional diploma to stand out in admissions. A few datapoints:==

- ==Homeschoolers graduate college at a 10% higher rate than public school peers==
- ==UNC Chapel Hill admits 47% of homeschoolers vs 17% overall admission rate==
- ==Homeschoolers are also well-represented at Ivy League schools like Yale, Harvard, and MIT==

==Beyond test scores and an official-looking transcript, colleges are increasingly interested in “spiky” applicants. But what does that mean?==

==A “spiky” application showcases deep expertise or passion in a specific area, rather than being well-rounded but average across the board.==

==**For example:**==

- ==A student who’s published research on local water quality==
- ==An aspiring filmmaker with a portfolio of short films and festival submissions==
- ==A budding entrepreneur who’s already launched a small business==

==So instead of forcing your 14 year old into weekend SAT prep classes, consider encouraging them to start a portfolio showcasing their projects and passions or seek out mentorship or internships in their field of interest==

==Use the flexibility of an open education to develop these distinctive “spikes” – they might just be their secret weapon.==

### ==**🏛️ Forge Your Own Path: College on**== _==**Your**==_ ==**Terms**==

==**FACT:**== ==You don’t have to wait until after high school to start earning college credits.==

==Through our partnership with Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), high school students can now earn real college credits online.==

- ==Access college-level courses in grades 9-12==
- ==Learn at your own pace, no credit limit==
- ==Affordable: Just $2,500 per year (discounts available for OpenEd students!)==

==Get a head start on your future. Earn towards an associates degree in high school, or show 4-year colleges you’re ready for the next level.==

==**“Are you a homeschooler?”**==

==This seemingly simple question often leaves parents pausing, furrowing their brows, and hesitantly replying,== _==“I guess?”==_

==What do you call it when your kid takes math classes online, goes to the local school for band, and runs a small business from home?==

==If you’re scratching your head, you’re not alone. The old labels don’t cut it anymore.==

==In our conversations with families over the years, we’ve noticed this growing trend of educational experiences that defy traditional categorization. It’s one of the key reasons we’re evolving from My Tech High to OpenEd – to better capture the amazing ways families like yours are already customizing your children’s education.==

==Incoming CEO Isaac Morehouse recently sat down again with Matt Bowman to clarify some things about the name change (no, the program is not changing!).==

==We talked about why names matter, and the importance of a shared language that reflects the flexible and open-ended nature of modern education.==

==And now, we’re turning to you – the parents – to help us tell your stories and highlight the incredible educational journeys you’re crafting. Your experiences are shaping the future of education, and we want to make sure those stories are heard.==

### ==The Inadequacy of Current Educational Labels==

==Since COVID hit, education has changed dramatically. We still have public schools, charter schools, and homeschooling. But now we have all this other stuff that doesn’t fit neatly into any of those boxes. It’s a mix of online and offline, structured and unstructured, traditional and innovative.==

==Take the story of one student who reached out to Matt on LinkedIn. She described herself as “a homeschooler enrolled in OpenEd (which partners with a public school).”==

==“I also split-enroll in my local school for band class,” she said, “and I’m pursuing a competency-based associate degree through Southern New Hampshire University.”==

==Try fitting that on a school registration form.==

==I hear stories from families like this al the time. Yet most parents have no idea these options exist.==

==The truth is, education today is more like a buffet than a set menu. Families are mixing and matching, creating unique learning experiences that defy simple labels.==

==It’s beyond the concepts of charter school, homeschool, tutorial, or co-op. It’s all of them, sometimes each of them, mixed in unique ways.==

==This isn’t just a handful of families doing something quirky. It’s a growing movement. And it needs a new language to describe it. That’s where you come in. Your stories and experiences are the building blocks of this new educational landscape.==

### ==Your Story is Cooler Than You Think==

==If you spend any time on social media, you might think that unless you’re teaching your 1st-grader astrophysics on a catamaran while island-hopping in the South Pacific, you’re not doing enough for your child’s education.==

==We’ve all seen those picture-perfect homeschool setups or heard about child prodigies running tech startups from their treehouses. It’s easy to feel like you’re not doing enough.==

==Let me assure you: that’s not true.==

==If you’ve chosen to personalize your child’s education, you’re already ahead of 99% of parents.==

==Think about it. Are you letting your child pursue their passion for music while ensuring they get solid math instruction? Have you found a way to incorporate their love for video games into their learning? These aren’t small things. They’re the building blocks of a personalized, engaging education.==

==We want to move this concept forward and help as many families as possible be able to open up education for their children. And we need your help to do it. Your stories, your experiences, your creative solutions – they’re the heart of this movement.==

==**So here’s my ask:**== ==Share your story with us. How have you customized your child’s education? What unique combinations of learning have you created? Your journey matters, and it could inspire other families to explore new possibilities.==

==You can email us at== ==reply@opened.co== ==or comment on this post. Let’s create a new language for education together – one that captures the amazing things happening in homes and communities across the country.==

==Let’s write the next chapter in education.==

## ==Transcript==

### ==Introduction and Welcome [00:00:00]==

==**Isaac:**== ==Many parents don’t realize what’s possible in education today. I hear stories of families building custom entrepreneurship courses at home or combining online classes with in-person band lessons. Most parents don’t know these options exist.==

==**Matt:**== ==Hey everyone, Matt Bowman and Isaac Morehouse here. We’re excited to discuss the transition from My Tech High to OpenEd. Isaac, welcome.==

==I want to address our long-time My Tech High families who’ve been with Amy and me for 15 years. This evolution to OpenEd has been thrilling. Isaac, we’ve known each other for a decade, introduced by a student interested in Praxis as a college alternative. It’s amazing to see you now taking the reins. Tell us about the motivation behind the name change when you joined.==

==**Isaac:**== ==Sure. We recently announced to thousands of My Tech High families that we’re changing to OpenEd and launching a newsletter and podcast. Naturally, many asked, “What’s happening? New CEO, new name?” We realized that the trust Matt and Amy built over 15 years is significant, so introducing new faces and a new name is no small matter. Let’s take a moment to explain our reasoning and vision.==

### ==The Importance of a Name [02:04]==

==**Isaac:**== ==Matt, when you first contacted me a decade ago, I was puzzled by “My Tech High.” I thought, “A tech-focused high school?” It took me a while to grasp the program because of the name. I assumed it was a charter school teaching only tech. That’s the obvious issue – people might think it’s just a high school or solely about technology.==

==But there’s a deeper aspect. I’ll touch on some business concepts here. I once read an article by James Currier, a tech founder with a VC firm called NFX. When I was raising funds for Praxis to build a tech platform, he told me, “What you’re building is a job-seeker platform. That’s distinct from Praxis and needs its own name.”==

### ==The Power of Language in Business [03:27]==

==**Isaac:**== ==I’m big into language, and when you’re trying to rally people around a vision, whether it’s a team or the market you’re trying to serve, having language – which includes your company’s name, but it’s much bigger than that – that people can rally to is crucial. Language is a network effect in business. People talk a lot about network effects. So any kind of product where every additional customer makes the product more valuable for every other customer, right? That’s a type of network effect. Facebook is an example of this, as are a lot of social platforms, but language is also a network effect.==

==The more people that are using a type of language to talk about a type of problem or challenge or solution, the more valuable that language becomes to everyone else because it’s applicable. It’s common. And when you can give voice to something that’s happening in the market that you are trying to help and serve, and give language and concepts for people to use, there’s a power there.==

### ==The Shift in Education Post-COVID [04:32]==

==**Isaac:**== ==I’ve seen something happening over the last 10 years, but especially since COVID, in education. The existing language just doesn’t quite capture all these things happening. You have public school, you have charter schools, you have homeschooling, but then you have all this stuff happening that doesn’t really fit in any of those categories.==

==The number of times I’ve run into parents in the last five years where we’ve asked, “Oh, do you homeschool?” And they’ve paused for a minute and been like, “I guess?” Like, the language isn’t quite doing the trick. And there’s something different happening.==

==I think what I really was excited about with My Tech High’s history, as we talked about in the first episode, is bridging. It’s kind of beyond the concepts of, are you in a charter school or homeschool or a tutorial or a co-op? It’s kind of like, yes, sometimes each of them, all of them. And so that movement, that broadening, that ability for parents to pick and choose, I felt like we needed some language to bridge that. That not only more accurately reflected what the program is, but the vision of who we’re trying to help and what movement, what change, the big change that’s happening in the world that we are trying to help be a part of and help anyone who wants to be a part of that. And I think it is the opening up of education. And so that was a big part of that name. Let’s really rally around a better way of talking about the shift that’s happening in the world when it comes to education.==

==**Matt:**== ==Isaac, it really was because when you proposed the shift to Open Ed, instantly, Amy and I looked at that and said, “Yes, that’s what we’ve been trying to talk about for 15 years.”==

### ==Origins and Vision of My Tech High [06:05]==

==**Matt:**== ==When you proposed the shift to OpenEd, Amy and I immediately recognized it as the concept we’ve been trying to articulate for 15 years. Many aren’t aware that the original My Tech High business plan aimed to transform 16 and 17-year-olds into tech entrepreneurs. We believed there were concrete ways to guide teenagers toward tech entrepreneurship, and that vision gave birth to My Tech High.==

==I should also mention High Tech High, a charter school in San Diego that inspired us. It was featured in a documentary called “Most Likely to Succeed.” This project-based tech charter school significantly influenced our thinking. We added “my” to “TechHigh” to emphasize personalization.==

==Interestingly, in our first year, the average student age was nine. I remember thinking, “Turning nine-year-olds into tech entrepreneurs might be a stretch!” While we kept the name, we shifted our focus to personalized education for younger children. This evolution was never fully reflected in the My Tech High name, which makes this rebranding particularly timely.==

==A few years ago, I received a LinkedIn request that perfectly illustrates the complexity of what we’ve become. The student, likely participating in a Praxis program task, had an incredibly detailed job description. She wrote, “I’m a homeschooler enrolled in My Tech High, which partners with a public school. I also split-enroll in my local school for band class and I’m pursuing a competency-based associate degree through Southern New Hampshire University.” This captures the multifaceted, personalized educational journeys we’ve come to facilitate.==

### ==Entrepreneurship for Young People [10:28]==

==**Isaac:**== ==It’s interesting, Matt, that I didn’t know you started with that intention around entrepreneurship for young people. That’s really been my passion from a very young age too – how do we help people in that 16 to early twenties range start thinking about entrepreneurial things?==

==When we started Praxis, it was aimed at those after high school graduation, whether they’d been in college for a few years and didn’t like it, were deciding if they wanted to go to college, or maybe even graduated but needed career help. That was our target demographic. But immediately we found that so many of these kids needed a de-schooling process first. They came to us with mindsets and assumptions that they had to unlearn if they actually wanted to be entrepreneurial or even work at a fast-growing startup.==

==I kept thinking we needed to reach kids earlier, to expose them to the right ideas sooner. Parents constantly asked us, “Is there a version for high schoolers? For middle schoolers?” I could never find a feasible way to get employers to take on 12-year-old apprentices, but we did launch a teen entrepreneurship course as a way to prepare people.==

==You eventually keep going backwards. You think, “Okay, these high school students would benefit from thinking about these basic concepts at 10 or 12.” Eventually, you realize it just starts at the beginning. The environment of being around things that allow you to experience the basic concepts of entrepreneurial thinking – which doesn’t necessarily mean starting a business, but seeing the world as full of opportunity – that can start very early.==

==**Matt:**== ==Exactly right. I remember in the first few years, still trying to find 16 and 17-year-olds who wanted to be tech entrepreneurs, they couldn’t escape the societal pressure. It was all about preparing for college, ACT prep, writing good essays. That pressure was so heavy I couldn’t even get their attention to think about entrepreneurial things.==

### ==Real-World Entrepreneurship Stories [14:40]==

==**Matt:**== ==We regularly run entrepreneurship competitions or invite kids to submit their pitches for extra seed funds. It’s interesting to see how they pitch nonprofit opportunities. That’s great – they see an opportunity to solve a problem in the community and decide to organize it as a nonprofit instead of a for-profit. To me, that doesn’t matter. Thinking like an entrepreneur is about seeing a problem, solving it, and creating opportunities.==

==We also regularly had meetups at different businesses. One story I remember is when eBay in Salt Lake hosted one of our meetups. The model we used was to have the executive team from the campus present some challenges eBay was facing and give everyone in the audience 10-15 minutes to gather in small groups or individually and come up with solutions.==

==The average age in the audience was probably 10. So here’s this board of executives at eBay Salt Lake City, and they gave 10 minutes to the audience. I saw all these teenagers and young kids writing on poster boards, and then they got up and pitched in front of the audience. After that, the executives turned to each other and said, “These are better ideas than we’ve had from our adult crew. We’ve asked the same question to present.” It was honestly better, more innovative, practical ideas for eBay to improve.==

==One kid said, “Your logo is out of date. It just doesn’t attract me as a young person. Update your brand.” I thought that was so cool. The eBay executives afterwards were saying, “Matt, thank you. We are actually taking some of these ideas back to our leadership team and seeing how we can implement them.”==

==**Isaac:**== ==I love it. There’s something about kids before they’ve been sort of tainted with things that feel obligatory, like “you’re supposed to learn this.” I know with my own kids, if you’re a parent of multiple kids, I’m sure you can relate to this – my younger kids are so much less tainted than my older kids because I’ve learned how to parent better over the years.==

==With my older kids, when they expressed interest in something, I’d immediately say, “Oh, cool. Well, we should set up a website or we should get a blog.” And something about my excitement, they’d interpret as “Dad’s trying to make me do something I don’t want to do” and they would resist. With my youngest, I’ve learned how to play it more cool.==

==Literally right now today, he’s up there doing data entry voluntarily. He’s seven, but he’s gotten into baseball cards. He wanted to trade them, and when his friend asked how many Braves cards he had, I suggested creating a spreadsheet to enter them all in and then sort them. He was intrigued, and now he’s always asking, “Dad, can I go put more cards into the spreadsheet?” I’m thinking, do I have the heart to tell him that nobody wants to do data entry? He loves it. He’s having a blast up there, entering every card.==

==When you don’t frame it as a subject with a restrictive criteria, but just as exploring an interest, it’s so fun. I remember with my oldest, one of my favorite entrepreneurial stories: He was about 10 and really into making fancy sandwiches at lunchtime. He always wanted my wife to buy specific baguettes and meats. He said, “There aren’t enough places to buy these. I should sell them.”==

==I suggested he ask my brother, who had a tech company with about 40 employees, if he could sell sandwiches there at lunchtime. The first time, he just had all the sandwiches the same and sold them, but he felt people bought them just because he was a cute kid selling stuff. I suggested he send a survey next time with options. He did that, got additional supplies, and sold them all again.==

==He kept getting requests for more meat, but he wanted to use fancy, expensive meats. We priced it out, and he found people didn’t seem to care about the quality as much as the quantity. This bothered him because he didn’t want to compromise on quality. Then people started asking for chips and drinks too. He figured out the margin was much better on chips than on sandwiches with fancy deli meat.==

==After about four or five weeks, he decided, “I figured out the only way to make enough money to make it worth it is to make products I wouldn’t buy myself. So this isn’t the business for me.” He’s very much the purist artist, and he knows that about himself. I told him if this were his career, he’d need to find a different market that values and is willing to pay for what he wants to make. Some of my other kids would say, “I don’t care what people want. I’ll give it to them if I can make money.” But it was fun watching him have that realization through experimentation.==

==**Matt:**== ==What draws me to entrepreneurship for young people is that it breaks down traditional barriers of cliques and groups. When you’re trying to develop an entrepreneurial pursuit, you realize the value of differences amongst all of us. You need someone who reads and writes a lot to be your messaging person. That girl or boy who always has their nose in a book? You need to attract them to your team because you need well-written content for your marketing website.==

==The kid that’s always coding or into tech? You need that person to join your team to create the backend website, automate things, and set up the tech. The kid who’s always talking and selling? You need that person. The person who loves math or spreadsheets? You need them for your financials.==

==Entrepreneurship creates the most integrated, heterogeneous society that we need. That’s what I love about pushing kids to be entrepreneurial – it makes them step outside of their own expertise and bring in people with other expertise, knowledge, and competencies. To me, that’s the real power of saving our world: developing this sense of entrepreneurial thinking.==

==**Isaac:**== ==That’s amazing. It’s really funny as you’re talking about this. I don’t want to overplay this, but I heard somebody once say you can explain a lot of the world if you just assume that it’s always a battle between the jocks and the nerds. That kind of thing happens in rigid educational structures where kids who are good at sports go over here and hang out together, kids who are good at book learning or interested in tech go over here, and there’s not much integration or overlap. These different ways of seeing and approaching the world don’t blend into each other, which can lead to conflict.==

==If you go to any successful company of any size, they have all of those things. Anyone who runs a company will tell you that the more integrated the company is, the less siloed each of those departments and skill sets are, the healthier and better it is. It’s hard to break down those silos if they’ve been conditioned into you from an early age.==

### ==The Broader Vision of Open Ed [23:39]==

==**Isaac:**== ==We went off on a fun tangent about tech and entrepreneurship, but I want to bring it back for the people who’ve reached out about the name change. We’ve launched a daily newsletter, the OpenEd Daily – go to== ==[opened.co](http://opened.co/)== ==and subscribe if you want that in your inbox every morning. This podcast, obviously, and for the families who’ve been with this program for many years, the podcast, newsletter, and even the== ==[opened.co](http://opened.co/)== ==homepage are clearly broader than just a description of the program currently set up in the states where we operate. That’s intentional because we’re trying to rally people as part of a movement.==

### ==Conclusion and Future Plans [28:15]==

==**Isaac:**== ==I should also reiterate that Matt and Amy are very much still here, involved, active, not going away. In fact, if I can tease a little bit, they’re working on something special – a book that should be coming out before too long. So they’re taking on the role of evangelists, telling these stories and going out there speaking and writing even more. That’s kind of in the future for you and Amy, right?==

==**Matt:**== ==Yes, Amy and I are so excited to document the stories we’ve heard, the lessons we’ve learned, and hope that it can help more families access this mindset of opening education for their children. It’s a mix of everything. OpenEd is pretty much the only entity on the planet that talks about all versions of education. Everyone else sits in their silos of either homeschool or public school or charter school. We say our loyalties lie with the kid. Let’s bring the world’s best resources to the child to help them thrive, succeed. Equally help the family, the parent have peace in their home, and bring a joy of education to the family that sometimes is often just lost. It’s a drudgery for so many families, fighting with their children over getting up in the morning or going to bed at night, tired, exhausted because of homework. We want to bring all of the joy of education and learning back to families, and open education is what will do that.==

==**Isaac:**== ==That’s a soundbite right there. Well, hey Matt, this has been a lot of fun. And for all of you families who have been My Tech High faithful through the years, send us things you want us to talk about, things that would be helpful for you in our newsletter, in our podcast. Pass those along. I’ll be continuing to get to know more of you, and the program that you know and love is only going to get better.==

==For all of those who are new, who have never heard of My Tech High and are new to OpenEd, welcome. If you are in a state where we don’t offer our current program, we’re trying to come there. We want to do as many things as we can to help you, whether it’s related to stuff we have or not. We’re going to try to put together resources for every state, not just things that we offer, but things from all different organizations and businesses. We really want to move this concept forward and help as many families as possible be able to open up education for their children.==

==We love hearing from listeners and readers. You can email us, let us know things you’d like to hear us talking about. You’ll hear a lot more stories from families, parents, and a whole variety of stuff on this podcast and in our newsletter. So Matt, this was fun. Anything we should close out on?==

==**Matt:**== ==No, that was great. Isaac. Thanks.==

==**Isaac:**== ==You bet. We’ll see you next time, everybody.==

## 🍎 OpenEd Daily: 3 quick bites | OpenEd

[![](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Artboard-6.jpg)](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Artboard-6.jpg)

==Happy Friday!==

==Today we’ve curated three quick reads to get you in the back-to-school mood.==

==**In this edition:**==

- ==Why more breaks could be what your child needs to get unstuck 🤯==
- ==Letting your kids struggle might be the best thing you do for them 🏔️== 
- ==The unexpected journey of a mom who said “No way” to homeschooling 🏠📚==

==Before we dive in – a quick favor to ask:==

==**Can you reply to this email and share what kinds of blogs, influencers, or Facebook pages you follow related to education or parenting? If so, two things will happen:**==

1. ==I’ll reply with something you might find interesting (and yes, I always reply).==
2. ==I’ll be able to keep the newsletter relevant for all of you==

==– Charlie (the OpenEd newsletter guy)==

### ==The Surprising Key to Learning Retention: More Breaks==

==[New research](https://www.edutopia.org/article/we-drastically-underestimate-importance-brain-breaks/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=3-quick-bites&_bhlid=95d7e2fbbe67efeb639a195ed3a9ba4e362b3c87)== ==suggests that schools drastically underestimate the importance of “brain breaks” for learning. A 2021 study found that during short breaks, your brain replays practice sessions at 20x speed. The mind isn’t resting – it’s working overtime to “bind” new skills to existing memories and consolidate lessons. The study also looked at test scores, which usually drop as the school day progresses. But when students took breaks, scores went== _==up==_ ==throughout the day.==

==**How often should you take a break (according to reseachers)?**==

- ==Elementary students: Every 10-15 minutes==
- ==Middle/High school: Every 20-30 minutes==

==(Maybe homeschoolers who follow a more flexible schedule were onto something all along.)==

## The ROI of Personalized Education | OpenEd

## ==💡 THOUGHT==

### ==The ROI of Personalized Ed==

==We keep hearing that personalized education is “too expensive.” But what’s the real cost?==

==Jonathan Chizik, a co-founder of SmartPath,== ==[runs the numbers](https://smartpath.school/the-roi-of-homeschooling?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=061-the-roi-of-personalized-education)====:==

- ==Traditional private schools: $12,000-30,000/year==
- ==Customized learning at home: $500-2,500/year==

==Meanwhile, Chizik notes== ==[that homeschooled students score 15-30 percentile points higher on standardized tests than their traditionally schooled peers](https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=061-the-roi-of-personalized-education)====. (Not that standardized tests are the gold standard—we’re more interested in creating lifelong learners than expert test-takers.)==

==**Think about that:**== ==Better results. Lower costs. More flexibility.==

==With today’s tools like Khan Academy, Outschool, and Time4Learning (to name just a few), personalized education isn’t just more affordable – it’s more effective.==

==Why do we think that learning must happen in expensive buildings, or that personalization is a luxury?==

That’s why we’re intrigued by== ==[SmartPath](https://smartpath.school/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=061-the-roi-of-personalized-education)====, a new AI-powered tool entering beta testing.==

==The concept is simple: Answer a few questions about your child’s needs, interests, and learning style, and SmartPath’s AI suggests a curated list of homeschooling resources and options.==

==While the platform is still in beta (and we’re eagerly awaiting our chance to test it), early feedback from parent testers sounds promising:==

- ==“Define longitude and latitude and give boundaries of the five zones.”==
- ==“Find cost at 12½ cents per sq. yd. of kalsomining the walls of a room 20 ft. long, 16 ft. wide and 9 ft. high, deducting 1 door 8 ft. by 4 ft. 6 in. and 2 windows 5 ft. by 3 ft. 6 in. each.”==
- ==“Name and locate these cities: Mobile, Quebec, Buenos Aires, Liverpool, Honolulu.” (Without Google Maps!)==

==And here we were, thinking “kalsomining” was just a typo. It’s actually a type of whitewash paint (we had to look it up).==

### ==“But I Work Full-Time…”==

==Last week, we shared== ==[research on the “ROI” of homeschooling](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.hqn5fvRZGNlF5Uv2NRQYleumk5kEk5K_4mpEDgDEwf2KmBafUTuSFchWOx1Es1A2C7J-jPflYmPw-tqdb4DAO4yXkv2Je1LPcmWhlAv48YAGgigdJyZBq-GOn-5NmDJ3Vwn-qqO9dMQOz5TmGD76lXhYGvsEehZ03cRe-gxAfYaTXyVkrmdwoYHoFxxafA8OUDmkPMBnOES5WXr_PrsQWCZajXrce6SPxn7D0XMfm-xbesWwhtMpVXRgg1TO8be5gTnwJaU44qpeSi-s69Rk4bV0dztdjFO4Lx5UgNvfGdQ/4av/ZXE40ilHRVCd2MHhmmoOew/h7/h001.HwJyyDoYCsTrP446VQYBfcErvr2yoHsseXZeBfqqOdQ?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=064-custom-education-for-single-and-working-parents)====, showing how it can be more affordable and effective than traditional private education. But a reader, Virginia, replied with an important reality check:==

_==“I work in technology, and I’ve been unable to find a work-from-home position that would allow the flexibility to homeschool. My husband and I both work outside the home… it is 100% of the reason I am not homeschooling my kids.”==_

==She’s right – the “true cost” of homeschooling must include the opportunity cost of reduced work hours or staying out of the workforce entirely. And that’s a deal-breaker for many families.==

==But here’s the good news:== ==**You don’t have to choose between work and personalized education.**==

==[Meet Sunny Simkins](https://youtu.be/Y5U8Hm0iei4?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=064-custom-education-for-single-and-working-parents)====, a single working mom with two kids in public school, who works in OpenEd’s Learning division.==

==“Public school provides the daytime support I need,” she explains. “But I’ve identified my kids’ learning styles and interests… and I make sure they have outlets for all of that. I don’t just assume school will handle it all.”==

==Her solution? Strategic add-ons and after-school programs:==

- ==Mathnasium for her daughter who needs extra help with math==
- ==Ninja Warrior classes for her son who needs movement==
- ==Community theater for creative expression (who doesn’t need that?)==

==If you can’t homeschool… If you need to work full-time… If public school is your only option… You can STILL customize your child’s education. The secret isn’t fighting the system. It’s getting creative with the pieces you have..==

### ==Gaming Gets Serious About Digital Literacy==

==A conversation between== ==[AEI’s education scholar Rick Hess](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/this-group-is-trying-to-teach-digital-literacy-heres-how/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=064-custom-education-for-single-and-working-parents)== ==and a former Stanford professor just revealed how Microsoft’s Minecraft – the world’s best-selling video game with over 300 million copies sold – is tackling one of education’s biggest challenges: digital literacy.==

==The Digital Inquiry Group (DIG), founded by former Stanford professor Sam Wineburg, has partnered with Microsoft to teach kids something more valuable than building virtual worlds—how to navigate the== _==real==_ ==digital world. Through interactive lessons and Microsoft’s new “Search Coach” browser, students learn to spot unreliable sources and identify conflicts of interest.==

==We were ahead of this curve with== ==[our Minecraft STEAM Foundations course (available for grades 3-8)](https://launchpad.neolms.com/visitor_catalog_class/show/4742474?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=064-custom-education-for-single-and-working-parents)====, which blends creative exploration with real-world problem-solving.

### ==The Sacred Hour==

==Whether you’re homeschooling full-time or supplementing after school, here’s a powerful technique we’ve heard from dozens of families: Create a “sacred hour” for learning.==

==**The concept is simple:**==

- ==Pick one consistent hour==
- ==Make it completely distraction-free==
- ==Be fully present (no multitasking!)==
- ==Treat it like an important appointment==

==**For example:**== ==If your child struggles with math, make 4-5 PM your “sacred math hour” every Tuesday and Thursday. No phones, no dishes, no distractions – just focused learning time.==

## Is your kid a night owl? | OpenEd

### ==Are You Homeschooling or Bringing School Home?==

==When== ==[Jamie Lesko first started homeschooling](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-017-from-classroom-teacher-to-homeschool-mom/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=069-is-your-kid-a-night-owl)====, she did what many teachers-turned-homeschoolers do: she recreated school at home. Desks. Rigid schedules. Planners. She fought her son’s regular meltdowns.==

==Then one day, she found all three kids doing schoolwork atop a closet loft.==

==Her first instinct was to worry. But then she had an epiphany: “Why do they have to learn at a desk?”==

==[Watch/Listen to Jamie’s full story](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-017-from-classroom-teacher-to-homeschool-mom/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=069-is-your-kid-a-night-owl)==

### ==Nocturnal Notions: Where Learning Takes Flight==

==The philosopher Hegel once wrote of the “Owl of Minerva,” which “spreads its wings only with the falling of the dusk.” He was speaking about wisdom’s tendency to arrive at unexpected hours – a metaphor that’s taking on new meaning in education today.==

==Just ask Jamie, whose daughter does her best math work at 10:30 PM.==

==“When we were in traditional school, that would have been completely irresponsible,” Jamie recalls. “We had to get up early every morning… But now we’ve discovered when each child learns best.”==

==Some minds shine brightest after dark. Personalized schedules allow learners to learn as they wish.==

## ==⚒️ TOOL==

### ==The Two-Week Rule==

==Picture this: Your 12-year-old declares their math curriculum “the worst thing ever” after one frustrating morning. Before you panic-buy a new curriculum (we’ve all been there),== ==[try Jamie’s “two-week rule.”](https://youtu.be/QsE-ykzzgJg?si=QNnXMzY3HRTDMxQZ&t=1107&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=069-is-your-kid-a-night-owl)== ==This approach (considered a best practice in special education) suggests giving any new intervention at least two weeks before changing course.==

==**Here’s how it works:**==

1. ==When your child protests, tell them:== _==“Two weeks. That’s all I ask.”==_
2. ==During the two weeks: Document what works and what doesn’t==
3. ==After two weeks: Have an honest chat==

==The rule teaches persistence without being rigid and shows kids you take their input seriously. It also prevents expensive curriculum-hopping and the cost of switching midstream.==

==Sometimes the only way to know if something works is to give it an honest try.==

It’s a smart strategy – tutoring works.==

==But what about everyone else? We might look to new solutions emerging outside of traditional, costly brick-and-mortar tutoring centers:==

- ==Online platforms like== ==[Wyzant](https://www.wyzant.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=073-what-comes-first-the-lessons-or-the-test)====,== ==[Skooli](https://www.skooli.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=073-what-comes-first-the-lessons-or-the-test)== ==and== ==[tutors.com](https://tutors.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=073-what-comes-first-the-lessons-or-the-test)==

==Unlike generic AI chatbots, Khanmigo is designed explicitly for learning:==

- ==Guides you through problems step-by-step==
- ==Supports your writing process (without writing for you)==
- ==Engages you in debates to strengthen arguments==
- ==Transforms into historical figures for deeper discussions==

==“It has completely revolutionized our homeschool,” says Katie, a homeschool parent. “It is perfect for a family that asks ‘why’ constantly. It is so much more time-efficient than trying to piece together intelligent answers from many sources.”==

==The coolest part? It thinks before it speaks. Khanmigo has “hidden thoughts” that help it be more Socratic and guide you to discoveries rather than just feeding information.==

==If you’ve tried it already, reply to this email and tell us what you think!gether as a team.==

## ==(STAT) OF THE DAY==

### ==The “Two Sigma Effect”==

==In 1984, researcher== ==[Benjamin Bloom discovered that students who received one-on-one tutoring performed two standard deviations better than their classroom-only peers](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/0013189X013006004?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=073-what-comes-first-the-lessons-or-the-test)====. In plain English, that means tutoring can launch an average student to the top of their class. Even “mastery learning” approaches, where students can progress at their own pace, only achieved about one sigma improvement.==

==Bloom called this the “2 Sigma== _==problem==_==” because while tutoring clearly worked best, providing a personal tutor for every student seemed economically impossible.==

==Forty years later, can a combination of more open education and AI tools help us crack this code?==

### ==The Rise of “Roadschooling”==

==Remember when “field trips” meant annual visits to the museum? Today’s educational pioneers are taking that concept to a whole new level.== ==[Meet the Douse family](https://simplehomeschool.net/life-of-a-roadschooler/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=075-how-to-create-a-high-school-transcript)====, who turned their car into a classroom and Spain into their textbook.

- ==Speaking Spanish at local markets (language immersion)==
- ==Exploring Gaudi architecture (art history)==
- ==Navigating car repairs in a foreign country (real-world problem solving)==

==Their 16-year-old’s verdict? “Best week of work I’ve ever had!”==

==Traditional boundaries between “school” and “life” are dissolving as families craft education around their lifestyle – not the other way around.==

### ==The “Translation Method” for Creating High School Transcripts==

==“Wait – how do I put== _==that==_ ==on a transcript?”==

==If you’ve ever asked this question about your teen’s unconventional learning experiences,== ==[a veteran homeschool mom offers a liberating approach](https://www.humilityanddoxology.com/essential-tips-for-homeschooling-high-schoolers/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=075-how-to-create-a-high-school-transcript)====: think like a== _==translator==_==, not a transcriber.==

==**The Translation Method in Action:**==

- ==Your Reality → Their Language==
- ==Nature journaling + science reading + field studies → “Biology with Lab”==
- ==Classic literature + writing + mythology studies → “English 10”==
- ==Civil War reenactments + primary source reading → “U.S. History”==

==**What about credit hours? An example helps. For literature credits:**==

1. ==Look up Audible duration of assigned books==
2. ==Add up total hours==
3. ==Include discussion and writing time==
4. ==You’ve got your credit hours!==

==**Pro Tips:**==

- ==Save the creative course names for your family records==
- ==Use conventional subject titles on official documents==
- ==Focus on making your student’s learning legible to others==

==Remember: A transcript is simply a communication device. Like a resume, it’s meant to highlight real achievements in a standardized format that others can understand. You’re not compromising your educational philosophy—you’re making it comprehensible to institutions. Once you start thinking like a translator, you can relax and focus on real learning, not record-keeping.==

### ==Hypnic Jerk==

==From “hypnos” (Greek for sleep) + “jerk” (sudden movement) – a brief, involuntary muscle spasm or sudden startle that occurs during the transition from wakefulness to sleep, often accompanied by a sensation of falling. Also known as a “sleep start” or “hypnagogic jerk,” these falling “dreams” actually occur before true dream sleep begins, during the initial transition to sleep.==

_==**“No matter what curriculum you’re using, no matter whether you’re an unschooler or an online schooler, whatever you’re doing, as long as you keep trying, you won’t ruin your kids.”**==_

==This isn’t an excuse to give up when the going gets tough. But you don’t need to be perfect. You don’t need to know everything. You just need to keep showing up.==

==The real damage doesn’t come from making mistakes – it comes from being too afraid to try at all.==

### ==The New Career Navigation Crisis==

==Here’s a paradox: As career paths multiply and diversify, students are having a harder time finding their way forward. The traditional “college or bust” mindset has exploded into a maze of possibilities – but our support systems are stuck in the past.==

==Think about it: We’re asking teenagers to navigate an increasingly complex future with almost no guidance. In U.S. high schools, each counselor juggles an average of 408 students. That’s not support – that’s crowd control.==

==[Sierra College found a smarter path through their Career Coach platform](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2024/11/05/empowering-students-to-bridge-the-gap-between-high-school-and-career-success/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=076-the-four-hour-revolution)====.

### ==The Four-Hour School Day==

==In his best-selling book== _==[The 4-Hour Work Week](https://fourhourworkweek.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=076-the-four-hour-revolution)==_==, Tim Ferriss challenged the assumption that productivity requires long hours. Now, veteran homeschoolers like Sandy Grant are proving you don’t need an 8-hour school day to deliver powerful learning.==

==She employs a focused four-hour framework that’s more about efficiency than endless worksheets.==

==“I try to keep it to about four hours of school so they’re done by 2 or 3 in the afternoon and can have plenty of time to do their own thing,” Sandy says.==

==The morning block (2 hours) tackles the heavy lifting:==

- ==Math lesson + practice==
- ==Reading/Writing==
- ==Parent-led instruction==

==The afternoon block (2 hours) opens up:==

- ==Independent work==
- ==Project time==
- ==Online courses==

==When you strip away the busywork, transitions, and institutional overhead of traditional schooling, you realize that most core academic work can happen in about four hours. That unlocks the rest of the day for deep dives into personal interests, projects, and real-world learning.==

### ==Is Technology Improving Educational Outcomes?==

==A provocative== ==[new report from After Babel](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-edtech-revolution-has-failed?r=5d1ba&utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true)== ==suggests that the so-called “EdTech revolution” has been nothing of the sort. Global test scores are declining, and research shows that students using computers “very frequently” at school tend to perform== _==worse==_==.==

==What’s interesting is that the same research shows that technology’s impact varies dramatically depending on how it’s used:==

- ==Science showed minimal gains (0.18)==
- ==Reading showed small gains (0.25)==
- ==Writing and Math showed modest gains (0.32 and 0.33 respectively)==

==None of these are considered impressive metrics.==

==The one area where the study found a sizable positive impact from technology was for students with specific learning needs==

==**What’s going on here?**== 

==It should be obvious: technology isn’t a magic wand you can wave over a classroom of 30 diverse learners. It’s a== _==tool==_ ==that only works when matched to specific student needs and learning goals. At OpenEd, we don’t just throw technology at kids – we help them integrate it into a== _==personalized learning plan.==_

## The Hidden Value of Chores | OpenEd

## ==💡 THOUGHT==

### ==The Hidden Value of Chores==

==Growing up homeschooled, my mom wasn’t always consistent with academic curricula. She’d buy stacks of books at education fairs that we’d never finish. But there was one thing she never wavered on: household chores.==

==At the time, it felt like just another task. But when I entered traditional high school, I found myself breezing through homework – often finishing work before leaving school –while my peers struggled to keep up.==

==Why? Those years of managing household duties taught me how to break down tasks, stick to a schedule, and follow through consistently. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, completing my assigned chores like laundry and sweeping had built the exact skills needed for academic success.==

==Parents stress about grades and academic achievement, but real-life skills often come from simpler sources. Managing regular responsibilities builds executive function, and these skills transfer to everything else in life.==

==Your child might never use what they learn in AP biology again. But their ability to consistently complete tasks and manage time will last forever.==

### ==The Other Inflation==

==In just one year, the percentage of students scoring a 4 or 5 on AP U.S. History jumped from 25% to 46% (!).==

==So… did teens suddenly discover a new passion for== _==Habeas Corpus==_ ==and Alexander Hamilton’s rap career?==

==[“Not so fast,” says University of Texas history professor Steven Mintz.](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/academic-rigor-is-in-decline-a-college-professor-reflects-on-ap-scores/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=079-the-hidden-value-of-chores)==

==When these same AP students arrive in his class at college, he observes that many “fail to demonstrate the content knowledge or writing skills” expected at the university level.==

==This shouldn’t surprise us. Large institutions like the College Board (which administers Advanced Placement tests) favor== _==what they can==_ _==measure==_ ==over what== _==matters==_==.==

==Genuine education is stubbornly resistant to standardization. Skills like critical thinking, deep analysis, and clear writing are getting left behind in favor of inflated test scores that mask the underlying reality.==

==The upside is that students who can actually write, think, and engage with ideas will stand out more than ever as colleges and employers grow skeptical of standardized measures.enEd, we don’t just throw technology at kids – we help them integrate it into a== _==personalized learning plan.==_

1. ==Create a “Morning Time” Ritual – start the day with activities everyone can do together (like daily readings, memory work, or music appreciation). This builds family culture while efficiently covering shared material.==
2. ==Think “One-Room Schoolhouse.” Teach the same topics at different levels. Let older kids work independently while you help younger ones, and have older students teach younger ones (it reinforces their learning)==
3. ==Work in waves:==
    - ==Start with the youngest learners when they’re fresh==
    - ==Schedule independent work for older kids==
    - ==Save deeper discussions with teens for evening hours/==

## 3 words to transform conversations with your kids | OpenEd

### ==“It’s Like Having a Baby”==

_==“When I first started homeschooling, there was that fear that I had to mimic a school schedule… Later I was like, ‘I don’t need to do all this. I can be more relaxed.’”==_

==–====[Cassie Shepherd, home-centered learning (@homecenteredlearning)](https://www.instagram.com/homecenteredlearning/?hl=en&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=080-3-words-to-transform-conversations-with-your-kids)==

==Starting a home-centered learning routine, Cassie Shepherd says, is like having a baby: As soon as you master nursing, they start eating solids, and everything changes. You can’t stick to the manual because there isn’t one.==

==Where she once attempted to follow a rigid school schedule, her kids now do math on the front porch. Her engineer-in-training builds all day. Her artist fills notebooks with drawings. Not because a curriculum demands it, but because that’s how she’s discovered her children learn best.==

### ==“Aestheticore” and the Teen Identity Crisis==

==On TikTok they call themselves “dark academia strawberry milk girls” and post videos of green juice at dawn. They create Pinterest boards of cottagecore aesthetics and call it identity. They are fifteen, sixteen, seventeen. They are searching.==

==[An eye-opening essay by Emma Sloan](https://www.humilityanddoxology.com/aestheticore/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=080-3-words-to-transform-conversations-with-your-kids)====, a 17-year-old homeschooled student, shines some much-needed light on why Generation Z seems obsessed with these aesthetic labels – from “dark academia” to “cottagecore” to “That Girl.”==

==Sloan’s argument isn’t that Gen-Z has too many identities. It’s that they’re desperately looking for one that matters.==

==When young people are cut off from deeper traditions and thrust into standardized schooling, they’ll grasp at superficial identities to feel unique. They’ll build what Emma calls “philosophy castles in quicksand pits” – elaborate systems of meaning based on nothing but aesthetics and trends.==

==The solution isn’t fewer identities. It’s stronger ones. It’s giving young people:==

- ==The freedom to explore deeply==
- ==Connection to wisdom across generations==
- ==Space to develop authentic interests==
- ==Real problems to solve==
- ==A foundation to build from==

==When you’re truly becoming yourself, you don’t need a Pinterest board to prove it.==

### ==Three Magic Words: “Tell Me More”==

==Want to unlock deeper conversations with your kids? Stop asking “what” questions.==

==When your child is drawing, your instinct might be to ask “What’s that?” But as Cassie Shepherd points out, specific questions often lead to dead-end answers. Instead, try these three words:== _==**“Tell me more.”**==_

==Why it works:==

- ==Opens the conversation instead of closing it==
- ==Lets your child lead the story==
- ==Invites deeper sharing==

==Try it out and let us know how it goes!==

### ==Acton Academy: “Each Person Who Enters Here Is a Hero”==

==Walk into an Acton Academy, and you might think the adults are slacking. No one’s at the front of the room. No one’s giving lectures. No one’s assigning homework.==

==That’s the point.==

==Founded in 2009, Acton believes every child is a hero on their own journey. Students run their own discussions, set their own goals, and even vote on their own rules. Teachers are called “guides,” and their job is to ask questions, not give answers.==

==The results? Their students typically test several grade levels above their age group (not that we’re counting).==

### ==The 7-Hour Question==

==Much ink has been spilled over the question of whether kids need to spend 7 hours a day in school. Some swear that 2 hours is enough for daily academics, but== ==[an unscientific (ahem… Reddit) survey of families](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1gp6plc/eighth_grader_with_executive_dysfunction/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=083-is-there-life-on-mars)== ==educating outside traditional schools reveals 3 to 4 hours as closer to the norm.==

==If kids can keep up with their school-based peers in half the time, what are all of those superfluous hours spent on?==

- ==Getting 20+ kids to do the same thing?==
- ==Transitioning between subjects?==
- ==Doing the hokey-pokey?==

==What’s worse, in a one-size-fits-all classroom, a child who blazes through math but needs extra time with reading has to wait during math and rush through reading. The whole class can only move as fast as the slowest student in each subject – or else leave some students behind.==

==There’s nothing wrong with longer days if they’re filled with meaningful activity. But let’s stop pretending the length of the school day has much to do with how children actually learn.==

### ==Is there life on MARS?==

==Remember when a “hybrid” education meant part-time school, part-time home? No longer.==

==[MARS](https://micromars.org/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=083-is-there-life-on-mars)== ==[(the Microcollective of AI, Robotics, and the Sciences), a new hybrid program in Huntsville, Alabama](https://micromars.org/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=083-is-there-life-on-mars)== ==is rewriting the rules of what a school day looks like. They’re ditching the traditional 7-hour schedule in favor of:==

- ==Project-based STEM learning==
- ==AI writing workshops==
- ==Virtual reality experiences==

==Students complete their academic studies in half the time, leaving space for deep dives into their passions. With a majority of their learners having special needs, including many twice-exceptional students, MARS is proving that different doesn’t mean slower.==

==The model is catching fire: They plan to expand to 100 rec centers across Alabama, each serving 20 students at just $7,000 per year.==

### ==The “Sportscaster” Method: Your Child’s First Reading Lesson==

==Before your child can read, they need to understand something more basic: words represent real things.==

==But here’s what’s not-so-basic: Your three-year-old is a pattern-seeking machine, desperately trying to crack the language code.==

==“Just narrate everything,” says Samantha Westmoreland, writer-in-residence at== ==[Guidepost Montessori](https://x.com/guidepostschool?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=083-is-there-life-on-mars)====,== ==[on the Hannah Frankman podcast](https://arc.net/l/quote/cubwvboq?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=083-is-there-life-on-mars)====.==

==“It sounds weird, but it works.”==

==**So try this:**== ==Narrate everything you do. Like a sports announcer, but for daily life.==

- ==“I’m turning the doorknob.”==
- ==“The water is flowing into the cup.”==
- ==“We’re pushing the swing higher.”==

==It feels silly. Do it anyway. Because when you connect clear words to real actions, you’re teaching their brain to connect symbols with meaning. That’s what reading is.==

### ==“Why do you care so much about personalized education?”==

==When Ela asked Keri Mae this question on our podcast, her answer stopped us in our tracks:==

==**“Love. That’s what it’s about at the end of the day.”**==

==Keri described something every parent has witnessed: Kids arrive in this world as little sponges, vibrating with curiosity, ready to absorb everything around them. Eyes wide. Questions endless. Wonder unlimited.==

==Then something happens.==

==“It’s heartbreaking to see that squashed,” she says. “To see a kid in kindergarten going ‘I hate school’ or ‘I can’t read.’ You came in with such vibrancy… what happened?”==

==This is why we fight for open education. Not because of test scores or college admissions or future earning potential.==

==Because we love our kids. Because we see their spark. Because we refuse to let that spark die.==

==👏 👏 👏 Learning sticks better when it connects to real life.👏 👏 👏== 

==When researchers studied over 2,300 third-graders, students doing real-world projects outperformed their peers by 8 percentage points – regardless of reading level or background.==

==But the real evidence? Think about how your toddler learned to walk. They didn’t read a manual or take a “Bipedal Movement 101” course. They watched, tried, failed, adjusted, and tried again. That’s authentic learning.==

==Now imagine if we applied this to all education:==

- ==Instead of memorizing business terms, start a mini-business==
- ==Instead of reading about ecology, plant a garden==
- ==Instead of studying local government, attend city council meetings==

==Is this the future of education?==

## ==📊 TREND==

### ==Will AI Flip the Role of the Classroom Teacher?==

==In the original meaning, the idea of the “flipped classroom” meant teachers assigning videos to watch at home, reserving class time for discussion and help with homework.==

==Though it was never adopted in mainstream schools, flipping the classroom makes sense as a way to deliver knowledge more efficiently while providing personalized support.==

==However, AI is now giving the classroom an even bigger flip.==

==“If you are a professorial-style teacher, you will be out of a job. If you are a facilitator, it will enhance your practice,” says Jonathan Bergman, one of the pioneers of the original flipped model. “Teachers who view themselves as the ringleader of a circus will get a boost from AI.”==

==Instead of watching pre-recorded videos, students are already learning concepts from AI tutors that adapt to their pace and questions (as Andrew Wilkinson noted above). In the future, teachers might become “learning architects” rather than just content deliverers – guiding discussions, designing real-world projects, and helping students apply what they’ve learned. Classrooms might be redefined as spaces for human connection and real-world application.==

==[Microsoft just released a free game-changing AI reading tutor](https://coach.microsoft.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=092-ai-might-be-education-s-most-patient-assistant)====, available on both web browsers and as a Windows app. As your child reads aloud, the AI listens and adapts, identifying which words are challenging and weaving those words into future practice.==

==Instead of just reading pre-made texts, your child can be the story director – choosing characters, settings, and reading level to generate their own personalized stories. When kids help create the story, the theory goes, they’ll be more invested in reading it. As they read aloud, Reading Coach tracks their progress, offers gentle support, and celebrates when they master challenging words. Reading Coach is also more suitable for kids under the age of 13 and comes with parental controls.==

### ==The Public is Catching Up==

==[Dr. Phil recently just called it “the fastest growing trend in American education.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S98fZa6Bh1Y&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=094-the-fastest-growing-trend-in-american-education)== ==But the real trend is visible in the comments section of his recent episode on “unschooling,” where dozens of former skeptics are saying: “Wait… maybe those parents were right all along.”==

==The segment featured a family living on a farm, where the children learned through immersive experiences – from building fairy villages (geometry) to managing fires and caring for livestock.==

==“I’m a former public school teacher with a Master’s Degree in Education,” wrote one viewer. “I left teaching in 2021… and I believe without a shadow of a doubt that unschooling is the future of education.”==

==Another commenter noted, “We live in a day and age where information is free… It’s up to us as parents to take our children’s education into our own hands.”==

==Of course, when this family first shared their unschooling journey on social media, the trolls came out: “Educational neglect!” “Save these children!” But their fury only proved the point: When you challenge people’s assumptions about learning, you discover how deeply those assumptions run.==

==Unschooling might be perfect for some families, while others thrive with more structure. What matters is finding what works for your child.==

==Unlike traditional speed reading programs focusing on pacing exercises, Infinite Mind takes a “whole brain” approach. Through a mix of reading therapy, vision exercises, and brain-training games, it aims to strengthen the connection between both sides of the brain.==

==The sweet spot seems to be around fourth grade – that crucial time when kids decide if they’re going to “really care about school or just slide through,” as Sonja puts it. Ten years later, her son still credits the program for his academic success and is using it again to prepare for college.==

==**Key Features:**==

- ==7-minute daily brain training sessions==
- ==Combines reading, visual, and brain-strengthening exercises==
- ==Available as a mobile app==

==The program costs around $199 for a lifetime license (accessible at no cost via OpenEd).extended family to virtual showcases. The beauty of sprints is that they create natural momentum and clear finish lines.==

## How to get your child to take you seriously as the 'teacher' | OpenEd

==Curriculum should be a springboard, not a straightjacket.==

==The magic of open education comes from molding lessons around your child’s unique spark, not forcing them into a one-size-fits-all box.==

### ==Fuzzy lines==

==Have you noticed that the lines between “public,” “private,” and “homeschool” are getting fuzzier?==

==Independent study charter schools, part-time microschools, co-ops and learning pods (not to mention OpenEd) defy the old labels. Let’s unpack the forces behind this:==

1. ==Technology enabling personalized and remote education==
2. ==Funding following students, not systems==
3. ==Demand for flexible attendance and scheduling options==

==Parents (and students) want customized educational experiences that incorporate elements of multiple approaches.==

==It’s a continuum, not an either/or.==

### ==How to get your child to take you seriously as the ‘teacher’?==

[==Some parent advice==](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1g07vho/how_to_get_your_child_to_take_you_seriously_as/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=058-how-to-get-your-child-to-take-you-seriously-as-the-teacher) ==from the weird, wide world of Reddit:==

1. ==**Consistency:**== ==“My kids didn’t take me seriously until I made us stick to a strict schedule.” Try setting a routine: breakfast at 8:00, school starts at 9:00, with a predictable order of subjects.==
2. ==**Engagement:**== ==“I do my best to keep the quiet listening parts of lessons to no more than 10 to 15 minutes.” Mix it up with movement and discussion to keep kids focused.==
3. ==**Flexibility:**== ==“Kids are allowed to have bad days, they’re people too. So are you!” Don’t beat yourself up if things don’t always go according to plan.==
4. ==**Agency:**== ==One parent describes sitting down with their kids weekly to plan assignments: “Having those choices for themselves gives them a sense of ownership, teaches them time management and self-control.”==
5. ==**Natural Consequences:**== ==“One rule in our house is that if you haven’t finished the work you gave yourself for the day, screen time is at the parent’s discretion.” Let the punishment fit the crime, so to speak.==

==We would add that you don’t always have to think of yourself as a teacher. The resources available to parent–educators allow you to serve as more of a facilitator.==

## Conditioning vs. Education | OpenEd

- ==**1 thought**==
- ==**1 trend**== 
- ==**1 tool**==

==And for fun, we’ll sometimes toss in a bonus== ==**‘( __ ) of the day’**== ==– a meme, a word, a quote, or an educational philosophy.==

### ==THOUGHT==

## ==Education vs. Conditioning==

==The== [==latest podcast==](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-007-5-building-blocks-of-open-education-with-isaac-morehouse/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=030-conditioning-vs-education) ==features Isaac Morehouse musing on the definition of education – which he distinguishes from mere conditioning (i.e., there’s a difference between learning and just salivating at the sound of a bell).==

==**Education**==

==**Conditioning**==

==Involves agency and willingness to learn==

==Imposed from outside==

==Conscious participation==

==Shapes behavior through rewards/punishments==

==Teaches== ==_how_== ==to think==

==Teaches== ==_what_== ==to think==

==Nurtures problem-solving abilities==

==Focuses on fact regurgitation==

==Driven by curiosity==

==Driven by compliance==

==**Key Takeaway:**== ==All humans are born learners. A toddler using a footstool to reach a shelf is a tiny scientist at work. But traditional schooling often stifles this innate drive, replacing curiosity with compliance.==

==**Food for Thought:**== ==Your paper certificate might show your level of conditioning, not your level of education. Discuss among yourselves.==

## ==The rapid growth of microschools==

==Education is evolving towards greater flexibility and personalization.== [==Microschools, founded by parents or teachers seeking more adaptable learning environments, are proliferating==](https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/education/4574859-the-us-is-experiencing-a-boom-in-microschools-what-are-they/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=030-conditioning-vs-education)==. The names and varieties are hard to keep track of… Acton, Montessori, Waldorf, and forest schools, to name a few.==

==Furthermore, traditional boundaries between different educational methods are blurring. We’re seeing hybrid models where students might attend public school part-time while pursuing other educational opportunities. As public schools face declining enrollment, they’re adapting by offering virtual options and more flexible schedules.==

==Parents may soon approach their child’s education for the year like college students planning their course schedules – selecting from a wide array of in-person and online options, public and private institutions, tutors, and homeschool resources. The shift towards open education isn’t about prescribing a single “right” way to learn but about expanding possibilities for every learner.==

## ==The sculpture approach==

==Think of educating your kids less like a painting and more like a sculpture. In other words, instead of agonizing over the perfect brush strokes, focus on chiseling away what doesn’t work from a hunk of granite.==

==Here’s how to apply the “educational sculpture” approach:==

- ==Identify what’s not working for each child==
- ==Remove those elements that cause stress or hinder learning==
- ==Allow space for natural interests to emerge==
- ==Test different methods and approaches==
- ==Gradually refine your approach as you learn what works best==

==Sometimes there’s more to be gained from subtraction than addition.==

==As Michelangelo said, “I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free.”==

==He didn’t create David by adding more marble. He “liberated David from within the stone. Your child’s potential is already there – your job is to chip away at what’s obscuring it.==

Here’s how to transform reading from a chore into an adventure:==

1. ==**Model the behavior:**== ==Let your kids see you enjoying books.==
2. ==**Freedom of choice:**== ==Let your kids pick books that interest them.==
3. ==**Curate classics:**== ==Introduce timeless stories with conversational potential.==
4. ==**Engage in dialogue:**== ==Ask thought-provoking questions about their reading:==
    - ==“What would you do if you were the main character?”==
    - ==“How would you have handled that situation differently?”==
5. ==**Create scenarios:**== ==Present enticing or challenging situations based on their reading and ask them to defend their choices.==
6. ==**Make it a family affair:**== ==Discuss books together, turning reading into a shared experience.==

==He emphasizes that most kids naturally love stories – our job is to maintain that “factory setting” of curiosity and excitement.==

==**Bonus tip:**== ==Try audiobooks for long car rides or while doing chores. It’s a great way to sneak in extra “reading” time!==

### ==The Perfectionism Paradox==

==The more you chase the perfect day, the fewer productive learning days you have.==

==The real transformation comes from understanding:==

- ==Consistency > Perfection==
- ==Progress > Plans==
- ==Showing up > Giving up==

[==Pam Barnhill’s latest podcast offers a formula for what she calls the “Minimum Viable Day”==](https://pambarnhill.com/why-perfectionism-is-sabotaging-your-homeschool/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=why-perfectionism-is-sabotaging-your-homeschool)==:==

1. ==Define non-negotiable subjects for YOUR family==
2. ==Create flexible time blocks (not rigid schedules)==
3. ==Build in buffer time for real life==
4. ==Focus on learning momentum, not daily completion==

==A consistently “good enough” routine accomplishes more than the occasional perfect day.==

==It’s a curriculum built around thinking, not calculating; discovery, not memorization. But what caught our eye was the 24/7 support.==

==Parents report their kids getting excited about math (no, really!). As one mom in Alberta put it: “We discovered the music and artistry, the elegance and playfulness… that can be REAL math!”==

==Want to test it out? They offer a free starter kit to see if their discovery method matches your teaching style.==

### ==orthogonal (or·thog·o·nal)==

==From Greek orthogōnios: orthos (straight, upright) + gōnia (angle), orthogonal usually refers to things that are independent, and uncorrelated – “of different or unrelated natures.”==

### ==Fuzzy lines==

==Have you noticed that the lines between “public,” “private,” and “homeschool” are getting fuzzier?==

==Independent study charter schools, part-time microschools, co-ops and learning pods (not to mention OpenEd) defy the old labels. Let’s unpack the forces behind this:==

1. ==Technology enabling personalized and remote education==
2. ==Funding following students, not systems==
3. ==Demand for flexible attendance and scheduling options==

==Parents (and students) want customized educational experiences that incorporate elements of multiple approaches.==

==It’s a continuum, not an either/or.==

## ==The rapid growth of microschools==

==Education is evolving towards greater flexibility and personalization.== ==[Microschools, founded by parents or teachers seeking more adaptable learning environments, are proliferating](https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/education/4574859-the-us-is-experiencing-a-boom-in-microschools-what-are-they/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=030-conditioning-vs-education)====. The names and varieties are hard to keep track of… Acton, Montessori, Waldorf, and forest schools, to name a few.==

==Furthermore, traditional boundaries between different educational methods are blurring. We’re seeing hybrid models where students might attend public school part-time while pursuing other educational opportunities. As public schools face declining enrollment, they’re adapting by offering virtual options and more flexible schedules.==

==Parents may soon approach their child’s education for the year like college students planning their course schedules – selecting from a wide array of in-person and online options, public and private institutions, tutors, and homeschool resources. The shift towards open education isn’t about prescribing a single “right” way to learn but about expanding possibilities for every learner.==

==**They teach:**== ==“Let’s discover how to solve it”==

==It’s a curriculum built around thinking, not calculating; discovery, not memorization. But what caught our eye was the 24/7 support.==

==Parents report their kids getting excited about math (no, really!). As one mom in Alberta put it: “We discovered the music and artistry, the elegance and playfulness… that can be REAL math!”==

==Want to test it out? They offer a free starter kit to see if their discovery method matches your teaching style.==

### ==“But I Work Full-Time…”==

==Last week, we shared== ==[research on the “ROI” of homeschooling](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.hqn5fvRZGNlF5Uv2NRQYleumk5kEk5K_4mpEDgDEwf2KmBafUTuSFchWOx1Es1A2C7J-jPflYmPw-tqdb4DAO4yXkv2Je1LPcmWhlAv48YAGgigdJyZBq-GOn-5NmDJ3Vwn-qqO9dMQOz5TmGD76lXhYGvsEehZ03cRe-gxAfYaTXyVkrmdwoYHoFxxafA8OUDmkPMBnOES5WXr_PrsQWCZajXrce6SPxn7D0XMfm-xbesWwhtMpVXRgg1TO8be5gTnwJaU44qpeSi-s69Rk4bV0dztdjFO4Lx5UgNvfGdQ/4av/ZXE40ilHRVCd2MHhmmoOew/h7/h001.HwJyyDoYCsTrP446VQYBfcErvr2yoHsseXZeBfqqOdQ?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=064-custom-education-for-single-and-working-parents)====, showing how it can be more affordable and effective than traditional private education. But a reader, Virginia, replied with an important reality check:==

_==“I work in technology, and I’ve been unable to find a work-from-home position that would allow the flexibility to homeschool. My husband and I both work outside the home… it is 100% of the reason I am not homeschooling my kids.”==_

==She’s right – the “true cost” of homeschooling must include the opportunity cost of reduced work hours or staying out of the workforce entirely. And that’s a deal-breaker for many families.==

==But here’s the good news:== ==**You don’t have to choose between work and personalized education.**==

==[Meet Sunny Simkins](https://youtu.be/Y5U8Hm0iei4?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=064-custom-education-for-single-and-working-parents)====, a single working mom with two kids in public school, who works in OpenEd’s Learning division.==

==“Public school provides the daytime support I need,” she explains. “But I’ve identified my kids’ learning styles and interests… and I make sure they have outlets for all of that. I don’t just assume school will handle it all.”==

==Her solution? Strategic add-ons and after-school programs:==

==If you can’t homeschool… If you need to work full-time… If public school is your only option… You can STILL customize your child’s education. The secret isn’t fighting the system. It’s getting creative with the pieces you have..==

## ==⚒️ TOOL==

### ==The Sacred Hour==

==Whether you’re homeschooling full-time or supplementing after school, here’s a powerful technique we’ve heard from dozens of families: Create a “sacred hour” for learning.==

==**The concept is simple:**==

- ==Pick one consistent hour==
- ==Make it completely distraction-free==
- ==Be fully present (no multitasking!)==
- ==Treat it like an important appointment==

==**For example:**== ==If your child struggles with math, make 4-5 PM your “sacred math hour” every Tuesday and Thursday. No phones, no dishes, no distractions – just focused learning time.==

Desks. Rigid schedules. Planners. She fought her son’s regular meltdowns.==

==Then one day, she found all three kids doing schoolwork atop a closet loft.==

==Her first instinct was to worry. But then she had an epiphany: “Why do they have to learn at a desk?”==

### ==Nocturnal Notions: Where Learning Takes Flight==

==The philosopher Hegel once wrote of the “Owl of Minerva,” which “spreads its wings only with the falling of the dusk.” He was speaking about wisdom’s tendency to arrive at unexpected hours – a metaphor that’s taking on new meaning in education today.==

==Just ask Jamie, whose daughter does her best math work at 10:30 PM.==

==“When we were in traditional school, that would have been completely irresponsible,” Jamie recalls. “We had to get up early every morning… But now we’ve discovered when each child learns best.”==

==Some minds shine brightest after dark. Personalized schedules allow learners to learn as they wish.==

## ==⚒️ TOOL==

### ==The Two-Week Rule==

==Picture this: Your 12-year-old declares their math curriculum “the worst thing ever” after one frustrating morning. Before you panic-buy a new curriculum (we’ve all been there),== ==[try Jamie’s “two-week rule.”](https://youtu.be/QsE-ykzzgJg?si=QNnXMzY3HRTDMxQZ&t=1107&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=069-is-your-kid-a-night-owl)== ==This approach (considered a best practice in special education) suggests giving any new intervention at least two weeks before changing course.==

==**Here’s how it works:**==

1. ==When your child protests, tell them:== _==“Two weeks. That’s all I ask.”==_
2. ==During the two weeks: Document what works and what doesn’t==
3. ==After two weeks: Have an honest chat==

==The rule teaches persistence without being rigid and shows kids you take their input seriously. It also prevents expensive curriculum-hopping and the cost of switching midstream.==

==Sometimes the only way to know if something works is to give it an honest try.==

### ==Curiosity > Curriculum==

==Humans will and must learn. It can’t be stopped. From the youngest age, toddlers constantly observe their surroundings, watch what others do, and experiment themselves.==

==They push, pull, and test things, always asking: “What happens if I do this?”==

==They’ve seen people use footstools and they’ve seen people reach for things on high shelves. In a moment of inspiration, they combine these ideas: move the footstool to the shelf and use it as a step to reach what they want. This is learning in action—the perfect blend of theory and practice.==

==But there’s also complex reasoning at play. When a child uses an object in a new way (like standing on a footstool they’ve only seen used for sitting) they’re making analogies and understanding systems. They connect dots in ways that demonstrate a deep, intuitive grasp of the world.==

==When you let children explore their interests, they can’t help but learn.==

### Obsessive interest can be a superpower | OpenEd

## ==💡 THOUGHT==

### ==“My kid is obsessed with just one subject. Should I be worried?”==

==**Our short answer:**== ==Feed your child’s interest with all the resources you can gather. It will likely shift over time. When kids do these deep dives, they’re learning how to learn. The obsessive approach often yields richer results than the traditional method of dividing subjects into neat 50-minute segments.==

==For example, Matt’s son once wanted to learn everything about diamonds—their history, value, and market appraisal based on colors and shapes. After a few weeks, he moved on to a different topic. Similarly, Isaac recently heard about an “unschooled” student who spent a whole year focused on fishing. Later, when he became interested in math, he applied the same “obsessive” mentality and learned it fast.==

[![](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Artboard-8.jpg)](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Artboard-8.jpg)

==One of the most common worries we hear from parents is around college readiness.==

- ==Am I doing enough to prepare my child?==
- ==Will he/she be competitive with other applicants if they don’t have a traditional diploma?==
- ==Is college even worth the price of admission these days?==

==**Let’s explore…**==

### ==In this edition:==

- ==📜 What’s a diploma worth without the skills to back it up?==
- ==🎓 How do homeschooler’s get into college?==
- ==🚀 Early College Programs: Earning Your Degree While Still in High School==

==Before getting into the advantages homeschoolers often have in college admissions (including the flexibility to take college courses early), let’s take a step back and ask: Is college the best path for everyone?==

==Here’s a sobering stat:== ==**52% of college graduates are underemployed.**==

==Now, let’s get real about what a degree actually does for you in the job market. Outside of fields where it’s legally required? Not much. There are often better ways to showcase your skills to employers. (====**Pro tip:**== ==Send a video pitch demonstrating your abilities. Nine times out of ten, they won’t even ask about your degree.)==

==So why the near-universal push for college? Often, it’s parents feeling the heat pressure to signal to society they did a good job.==

==There are plenty of good reasons to go to college, but social pressure isn’t one of them!==

==Make sure you know what your goals are and whether it’s truly the best way to reach them.==

### ==🎓 College Admissions Myth-Busting: Homeschoolers Edition==

==If your child is determined to go to college, the question arises…== ==[how do homeschoolers get in?](https://www.joinprisma.com/blog/how-do-homeschoolers-get-into-college?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=is-a-college-degree-still-worth-it)== ==The Prisma blog debunks the myth that you need a traditional diploma to stand out in admissions. A few datapoints:==

- ==Homeschoolers graduate college at a 10% higher rate than public school peers==
- ==UNC Chapel Hill admits 47% of homeschoolers vs 17% overall admission rate==
- ==Homeschoolers are also well-represented at Ivy League schools like Yale, Harvard, and MIT==

==Beyond test scores and an official-looking transcript, colleges are increasingly interested in “spiky” applicants. But what does that mean?==

==A “spiky” application showcases deep expertise or passion in a specific area, rather than being well-rounded but average across the board.==

==**For example:**==

- ==A student who’s published research on local water quality==
- ==An aspiring filmmaker with a portfolio of short films and festival submissions==
- ==A budding entrepreneur who’s already launched a small business==

==So instead of forcing your 14 year old into weekend SAT prep classes, consider encouraging them to start a portfolio showcasing their projects and passions or seek out mentorship or internships in their field of interest==

==Use the flexibility of an open education to develop these distinctive “spikes” – they might just be their secret weapon.==

==**“Are you a homeschooler?”**==

==This seemingly simple question often leaves parents pausing, furrowing their brows, and hesitantly replying,== _==“I guess?”==_

==What do you call it when your kid takes math classes online, goes to the local school for band, and runs a small business from home?==

==If you’re scratching your head, you’re not alone. The old labels don’t cut it anymore.==

==In our conversations with families over the years, we’ve noticed this growing trend of educational experiences that defy traditional categorization. It’s one of the key reasons we’re evolving from My Tech High to OpenEd – to better capture the amazing ways families like yours are already customizing your children’s education.==

==Incoming CEO Isaac Morehouse recently sat down again with Matt Bowman to clarify some things about the name change (no, the program is not changing!).==

==We talked about why names matter, and the importance of a shared language that reflects the flexible and open-ended nature of modern education.==

==And now, we’re turning to you – the parents – to help us tell your stories and highlight the incredible educational journeys you’re crafting. Your experiences are shaping the future of education, and we want to make sure those stories are heard.==

### ==The Inadequacy of Current Educational Labels==

==Since COVID hit, education has changed dramatically. We still have public schools, charter schools, and homeschooling. But now we have all this other stuff that doesn’t fit neatly into any of those boxes. It’s a mix of online and offline, structured and unstructured, traditional and innovative.==

==Take the story of one student who reached out to Matt on LinkedIn. She described herself as “a homeschooler enrolled in OpenEd (which partners with a public school).”==

==“I also split-enroll in my local school for band class,” she said, “and I’m pursuing a competency-based associate degree through Southern New Hampshire University.”==

==Try fitting that on a school registration form.==

==I hear stories from families like this al the time. Yet most parents have no idea these options exist.==

==The truth is, education today is more like a buffet than a set menu. Families are mixing and matching, creating unique learning experiences that defy simple labels.==

==It’s beyond the concepts of charter school, homeschool, tutorial, or co-op. It’s all of them, sometimes each of them, mixed in unique ways.==

==This isn’t just a handful of families doing something quirky. It’s a growing movement. And it needs a new language to describe it. That’s where you come in. Your stories and experiences are the building blocks of this new educational landscape.==

### ==Your Story is Cooler Than You Think==

==If you spend any time on social media, you might think that unless you’re teaching your 1st-grader astrophysics on a catamaran while island-hopping in the South Pacific, you’re not doing enough for your child’s education.==

==We’ve all seen those picture-perfect homeschool setups or heard about child prodigies running tech startups from their treehouses. It’s easy to feel like you’re not doing enough.==

==Let me assure you: that’s not true.==

==If you’ve chosen to personalize your child’s education, you’re already ahead of 99% of parents.==

==Think about it. Are you letting your child pursue their passion for music while ensuring they get solid math instruction? Have you found a way to incorporate their love for video games into their learning? These aren’t small things. They’re the building blocks of a personalized, engaging education.==

==We want to move this concept forward and help as many families as possible be able to open up education for their children. And we need your help to do it. Your stories, your experiences, your creative solutions – they’re the heart of this movement.==

==**So here’s my ask:**== ==Share your story with us. How have you customized your child’s education? What unique combinations of learning have you created? Your journey matters, and it could inspire other families to explore new possibilities.==

==You can email us at== ==reply@opened.co== ==or comment on this post. Let’s create a new language for education together – one that captures the amazing things happening in homes and communities across the country.==

==Let’s write the next chapter in education.==

## ==Transcript==

### ==Introduction and Welcome [00:00:00]==

==**Isaac:**== ==Many parents don’t realize what’s possible in education today. I hear stories of families building custom entrepreneurship courses at home or combining online classes with in-person band lessons. Most parents don’t know these options exist.==

==**Matt:**== ==Hey everyone, Matt Bowman and Isaac Morehouse here. We’re excited to discuss the transition from My Tech High to OpenEd. Isaac, welcome.==

==I want to address our long-time My Tech High families who’ve been with Amy and me for 15 years. This evolution to OpenEd has been thrilling. Isaac, we’ve known each other for a decade, introduced by a student interested in Praxis as a college alternative. It’s amazing to see you now taking the reins. Tell us about the motivation behind the name change when you joined.==

==**Isaac:**== ==Sure. We recently announced to thousands of My Tech High families that we’re changing to OpenEd and launching a newsletter and podcast. Naturally, many asked, “What’s happening? New CEO, new name?” We realized that the trust Matt and Amy built over 15 years is significant, so introducing new faces and a new name is no small matter. Let’s take a moment to explain our reasoning and vision.==

### ==The Importance of a Name [02:04]==

==**Isaac:**== ==Matt, when you first contacted me a decade ago, I was puzzled by “My Tech High.” I thought, “A tech-focused high school?” It took me a while to grasp the program because of the name. I assumed it was a charter school teaching only tech. That’s the obvious issue – people might think it’s just a high school or solely about technology.==

==But there’s a deeper aspect. I’ll touch on some business concepts here. I once read an article by James Currier, a tech founder with a VC firm called NFX. When I was raising funds for Praxis to build a tech platform, he told me, “What you’re building is a job-seeker platform. That’s distinct from Praxis and needs its own name.”==

### ==The Power of Language in Business [03:27]==

==**Isaac:**== ==I’m big into language, and when you’re trying to rally people around a vision, whether it’s a team or the market you’re trying to serve, having language – which includes your company’s name, but it’s much bigger than that – that people can rally to is crucial. Language is a network effect in business. People talk a lot about network effects. So any kind of product where every additional customer makes the product more valuable for every other customer, right? That’s a type of network effect. Facebook is an example of this, as are a lot of social platforms, but language is also a network effect.==

==The more people that are using a type of language to talk about a type of problem or challenge or solution, the more valuable that language becomes to everyone else because it’s applicable. It’s common. And when you can give voice to something that’s happening in the market that you are trying to help and serve, and give language and concepts for people to use, there’s a power there.==

### ==The Shift in Education Post-COVID [04:32]==

==**Isaac:**== ==I’ve seen something happening over the last 10 years, but especially since COVID, in education. The existing language just doesn’t quite capture all these things happening. You have public school, you have charter schools, you have homeschooling, but then you have all this stuff happening that doesn’t really fit in any of those categories.==

==The number of times I’ve run into parents in the last five years where we’ve asked, “Oh, do you homeschool?” And they’ve paused for a minute and been like, “I guess?” Like, the language isn’t quite doing the trick. And there’s something different happening.==

==I think what I really was excited about with My Tech High’s history, as we talked about in the first episode, is bridging. It’s kind of beyond the concepts of, are you in a charter school or homeschool or a tutorial or a co-op? It’s kind of like, yes, sometimes each of them, all of them. And so that movement, that broadening, that ability for parents to pick and choose, I felt like we needed some language to bridge that. That not only more accurately reflected what the program is, but the vision of who we’re trying to help and what movement, what change, the big change that’s happening in the world that we are trying to help be a part of and help anyone who wants to be a part of that. And I think it is the opening up of education. And so that was a big part of that name. Let’s really rally around a better way of talking about the shift that’s happening in the world when it comes to education.==

==**Matt:**== ==Isaac, it really was because when you proposed the shift to Open Ed, instantly, Amy and I looked at that and said, “Yes, that’s what we’ve been trying to talk about for 15 years.”==

### ==Origins and Vision of My Tech High [06:05]==

==**Matt:**== ==When you proposed the shift to OpenEd, Amy and I immediately recognized it as the concept we’ve been trying to articulate for 15 years. Many aren’t aware that the original My Tech High business plan aimed to transform 16 and 17-year-olds into tech entrepreneurs. We believed there were concrete ways to guide teenagers toward tech entrepreneurship, and that vision gave birth to My Tech High.==

==I should also mention High Tech High, a charter school in San Diego that inspired us. It was featured in a documentary called “Most Likely to Succeed.” This project-based tech charter school significantly influenced our thinking. We added “my” to “TechHigh” to emphasize personalization.==

==Interestingly, in our first year, the average student age was nine. I remember thinking, “Turning nine-year-olds into tech entrepreneurs might be a stretch!” While we kept the name, we shifted our focus to personalized education for younger children. This evolution was never fully reflected in the My Tech High name, which makes this rebranding particularly timely.==

==A few years ago, I received a LinkedIn request that perfectly illustrates the complexity of what we’ve become. The student, likely participating in a Praxis program task, had an incredibly detailed job description. She wrote, “I’m a homeschooler enrolled in My Tech High, which partners with a public school. I also split-enroll in my local school for band class and I’m pursuing a competency-based associate degree through Southern New Hampshire University.” This captures the multifaceted, personalized educational journeys we’ve come to facilitate.==

### ==Entrepreneurship for Young People [10:28]==

==**Isaac:**== ==It’s interesting, Matt, that I didn’t know you started with that intention around entrepreneurship for young people. That’s really been my passion from a very young age too – how do we help people in that 16 to early twenties range start thinking about entrepreneurial things?==

==When we started Praxis, it was aimed at those after high school graduation, whether they’d been in college for a few years and didn’t like it, were deciding if they wanted to go to college, or maybe even graduated but needed career help. That was our target demographic. But immediately we found that so many of these kids needed a de-schooling process first. They came to us with mindsets and assumptions that they had to unlearn if they actually wanted to be entrepreneurial or even work at a fast-growing startup.==

==I kept thinking we needed to reach kids earlier, to expose them to the right ideas sooner. Parents constantly asked us, “Is there a version for high schoolers? For middle schoolers?” I could never find a feasible way to get employers to take on 12-year-old apprentices, but we did launch a teen entrepreneurship course as a way to prepare people.==

==You eventually keep going backwards. You think, “Okay, these high school students would benefit from thinking about these basic concepts at 10 or 12.” Eventually, you realize it just starts at the beginning. The environment of being around things that allow you to experience the basic concepts of entrepreneurial thinking – which doesn’t necessarily mean starting a business, but seeing the world as full of opportunity – that can start very early.==

==**Matt:**== ==Exactly right. I remember in the first few years, still trying to find 16 and 17-year-olds who wanted to be tech entrepreneurs, they couldn’t escape the societal pressure. It was all about preparing for college, ACT prep, writing good essays. That pressure was so heavy I couldn’t even get their attention to think about entrepreneurial things.==

### ==Real-World Entrepreneurship Stories [14:40]==

==**Matt:**== ==We regularly run entrepreneurship competitions or invite kids to submit their pitches for extra seed funds. It’s interesting to see how they pitch nonprofit opportunities. That’s great – they see an opportunity to solve a problem in the community and decide to organize it as a nonprofit instead of a for-profit. To me, that doesn’t matter. Thinking like an entrepreneur is about seeing a problem, solving it, and creating opportunities.==

==We also regularly had meetups at different businesses. One story I remember is when eBay in Salt Lake hosted one of our meetups. The model we used was to have the executive team from the campus present some challenges eBay was facing and give everyone in the audience 10-15 minutes to gather in small groups or individually and come up with solutions.==

==The average age in the audience was probably 10. So here’s this board of executives at eBay Salt Lake City, and they gave 10 minutes to the audience. I saw all these teenagers and young kids writing on poster boards, and then they got up and pitched in front of the audience. After that, the executives turned to each other and said, “These are better ideas than we’ve had from our adult crew. We’ve asked the same question to present.” It was honestly better, more innovative, practical ideas for eBay to improve.==

==One kid said, “Your logo is out of date. It just doesn’t attract me as a young person. Update your brand.” I thought that was so cool. The eBay executives afterwards were saying, “Matt, thank you. We are actually taking some of these ideas back to our leadership team and seeing how we can implement them.”==

==**Isaac:**== ==I love it. There’s something about kids before they’ve been sort of tainted with things that feel obligatory, like “you’re supposed to learn this.” I know with my own kids, if you’re a parent of multiple kids, I’m sure you can relate to this – my younger kids are so much less tainted than my older kids because I’ve learned how to parent better over the years.==

==With my older kids, when they expressed interest in something, I’d immediately say, “Oh, cool. Well, we should set up a website or we should get a blog.” And something about my excitement, they’d interpret as “Dad’s trying to make me do something I don’t want to do” and they would resist. With my youngest, I’ve learned how to play it more cool.==

==Literally right now today, he’s up there doing data entry voluntarily. He’s seven, but he’s gotten into baseball cards. He wanted to trade them, and when his friend asked how many Braves cards he had, I suggested creating a spreadsheet to enter them all in and then sort them. He was intrigued, and now he’s always asking, “Dad, can I go put more cards into the spreadsheet?” I’m thinking, do I have the heart to tell him that nobody wants to do data entry? He loves it. He’s having a blast up there, entering every card.==

==When you don’t frame it as a subject with a restrictive criteria, but just as exploring an interest, it’s so fun. I remember with my oldest, one of my favorite entrepreneurial stories: He was about 10 and really into making fancy sandwiches at lunchtime. He always wanted my wife to buy specific baguettes and meats. He said, “There aren’t enough places to buy these. I should sell them.”==

==I suggested he ask my brother, who had a tech company with about 40 employees, if he could sell sandwiches there at lunchtime. The first time, he just had all the sandwiches the same and sold them, but he felt people bought them just because he was a cute kid selling stuff. I suggested he send a survey next time with options. He did that, got additional supplies, and sold them all again.==

==He kept getting requests for more meat, but he wanted to use fancy, expensive meats. We priced it out, and he found people didn’t seem to care about the quality as much as the quantity. This bothered him because he didn’t want to compromise on quality. Then people started asking for chips and drinks too. He figured out the margin was much better on chips than on sandwiches with fancy deli meat.==

==After about four or five weeks, he decided, “I figured out the only way to make enough money to make it worth it is to make products I wouldn’t buy myself. So this isn’t the business for me.” He’s very much the purist artist, and he knows that about himself. I told him if this were his career, he’d need to find a different market that values and is willing to pay for what he wants to make. Some of my other kids would say, “I don’t care what people want. I’ll give it to them if I can make money.” But it was fun watching him have that realization through experimentation.==

==**Matt:**== ==What draws me to entrepreneurship for young people is that it breaks down traditional barriers of cliques and groups. When you’re trying to develop an entrepreneurial pursuit, you realize the value of differences amongst all of us. You need someone who reads and writes a lot to be your messaging person. That girl or boy who always has their nose in a book? You need to attract them to your team because you need well-written content for your marketing website.==

==The kid that’s always coding or into tech? You need that person to join your team to create the backend website, automate things, and set up the tech. The kid who’s always talking and selling? You need that person. The person who loves math or spreadsheets? You need them for your financials.==

==Entrepreneurship creates the most integrated, heterogeneous society that we need. That’s what I love about pushing kids to be entrepreneurial – it makes them step outside of their own expertise and bring in people with other expertise, knowledge, and competencies. To me, that’s the real power of saving our world: developing this sense of entrepreneurial thinking.==

==**Isaac:**== ==That’s amazing. It’s really funny as you’re talking about this. I don’t want to overplay this, but I heard somebody once say you can explain a lot of the world if you just assume that it’s always a battle between the jocks and the nerds. That kind of thing happens in rigid educational structures where kids who are good at sports go over here and hang out together, kids who are good at book learning or interested in tech go over here, and there’s not much integration or overlap. These different ways of seeing and approaching the world don’t blend into each other, which can lead to conflict.==

==If you go to any successful company of any size, they have all of those things. Anyone who runs a company will tell you that the more integrated the company is, the less siloed each of those departments and skill sets are, the healthier and better it is. It’s hard to break down those silos if they’ve been conditioned into you from an early age.==

### ==The Broader Vision of Open Ed [23:39]==

==**Isaac:**== ==We went off on a fun tangent about tech and entrepreneurship, but I want to bring it back for the people who’ve reached out about the name change. We’ve launched a daily newsletter, the OpenEd Daily – go to== ==[opened.co](http://opened.co/)== ==and subscribe if you want that in your inbox every morning. This podcast, obviously, and for the families who’ve been with this program for many years, the podcast, newsletter, and even the== ==[opened.co](http://opened.co/)== ==homepage are clearly broader than just a description of the program currently set up in the states where we operate. That’s intentional because we’re trying to rally people as part of a movement.==

### ==Conclusion and Future Plans [28:15]==

==**Isaac:**== ==I should also reiterate that Matt and Amy are very much still here, involved, active, not going away. In fact, if I can tease a little bit, they’re working on something special – a book that should be coming out before too long. So they’re taking on the role of evangelists, telling these stories and going out there speaking and writing even more. That’s kind of in the future for you and Amy, right?==

==**Matt:**== ==Yes, Amy and I are so excited to document the stories we’ve heard, the lessons we’ve learned, and hope that it can help more families access this mindset of opening education for their children. It’s a mix of everything. OpenEd is pretty much the only entity on the planet that talks about all versions of education. Everyone else sits in their silos of either homeschool or public school or charter school. We say our loyalties lie with the kid. Let’s bring the world’s best resources to the child to help them thrive, succeed. Equally help the family, the parent have peace in their home, and bring a joy of education to the family that sometimes is often just lost. It’s a drudgery for so many families, fighting with their children over getting up in the morning or going to bed at night, tired, exhausted because of homework. We want to bring all of the joy of education and learning back to families, and open education is what will do that.==

==**Isaac:**== ==That’s a soundbite right there. Well, hey Matt, this has been a lot of fun. And for all of you families who have been My Tech High faithful through the years, send us things you want us to talk about, things that would be helpful for you in our newsletter, in our podcast. Pass those along. I’ll be continuing to get to know more of you, and the program that you know and love is only going to get better.==

==For all of those who are new, who have never heard of My Tech High and are new to OpenEd, welcome. If you are in a state where we don’t offer our current program, we’re trying to come there. We want to do as many things as we can to help you, whether it’s related to stuff we have or not. We’re going to try to put together resources for every state, not just things that we offer, but things from all different organizations and businesses. We really want to move this concept forward and help as many families as possible be able to open up education for their children.==

==We love hearing from listeners and readers. You can email us, let us know things you’d like to hear us talking about. You’ll hear a lot more stories from families, parents, and a whole variety of stuff on this podcast and in our newsletter. So Matt, this was fun. Anything we should close out on?==

==**Matt:**== ==No, that was great. Isaac. Thanks.==

==**Isaac:**== ==You bet. We’ll see you next time, everybody.==

### 🍎 OpenEd Daily: 3 quick bites | OpenEd

[![](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Artboard-6.jpg)](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Artboard-6.jpg)

==Happy Friday!==

==Today we’ve curated three quick reads to get you in the back-to-school mood.==

==**In this edition:**==

- ==Why more breaks could be what your child needs to get unstuck 🤯==
- ==Letting your kids struggle might be the best thing you do for them 🏔️== 
- ==The unexpected journey of a mom who said “No way” to homeschooling 🏠📚==

==Before we dive in – a quick favor to ask:==

==**Can you reply to this email and share what kinds of blogs, influencers, or Facebook pages you follow related to education or parenting? If so, two things will happen:**==

1. ==I’ll reply with something you might find interesting (and yes, I always reply).==
2. ==I’ll be able to keep the newsletter relevant for all of you==

==– Charlie (the OpenEd newsletter guy)==

### ==The Surprising Key to Learning Retention: More Breaks==

==[New research](https://www.edutopia.org/article/we-drastically-underestimate-importance-brain-breaks/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=3-quick-bites&_bhlid=95d7e2fbbe67efeb639a195ed3a9ba4e362b3c87)== ==suggests that schools drastically underestimate the importance of “brain breaks” for learning. A 2021 study found that during short breaks, your brain replays practice sessions at 20x speed. The mind isn’t resting – it’s working overtime to “bind” new skills to existing memories and consolidate lessons. The study also looked at test scores, which usually drop as the school day progresses. But when students took breaks, scores went== _==up==_ ==throughout the day.==

==**How often should you take a break (according to reseachers)?**==

- ==Elementary students: Every 10-15 minutes==
- ==Middle/High school: Every 20-30 minutes==

==(Maybe homeschoolers who follow a more flexible schedule were onto something all along.)==

==**The core message: challenges shape our kids.**==

==Here are our favorites:==

- ==Children can’t learn to be creative if everything is done for them.==
- ==Children can’t feel healthy pride or self-esteem unless they overcome obstacles to achieve something.==
- ==Children can’t develop persistence and strength if everything is easy.==

==“No way,” she said.==

==That is, until a friend told her about OpenEd.==

Here’s how to transform reading from a chore into an adventure:==

1. ==**Model the behavior:**== ==Let your kids see you enjoying books.==
2. ==**Freedom of choice:**== ==Let your kids pick books that interest them.==
3. ==**Curate classics:**== ==Introduce timeless stories with conversational potential.==
4. ==**Engage in dialogue:**== ==Ask thought-provoking questions about their reading:==
    - ==“What would you do if you were the main character?”==
    - ==“How would you have handled that situation differently?”==
5. ==**Create scenarios:**== ==Present enticing or challenging situations based on their reading and ask them to defend their choices.==
6. ==**Make it a family affair:**== ==Discuss books together, turning reading into a shared experience.==

==He emphasizes that most kids naturally love stories – our job is to maintain that “factory setting” of curiosity and excitement.==

==**Bonus tip:**== ==Try audiobooks for long car rides or while doing chores. It’s a great way to sneak in extra “reading” time!==

### The ROI of Personalized Education | OpenEd

## ==💡 THOUGHT==

### ==The ROI of Personalized Ed==

==We keep hearing that personalized education is “too expensive.” But what’s the real cost?==

==Jonathan Chizik, a co-founder of SmartPath,== ==[runs the numbers](https://smartpath.school/the-roi-of-homeschooling?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=061-the-roi-of-personalized-education)====:==

- ==Traditional private schools: $12,000-30,000/year==
- ==Customized learning at home: $500-2,500/year==

==Meanwhile, Chizik notes== ==[that homeschooled students score 15-30 percentile points higher on standardized tests than their traditionally schooled peers](https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=061-the-roi-of-personalized-education)====. (Not that standardized tests are the gold standard—we’re more interested in creating lifelong learners than expert test-takers.)==

==**Think about that:**== ==Better results. Lower costs. More flexibility.==

==With today’s tools like Khan Academy, Outschool, and Time4Learning (to name just a few), personalized education isn’t just more affordable – it’s more effective.==

==Why do we think that learning must happen in expensive buildings, or that personalization is a luxury?==

But a reader, Virginia, replied with an important reality check:==

_==“I work in technology, and I’ve been unable to find a work-from-home position that would allow the flexibility to homeschool. My husband and I both work outside the home… it is 100% of the reason I am not homeschooling my kids.”==_

==She’s right – the “true cost” of homeschooling must include the opportunity cost of reduced work hours or staying out of the workforce entirely. And that’s a deal-breaker for many families.==

==But here’s the good news:== ==**You don’t have to choose between work and personalized education.**==

==“Public school provides the daytime support I need,” she explains. “But I’ve identified my kids’ learning styles and interests… and I make sure they have outlets for all of that. I don’t just assume school will handle it all.”==

==Her solution? Strategic add-ons and after-school programs:==

- ==Ninja Warrior classes for her son who needs movement==
- ==Community theater for creative expression (who doesn’t need that?)==

### ==Are You Homeschooling or Bringing School Home?==

==When== ==[Jamie Lesko first started homeschooling](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-017-from-classroom-teacher-to-homeschool-mom/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=069-is-your-kid-a-night-owl)====, she did what many teachers-turned-homeschoolers do: she recreated school at home. Desks. Rigid schedules. Planners. She fought her son’s regular meltdowns.==

==Then one day, she found all three kids doing schoolwork atop a closet loft.==

==Her first instinct was to worry. But then she had an epiphany: “Why do they have to learn at a desk?”==

==[Watch/Listen to Jamie’s full story](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-017-from-classroom-teacher-to-homeschool-mom/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=069-is-your-kid-a-night-owl)==

### ==Nocturnal Notions: Where Learning Takes Flight==

==The philosopher Hegel once wrote of the “Owl of Minerva,” which “spreads its wings only with the falling of the dusk.” He was speaking about wisdom’s tendency to arrive at unexpected hours – a metaphor that’s taking on new meaning in education today.==

==Just ask Jamie, whose daughter does her best math work at 10:30 PM.==

==“When we were in traditional school, that would have been completely irresponsible,” Jamie recalls. “We had to get up early every morning… But now we’ve discovered when each child learns best.”==

==Some minds shine brightest after dark. Personalized schedules allow learners to learn as they wish.==

## ==⚒️ TOOL==

### ==The Two-Week Rule==

==Picture this: Your 12-year-old declares their math curriculum “the worst thing ever” after one frustrating morning. Before you panic-buy a new curriculum (we’ve all been there),== ==[try Jamie’s “two-week rule.”](https://youtu.be/QsE-ykzzgJg?si=QNnXMzY3HRTDMxQZ&t=1107&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=069-is-your-kid-a-night-owl)== ==This approach (considered a best practice in special education) suggests giving any new intervention at least two weeks before changing course.==

==**Here’s how it works:**==

1. ==When your child protests, tell them:== _==“Two weeks. That’s all I ask.”==_
2. ==During the two weeks: Document what works and what doesn’t==
3. ==After two weeks: Have an honest chat==

==The rule teaches persistence without being rigid and shows kids you take their input seriously. It also prevents expensive curriculum-hopping and the cost of switching midstream.==

==Sometimes the only way to know if something works is to give it an honest try.==

### ==The Tutoring Boom==

==A== ==[forthcoming study in Education Finance and Policy](https://edworkingpapers.com/sites/default/files/ai21-367_0.pdf?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=073-what-comes-first-the-lessons-or-the-test)== ==found that over half of centers like Kumon and Mathnasium are located in school districts representing the top 20% of income distribution. One researcher== ==[suggests](https://www.educationnext.org/the-tutoring-revolution-more-families-seek-one-on-one-help-education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=073-what-comes-first-the-lessons-or-the-test)== ==wealthy families (already saving money by using high-quality public schools) are reinvesting those savings into personalized support. It’s a smart strategy – tutoring works.==

==But what about everyone else? We might look to new solutions emerging outside of traditional, costly brick-and-mortar tutoring centers:==

- ==Online platforms like== ==[Wyzant](https://www.wyzant.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=073-what-comes-first-the-lessons-or-the-test)====,== ==[Skooli](https://www.skooli.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=073-what-comes-first-the-lessons-or-the-test)== ==and== ==[tutors.com](https://tutors.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=073-what-comes-first-the-lessons-or-the-test)==
- ==AI-powered tools like Khan Academy’s new AI tutor,== ==[Khanmigo](https://www.khanmigo.ai/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=073-what-comes-first-the-lessons-or-the-test)== 
- ==Community-driven learning pods where families share resources and expertise==

==The future of tutoring is here. It’s just unevenly distributed.==

## ==⚒️ TOOL==

### ==Khanmigo: Your AI Study Buddy Has Arrived==

==[Khan Academy’s new AI tutor, Khanmigo](https://www.khanmigo.ai/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=073-what-comes-first-the-lessons-or-the-test)====, is changing how students get help with their homework (without doing the work for them).==

==Unlike generic AI chatbots, Khanmigo is designed explicitly for learning:==

- ==Guides you through problems step-by-step==
- ==Supports your writing process (without writing for you)==
- ==Engages you in debates to strengthen arguments==
- ==Transforms into historical figures for deeper discussions==

==“It has completely revolutionized our homeschool,” says Katie, a homeschool parent. “It is perfect for a family that asks ‘why’ constantly. It is so much more time-efficient than trying to piece together intelligent answers from many sources.”==

==The coolest part? It thinks before it speaks. Khanmigo has “hidden thoughts” that help it be more Socratic and guide you to discoveries rather than just feeding information.==

==If you’ve tried it already, reply to this email and tell us what you think!gether as a team.==

## ==(STAT) OF THE DAY==

### ==The “Two Sigma Effect”==

==In 1984, researcher== ==[Benjamin Bloom discovered that students who received one-on-one tutoring performed two standard deviations better than their classroom-only peers](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/0013189X013006004?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=073-what-comes-first-the-lessons-or-the-test)====. In plain English, that means tutoring can launch an average student to the top of their class. Even “mastery learning” approaches, where students can progress at their own pace, only achieved about one sigma improvement.==

==Bloom called this the “2 Sigma== _==problem==_==” because while tutoring clearly worked best, providing a personal tutor for every student seemed economically impossible.==

==Forty years later, can a combination of more open education and AI tools help us crack this code?==

### ==The “Translation Method” for Creating High School Transcripts==

==“Wait – how do I put== _==that==_ ==on a transcript?”==

==If you’ve ever asked this question about your teen’s unconventional learning experiences,== ==[a veteran homeschool mom offers a liberating approach](https://www.humilityanddoxology.com/essential-tips-for-homeschooling-high-schoolers/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=075-how-to-create-a-high-school-transcript)====: think like a== _==translator==_==, not a transcriber.==

==**The Translation Method in Action:**==

- ==Your Reality → Their Language==
- ==Nature journaling + science reading + field studies → “Biology with Lab”==
- ==Classic literature + writing + mythology studies → “English 10”==
- ==Civil War reenactments + primary source reading → “U.S. History”==

==**What about credit hours? An example helps. For literature credits:**==

1. ==Look up Audible duration of assigned books==
2. ==Add up total hours==
3. ==Include discussion and writing time==
4. ==You’ve got your credit hours!==

==**Pro Tips:**==

- ==Save the creative course names for your family records==
- ==Use conventional subject titles on official documents==
- ==Focus on making your student’s learning legible to others==

==Remember: A transcript is simply a communication device. Like a resume, it’s meant to highlight real achievements in a standardized format that others can understand. You’re not compromising your educational philosophy—you’re making it comprehensible to institutions. Once you start thinking like a translator, you can relax and focus on real learning, not record-keeping.==

==From “hypnos” (Greek for sleep) + “jerk” (sudden movement) – a brief, involuntary muscle spasm or sudden startle that occurs during the transition from wakefulness to sleep, often accompanied by a sensation of falling. Also known as a “sleep start” or “hypnagogic jerk,” these falling “dreams” actually occur before true dream sleep begins, during the initial transition to sleep.==

### ==The New Career Navigation Crisis==

==Here’s a paradox: As career paths multiply and diversify, students are having a harder time finding their way forward. The traditional “college or bust” mindset has exploded into a maze of possibilities – but our support systems are stuck in the past.==

==Think about it: We’re asking teenagers to navigate an increasingly complex future with almost no guidance. In U.S. high schools, each counselor juggles an average of 408 students. That’s not support – that’s crowd control.==

### ==Is Technology Improving Educational Outcomes?==

==A provocative== ==[new report from After Babel](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-edtech-revolution-has-failed?r=5d1ba&utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true)== ==suggests that the so-called “EdTech revolution” has been nothing of the sort. Global test scores are declining, and research shows that students using computers “very frequently” at school tend to perform== _==worse==_==.==

==What’s interesting is that the same research shows that technology’s impact varies dramatically depending on how it’s used:==

- ==Science showed minimal gains (0.18)==
- ==Reading showed small gains (0.25)==
- ==Writing and Math showed modest gains (0.32 and 0.33 respectively)==

==None of these are considered impressive metrics.==

==The one area where the study found a sizable positive impact from technology was for students with specific learning needs==

==**What’s going on here?**== 

==It should be obvious: technology isn’t a magic wand you can wave over a classroom of 30 diverse learners. It’s a== _==tool==_ ==that only works when matched to specific student needs and learning goals. At OpenEd, we don’t just throw technology at kids – we help them integrate it into a== _==personalized learning plan.==_

### The Hidden Value of Chores | OpenEd

## ==💡 THOUGHT==

### ==The Hidden Value of Chores==

==Growing up homeschooled, my mom wasn’t always consistent with academic curricula. She’d buy stacks of books at education fairs that we’d never finish. But there was one thing she never wavered on: household chores.==

==At the time, it felt like just another task. But when I entered traditional high school, I found myself breezing through homework – often finishing work before leaving school –while my peers struggled to keep up.==

==Why? Those years of managing household duties taught me how to break down tasks, stick to a schedule, and follow through consistently. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, completing my assigned chores like laundry and sweeping had built the exact skills needed for academic success.==

==Parents stress about grades and academic achievement, but real-life skills often come from simpler sources. Managing regular responsibilities builds executive function, and these skills transfer to everything else in life.==

==Your child might never use what they learn in AP biology again. But their ability to consistently complete tasks and manage time will last forever.==

### ==The Other Inflation==

==In just one year, the percentage of students scoring a 4 or 5 on AP U.S. History jumped from 25% to 46% (!).==

==So… did teens suddenly discover a new passion for== _==Habeas Corpus==_ ==and Alexander Hamilton’s rap career?==

==[“Not so fast,” says University of Texas history professor Steven Mintz.](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/academic-rigor-is-in-decline-a-college-professor-reflects-on-ap-scores/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=079-the-hidden-value-of-chores)==

==When these same AP students arrive in his class at college, he observes that many “fail to demonstrate the content knowledge or writing skills” expected at the university level.==

==This shouldn’t surprise us. Large institutions like the College Board (which administers Advanced Placement tests) favor== _==what they can==_ _==measure==_ ==over what== _==matters==_==.==

==Genuine education is stubbornly resistant to standardization. Skills like critical thinking, deep analysis, and clear writing are getting left behind in favor of inflated test scores that mask the underlying reality.==

==The upside is that students who can actually write, think, and engage with ideas will stand out more than ever as colleges and employers grow skeptical of standardized measures.enEd, we don’t just throw technology at kids – we help them integrate it into a== _==personalized learning plan.==_

### ==“Help! How Do I Teach 3 Kids at 3 Different Levels?”==

==It’s a common worry we hear from parents considering home education. Here are a few key strategies that experienced parents swear by:==

1. ==Create a “Morning Time” Ritual – start the day with activities everyone can do together (like daily readings, memory work, or music appreciation). This builds family culture while efficiently covering shared material.==
2. ==Think “One-Room Schoolhouse.” Teach the same topics at different levels. Let older kids work independently while you help younger ones, and have older students teach younger ones (it reinforces their learning)==
3. ==Work in waves:==
    - ==Start with the youngest learners when they’re fresh==
    - ==Schedule independent work for older kids==
    - ==Save deeper discussions with teens for evening hours/==

==Starting a home-centered learning routine, Cassie Shepherd says, is like having a baby: As soon as you master nursing, they start eating solids, and everything changes. You can’t stick to the manual because there isn’t one.==

==Where she once attempted to follow a rigid school schedule, her kids now do math on the front porch. Her engineer-in-training builds all day. Her artist fills notebooks with drawings. Not because a curriculum demands it, but because that’s how she’s discovered her children learn best.==

==Sloan’s argument isn’t that Gen-Z has too many identities. It’s that they’re desperately looking for one that matters.==

==When young people are cut off from deeper traditions and thrust into standardized schooling, they’ll grasp at superficial identities to feel unique. They’ll build what Emma calls “philosophy castles in quicksand pits” – elaborate systems of meaning based on nothing but aesthetics and trends.==

==The solution isn’t fewer identities. It’s stronger ones. It’s giving young people:==

- ==The freedom to explore deeply==
- ==Connection to wisdom across generations==
- ==Space to develop authentic interests==
- ==Real problems to solve==
- ==A foundation to build from==

==That’s the point.==

==Founded in 2009, Acton believes every child is a hero on their own journey. Students run their own discussions, set their own goals, and even vote on their own rules. Teachers are called “guides,” and their job is to ask questions, not give answers.==

==The results? Their students typically test several grade levels above their age group (not that we’re counting).==

- ==Getting 20+ kids to do the same thing?==
- ==Transitioning between subjects?==
- ==Doing the hokey-pokey?==

==What’s worse, in a one-size-fits-all classroom, a child who blazes through math but needs extra time with reading has to wait during math and rush through reading. The whole class can only move as fast as the slowest student in each subject – or else leave some students behind.==

### ==The “Sportscaster” Method: Your Child’s First Reading Lesson==

==Before your child can read, they need to understand something more basic: words represent real things.==

==But here’s what’s not-so-basic: Your three-year-old is a pattern-seeking machine, desperately trying to crack the language code.==

==“Just narrate everything,” says Samantha Westmoreland, writer-in-residence at== ==[Guidepost Montessori](https://x.com/guidepostschool?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=083-is-there-life-on-mars)====,== ==[on the Hannah Frankman podcast](https://arc.net/l/quote/cubwvboq?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=083-is-there-life-on-mars)====.==

==“It sounds weird, but it works.”==

==**So try this:**== ==Narrate everything you do. Like a sports announcer, but for daily life.==

- ==“I’m turning the doorknob.”==
- ==“The water is flowing into the cup.”==
- ==“We’re pushing the swing higher.”==

==It feels silly. Do it anyway. Because when you connect clear words to real actions, you’re teaching their brain to connect symbols with meaning. That’s what reading is.==

==When Ela asked Keri Mae this question on our podcast, her answer stopped us in our tracks:==

==**“Love. That’s what it’s about at the end of the day.”**==

==Keri described something every parent has witnessed: Kids arrive in this world as little sponges, vibrating with curiosity, ready to absorb everything around them. Eyes wide. Questions endless. Wonder unlimited.==

==Then something happens.==

==“It’s heartbreaking to see that squashed,” she says. “To see a kid in kindergarten going ‘I hate school’ or ‘I can’t read.’ You came in with such vibrancy… what happened?”==

==This is why we fight for open education. Not because of test scores or college admissions or future earning potential.==

==Because we love our kids. Because we see their spark. Because we refuse to let that spark die.==

- ==Instead of memorizing business terms, start a mini-business==
- ==Instead of reading about ecology, plant a garden==
- ==Instead of studying local government, attend city council meetings==

==The classroom isn’t just a room with four walls. It’s everywhere your child’s curiosity takes them.==

==As our study last week showed, tech integration works best when truly personalized to each child. This raises an interesting question: Why stick 25 kids in a one-size-fits-all classroom just so they can receive personalized education through an iPad?==

==The solution might be simpler than we think. Instead of full days of screen-based learning, imagine a space where students spend a focused two hours on self-paced digital academics, followed by group projects, hands-on activities, and real-world problem solving. What Sweden reminds us is that effective education isn’t about choosing between old and new – it’s about finding the right tool for each learner at each moment.==

==Instead of just digitizing worksheets, Synthesis creates an engaging, personalized experience focused on deep understanding rather than rote memorization. The AI tutor turns abstract math concepts into hands-on play, adapting in real time to how your child thinks and learns.==

==Beyond the math tutor, Synthesis also offers “Teams” – where kids can join other young learners from around the world in collaborative problem-solving sessions led by expert coaches.==

==Parents report their kids going from “hating math” to begging for more Synthesis time (perhaps the ultimate measure of educational technology done right).==

### ==Will AI Flip the Role of the Classroom Teacher?==

==In the original meaning, the idea of the “flipped classroom” meant teachers assigning videos to watch at home, reserving class time for discussion and help with homework.==

==Though it was never adopted in mainstream schools, flipping the classroom makes sense as a way to deliver knowledge more efficiently while providing personalized support.==

==However, AI is now giving the classroom an even bigger flip.==

==“If you are a professorial-style teacher, you will be out of a job. If you are a facilitator, it will enhance your practice,” says Jonathan Bergman, one of the pioneers of the original flipped model. “Teachers who view themselves as the ringleader of a circus will get a boost from AI.”==

==Instead of watching pre-recorded videos, students are already learning concepts from AI tutors that adapt to their pace and questions (as Andrew Wilkinson noted above). In the future, teachers might become “learning architects” rather than just content deliverers – guiding discussions, designing real-world projects, and helping students apply what they’ve learned. Classrooms might be redefined as spaces for human connection and real-world application.==

==Instead of just reading pre-made texts, your child can be the story director – choosing characters, settings, and reading level to generate their own personalized stories. When kids help create the story, the theory goes, they’ll be more invested in reading it.

## How to encourage reluctant readers | OpenEd

## ==💡 THOUGHT==

### ==“How do I encourage a love of reading if my kids hate books?”==

==We’ve heard from our OpenEd teachers that the number of kids who say they “hate reading” has increased in the past few years.==

==If this sounds like your child, don’t lose hope.==

==As a kid, I hated reading. Now I’m surrounded by books and can’t stop reading! I was into sports, LEGO, and fighter planes. But when I turned 16, something changed, and I started reading books and never stopped. You might be surprised how quickly your child changes.==

==Does that mean you need to just wait around for that change to happen? Not necessarily.==

==Try reading aloud, or playing audiobooks in the background while they’re doing other things. Do reading yourself in their presence. Have lots of books around the house.==

==If your kid loves a certain YouTube channel, try turning on the captions and letting them watch with or without sound (admittedly,== [==Mark Rober’s science experiments==](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY1kMZp36IQSyNx_9h4mpCg?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=040-how-to-encourage-reluctant-readers) ==are way less cool without sound).==

==If your kids love movies, try printing out screenplays.==

## ==(word) OF THE DAY==

### ==**Kerfuffle**==

==**Kerfuffle**== ==(ker-FUH-fuhl) – noun – A commotion or fuss, especially one caused by conflicting views.==

==Example: “The annual bake sale turned into a real kerfuffle when two grandmothers claimed to have the best apple pie recipe in town.”==

==_Origin:_== ==This delightful word comes from the Scottish Gaelic “car” (to twist) + “fuffle” (to dishevel). It entered English in the early 19th century.==

==While “kerfuffle” sounds like it could be the name of a fluffy pancake or a cozy slipper, it actually captures those minor, often humorous, disturbances in our daily lives. Next time you’re caught in a little disagreement or chaos, remember: you’re not in trouble – you’re just experiencing a kerfuffle!==

### ==The power of saying ‘Yes’ (plus cupcakes) 🧁==

==Your willingness to say ‘yes’ in life creates your reality. Just ask Daniella Park, who left high school – severely dyslexic – with just a business plan.==

==“I begged my parents and teachers to just give me a chance,” she recalls.==

==In this podcast clip, Daniella tells the story of how she landed Malaysian Airlines as her first client. She’d bake ornate cupcakes, put them in clear boxes, and walk around Sydney, Australia’s business district (pretending to be on a delivery). Curious onlookers would ask for her card. She’d say she ran out, but give them a cookie instead and ask for their email.==

==Aiden’s business earned over $150,000 in its first year (!), far exceeding his initial $10,000 goal. We love to see it. Keep it up, Aiden!==

==The push for STEM education comes partly from the recognition that many of the best-paying jobs and opportunities lie in these fields. However, there’s also a growing awareness that STEM focus should be balanced with creative thinking, leading to the inclusion of “Arts” in many so-called “STE====**A**====M” programs. There’s also been a shift towards hands-on, experiential learning in STEM to make abstract concepts more concrete and to engage all five senses to make lessons stick. Which brings us too this week’s tool…==

### ==How to Start a Business (with no ideas)==

==You don’t need a groundbreaking idea to start a business. You just need to start.==

==I remember when OpenEd was just a glimmer in my eye. There was no clearly defined roadmap, just a driving feeling that we could do education better for our children. So== [==this recent Forbes article==](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/want-start-business-but-no-ideas/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=038-how-to-start-a-business-with-no-ideas) ==titled== ==_‘How to Start a Business with No Ideas’_== ==caught my eye, and I had to share some of the lessons that resonate most with me:==

1. ==Be a problem detective. The best businesses solve pain points. What irks you daily?==
2. ==Passion + skill = potential goldmine. What do you love? What are you good at? That intersection is your sweet spot.==
3. ==Network like your business depends on it (because it does). Ideas spark from conversations.==
4. ==MVP = Minimum Viable Product, not Most Valuable Player. Start small, iterate fast.==
5. ==Feedback is your new best friend. Embrace it, even when it stings.==

==**Remember:**== ==Every expert was once a beginner. Successful leaders didn’t start there—they started by starting.==

- ==Distinguishing facts from fiction in your mind==
- ==Identifying (and replacing) thought patterns that sabotage success==
- ==Crafting new narratives that fuel confidence==

- ==“I’m weird-looking.”==
- ==“Nobody likes me.”==
- ==“I’ll never succeed.”==

Today, we’re offering three simple tricks to reset between these micro-lessons:==

1. ==**Movement Snacks:**== ==Quick stretches or jumping jacks boost concentration. University students who took 5-10 minute exercise breaks during long lectures felt more confident and less worried about making mistakes.==
2. ==**Drawing to Learn:**== ==When a topic lends itself to visuals, let your kids sketch it out. Simple drawings (even stick figures) can nearly double factual recall. For abstract ideas, try concept mapping.==
3. ==**Rapid Reviews**====: Quick recaps clarify misunderstandings. Use tools like== [==Kahoot==](https://kahoot.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=050-the-paradox-of-sacrifice) ==or== [==Quizizz==](https://quizizz.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=050-the-paradox-of-sacrifice) ==to ask a short review question and turn rapid reviews into fun, low-stakes quizzes.==

With the exception of recent graduates, Google will no longer asks for GPAs or test scores, except for recent graduates.==

==“We found that they don’t predict anything,” referring to traditional academic metrics. He adds, “You want people who like figuring out stuff where there is no obvious answer.”==

==The percentage of Googlers without college degrees has also been increasing, as Google now focuses on “behavioral interviewing” to assess real-world problem-solving skills.==

[![](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-6-1021x1024.png)](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-6-1021x1024.png)

==The company’s famous “brainteaser” interview questions have also been abandoned. Bock calls them “a complete waste of time,” adding that they “serve primarily to make the interviewer feel smart.” It turns out that both GPAs and the ability to calculate how many golf balls it would take to fill the moon are equally useless in predicting an employee’s productivity.==

==This reinforces what we’ve been saying about the “hidden curriculum” most schools aren’t teaching. While closed education often focuses on memorization and test-taking, the real world demands problem-solving skills, creativity, and the ability to navigate ambiguity.==

## To Diploma or Not to Diploma? | OpenEd

[![](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Artboard-18.jpg)](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Artboard-18.jpg)

==Last week, we received an email from a parent, Joanna, who was grappling with a familiar dilemma:==

==I would love resources about college after homeschool/online school. My student did 9th grade last year on the diploma path, but we are planning to do non-diploma-seeking status this year. My child needs options and flexibility more than we felt was available on the diploma seeking path. However, I worry a lot about not following the traditional, earn a diploma and go to college path. I would love help specific to college and/or other training when doing school through OpenEd.==

==Joanna is not alone. Many parents struggle with this decision, and society has long pushed a linear path:==

### ==**High school diploma → college degree → good job → success!**==

==But as education and work evolve, so must our approach to preparing kids for the future.==

### ==**The New Landscape of Post-High School Options**==

==The four-year degree isn’t the only path to success anymore. The options have multiplied.==

==Several experiences shared in a recent student panel discussion highlight this:==

- ==Elise earned an associate’s degree through Southern New Hampshire University while in high school.==
- ==Jordan, a ballet dancer, found non-diploma seeking gave him flexibility “to fit in as much educational work as I wanted while still managing a ballet life.”==
- ==Then there’s Olivia, who started a business breeding hypoallergenic dogs at age 15, earning $30,000 in profit within six months – more than her parents had ever made in a year.==

==“I’ve gotten my associate’s degree through Southern New Hampshire University. It has been a huge help to me in my educational journey.”==

==**Success in the 21st century isn’t about following a preset path.**== ==It’s about aligning your education with individual talents, interests, and goals.==

==Still, Joana’s question remains: How do you prepare for college when you’re not on the traditional diploma-seeking path?==

==First, let’s dispel a myth:==

### ==**A high school diploma isn’t always necessary for college admission.**==

==Contrary to common fears, a non-traditional high school path doesn’t close these doors either. Colleges and universities== ==_want_== ==diverse experiences and skills that students from alternative educational backgrounds bring to their campuses.==

==Many colleges accept alternatives such as a GED or a well-documented homeschool transcript. What matters more is demonstrating your readiness for college-level work.==

==Here’s how some successful non-traditional students have done it:==

1. ==**Build a Compelling Portfolio:**== ==It’s crucial to maintain detailed records of all educational activities, projects, and achievements in lieu of a traditional diploma.==
    
    ==Destiny, another student on our panel, shared that the flexibility afforded by OpenEd allowed her to pursue projects and experiences that showcased her skills and interests more effectively than a transcript ever could.==
    
2. ==**Leverage Early College Credits:**== ==Remember Elise? Her associate’s degree is proof positive that she can handle college-level coursework. Even without pursuing a diploma, students can access early college credit options. For instance:==
    - ==Bottega University offers a Full-Stack Development Certificate worth 18 university credits.==
    - ==Southern New Hampshire University provides competency-based education programs in various fields.==
    - ==OC Online through Oklahoma Christian University offers competency-based courses.==
3. ==**Standardized Tests Still Matter:**== ==While some colleges are moving away from requiring SAT or ACT scores, these tests can still be a valuable tool for homeschoolers to demonstrate their academic abilities on a standardized scale.==
4. ==**Embrace Your Uniqueness:**== ==Jordan’s dedication to ballet alongside his studies shows a level of discipline and time management that many traditional students struggle to develop. Colleges value these soft skills just as much as academic prowess.==

==*For diploma-seekers, note the required Civics Test administered by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.==

### ==**But what if traditional college isn’t the goal?**==

==The beauty of the non-diploma-seeking path is that it opens up a world of alternatives outside of college:==

- ==**Vocational Training:**== ==For hands-on learners, programs in everything from culinary arts to cybersecurity offer direct paths to lucrative careers.==
- ==**Apprenticeships:**== ==Many industries, particularly in the trades, offer paid apprenticeships that lead to well-paying, stable careers.==
- ==**Entrepreneurship:**== ==Olivia’s dog breeding business is just one example. With the right skills and mindset, starting a business can be a viable alternative to college.==
- ==**Gap Year Programs:**== ==Structured gap years can provide valuable life experience and clarity about future goals.==

==While the options may seem overwhelming, tools like the “Own It!” mini-course can help students navigate their unique educational paths. This 10-unit course offers a journey of self-discovery that goes beyond academic planning.==

==Students engage with:==

1. ==Interactive video scenarios that challenge their problem-solving skills==
2. ==Personality reflections to understand their strengths and preferences==
3. ==Mindset skills instruction to develop resilience and adaptability==

==Perhaps most importantly, Own It! helps you generates a unique student profile that showcases:==

- ==Career interests==
- ==Learning-style preferences==
- ==Key skills to develop==

==This profile becomes a roadmap for students, parents, and educators to tailor the educational experience. The Own It! program is available by request for OpenEd students through InfoCenter. Just reach out to your homeroom teacher or the parent support team to get started.==

==In closing, let’s circle back to Joanna’s worries about “not following the traditional path.”==

==The reality is that the definition of a “traditional path” is becoming more and more slippery. Colleges and employers want skills, experiences, and the ability to learn over credentials.==

==Approach education as a canvas for growth, not a checklist of requirements. Whether that growth happens in a classroom, online, through an apprenticeship, or via self-directed projects is less important than the fact that it happens at all.==

## 🍎 The OpenEd Daily: tl;dr Tuesday | OpenEd

==Welcome to another edition of tl;dr (too long; didn’t read) Tuesday, where we distill educational epiphanies into bite-sized brain food.==

==**In this edition:**==

- ==**Podcast recap:**== ==The hidden curriculum and the “unbundling” of education== ==**🎙️**==
- ==Newsweek reports on the Great Education Exodus 🏫== 
- ==**WATCH:**== ==8-year-old coder conjures Harry Potter app in minutes 🪄==

==Let’s dive in, shall we?==

### ==🎙️== ==**The Hidden Curriculum and the “Unbundling” of Education**==

==**Hard truth:**== ==Most schools might be preparing kids for a world that no longer exists.==

==Last week Michael B. Horn dropped some truth bombs about the future of education on the OpenEd podcast.==

==Missed it? Watch/listen== [==here==](https://opened.co/podcast/%F0%9F%8E%99%EF%B8%8Fepisode-004-the-great-unbundling-with-michael-horn/) ==or read the transcript.==

==**Here are 3 things you need to know:**==

### ==**1/**== ==**Schools are failing at “the hidden curriculum”**==

==They teach math and literature, but they’re missing crucial skills like project management, effective communication, and emotional intelligence – the very skills that make or break careers.==

### ==**2/ ESAs ≠ Vouchers**==

==Education Savings Accounts offer families a pool of money for multiple options, not just a ticket to one school. It’s about customization, not just choice.==

### ==**3/**== ==**An “unbundling” of education is coming… slowly**==

==Unbundling in education refers to the process of breaking down traditional, all-in-one schooling into its component parts. Instead of receiving a fixed package of subjects and services from a single institution, students and families can choose from various educational options, providers, and experiences.==

==Horn estimates that 10 million students have access to choice options. Still, most parents start with traditional schooling before exploring alternatives.==

==“We talk about teamwork all the time. That’s a big buzzphrase in education, ‘building teamwork.’ But We don’t actually talk about how you run a meeting, how you do project management, how you coordinate team members.”==

### ==🏫== ==**The Great Education Exodus**==

==Newsweek reports more parents opting for homeschooling due to various concerns about traditional schooling, putting pressure on public schools to evolve or lose enrollment (==[==“Why Parents Are Pulling Their Kids Out of School”==](https://www.newsweek.com/2024/08/30/why-parents-pull-kids-out-school-homeschool-1941949.html?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday)==).==

==“Parents are seeing the value in being able to teach their own kids what they feel is necessary for them to learn.”==

==– Arlena Brown, homeschooling mom==

==**Key takeaways:**==

- ==**The Surge:**== ==Homeschooling has exploded from 2.8% to 4.2% of U.S. students since 2019, with 50,000 new homeschoolers monthly. COVID-19 was the unexpected catalyst, exposing millions to alternative education models.==
- ==**Safety, Satisfaction, and Personalization:**== ==Parents seek safer environments, better educational experiences, and learning tailored to their child’s needs.==
- ==**Forget old stereotypes:**== ==Modern homeschoolers span all demographics and backgrounds – including those traditionally underserved by conventional schools.==

==While homeschooling is surging in popularity, the article also highligts concerns around financial accessibility, oversight, and socialization opportunities. We hope to see more parents continue to reinvent homeschooling through the== [==OpenEd==](http://opened.co/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday) ==model, with resources, quality assurance, and community courses.==

## Playing with LEGO is More Valuable than Learning Algebra | OpenEd

[![](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/legos1-1024x544-1.jpg)](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/legos1-1024x544-1.jpg)

==I was homeschooled.==

==My mom really wanted to have a highly structured and rigorous curriculum for us.  She didn’t.==

==She tried – lord knows the number of books she purchased at annual curriculum fairs – and we’d go through phases with a little more structure than others.  But ultimately, she was raising three stubborn kids while also caring for a disabled husband (and just about anyone else we ever met who needed help… my mom is a wonderful woman who has a terrible time saying ‘no’).==

==The result is that my siblings and I didn’t do much consistent, structured learning.  Today we might be called borderline “unschoolers”, but at the time nobody had heard the word.  The most structure we had was in the daily and weekly chores we did to help keep up the house and yard and the fact that all three of us had paying jobs from age 10 or so on. (One of the benefits of not being in school all day is that you can work and earn money,== [==though laws make this harder and harder==](http://fee.org/freeman/detail/keep-them-down-keep-them-dependent)==.)==

==So what did we do?  I would estimate that between the ages of 4 and 13, roughly half of my time on any given day was spent playing with LEGO.  My mom used to feel guilty about this.  Frankly, so did I.  I was always a little worried that “real school kids” would be far ahead of me in their knowledge and skill and it might embarrass me some day.  But that day never came.  Real school kids suffered all day while I played LEGO, and by the time I went to school (one year in high school, and then college, neither of which were worth the cost) they were no better for it.==

==My mom would sometimes assign us math work through a textbook (Saxon Math. Even the name is ominous), which we would complete and grade on our own.  I remember sitting at my desk and moving through “Algebra 1/2” as fast as I could, not caring or comprehending it.  I’d grade it with the answer guide and fix errors, but mostly I was staring out the window at the excessively fat Squirrels of Milwood, who I’m pretty sure were running some kind of animal cartel.  The fattest of them was an albino squirrel who was probably immortal. I called him The Godsquirrel.  Where was I… oh yes, working on math problems…==

==That was pretty much how it would go.  I’d get it out of the way (or not) and get back to my LEGO. Only later have I come to realize how much more valuable playing with LEGO was than the little math I did, or really any of the formal instruction I had.  I remember nearly every Lego creation in detail and with great pride.  In fact, give me some LEGO today I can still whip up a mean spaceship or watercraft if I do say so myself.==

==There are a few reasons I think playing with LEGO was much more valuable to me than pretending to learn from textbooks.==

### ==**Confidence**==

==Confidence cannot be given.  It must be earned.==  

==No cat poster telling you that you can do anything will really give you the self-esteem needed to pursue your goals with grit and determination.==  

[![](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1-1024x1024.png)](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1-1024x1024.png)

==Confidence comes by overcoming challenges and solving problems.  Especially problems that are meaningful to you.  Building entire cities with plastic blocks is time-consuming and can be very challenging.  When you’re done, you get so much more than a gold star or a pat on the head or a lifeless word on a page that says, “Correct”.  You get to see and touch and play with a tangible creation.  Until you decide to destroy it, you have proof of your work and the challenges you overcame.  (It’s doubly challenging when you have to dig through the Lego bin piece by piece so as not to be too loud and awaken your mom, who is probably on the phone helping someone downstairs, to the realization that you’re playing instead of working.)==

### ==**Value Creation**==

==In school, you’re rewarded for finding the right answers to questions you don’t care about.  Neither does anyone else except (maybe) your teacher.  In the marketplace where you’ll spend most of your life working and interacting, no one cares about whether you’re right on some arbitrary scale.  They care about value creation.  Playing with LEGO imparts this lesson.  No kid gives two hoots about your method for finding and snapping together pieces.  What matters is the beauty, originality, and functionality of the end result.  Did you make something awesome?  Everything else is negotiable and can be experimented with, but the ultimate test is whether you created something valuable to yourself and others. Not in theory, but in the real world.  That’s a kind of “show your work” I can get behind.==

### ==**Solve for X**==

==Algebra is about figuring out puzzles when you don’t have all the pieces.  But most kids don’t really know this and don’t really care.  I didn’t.  But I did love solving complex problems without having all the pieces… as long as those pieces were small bits of colored plastic.  None of us had enough LEGO to build exactly what we envisioned in all the right colors and shapes.  Especially back then when there were few custom pieces or crazy shapes. (====_Shakes cane at kids these days_====)  You want to make a lightsaber?  You’ve got to break some other pieces in half and improvise.  Lego building is nothing but a series of complex design problems with a constant absence of the right pieces.  I loved solving for X, as long as it was the X-Wing spacecraft.==

### ==**Freedom**==

==New sets come with instructions.  Maybe you follow them once, maybe not at all.  But eventually you’ll rip apart the prescribed design and create something new.  There are no arbitrary rules, but it doesn’t mean there are no rules.  Like the real world, some things are non-negotiable.  The pieces have definite physical dimensions.  You can break or color (or melt!) them sometimes, but only to a limited extent.  You learn to work with the very few natural rules, but that with those you can create anything you want.  A building that turns into an airplane that drops a bomb that’s really a submarine?  No problem.  The only limiting factors are your resources (of which you can acquire more if you save up your paper route money) and your imagination and skill.  Learning to achieve goals when no one has assigned goals to you or methods for reaching them is the hardest thing for a schooled mind.  It’s also the most valuable.==

### ==**Change**==

==Lego builds are not permanent.  Siblings, friends, and mostly your own boredom drive you to tear down and recreate constantly.  It’s an open-ended system.  There is no once for all plateau or achievement.  There is no Lego graduation.  It’s a dynamic, non-linear world of possibility.  Whatever you have built can and probably will be changed into something better.  You’re never done.  That mindset is powerful, and a strong shield against dangerous== ==_status quo_== ==bias and constructivist notions of the individual and society.==

==This is all playful (all the best things are) and anecdotal.  If you want some deeper stuff about why playing with LEGO or any other self-chosen activity is superior to textbooks and schools and teacher-guided learning, check out the== [==excellent work of Dr. Peter Gray==](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201506/how-early-academic-training-retards-intellectual-development)==.==

==Oh, and thanks mom.  You never had it in you to be an authoritarian task-master, and that’s opened up the world to me.==

==————==

==**Update:**== ==Some readers seem to have a difficult time getting the general point because of the specific title.  The point of this post isn’t that always and everywhere for everyone LEGO play is more valuable than algebra.  The point is that kids doing and learning things of their own choosing in their own way on their own time is more valuable than making them do stuff.  Most kids will prefer LEGO to math.  Let them play LEGO.  Some may prefer math to LEGO.  Let them do math.==

==Happy Wednesday!==

==Welcome back to your daily dose of educational enlightenment. No, we haven’t solved the mystery of missing socks in the laundry, but we do have some interesting news.==

==**In this edition:**==

- ==**Worldschooling 101:**== ==No passport required! 🌍==
- ==**Free App Alert:**== ==Teach your monster to read 📱==
- ==**Meet Lily:**== ==Our pickleball champion and OpenEd superstar 🏆==

==Let’s dive in!==

### ==🌍️ 🤷== ==**What in the World is**== ==_**Worldschooling**_====**?**==

==Worldschooling is the latest homeschooling spin-off – enjoying a resurgence since virtual offices, remote work, and online schools have become more common.==

==So, what is it?== [==The Prisma blog defines it==](https://joinprisma.com/blog/worldschooling?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=3-quick-bites) ==as “====_a type of homeschooling that involves full-time or part-time travel away from the family’s home country_====.”==

==At OpenEd, we embrace a more expansive definition: it’s any approach that turns the whole world into a classroom.==

==You don’t need to sail across the Pacific – studying marine biology with wild dolphin pods and using celestial navigation for math lessons – to call yourself a worldschooler.==

==Visit your local international market and challenge kids to plan a meal from a country they’ve never visited. Take a family road trip to see the biggest ball of twine in Minnesota (Google it!) and turn it into a lesson on folk art and community pride. Or try geocaching in your neighborhood to combine outdoor adventure with geography and problem-solving skills.==

[==Take the Thygerson family==](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/528999840?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=3-quick-bites)==. They found a sweet spot between traditional education and world travel. Using OpenEd (formerly My Tech High), they’ve blended online learning with real-world experiences.==

==“Learning is everywhere,” says one of the Thygerson children, “it’s not just in school for seven hours – it’s every day and everywhere that you go.”==

==One day, the Thygersons are exploring Nepal; the next, they’re back home, building robots at the== [==Thanksgiving Point Makerspace==](https://thanksgivingpoint.org/education/youth/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=3-quick-bites)==.==

==Remember, worldschooling is more mindset than travel itinerary. It’s about seeing learning opportunities in everyday experiences. So whether you’re planning an epic journey to Mt. Everest or just a trip to the local park, learning opportunities are everywhere. Just don’t blame us if your kids start asking for “educational” ice cream trips.==

==The replies to Pink’s tweet were amusing and insightful.==

==One comment suggested that the conclusion didn’t need a 50-year meta-study to back them up:==

==“Observe all of recorded human history > This massive new meta-analysis”==

==Another questioned the results, wondering if the study had confused correlation with causation:==

==“It’s likely that kids that are healthier and doing well allow parents to give them more autonomy, and kids that are having problems cause parents to tighten control.”==

==(A fair point, though the researchers claimed to have controlled the data to eliminate that potential source of bias.)==

==Others just wanted clarity on what the term “autonomy-supportive parenting” even means:== ==**like, do you just let your kids do whatever they want??**==

==Here, we would do well to read the paper itself, but since nobody’s got time for that we asked== [==Claude==](http://claude.ai/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday-the-new-science-of-raising-happy-kids) ==(our trusty AI assistant) to give us some highlights:==

- ==**Self-Determination Theory:**== ==A psychological framework proposing that autonomy, competence, and relatedness are universal human needs. In parenting and education, it suggests that supporting these needs fosters intrinsic motivation and well-being.==
- ==Autonomy-supportive parenting involves considering the child’s perspective, encouraging== ==**age-appropriate choices**====, and providing rationales for rules and limits.==
- ==It’s about nurturing a child’s sense of self and decision-making skills== ==**within appropriate boundaries**====.==
- ==This approach is consistently linked to better well-being and mental health outcomes across cultures.==

==In short, autonomy-supportive parenting isn’t about letting your kids run wild. It’s about supporting their growing independence and self-determination within specific structures and limits.==

## ==Connecting the Dots to Self-Directed Learning==

==In the context of education, self-determination (the theory) lends itself well to self-directed learning (the practice). A schooling experience that puts test scores and arbitrary learning outcomes ahead of a child’s natural curiosity is likely to be linked to decreased well-being and motivation.==

==This brings us back to the message of== [==the recent podcast episode with Andrea Fife==](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-005-she-almost-gave-up-on-education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday-the-new-science-of-raising-happy-kids)==, our VP of learning at OpenEd. When asked about her goals for the program, she said:==

==“For any student who can identify their goal, I want for us to have a way to get them there. … Part of that is understanding that they can have goals that they’ve never heard of before. There’s sort of a deconstructing the traditional narrative that has to happen before someone can truly tell me their goal.”==

==– Andrea Fife==

==Andrea’s words speak to the spirit of autonomy support in education. It’s about expanding horizons – showing learners that there are more choices than they might have realized – and then providing the== ==_support_== ==to pursue those choices.==

==Do we need a 51-year meta-study to validate this approach? Probably not, but if any researchers out there are looking for a long-term project, a study on the outcomes of self-directed learning could be huge.==

==That’s all for this edition.==

==Do you have thoughts on this format or anything else?== ==**Comment on this post – we always love hearing from you!**==

==Until next time,==

[![](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Artboard-8-copy-2.jpg)](https://opened.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Artboard-8-copy-2.jpg)

==It’s been 18 years since Sir Ken Robinson delivered his “mic-drop moment” on the TED stage, asking whether schools kill creativity.==

==If you haven’t seen the video, it’s only 20 minutes long. Still, we thought it was worth sharing the== ==_**tl;dr**_== ==and reflecting on how it’s stood the test of time.==

[https://www.youtube.com/embed/iG9CE55wbtY?feature=oembed](https://www.youtube.com/embed/iG9CE55wbtY?feature=oembed)

==Since 2007, a staggering 77 million have watched the video on the TED website, plus another 24 million people on YouTube. The message is provocative, but the real eye-opener comes when you scroll down to the comments.==

==The top comments on YouTube span more than a dozen years, but they all say basically the same thing:==

==Here’s one from 8 years ago:==

==**“Almost 10 years since this video was posted and unfortunately nothing has changed.”**==

==Fast forward two years:==

==**“Clap clap. 12 years have gone by, we’re still in the same boat.”**==

==After Robinson’s passing in 2020, the video received a renewed flood of attention, and the chorus of frustration remains the same:==

==**“It’s incredibly upsetting how old this is and how everything is still the same.”**==

==That’s all for this edition.==

==How could Robinson’s remarks receive such a thunderous ovation in 2007 – both on stage and reverberating through YouTube – yet have so little effect on the educational system?==

==To understand this paradox, you first need to know who Ken Robinson was and why his words struck such a chord. Sir Ken wasn’t just another talking head. Knighted in 2003 for his services to the arts, Robinson was a professor of arts education who had advised governments, non-profits, and Fortune 500 companies on creative and cultural education.==

==His core message was that our schools are stuck in an industrial-age model, churning out conformity at a time when we need creativity more than ever.==

==“Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth for a particular commodity,” he observed.==

==It’s clear that the message resonates with anyone who’s ever felt stifled by standardized tests or wondered why art class always gets the short end of the budget stick.==

==Robinson’s most provocative claim was that we don’t grow== ==_into_== ==creativity, we grow== ==_out of it_====. Or rather, “We get educated out of it.”==

==One way our current system educates kids out of creativity is by stigmatizing mistakes – creating an environment where taking risks becomes taboo.==

==“If you’re not prepared to be wrong, you’ll never come up with anything original,” he insisted.==

==This fear of failure, ingrained from an early age, stifles the very innovation our rapidly changing world demands.==

==As Robinson warned, “Many highly talented, brilliant, creative people think they’re not, because the thing they were good at at school wasn’t valued, or was actually stigmatized.”==

==How many potential Steve Jobs, artists, or out-of-the-box thinkers have we lost to a system that prizes conformity over creativity?==

==Moreover, the gap between what schools teach and what the real world demands is widening. In an era of artificial intelligence and automation, rote learning and standardized testing have never been less relevant. Yet, our education system continues to churn out graduates ill-equipped for the challenges of the 21st century.==

==The frustration is palpable among educators, parents, and students alike. They see the mismatch between education and reality, but feel powerless to change a system with such strong inertia. It’s like trying to turn a massive ship with an undersized rudder – the change is slow, almost imperceptible, even as the iceberg looms ahead.==

==The timing of Robinson’s passing in August 2020 was tragically ironic – just as the world was primed for disruptive change, we lost a visionary who had been championing that change for decades.==

==Yet, all is not lost. While large-scale systemic change has been slow, a revolution is brewing at the margins. Parents and students, frustrated with the one-size-fits-all approach of traditional schooling, are taking matters into their own hands. We’re seeing a rise in homeschooling, virtual schools, unschooling, microschools, and alternative education models that prioritize creativity, individual talents, and real-world skills.==

==This is where OpenEd comes in. We believe in empowering families to create personalized learning journeys that nurture each child’s unique gifts and passions. Our program provides the tools and resources for parents to become the architects of their children’s education, much in the spirit of what Ken Robinson advocated.==

### ==After the Ovation==

==As we consider the state of education today, it’s worth reflecting on one last comment from the YouTube video:==

==“====**Modern education:**== ==Creating people who are smart enough to accurately repeat what they’re told and follow orders, but not smart enough to realize this doesn’t make them smarter than everyone else.”==

==The industrial model of education has shaped generations, including many of us who “succeeded” within its confines. But that doesn’t mean we’re doomed to perpetuate it. Even those of us who thrived in traditional schools can recognize its limitations and participate in crafting a more enlightened approach. We just have to get creative.==

==For parents and teachers, the education revolution doesn’t have to wait for slow-moving institutions to catch up. It can start in your home, in your classroom, in your community. Encourage creativity, even (especially!) when it leads to mistakes.==

==For policymakers and administrators, it’s time to reevaluate the hierarchy of subjects, to question the emphasis on standardized testing, to consider what education truly means in the 21st century.==

==For our friends in public education, consider this an invitation to innovation. How can you incorporate more personalized learning, even within the constraints of standardized curricula?==

==Sir Ken Robinson laid out the challenge nearly two decades ago. The world has changed dramatically since then. We don’t have to wait another two decades to see the change.==

==Until next time,==

==My 10-year-old wanted to sell gourmet sandwiches. 4 weeks later, he shut it down.==

==Here’s what happened in between:==

- ==**Week 1:**== ==Sold out. “They only bought them because I’m cute.”== ==**Lesson:**== ==Novelty isn’t a sustainable business model.==
- ==**Week 2:**== ==Sent surveys and customized orders.== ==**Lesson:**== ==Market research matters.==
- ==**Week 3:**== ==“They want more meat, not fancy meat.”== ==**Lesson:**== ==Your taste isn’t always the market’s taste.==
- ==**Week 4:**== ==Added chips and drinks. “The margin is way better!”== ==**Lesson:**== ==Diversify your offerings.==

==**Final decision:**== ==“To make real money, I’d have to make sandwiches I wouldn’t eat myself.”== ==**Lesson:**== ==Know when to pivot or quit.==

==**Bonus lesson:**== ==He learned his values. Quality over profit.==

==No textbook teaches this. Only experience does.==

==What real-world “classes” could your kids be taking?==

### ==Brave New Words: Will AI Revolutionize Education?==

==The word “revolution” gets thrown around a lot. In a recent interview with Bill Gates, Sal Khan (yes, that Khan from Khan Academy) says the AI revolution is already here:==

==“I think we’re going to see it next year; while the teacher is lecturing or whatever they’re doing, if you’re confused by something they just said, you just ask the bot in real time. It’s like whispering to your friend without disrupting the classroom.”==

==– Salman Khan==

==In the future (soon), Khan envisions parents and teachers as the architects of learning while AI acts as a powerful tool or assistant. In fact, this vision is already a reality. Khan recently demoed a new AI model, helping him guide his son through a tricky trigonometry problem.==

==Remember, whether it’s education or art, AI is here to assist, not replace. We’ll start worrying about the AI takeover when it learns to draw hands without extra fingers.==

## ==💡 THOUGHT==

### ==Taste it.==

==As a society, we have a weird way of looking at risk. We think it’s perfectly normal to let 15-year-olds take the wheel of these big metal boxes on the highway at 70 mph with no protections other than a seatbelt and their parents yelling at them. Yet many would balk at sending their child up in a small aircraft with a trained pilot at the helm.==

==The greatest skill you can teach a child is believing they can fly before society tells them they can’t.== [==Our latest podcast guest==](https://youtu.be/h53EZNNeFhM?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=035-taste-it-feel-it-do-it)==, Mark Hyatt, has been teaching kids to do just that – literally – through== [==Falcon AeroLab==](https://www.falconaerolab.org/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=035-taste-it-feel-it-do-it)==, an OpenEd partner course that pairs an online curriculum with an opportunity to take a live flight with a trained pilot.==

==Does flying come with risks? Yes, and that’s why safety is paramount. But we can’t fall victim to the “Nirvana fallacy,” comparing something to an imagined world with no possible downside.==

==**Ask yourself:**== ==Is it riskier to let my child do something that comes with some risk, or to shelter them from all risks?==

### ==Feel it.==

==Ella was 12 when she took her first airplane ride with Mark at== [==Falcon AeroLab==](https://www.falconaerolab.org/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=035-taste-it-feel-it-do-it)==. Her mother drove her 2.5 hours (each way) to Colorado Springs for classes.==

==By 14, she had soloed in gliders.==

==At 16, she soloed in powered airplanes.==

==At 18, Ella now holds a commercial pilot’s license, an instructor license, and an instrument license. She was recently offered a job training Air Force cadets in Pueblo, Colorado (====**starting salary**====: $100,000).==

==Not only is Ella bucking stereotypes about females in aviation (only 6.8% of pilots in America are women), but also the notion that you need a college degree to be successful. With the labor shortages in the aerospace industry (Boeing, for instance, is struggling to find enough workers for its Dreamliner facility), programs like Falcon AeroLab are fast-tracking high-paying careers in skilled jobs that many never knew existed.==

### ==Do it.==

==Looking for an exciting way to introduce your child to the world of aerospace and aviation?== [==Falcon AeroLab’s virtual curriculum==](https://www.falconaerolab.org/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=035-taste-it-feel-it-do-it) ==is available to OpenEd students ages 12-18.==

==Learn from qualified industry professionals, including engineers, military and airline pilots, and drone operators. Courses like “Fundamentals of Aerospace” and “Introduction to Aviation” include a live flight experience.==

==Students can prepare for the FAA Private Pilot License written exam, valid for 2 years.==

==These courses are available to students with Exploring Technology, Engineering, Transportation & Distribution, or Industrial Arts on their approved schedule.==

==Parents can set up the flight experience using the Falcon AeroLab contact link. You’ll receive contact information for flight experience vendors/facilities and can schedule individual flights near you.==
