## ==💡 THOUGHT==

### ==The Hidden Curriculum==

[==The 50-State Campaign for Achievement Now (50CAN) has released its annual report, “The State of Educational Opportunity in America.”==](https://50can.org/education-opportunity-survey/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=052-i-wish-school-had-taught-me-that) ==This survey of 20,000 parents across all 50 states offers way more insight than we can cram into a single newsletter. Still, we wanted to share one particular finding:== ==**students who excel academically are far more likely to participate in extracurricular activities**====.==

==Which way does the causation run? Do high achievers get more opportunities? Or do those who participate in extracurriculars find themselves more engaged with their studies?==

==Either way, it’s time we stopped thinking of art, sports, and community service as “extras.”==

==In the real world, there are no extracurriculars. There’s just life.==

### ==The Gap Between School and Life===

==“I wish school had taught me that.”==

==How many times have you heard (or felt) this?== [==The 50CAN report==](https://50can.org/education-opportunity-survey/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=052-i-wish-school-had-taught-me-that) ==also discusses the widening gap between what schools teach and what life demands:==

- ==59% of families want more college prep programs.==
- ==66% desire career readiness courses.==
- ==Only 32% feel confident their kids are prepared for the workforce. (We’d like to know what the other 68% are doing differently!)==

==From tutoring to summer programs, families are seeking more than schools currently offer.==

## ==(word) OF THE DAY==

### ==Pareidolia (pair-i-DOH-lee-uh)==

==From the Greek para- (“beside” or “beyond”) and eidōlon (“image” or “form”), pareidolia is the tendency to perceive a specific, often meaningful image in a random or ambiguous visual pattern.==

==That’s all for today!==
