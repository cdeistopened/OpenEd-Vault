## ==**CELEBRATING THE DEAD ENDS**==

=="Great! Now you know what you don't want to do." Rose Ybaben, founder of== ==[SOARING2COLLEGE](https://soaring2college.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=high-school-juniors-landing-70k-jobs)====, told her son after he quit his mailroom job at a rock climbing company. "And that's just as important as knowing what you want to do or what you want to try."==

==What had seemed like a perfect fit became miserable fast—and that was valuable.==

==As Rose explains in== ==[the latest episode of the OpenEd podcast](https://opened.co/blog/college-and-career-advice-for-teens-with-rose-ybaben-and-danielle-rose?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=high-school-juniors-landing-70k-jobs)====, career paths aren't linear. They're elimination rounds where each "no" redirects you to better options. After 15 years helping families navigate post-high school transitions, she's seen how these clarifying moments help students discover not just what excites them, but also what doesn't.==

### ==📊 2 TRENDS==

## ==**1. THE COLLEGE GRAD REVERSAL**==

==[Recent college graduates face a 5.8% unemployment rate](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3FehyreBio3UL1fDGdDH60?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=high-school-juniors-landing-70k-jobs)== ==– the worst relative gap compared to overall unemployment in 40 years.==

==Since at least the 1800s, new technology has benefitted those with more education. Industrialization, computers, and robotics replaced manual labor while creating opportunities for knowledge workers with degrees.==

==What's different now?==

1. ==Post-pandemic tech industry contraction==
2. ==College degrees providing diminishing returns since 2010==
3. ==Entry-level knowledge work being automated==

==Don’t despair, though… there’s also this 👇️== 

## ==**2. HIGH SCHOOLERS LANDING $70,000 JOBS**==

==[The Wall Street Journal reports](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/skilled-trades-high-school-recruitment-fd9f8257?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=high-school-juniors-landing-70k-jobs)== ==companies facing skilled worker shortages are recruiting students directly from high schools, with juniors receiving $70,000/year job offers. One welding student described it as "like I'm an athlete getting all this attention from all these pro teams."==

==Key drivers behind this trend:==

- ==Critical labor shortages in skilled trades==
- ==Astronomical college costs prompting families to reconsider ROI==
- ==Industry-school partnerships creating direct pipelines to careers==
