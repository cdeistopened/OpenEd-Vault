### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**THE POWER OF BOREDOM**==

==When was the last time you let your child get== ==_truly_== ==bored?==

==In our rush to fill every moment with structured learning, we often miss the magic that happens when children have nothing they== ==_have_== ==to do. That empty space is where genuine curiosity begins.==

==As Matt Bowman explains in== [==our latest podcast episode==](https://opened.co/blog/stop-overscheduling-your-childs-learning-matt-bowman/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stop-overscheduling-your-child-s-learning)==, "Sometimes you need to let a child get bored enough to then wake up and say, 'I have nothing I have to do. What do I== ==_want_== ==to do?'"==

### ==📊 TREND==

## ==**YOUTH ENTREPRENEURSHIP: THE ULTIMATE EDUCATION**==

==Entrepreneurship isn't just about building businesses—it's becoming one of the most powerful educational experiences for young people.==

==Why? As Matt explains: "There's something unique you can learn from trying to be an entrepreneur that cannot be learned any other way."==

==Through entrepreneurship, young people develop skills that traditional education often misses:==

- ==Applied problem-solving with real-world consequences==
- ==Financial literacy through actual transactions==
- ==Communication across diverse audiences==
- ==Resilience through trial and error==

==This is exactly why== [==the Youth Entrepreneur Award (YEA!)==](https://yea.education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stop-overscheduling-your-child-s-learning) ==was created, with its $5,000 prize pool for entrepreneurs 18 and under. Again, the deadline is March 15th!==

### ==🔨 TOOL==

## ==**THE 20-MINUTE METHOD FOR OVERWHELMED PARENTS**==

==If you're feeling completely overwhelmed by your day, this minimalist approach can help you reset:==

- ==20 minutes of focused math==
- ==20 minutes of reading==
- ==20 minutes of writing==
- ==1 hour of free exploration between each==

=="If you're overwhelmed, your kids are gonna be feeling overwhelmed," explains Matt Bowman. "Take a break. Take a little time where you reduce whatever you're doing by 50%. Just cut in half whatever you're doing so that you can breathe a little bit."==

==Once you've established this sustainable rhythm and identified your child's genuine interests, you can gradually add more structured learning around those areas of curiosity.==

### ==**WORD OF THE DAY**==

## ==**Kairos**== ==(KAI-ross):== ==_noun_==

==From ancient Greek, meaning "the right, critical, or opportune moment." Unlike chronos (sequential time), kairos refers to the perfect moment for action.==

==In education, it's recognizing when a child is truly ready to learn something—not when the curriculum says they should be.==

==That’s all for today! See you tomorrow.==
