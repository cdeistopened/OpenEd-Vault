==Happy Monday!==

==Remember Mario Teaches Typing? That pixelated plumber who taught us to type while jumping on Koopa Troopas? Well, typing instruction got a serious upgrade.==

==And== ==[Indiana just went from 6 microschools to 130 in one year](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerrymcdonald/2025/05/27/public-microschooling-gains-popularity-and-support/)====—with public schools now leading the charge.==

==Let's dive in.==

==**THOUGHT:**== ==Success Theater====**TREND:**== ==The Rise of the Intrapreneurs====**TOOL:**== ==Fix Your Kid's Hunt-and-Peck Problem==

# ==Success Theater==

==We judge restaurants by whether the food tastes good.  
We judge gyms by whether people get fit.  
But in education, we applaud the credential—not the life that follows.==

==Parents proudly announce: "My kid graduated with honors from this university."==

==Their kid could be 27, unemployed, eating chicken wings in the basement. But the diploma on the wall?== _==That's==_ ==success.==

==The educational conveyor belt claims to prepare kids for life. Yet we measure its success by grades, test scores, and acceptance letters—never by whether kids actually thrive afterward.==

==[Adapted from Isaac's comments on the Hannah Frankman Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jk9sdqL__wg)==

# ==The Rise of the Intrapreneurs==

==Indiana had 6 microschools in 2023. Today they have over 130.==

==[A public school superintendent saw families making the shift and thought, "We should build those too."](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerrymcdonald/2025/05/27/public-microschooling-gains-popularity-and-support/)==

==Phil Hauer runs Eastern Hancock school district in rural Indiana. He just launched the state's first network of public charter microschools—while keeping his superintendent job.==

==Instead of fighting innovation, he's embracing it and bringing microschool flexibility to families who can't afford private options.==

==Kerry McDonald calls leaders like Hauer== ==["intrapreneurs"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerrymcdonald/2025/05/27/public-microschooling-gains-popularity-and-support/)====—entrepreneurs working inside the system. They're proof that open education works everywhere: in your living room, at a learning pod, or even in a public school that decides to reinvent itself.==

==[Read Kerry's full article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerrymcdonald/2025/05/27/public-microschooling-gains-popularity-and-support/)====.==

# ==Fix Your Kid's Hunt-and-Peck Problem==

==Your kid thinks at 150 words per minute, but types at 15.==

==That's a ten-to-one bottleneck between brain and screen.==

==Alicia Hutchinson from Learning Well discovered== ==[Typesy](https://www.typesy.com/homeschool/)== ==and calls it "====[the best typing program for homeschool.](https://www.aliciahutchinson.com/the-best-typing-program-for-homeschool/)===="==

=="My middle schooler actually looks forward to typing practice—something I didn't expect!" she says.==

==Her high schooler uses it differently—brushing up on accuracy and speed before tackling writing-heavy assignments. Same program, different goals. Both kids making progress.==

==Beyond typing, kids learn Microsoft Office skills, Google Drive, even time management. Fifteen minutes each morning after Morning Meeting. Parents track progress with one click.==

==$67 gets your entire family lifetime access.==

==And if you’re still nostalgic for the pixelated plumber who taught== _==you==_ ==typing—well,== ==[there’s an app for that](https://playclassic.games/games/educational-dos-games-online/play-mario-teaches-typing-online/)== ==too.==

# ==The Babysitting Hypothesis==

==Naval Ravikant makes a provocative claim:== ==[Schools exist primarily as daycare and "prisons for college-aged males who would otherwise overrun society.](https://www.facebook.com/share/r/1J1Bg9itbG/)===="==

==It's an extreme take. But it's worth analyzing. Schools spend zero time on life skills like nutrition, cooking, relationships, or managing money. We teach kids to wait for permission instead of building things, and spend twelve years on standardized test prep for jobs that might not exist.==

==The counterarguments are many: schools provide structure, socialization, foundational knowledge. Fair. But when kids can learn calculus on Khan Academy at 11 (more on that in a moment), you have to wonder whether we're optimizing for education or convenience?==

==The real curriculum, Naval says, should be simpler: Learn basics across all fields. Master them through repetition. Go deep only in what you love.==

==We can get along with that.==

==**[Watch the full video](https://youtu.be/9IVrRhbeSjI?si=ZguSHW3CzAAcBRzp)**==

# ==Nobody Told Her It Was Impossible==

==Hannah Cairo learned calculus on== ==[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)== ==at 11. By 14, she'd taught herself graduate-level mathematics from textbooks alone, homeschooled in Nassau, Bahamas.==

=="Mathematics was another world I could explore," she== ==[told Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/at-17-hannah-cairo-solved-a-major-math-mystery-20250801/)====. "A world that was not confining."==

==At 15, she enrolled in Berkeley's concurrent enrollment program—a way for exceptional high schoolers to take college courses. By 16, she'd talked her way into graduate seminars. Her professor gave his class a warm-up problem: a simplified version of the== ==[Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoconvex_domain)====, which mathematicians had wrestled with it for 40 years.==

==Cairo went to work, and at 17, she disproved the conjecture.==

==This echoes George Dantzig's story (====[which we covered with 1517 Fund's Michael Gibson](https://opened.co/blog/the-genius-we-engineer-away)====). In 1939, Dantzig walked into class late, and ended up solving two problems from the board (thinking they were homework).==

==When Cairo applied to PhD programs, six universities rejected her outright on the grounds that she had no bachelor's degree.==

==Maryland and Johns Hopkins were the only schools that would take her straight to doctorate. When she graduates, it'll be her first degree ever.==

# ==The Anti-Answering Machine==

==Some kids use ChatGPT to cheat. Others use it as a thinking partner.==

==[MathGPT](https://www.mathgpt.ai/)== ==helps the latter. Instead of answering questions directly, it asks them. When you're stuck, it guides rather than solves.==

==Penn State, Tufts, and Liberty University are implementing it this fall. Professors control when students access AI help. They set attempt limits. They can require work uploads to verify authenticity.==

==Even ChatGPT recently added a "study mode" that similarly avoids direct answers.==

==AI makes cheating trivially easy, but also incredibly expensive. Not in dollars, but in lost ability to think independently. The students who resist the temptation to outsource their thinking are the ones who'll thrive when everyone else is dependent on machines.==

==**Cost:**== ==$25 per student per course.==

# Montessori Curriculum for Homeschooling | OpenEd (1)

[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e31168e49f5b7e6f76f0e5/68d53b8edeefe408cd98093f_Blog%20Thumbnail%20%231.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e31168e49f5b7e6f76f0e5/68d53b8edeefe408cd98093f_Blog%20Thumbnail%20%231.png)

==In 1907, Dr. Maria Montessori walked into a Roman tenement filled with children everyone else had written off. The authorities called them "unteachable." Their parents, working long factory hours, had nowhere else to leave them. Within months, these same children were teaching themselves to read, solving complex math problems, and—most shocking to observers—choosing to work rather than play.==

==What Montessori discovered in that first== _==Casa dei Bambini==_ ==(Children's House) was more than a teaching method. It was a truth about human nature: children are born scientists, desperate to understand their world. Give them real tools instead of toys, respect instead of condescension, and freedom within prepared limits, and they'll exceed every expectation you never knew you had.==

==Montessori herself was a revolutionary figure—Italy's first female physician. Her medical training in observation and scientific method shaped everything that followed. She approached education as a scientist, documenting how children actually learn rather than theorizing about how they== _==should==_ ==learn.==

=="The greatest sign of success for a teacher," she wrote, "is to be able to say,== _==the children are now working as if I did not exist.==_=="==

==More than a century later, her method has produced what== ==[Wall Street Journal called the "Montessori Mafia",](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-IMB-2034)== ==which includes Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Wikipedia's Jimmy Wales. When Barbara Walters asked if having professor parents explained Google's success, Page credited something else:==

=="We both went to Montessori school, and I think it was part of that training of not following rules and orders, and being self-motivated, questioning what's going on in the world, doing things a little bit differently."==

==Today, the Montessori method is booming in preschools, microschools, and co-ops—and increasingly being translated into the home environment. Ben Mann, co-founder of AI company Anthropic,== ==[recently explained why his daughter attends Montessori](https://x.com/lennysan/status/1947810003169292371)====:==

_==**"If this were 10-20 years ago, I'd be lining her up for top-tier schools and extracurriculars. But now I don't think any of it's going to matter. Learning facts is going to fade into the background. What matters is that she's happy, thoughtful, curious, and kind."**==_

==In an AI age, the skills Montessori develops—creativity, independence, problem-solving—become more important, not less.==

==While some argue that true Montessori requires a classroom community, a growing movement of families is successfully adapting the principles for home use. Aubrey Hargis, M.Ed., homeschooling mom of two and founder of== ==[Child of the Redwoods](https://www.childoftheredwoods.com/)====, offers== ==[reassurance to hesitant parents](https://www.childoftheredwoods.com/homeschool-help/your-kitchen-is-a-classroom)====:==

_==**"Your home is good enough! Wherever you are is going to be great. You have what you need—because the most important thing you can offer is carrying a sense of curiosity and joy yourself."**==_

==So how do you transform your kitchen table into a laboratory for independence? Which materials matter and which are Instagram props? Let's dive in.==

## ==Defining Montessori Education==

==Pinterest boards featuring pristine wooden toys on color-coordinated shelves. Instagram accounts showcasing picture-perfect playrooms. DIY essential oil playdough recipes. While these can inspire, Montessori is far more than an aesthetic—it's a complete reimagining of how children learn.==

==Dr. Montessori, nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize three times, identified core principles through scientific observation:==

==**The child is the teacher.**== ==Adults observe, prepare the environment, then step back. Your three-year-old knows exactly what skill she needs to develop next—she just needs access to the right materials at the right moment.==

==**Everything connects.**== ==Pouring water teaches mathematical precision and hand control for writing. Washing dishes builds concentration for reading. Caring for plants develops patience for long division. Every activity secretly prepares the child for something greater.==

==**Mistakes teach without shame.**== ==The materials themselves show children their errors—a puzzle piece that won't fit, water that spills, a sum that doesn't balance. No red pen needed. Just information: try again differently.==

==When we rush to assist, we rob children of the satisfaction of mastery. In other words: Show don't tell. Name don't explain. And perhaps hardest of all—don't point out mistakes. The materials are designed to provide feedback, preserving both dignity and intrinsic motivation.==

## ==Montessori Curriculum==

==The Montessori curriculum weaves together five interconnected areas, each building specific neural pathways and skills. Unlike traditional subjects that stand alone, these areas support and reinforce each other.==

==**Practical Life**== ==forms the foundation—not because it teaches academic skills directly, but because it builds the concentration, coordination, and confidence that make all other learning possible. When a three-year-old spends== ==[twenty minutes transferring beans with tweezers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSBfrQ2S42g)====, she's developing the pincer grip for writing, the left-to-right movement for reading, and the focused attention for mathematics.==

==As educator== ==[Marietta Rawson illustrates in her book Work, Work, Work](https://www.amazon.com/Work-Montessori-Education-Marietta-Rawson/dp/B0006R4N82)====: "If I were to go down to the seashore and were to come upon a man filling a wheelbarrow with sand, and a small boy filling a toy wheelbarrow with sand... when the boy finished filling the wheelbarrow, he very probably would dump it out and refill it any number of times, whereas the man would never in the world do such a thing."==

==The boy isn't playing at work; he is working at mastery. Activities like pouring, spooning, buttoning, and polishing connect children to real work that matters.== 

==**Sensorial Materials**== ==function as keys to understanding the world. The== ==[famous Pink Tower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXFwOcfdLIM)====, with its ten precisely graduated cubes, helps children internalize mathematical relationships through their muscles and eyes long before they encounter numbers.== ==[Color Tablets](https://reachformontessori.com/the-montessori-color-tablets-explanation-and-presentation/)== ==train visual discrimination for distinguishing 'b' from 'd.'== ==[Sound Cylinders](https://www.wonderfulmontessori.com/sound-cylindersboxes-presentation1-matching)== ==develop auditory processing essential for phonics. Each material isolates one quality—size, color, texture, weight—allowing the child to build a mental catalog of sensory experiences.==

==**Language**== ==acknowledges that children learn to write before they read—a reversal of traditional teaching that makes perfect sense once you observe children. The== ==[[smallmovableal]]== ==lets them build words before their hands can form letters.== ==[Sandpaper Letters](https://a.co/d/4nOHK5C)== ==connect sound to symbol through touch. Grammar transforms from rules to memorize into games with colorful symbols. Reading emerges naturally when ready, without force or frustration.==

==**Mathematics**== ==becomes concrete through the== ==[Golden Beads](https://www.alisonsmontessori.com/Golden_Bead_Material_Complete_Set_p/m92.set.htm)====. Children literally hold units, tens, hundreds, and thousands in their hands. They discover place value by exchanging ten units for a ten-bar. They understand addition by physically combining quantities. The progression from concrete to abstract happens gradually, with children often working with materials and symbols simultaneously until abstraction feels natural.==

==**Cultural Studies**== ==encompasses geography, history, science, art, music—woven together in "Cosmic Education." Rather than isolated subjects, children learn about their interconnected world. They trace writing's development while studying ancient civilizations. They explore botany while learning about biomes. They discover their place in the universe's grand story.==

## ==Montessori Homeschool Curriculum==

### ==Elementary School Montessori Homeschool Curriculum==

==In Montessori's framework, human development occurs in distinct six-year planes, each with unique characteristics and needs. Around age six, a profound transformation occurs. The absorbent mind of early childhood—which soaked up everything in the environment—evolves into a reasoning mind hungry for understanding. The child who was content to name and classify now demands "Why?" and "How?"==

==This is a period of relative physical stability but intense intellectual exploration, characterized by a burgeoning imagination that can travel through time and space. Socially, the child moves away from parallel play and develops a strong "herd instinct"—a need to belong to a group and collaborate with peers.==

==Elementary Montessori responds with the== ==**Five Great Lessons**====—epic narratives that provide a framework for all knowledge. These aren't textbooks you purchase but dramatic presentations you give, complete with experiments, timelines, and charts:==

1. ==**The Coming of the Universe and Earth**== ==- The Big Bang through Earth's formation, told with experiments showing states of matter and volcanic eruptions==
2. ==**The Coming of Life**== ==- Evolution from single-celled organisms to complex ecosystems, presented with the Timeline of Life==
3. ==**The Coming of Humans**== ==- Early humans developing language, tools, and civilization==
4. ==**The Story of Writing**== ==- Cave paintings to modern alphabets, shown with actual examples of different scripts==
5. ==**The Story of Numbers**== ==- How humans developed mathematical thinking across cultures==

==These carefully crafted narratives give children cosmic perspective. Every subject studied afterward connects back to these origin stories. Learning fractions? That's the Babylonians from the Story of Numbers. Studying photosynthesis? That's Chapter Two in the Coming of Life. The Egyptians you're researching? They appear in multiple lessons—writing hieroglyphics, developing irrigation, creating number systems.==

==The genius is that children see all knowledge as interconnected, not isolated subjects. They understand their place in the grand story of the universe.

## ==Middle & High School Montessori Homeschool Curriculum==

==Here's where Montessori's vision takes a radical turn. She believed that after age 12, adolescents don't need more academics—they need real work that matters. Her solution was== _==Erdkinder==_ ==(earth children), where students would live and work on farms, running actual businesses and solving genuine problems.==

==Montessori argued that the adolescent craves purpose, contribution, and evidence of their value to society. Traditional high school academics divorced from real application actually work against the developmental needs of this age. She never fully developed a complete high school curriculum because she believed students at this stage should be learning through authentic work experiences, not classroom lessons.==

==Today's Montessori adolescents might be:==

- ==Starting Etsy businesses selling handmade goods==
- ==Running YouTube channels teaching younger children==
- ==Managing community gardens donating to food banks==
- ==Coding apps solving real problems==
- ==Apprenticing with local craftspeople and entrepreneurs==

==Academics don't disappear—they become embedded in meaningful work. That garden requires soil chemistry analysis, crop rotation planning, budget management, marketing materials. The Etsy business demands photography skills, persuasive writing, percentage calculations for pricing, customer service communication.==

==**High School (Ages 15-18):**==

==Most modern "Montessori high schools" blend these principles with other progressive approaches, since Montessori herself believed that students with authentic Montessori education from the start would have developed the skills to direct their own learning by this age.==

==OpenEd families at this stage might blend Montessori principles with:==

- ==**[SNHU](https://www.snhu.edu/)**== ==- Self-paced, competency-based program for full college credit, allowing teens to earn an associate's degree in high school==
- ==**[BYU Independent Study](https://is.byu.edu/)**== ==- Flexible courses across all subjects==
- ==**[Bottega University](https://bottega.edu/)**== ==- Project-based tech training to become a full-stack developer==

==The absence of a formal high school curriculum isn't a failure—it's recognition that truly prepared adolescents don't need to be taught; they need opportunities to contribute. The Montessori foundation—independence, love of learning, deep concentration—serves these students regardless of specific curriculum.==

## ==Polished Transcript==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast.I'm joined by Janae Daniels, who has a fascinating story.She pulled her kids just before high school, a later decision than most.She came from the public school world as a K-12 licensed teacher.So Janae, what happened? How do you get to the point where you're about to enter high school and suddenly decide to go down this path you've never considered?==

==**Janae Daniels:**== ==It was not intentional.We are COVID converts.My oldest two kids graduated from public school, and as a former public middle school teacher, I was against homeschooling.I believed all the propaganda.I knew a couple of homeschoolers in high school and thought they were weird.So it was never on my radar.Then COVID hit.The end of the 2020 school year was okay; I felt bad for the teachers struggling with online classes.But as summer went on, I ran into my kids' middle school principal at Target and asked what was happening for the fall.He had no idea.==

==A couple of weeks later, I was in church, and this thought came into my head: "I want you to homeschool the kids." I thought, "hard no." Then it came again: "It's taken a pandemic.I want you to homeschool the kids." I believe in divine intervention, so I went home and called the three people I knew who homeschooled.I cried most of the afternoon, but the thought wouldn't go away.I went to my husband and said, "What if we homeschooled the kids?" He said, "I always thought it would be great, but I figured you didn't want to.We could try it.If it doesn't work out, just put them back in."==

==The next day, I researched how to homeschool in Colorado, and on Tuesday, I submitted my notice of intent.I was shaking.I went in person, and they just took the paper and shut the door.That was it.A month later, we had our first day, which was a disaster.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==What did your friends tell you on those calls? What made you finally say yes?==

==**Janae Daniels:**== ==I couldn't shake that call.That was the biggest factor.I had to honor what was on my heart because my mom's intuition is never wrong.When I called people, I asked why they started and why they kept homeschooling.They all said it's hard, but the relationship with their kids became paramount.They loved watching their children blossom.One friend said, "I don't trust the government with a lot of things, so why would I trust them with my children?" But the biggest thing was that all of them said the relationship with their kids was better than they ever dreamed.That led me to learn about attachment psychology and the work of Dr.Gordon Neufeld and Gabor Maté, who wrote== _==Hold On To Your Kids==_==.==

==I learned about peer versus parent orientation—who a child goes to for nurturing.Historically, it was parents, not peers.This is a recent phenomenon.The school system has played into that, separating kids from parents for 16,000 hours during their formative years.That blew me away.I realized my kids could be attached to me; that's the natural order.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==That's fascinating.A 12-year-old homeschooler told me her favorite thing about it is the time she spends with her family.She sees her public-schooled friends don't have the same close relationships with their parents.It's become something we just accept.Why do you think it's become so normal for families not to be together?==

==**Janae Daniels:**== ==I used to love the public school system, but the more I've delved into its history with Horace Mann, John Dewey, and John D.Rockefeller, the more I see the nefarious intentionality.There was a push to separate children from their parents.Cuberly, the Dean of the Stanford School for Education, essentially said the more they can separate kids from parents, the more kids will rely on the government.It was intentional.That's not to say public school kids can't have good relationships with their parents, but it's tougher.As parents, we get the worst hours of the day—the morning rush and the tired evenings.We don't get their best hours.==

==Can I share a story? My kids' homeschool enrichment program had a fall festival.The teenage girls were teaching line dances.My 15-year-old daughter said, "Mom, let's do this!" In that room, all the girls were saying, "Mom, stand next to me!" Not one was ashamed of their mom.It was beautiful.A couple of weeks later, a friend came over for dinner and started crying because her teenage daughter wanted nothing to do with her.She said, "I guess it's just normal teenage behavior, right?" I handed her== _==Hold On To Your Kids==_ ==and said, "You can get your daughter's heart back." As Dr.Neufeld says, "We cannot parent children whose heart we don't have." She worked so hard, and now she has her daughter's heart back.We are meant to be their compass point.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==That quote is so powerful.You started homeschooling when your kids were about to enter high school.Did you have their hearts then?==

==**Janae Daniels:**== ==It was a rough ride with our oldest two.But for the next four, I had the heart of my four-year-old and eight-year-old, but I could see I was losing my 12 and 13-year-olds.When we started homeschooling, I could see I was getting their hearts back.But our first week was a disaster.I was still in a public school teacher mindset, with a detailed schedule and tons of expensive curriculums.An hour in, everyone was in tears.My 13-year-old son said, "We're going back to school.Just put us back." I was ready to agree.==

==Then there was a knock at the door; the piano tuner had arrived.I let him in and went back downstairs to find the kids refusing to do anything.One by one, they went upstairs until I was alone.I went up to find all four of them surrounding the piano tuner, totally mesmerized as he explained sound frequencies and the geometry of octaves.They asked thoughtful, deep questions.For two hours, they watched him.And I realized I needed to rethink education.==

==I put away all the curriculums except for math, reading, and writing.For the next several months, we focused on the basics, read aloud, and spent time in nature.My kids had so much free time.My son picked up a guitar and taught himself to play from YouTube.My eight-year-old learned Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata the same way.My daughter started devouring books.I saw their love of learning come back.==

==Several months later, my daughter was reading books about World War II.She picked up== _==The Diary of Anne Frank==_ ==and came downstairs sobbing.She said, "She was real, Mom.This happened." She started making real-world connections on her own.Later, at church, she talked to a friend who had just read the book for school and found it "so boring." My daughter came home and said, "Mom, where is the humanity?" She recognized she was learning humanity.By this time, we had moved into more of an unschooling model.My perspective shifted so drastically.I started asking, why do they have to take Algebra 2? Do they even need biology? Could there be a better way?==

==By freshman and sophomore year, they started concurrent enrollment.I was worried, but they both made the president's list.My daughter said, "I realized as long as I just jump through the hoops the teacher tells me to, I get an A." My son, after a business class, asked, "Why would I take business advice from a professor who's never run a business?" That shifted how we did high school.We became more child-focused.My now 18-year-old interned with a YouTuber with 4 million subscribers.He learned everything from film editing to writing proposals to NASA.He said he learned more in those months than in a semester of his business class.He has job offers waiting for him.He never finished Algebra 2, but he tested out of it for college.There's more than one road to Rome.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==That's so perfect.It sounds like the reason high school is so scary is because of all the expectations we put on ourselves.You outsourced for things you didn't know and were critical about whether they actually needed it.What's your thought on that?==

==**Janae Daniels:**== ==A lot of it depends on what Stephen Covey says: "Begin with the end in mind." What's the end goal for your family? They need to know how to read, write, and do basic math.I don't care if they ever learn the intercept formula.If a child is geared mathematically, great.But what is the end goal? Is it college? We need to keep those doors open.But lots of roads lead to Rome.I interviewed a former Harvard professor who was a high school dropout.He went to a college that accepted everybody, graduated with top honors, and went to Harvard for his PhD.Society would say he was a failure, yet he found a different road.If your child loves the trades, how do we prepare them for that? My 13-year-old wants to be a plumber because AI can't take that job.So today, he's in his construction academy class.The end goal becomes the guiding light.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==I love the emphasis on what doors you want to keep open.It's more about opening doors than anything else.I want to steer this toward family culture.It sounds like your kids are very bought-in.Most kids are not doing that.How do you steer them toward this?==

==**Janae Daniels:**== ==We are not an anti-technology family, but I do put limits on video games.I talk to them about being creators versus consumers.It's okay to consume sometimes, but we are meant to be creators.In the beginning, my kids did a lot of sitting around getting bored.I was panicky.But boredom leads to brilliance.When they were so bored with nothing to do, that's when my daughter started to read, and my son picked up the guitar.We've overbooked our kids and robbed them of the gift of boredom.That's where genius happens.It also gives them time to reflect.My 18-year-old told me, "Mom, I realized what I liked and didn't like during the hours where I had time to just think.You have blessed me with the gift to think." If I could tell any parent anything, it's to simplify your schedule and give your kids time to think and reflect.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==What is the culture that you and your husband embody? It sounds like you're always creating.==

==**Janae Daniels:**== ==As we've done our homeschooling journey, it has shifted things for us.My husband used to run a large real estate brokerage.He has since really slowed down.I was running my own small business hiring company and realized I really hate hiring.I ended up podcasting.Our kids have watched us go through a transformation where we asked what's most important.Spending time as a family, for one.My husband realized he needed to slow down.We've learned we have to slow way, way down.We expect our kids to work hard and contribute.But the biggest thing is that we as parents have to slow down.The things we thought were important are not that important.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==It sounds like there's this emphasis on creating, but not pursuing things for pride or greed.You're creating in a way that is mission-aligned.It's interesting because you say you're not moving that fast, but to everyone else, it probably seems like you are.==

==**Janae Daniels:**== ==It's intentional.We try to eliminate the unessential.I'm not a minimalist, but there is truth to that principle.Our values just changed.We do less, but we try to do it well.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==Kids are very attuned to whether you're living with integrity.I think one of the best gifts you can give your kids is to show them what good looks like while they are young so that they have an appetite for it when they are older.When they stray, it's much easier for them to name that something is not good and they know what to do next.==

==**Janae Daniels:**== ==Thank you.And they've watched us flounder too.They've watched the good, the bad, and the ugly.And now they get to see most of the good.Homeschooling will bring out the worst in you, but it also brings out the best.It puts a mirror up to you.My kids have learned to call me out on stuff, which I don't love, but it's good for me.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==I love it.Two rapid-fire questions.Number one, what is the best resource for subjects you're not an expert in?==

==**Janae Daniels:**== ==I look for alternatives, whether that's YouTube, OpenEd, a college class, or a co-op.My kids wanted to learn French, so we hired a reasonably priced French tutor for six months.You just have to get resourceful.There's a lot of free stuff out there from universities or places like OpenEd where somebody else can teach.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==Second question. What is your best advice for homeschool families starting the journey later, when their kids are older?==

==**Janae Daniels:**== ==The very first thing you have to focus on is the relationship. That has to come before everything else. It's a long and painful process, but once you have that relationship intact, helping them navigate the future is so much easier. If you don't have their heart, you will not be in their future. Everything else is second to the relationship. The second thing is to let them go through the de-schooling process. The teenagers coming out of the system are exhausted. Help them de-school, gain their humanity and confidence back, and work through any trauma. It all goes back to the relationship.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==Dang, this has been an incredible episode. Thank you so much. Where can people find you?==

==**Janae Daniels:**== ==You can go to my YouTube channel at== ==[School to Homeschool](https://www.youtube.com/channel/SchoolToHomeschool)====, and my podcast, School to Homeschool, is on all major platforms. You can also email me at== ==schooltohomeschool1@gmail.com====.==
