==Here’s a look back at the week that was…==

## ==💡 THOUGHTs==

### [==**Don’t Smother the Spark**==](https://simplehomeschool.net/child-focused-approach/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=058-how-to-get-your-child-to-take-you-seriously-as-the-teacher)==🌟==

==“Flexibility is one of the greatest gifts you can give both yourself and your child,” says Colleen Kessler of== [==Raising Lifelong Learners==](https://raisinglifelonglearners.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=062-helicopter-parents-now-with-extended-range)==. Curriculum should be a springboard, not a straightjacket. The magic of open education comes from molding lessons around your child’s unique spark.==

### ==**From Outsiders to Innovators**== ==🚀==

==Fifteen years ago, homeschoolers got weird looks. Today everyone wants to imitate them. The most common response now to telling people you homeschool is ‘I wish I could do that.'”==

### [==**The “Right” Curriculum Myth**==](https://x.com/MattBeaudreau/status/1846567644960370971?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=062-helicopter-parents-now-with-extended-range) ==📚==

==Here’s== [==a radical idea from Matt Beaudreau==](https://x.com/MattBeaudreau/status/1846567644960370971?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=062-helicopter-parents-now-with-extended-range)==: You don’t need to find the “perfect” curriculum. Instead, ask yourself what life you want to build and what the best version of each family member looks like. Then surround yourself with people and pursuits that keep you consistent in that build.==

### [==**The ROI of Personalized Ed**==](https://smartpath.school/the-roi-of-homeschooling?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=061-the-roi-of-personalized-education) ==💰==

==Think personalized education is too expensive? Think again. Jonathan Chizik of== [==**SmartPath**==](https://smartpath.school/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=061-the-roi-of-personalized-education) ==runs the numbers:==

- ==Traditional private schools: $12,000-30,000/year==
- ==Customized learning at home: $500-2,500/year Plus, better results and more flexibility.==

==(Of course, there’s still the opportunity cost of parents’ time.)==

### [==**The Great Trade Revolution**==](https://x.com/Holden_Culotta/status/1848751959827698048?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=061-the-roi-of-personalized-education) ==🔧==

==Mike Rowe of Dirty Jobs fame dropped this bombshell: “For every five tradespeople who retire this year, two will replace them.” One company needs 100,000 skilled workers in nine years. Where are these workers? “They’re in the 8th grade,” says Rowe.==

### [==**Helicopter Parents: Now with Extended Range**==](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/helicopter-parents-college-freshman-ac32970f?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=060-you-don-t-need-to-find-the-right-curriculum) ==🚁==

==The latest in surveillance technology isn’t from Silicon Valley—it’s from Mom and Dad’s smartphones. 44% of parents interact daily with their college kids, and parent support groups are booming (24,000 members and counting!)==

### [==**Single Parent Superheroes**==](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.dFrKOyqO2C0vPj6Kri3tthIwJGLwM1DZAveegEWLi24GWTq43IFQkiinoII4znEynbzQf_HEA4j8Sq4QIHUskFyI-tANw_a9tp9lhvXEAY6F8_jffZng_CCM_m4JtZzHChvqxLJEK0_Wda6zA23rWNMgSUTjdSy6LwxZg10fI3peQ44ocp42ZJqptv2mQzyU9ttifUoLAvFqOw0p_p-DQavtbc0lKNgRIhtvgyW9ds8FEjB2WmH5VJWYUYuu2flNrJb3cKEuTu80DBQc5HvU8uOkybI5BrrY_1X7USTmSw5XU-3CpSifisC_bjIQMLcqUYAF9n0nFE046nrUFUQcrg/4at/b4CTphjdT1-Z88DSfu3mXA/h2/h001.h4H3WQwfKp-gLLP4Kp6qzTlneYWX_3EmnWCyxBf4zvU?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=062-helicopter-parents-now-with-extended-range) ==🦸‍♀️==

==They’re redefining what’s possible in education while earning a living. From virtual charters to family businesses as classrooms, these educational jugglers somehow manage to keep all the balls in the air.==
