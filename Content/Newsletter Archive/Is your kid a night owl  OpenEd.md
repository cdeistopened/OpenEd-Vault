## ==💡 THOUGHT==

### ==Are You Homeschooling or Bringing School Home?==

==When== [==Jamie Lesko first started homeschooling==](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-017-from-classroom-teacher-to-homeschool-mom/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=069-is-your-kid-a-night-owl)==, she did what many teachers-turned-homeschoolers do: she recreated school at home. Desks. Rigid schedules. Planners. She fought her son’s regular meltdowns.==

==Then one day, she found all three kids doing schoolwork atop a closet loft.==

==Her first instinct was to worry. But then she had an epiphany: “Why do they have to learn at a desk?”==

[==Watch/Listen to Jamie’s full story==](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-017-from-classroom-teacher-to-homeschool-mom/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=069-is-your-kid-a-night-owl)

## ==📊 TREND==

### ==Nocturnal Notions: Where Learning Takes Flight==

==The philosopher Hegel once wrote of the “Owl of Minerva,” which “spreads its wings only with the falling of the dusk.” He was speaking about wisdom’s tendency to arrive at unexpected hours – a metaphor that’s taking on new meaning in education today.==

==Just ask Jamie, whose daughter does her best math work at 10:30 PM.==

==“When we were in traditional school, that would have been completely irresponsible,” Jamie recalls. “We had to get up early every morning… But now we’ve discovered when each child learns best.”==

==Some minds shine brightest after dark. Personalized schedules allow learners to learn as they wish.==

## ==⚒️ TOOL==

### ==The Two-Week Rule==

==Picture this: Your 12-year-old declares their math curriculum “the worst thing ever” after one frustrating morning. Before you panic-buy a new curriculum (we’ve all been there),== [==try Jamie’s “two-week rule.”==](https://youtu.be/QsE-ykzzgJg?si=QNnXMzY3HRTDMxQZ&t=1107&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=069-is-your-kid-a-night-owl) ==This approach (considered a best practice in special education) suggests giving any new intervention at least two weeks before changing course.==

==**Here’s how it works:**==

1. ==When your child protests, tell them:== ==_“Two weeks. That’s all I ask.”_==
2. ==During the two weeks: Document what works and what doesn’t==
3. ==After two weeks: Have an honest chat==

==The rule teaches persistence without being rigid and shows kids you take their input seriously. It also prevents expensive curriculum-hopping and the cost of switching midstream.==

==Sometimes the only way to know if something works is to give it an honest try.==

==That’s all for today!==
