### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==MODEL T EDUCATION FAILS MODEL Y HUMANS==

==Todd Rose escaped a 0.9 GPA to become a Harvard professor with a revelation: our education system treats unique humans like interchangeable Model Ts.==

=="We've standardized everything," Rose explains, "what kind of jobs are valued, what we should aspire to, and how we do it."==

==It's efficient—just like Ford's assembly line. It's also completely backward.==

=="People's individuality is not selfishness," Rose insists. "That distinctiveness is everything."==

==Imagine designing education around humans rather than factories—celebrating differences instead of smoothing them away. Crazy idea: what if schools adapted to children instead of forcing children to adapt to schools?==

### ==📊 TREND==

## ==**THE END OF EDUCATION MONOPOLIES**==

==People throw around the word “disruption” a lot these days.==

==But== ==[Michael B. Horn isn’t exaggerating when he says we’re experiencing the first true disruption of K-12 education](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhorn/2025/04/24/disrupting-us-schools-wasnt-possible-before-that-may-be-changing/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-factory-model-of-education-is-dying)== ==in decades.== _==**40% of American students no longer attend their assigned neighborhood schools.**==_

==One of the main catalysts has been families gaining direct control of education funding through choice programs—which is rewiring the power dynamics. When families control education dollars, they weigh value vs. cost for the first time. Innovation emerges from the bottom up as providers compete to serve families. And customized learning becomes financially viable at scale.==

## ==**THE GAME THAT TEACHES FRUSTRATION IMMUNITY**==

==What do you do when your 5-year-old gets "very frustrated and impatient" with a puzzle game? Most parents might put the iPad away, but @gt_dad had a different response:==

> ==Added Monument Valley to 5yo’s iPad. She got the idea quickly, and advanced through most of the puzzles independently, but occasionally got *very* frustrated and impatient.==

> ==Makes me want to give her more video games. Good for getting over feeling stuck and incapable.==
