## ==💡 THOUGHT==

### ==The Hidden Value of Chores==

==Growing up homeschooled, my mom wasn’t always consistent with academic curricula. She’d buy stacks of books at education fairs that we’d never finish. But there was one thing she never wavered on: household chores.==

==At the time, it felt like just another task. But when I entered traditional high school, I found myself breezing through homework – often finishing work before leaving school –while my peers struggled to keep up.==

==Why? Those years of managing household duties taught me how to break down tasks, stick to a schedule, and follow through consistently. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, completing my assigned chores like laundry and sweeping had built the exact skills needed for academic success.==

==Parents stress about grades and academic achievement, but real-life skills often come from simpler sources. Managing regular responsibilities builds executive function, and these skills transfer to everything else in life.==

==Your child might never use what they learn in AP biology again. But their ability to consistently complete tasks and manage time will last forever.==

### ==The Other Inflation==

==In just one year, the percentage of students scoring a 4 or 5 on AP U.S. History jumped from 25% to 46% (!).==

==So… did teens suddenly discover a new passion for== ==_Habeas Corpus_== ==and Alexander Hamilton’s rap career?==

[==“Not so fast,” says University of Texas history professor Steven Mintz.==](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/academic-rigor-is-in-decline-a-college-professor-reflects-on-ap-scores/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=079-the-hidden-value-of-chores)

==When these same AP students arrive in his class at college, he observes that many “fail to demonstrate the content knowledge or writing skills” expected at the university level.==

==This shouldn’t surprise us. Large institutions like the College Board (which administers Advanced Placement tests) favor== ==_what they can_== ==_measure_== ==over what== ==_matters_====.==

==Genuine education is stubbornly resistant to standardization. Skills like critical thinking, deep analysis, and clear writing are getting left behind in favor of inflated test scores that mask the underlying reality.==

==The upside is that students who can actually write, think, and engage with ideas will stand out more than ever as colleges and employers grow skeptical of standardized measures.enEd, we don’t just throw technology at kids – we help them integrate it into a== ==_personalized learning plan._==

### ==“Help! How Do I Teach 3 Kids at 3 Different Levels?”==

==It’s a common worry we hear from parents considering home education. Here are a few key strategies that experienced parents swear by:==

1. ==Create a “Morning Time” Ritual – start the day with activities everyone can do together (like daily readings, memory work, or music appreciation). This builds family culture while efficiently covering shared material.==
2. ==Think “One-Room Schoolhouse.” Teach the same topics at different levels. Let older kids work independently while you help younger ones, and have older students teach younger ones (it reinforces their learning)==
3. ==Work in waves:==
    - ==Start with the youngest learners when they’re fresh==
    - ==Schedule independent work for older kids==
    - ==Save deeper discussions with teens for evening hours/==
