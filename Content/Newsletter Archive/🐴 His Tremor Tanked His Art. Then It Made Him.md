🍎 Montessori: Fad, philosophy, or free-for-all?  
🍎 Homeschooling's surprising surge: a deeper look.==

### ==💡 1 THOUGHT==

==Phil Hansen’s hand shook. Badly.==

==For a pointillist—an artist of tiny dots—it was over. Years of dedication, gone. He quit.==

==But the itch to create stayed. So he came back. This time, he let the tremor lead.==

==The art wasn't what he planned, but it was== _==his==_==. Born from the shake.==

==He found freedom in his biggest limit.==

### ==📊 2 TRENDS==

==**1. Montessori: What's In A Name?**== ==Once a buzzword, now a question mark for some. A major Montessori-inspired chain is shrinking. Is it the economy? Charter school competition? Or that "Montessori" isn't trademarked, meaning quality can be a crapshoot? EdSurge asks:== ==[Is the Montessori magic fading?](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2025-06-09-montessori-schools-are-hot-until-they-re-not-what-does-that-mean-about-education?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=his-tremor-tanked-his-art-then-it-made-him)====.==

==**2. The Real Reason Some Families Homeschool.**== ==It's not always about curriculum choice. For a growing number of parents, especially those with kids needing special accommodations, homeschooling is a lifeline to tailored support that traditional schools can’t provide. So, parents build their own systems—microschools are booming.== ==[Read the whole thing at Vox.com](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/367271/homeschooling-public-school-accommodations-autism-learning-differences-disabilities?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=his-tremor-tanked-his-art-then-it-made-him)====.==
