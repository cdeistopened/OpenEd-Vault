Breakdown: "- Thought:- Archimedes in 200 BC is depicted as a pivotal figure in mathematics.- He questioned the true size of a circle, leading to significant advancements in mathematical understanding.- His method involved slicing circles into wedges to approximate their area, foreshadowing concepts that would be solidified with calculus 2,000 years later.- The anecdote highlights the importance of starting with a basic idea and refining it.- Tool:- Introduction of a simple, repeatable ritual called \"morning time\" to anchor daily learning.- Designed to create a consistent, shared moment that sets a positive tone for the day.- Involves three activities:- Reading one page or verse.- Sharing a poem or song.- Engaging in a quiet activity while discussing a question.- Focus on consistency over length to foster a habit.- Trend:- Discussion on a zoning conflict surrounding Mark Zuckerberg's micro-school.- The school faced complaints from neighbors, raising questions about the nature of schooling and its regulations.- Highlights a shift toward flexible education models, encompassing homeschooling, microschooling, and learning pods.- Suggests future educational debates will focus on logistical issues rather than curriculum specifics.- Fourth Segment:- A poll inviting readers to share their favorite \"back-to-school\" rituals or whether they follow any specific traditions."

==His "hack" was to slice it into paper-thin wedges, flip half of them, and watch the pile morph into something that looked suspiciously like a rectangle (which is easy to measure). He was flirting with the idea of “infinitely small” pieces, a concept so slippery it wouldn’t be nailed down until 2,000 years later with calculus. Thankfully, he sidestepped disaster using the so-called “method of exhaustion,” squeezing the answer between shapes that were a little too big and a little too small.==

==[Mark Zuckerberg's neighbors complained that he was running a 14-student micro-school out of his house](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/money-and-power/a65653481/mark-zuckerberg-priscilla-chan-private-school-palo-alto-property/?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Dg4JqYCI0p5i9mS1GB85dIRbkTJMJ1y_z3b-uKad8i0x8j7Ps5zzlyaekfrC21n494iwP)====—apparently a zoning violation. The city called it a private school; Zuckerberg’s spokesperson said, to the contrary, it was a "tuition-free homeschool pod."==

==Some media outlets have used the flap to dunk on Zuckerberg as an example of privileged billionaires bending the rules. Whatever you call it, we’re all for more of this (assuming they don’t cause a traffic jam)—and we’re glad to see the language of open education, with its blurred lines between homeschooling, microschooling, and learning pods, being adopted by people like Zuck.==

# ==But this isn’t just a billionaire’s game. Families across income levels are creating new models and mash-ups that defy neat labels (and yes, sometimes zoning laws). The next fights about education won’t be over curriculum—they’ll be over curb space, car lines, and community “compacts.” Because the school of the future might be operating out of your neighbor’s living room.Morning Time==

==It doesn’t need to be elaborate or “Pinterest perfect.” The power comes from showing up at the same time, in the same spirit, with everyone together. Over time, it becomes a habit your family looks forward to—a quiet center that helps the rest of the day fall into place.==

==**Try it out:**==

- ==Pick a spot; put out one basket (read‐aloud, poem, sketch pad). Optional candle/timer.==
- ==Do three beats: 1) one page or one verse, 2) one poem or song, 3) quiet hands (coloring/LEGO) while you discuss one question.==
- ==Stop on the timer, even if it’s going well. Consistency beats length.Tuesday Flash poll:
