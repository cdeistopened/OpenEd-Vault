=="We knew there would be a dip in enrollment," notes McDonald, citing the decline in birth rates, "but that dip has been far deeper than expected because families are choosing alternatives."==

==Nearly 6% of U.S. students now homeschool—matching public charter school attendance—while new categories like microschooling and open education are growing even faster.==

=="Parents are fed up with one-size-fits-all education," McDonald explains. "They want something responsive to individual needs and aligned with their values."==

==Thankfully, a growing number of public schools are also adapting and embracing the open education model of flexible, hybrid, customized options.==
