### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**Agency Starts Earlier Than You Think**==

==Be careful infantilizing your kids – even the infants.==

==A== [==recent article in==](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2025/01/23/agency-for-nine-month-olds-yes/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=baby-agency-transforming-screen-time-128) [==_Getting Smart_==](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2025/01/23/agency-for-nine-month-olds-yes/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=baby-agency-transforming-screen-time-128) [==claims that==](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2025/01/23/agency-for-nine-month-olds-yes/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=baby-agency-transforming-screen-time-128)==

### ==📊 TREND==

## ==**New Study: The Secret to Making Tech Work in Education**==

==While many parents worry about screen time, a== [==new study from Bath Spa University (it’s legit - we checked) and Liberty University==](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11159-023-10041-x?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=baby-agency-transforming-screen-time-128) ==found that when children are given agency in their learning, they develop different relationships with technology:==

- ==They tend to use devices for active learning rather than passive consumption==
- ==They naturally develop digital literacy through interest-driven projects==
- ==They find ways to collaborate with other learners across distances==

==The key finding wasn't about the technology itself - it was about the learning environment. When students are given the freedom to pursue their interests, technology becomes a tool for exploration rather than just task completion.==

### ==🔨 TOOL==

## ==**Want to transform how your child uses technology?**==

==Try these 3 shifts:==

1. ==Let them choose topics that fascinate them==
2. ==Show them how technology can help explore those interests==
3. ==Connect them with other learners who share their passions==

==That’s all for today!==
