## ==💡 THOUGHT==

### ==When Rewards Backfire==

[==A viral story from ‘Peaceful Parenting Coach’ Luke Adsit==](https://x.com/Peaceful_Tips/status/1857453749767487655?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=085-the-old-man-who-outsmarted-his-bullies) ==(@peaceful_tips) perfectly captures what many of us get wrong about motivation==

==_{An old man was tired of kids mocking him on his daily walk._====  
====_So he offered them a dollar each to do it._====  
====_The next day, they eagerly showed up to earn their reward._====  
====_Then he offered 25 cents. They still came, though less enthusiastically._====  
====_Finally, he offered just a penny._====  
====_“That’s not worth it!” the kids protested, and never bothered him again.}_==

==The lesson? What starts as== ==_intrinsic_== ==(the kids’ genuine, if misguided, enjoyment) becomes== ==_extrinsic_== ==when we add rewards.==

==Remove the reward, the behavior disappears. Likewise, bribing kids with screen-time as a reward for reading teaches them that learning itself isn’t worthwhile – only the reward matters.==

==❌ “What will you give me for doing this?”==

==✅ “What can I learn from this?”==

==It’s the difference between conditioning and true education.==

## ==📊 TREND==

### ==The New Rules of Graduation==

==For generations, states have dictated what high school graduates should look like from the top down. Now,== [==some states are trying something new==](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2024/11/15/portrait-of-a-graduate-gets-a-glow-up/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=085-the-old-man-who-outsmarted-his-bullies)==:== ==_letting communities design their own vision of success._==

==We especially love Kentucky’s concept of “Local Laboratories of Learning” – through which 78% of the state’s districts are creating their own “Portrait of a Learner” frameworks. For example, instead of the usual list of graduation requirements, Greenup County schools now let students define their own set of skills and competencies – the “Great 8” – which can be used to apply not only for colleges and scholarships but also apprenticeships and jobs.==

==**Note to other states:**== ==When you trust communities to define success, they often create more rigorous, relevant, and real standards than anything handed down from above.==

==Finally, education is coming home.==

## ==⚒️ TOOL==

### ==The Montessori Method, Simplified==

==Montessori education can be summed up in a simple but radical idea: Kids are naturally wired to learn. The educator’s job is to set up the right environment and get out of the way.==

==Sounds great! But how do you do it?==

==Here’s Keri Mae’s suggested 20-minute Montessori makeover:==

==First,== ==**clear**== ==**one corner of your home.**==

==Next,== ==**add three learning options:**==

1. ==Something they love (piano app, art supplies)==
2. ==Something they== ==_might_== ==love (new books, building blocks)==
3. ==Something that== ==_stretches_== ==them (chess set, coding game)==

==Then do the hardest part: Walk away. Don’t teach. Don’t suggest. Don’t hover.==

==Just watch what they choose.==

==After a week:==

1. ==Remove what they ignore==
2. ==Double down on what they love==
3. ==Add one new option==

==Keri tried a makerspace, and her kids ignored it. Then, she swapped in== [==Simply Piano==](https://www.hellosimply.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=085-the-old-man-who-outsmarted-his-bullies)==, and her son played for hours.==

==Start small. Start with one corner. Start today.==

## ==(WORD) OF THE DAY==

### ==autodidact (n.)==

==A self-taught person.==

==Example: “Before the age of standardized education, many of history’s greatest minds were autodidacts. Benjamin Franklin taught himself five languages using books from his local library.”==

==That’s all for today!==
