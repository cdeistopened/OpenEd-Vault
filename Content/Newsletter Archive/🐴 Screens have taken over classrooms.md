## ==**THE BOOK THAT CALMS PARENTS' BIGGEST FEAR**==

_==By Isaac Morehouse, CEO of OpenEd==_

==Every day I talk to parents who love the idea of opening up their kids' education, but are so worried about them being "on track" and measuring up against whatever (sometimes arbitrary) standard is deemed "normal." That's the biggest fear.==

==Whenever I start mentioning research and anecdotes from the book== _==[Free to Learn](https://www.amazon.com/Free-Learn-Unleashing-Instinct-Self-Reliant/dp/0465025994?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=screens-have-taken-over-classrooms)==_ ==[by Dr. Peter Gray](https://www.amazon.com/Free-Learn-Unleashing-Instinct-Self-Reliant/dp/0465025994?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=screens-have-taken-over-classrooms)====, it blows their minds.==

==If you've never read this book, it's a mainstay for helping ease parents' fears about whether kids can learn without so much structure. It's on the more radical "Sudbury Valley" or "Unschool" end of the spectrum, but it's pretty great in just helping shift mindset.==

==If kids who literally had== _==no formal instruction whatsoever==_ ==can learn reading and math, then surely your kid who is doing a twice-a-week co-op can!==

==You don't need to unschool to gain some needed perspective on the fact that your kids might do well with a little less structure and a little more breathing room.==

### ==📖 QUOTE OF THE DAY==

=="Children come into the world burning to learn and genetically programmed with extraordinary capacities for learning. They are little learning machines. Within their first four years or so they absorb an unfathomable amount of information and skills without any instruction."==

==— Dr. Peter Gray,== _==Free to Learn==_
