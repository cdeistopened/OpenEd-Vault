# Weekly 9/19 (1)

  

Remember when you had to pick: public or private? Traditional or homeschool? Online or in-person?

This week we dove deep into what happens when you stop choosing from pre-defined boxes and start creating your own.

We featured the vanguards of a movement that refuses to accept that education has to be one thing:

[Burned-out teachers](https://opened.co/blog/lost-art-of-play?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--3ECcNdwtfXIwgPqeom2kGF7ZiF9IoTeUM6SZ9XCav8NWagpbFXg2fAdHEi9OvA8e1V1uV) who built something better.

[A billionaire](https://opened.co/blog/the-6-hour-school-day-is-a-lie?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--3ECcNdwtfXIwgPqeom2kGF7ZiF9IoTeUM6SZ9XCav8NWagpbFXg2fAdHEi9OvA8e1V1uV) who thinks most of school is wasted time.

[Hollywood veterans](https://opened.co/blog/the-hollywood-veterans-teaching-kids-to-break-into-film?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--3ECcNdwtfXIwgPqeom2kGF7ZiF9IoTeUM6SZ9XCav8NWagpbFXg2fAdHEi9OvA8e1V1uV) who turned tragedy into opportunity.

And [an activist convincing educational departments](https://opened.co/blog/fund-families-not-systems-corey-deangelis-on-the-parent-revolution?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--3ECcNdwtfXIwgPqeom2kGF7ZiF9IoTeUM6SZ9XCav8NWagpbFXg2fAdHEi9OvA8e1V1uV) to fund families directly instead of systems.

They're all saying the same thing in different ways: no student is standard, and their education shouldn't be either.

– Charlie _(the OpenEd newsletter guy)_

# ==**DEEP DIVE:**== ==Play is the Job of Kids==

==Ginger Montezon still has the Post-it note, yellowing at the edges now. She'd stuck it on Kristin Fink's desk during a particularly brutal week in 2019:== ==**"Kristin, you need to start a school and I'll come work for you."**==

==Three years later, that Post-it became the founding document of== ==[SKOLA](https://skolamicroschool.com/?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--3ECcNdwtfXIwgPqeom2kGF7ZiF9IoTeUM6SZ9XCav8NWagpbFXg2fAdHEi9OvA8e1V1uV)====: a microschool where kids spend three hours outside every day, and where boredom is celebrated as the gateway to discovery.==

==Here's the stark reality: American children now spend just== ==**4-7 minutes a day playing outside**====—less time than maximum-security prisoners spend in the yard. Meanwhile, anxiety disorders affect 31.9% of adolescents.==

==But when you actually ask kids what they want, they don't choose screens. "Being glued to screens is their DEFAULT not their DESIRE,"== ==[says Lenore Skenazy, founder of Let Grow](https://letgrow.org/let-grow-in-the-atlantic-the-surprising-reason-kids-are-glued-to-their-phones/?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--3ECcNdwtfXIwgPqeom2kGF7ZiF9IoTeUM6SZ9XCav8NWagpbFXg2fAdHEi9OvA8e1V1uV)====.==

==Screens are simply filling a void we've created by eliminating real-world freedom.==

==What Kristin and Ginger discovered through observation—that== _==play is the job of kids==_==—is confirmed in a massive body of research. When children negotiate rules, manage disappointment, persist through challenges, they're building the exact capacities that predict life success better than IQ or family income.==

# ==**PODCAST HIGHLIGHT:**== ==Every "Weird" Kid Has a Superpower==

==When the Columbine shooting unfolded on live radio in 1999, Hollywood storyboard artist Darrin "Fletch" Fletcher was driving to work on the set of== _==Touched By An Angel==_==.==

==Three days later, he asked his brother's high school students to write essays about their feelings. Several admitted they were "pretty close" to doing something similar.==

==That realization birthed== ==[Sneak on the Lot](https://www.sneakonthelot.com/?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--3ECcNdwtfXIwgPqeom2kGF7ZiF9IoTeUM6SZ9XCav8NWagpbFXg2fAdHEi9OvA8e1V1uV)====—a film program (and OpenEd vendor) that has evolved from teaching basics into a genuine Hollywood pipeline, complete with a virtual 3D backlot where students audition for real productions.==

==Fletcher remembers one student in particular: a goth kid in a trench coat with black-dyed hair who drove 45 minutes each day to their building. Fletcher recognized the gift immediately—this kid was a talented writer, way ahead of his age. At a local film festival, the student won five trophies. "Each time he would go down and get a trophy, he would grow a little," Fletcher recalls. "By the time he was done, that kid was like 10 feet tall."==

==Today, that former goth kid sells scripts for six figures in Hollywood.== 

==As Karalee Sartin discovered when she interviewed Fletcher and his partner Chet Thomas, their curriculum works because "no matter what your talents are, no matter your abilities, whether you fit a traditional mold or not, there's a place for you, and you are valued and needed."==

### ==**The Undoing**==

=="For however many years you're in a system, it's going to take that many months to actually shed everything off before you can rebuild," Kristin discovered. She'd been teaching 18 years, so she gave herself 18 months to unlearn. The same is true for students coming from traditional schools—they look for permission, wait for instructions, ask "Is this right?" about things with no right answer. Freedom takes practice.

# ==**DEEP DIVE:**== ==Maria Montessori's 117-Year-Old Secret==

==In 1907, Dr. Maria Montessori walked into a Roman tenement filled with children everyone else had written off. The authorities called them "unteachable." Within months, these same children were teaching themselves to read, solving complex math problems, and—most shocking to observers—choosing to work rather than play.==

==What Montessori discovered in that first== _==Casa dei Bambini==_ ==(Children's House) wasn't just a teaching method. It was a truth about human nature:== ==**children are born scientists, desperate to understand their world.**== ==Give them real tools instead of toys, respect instead of condescension, and freedom within prepared limits, and they'll exceed every expectation you never knew you had.==

=="The greatest sign of success for a teacher," she wrote, "is to be able to say,== _==the children are now working as if I did not exist.==_=="==

==More than a century later, something unexpected is happening. In an age where AI can generate essays and solve equations, the skills Montessori develops—creativity, independence, critical thinking—matter more than ever. As Ben Mann, co-founder of AI company Anthropic,== ==[recently explained why his daughter attends a Montessori school](https://x.com/lennysan/status/1947810003169292371?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--bHmZdWFL12K4DnYKKkYu4um-Ai4vdmARPY9xxrRuXmFS_LkHUPAEzMZYVRVbS1iW9XADN)====:==

==**"Learning facts is going to fade into the background. What matters is that she's happy, thoughtful, curious, and kind."**==

==The method centers on five interconnected areas. Practical Life builds concentration through real work—a three-year-old spending twenty minutes transferring beans with tweezers is developing the pincer grip for writing, the left-to-right movement for reading, and the focused attention for mathematics. The famous== ==[Pink Tower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXFwOcfdLIM&utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--bHmZdWFL12K4DnYKKkYu4um-Ai4vdmARPY9xxrRuXmFS_LkHUPAEzMZYVRVbS1iW9XADN)== ==helps children internalize mathematical relationships through their muscles long before they encounter numbers.==

# ==**PODCAST HIGHLIGHT:**== ==How to Reclaim Your Teenager's Affection==

==Is it really "normal" for teenagers to pull away, preferring friends over family and treating their parents with disdain? Former public school teacher== ==[Janae Daniels](https://opened.co/blog/teenage-rebellion-is-a-myth-or-it-can-be?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--bHmZdWFL12K4DnYKKkYu4um-Ai4vdmARPY9xxrRuXmFS_LkHUPAEzMZYVRVbS1iW9XADN)==  ==once thought so, until she witnessed a striking contrast: a mother crying over her distant daughter, followed by a homeschool dance where teens eagerly pulled their moms onto the floor. The difference, she discovered, was their primary attachment.==

==Drawing from the work of Dr. Gordon Neufeld, Janae shares the transformative idea that== ==**"we cannot parent children whose heart we don't have,"**== ==arguing that what we accept as normal teenage behavior is often a symptom of a lost connection.==

==Pushed into homeschooling by the pandemic, Janae’s journey began with a disastrous, tear-filled attempt to replicate school at home.==

==The turning point came from an unlikely source: the piano tuner, whose visit taught her more about education than her teaching degree ever had. By prioritizing her relationship with her teens and giving them the freedom to be bored, she watched them blossom—learning instruments, developing real-world business skills, and reigniting a deep love of learning.==

==Her story is a powerful testament to how slowing down and focusing on connection can help you reclaim your teenager's affection and transform your family.==

# ==**THOUGHTS OF THE WEEK**==

==**Success Theater**====We judge restaurants by whether the food tastes good. We judge gyms by whether people get fit. But in education, we applaud the credential—not the life that follows.

==**The Gift of Boredom**====  
"Boredom leads to brilliance," Janae discovered. When her kids had nothing to do, that's when her daughter started devouring books and her son picked up guitar. "We've overbooked our kids and robbed them of the gift of boredom, because that's where genius happens." Her 18-year-old told her: "You blessed me with the gift to think."

==**Children Are Born Scientists**====  
Montessori's core insight: children don't need to be taught how to learn—they need to be given the freedom to explore. When you see a toddler repeatedly pouring water or a six-year-old obsessed with counting everything, you're witnessing the scientific method in action. The job isn't to teach them. It's to get out of their way.

Schools spend zero time on life skills like relationships or money management. Twelve years of test prep for jobs that might not exist. When an 11-year-old can learn calculus on Khan Academy, you have to wonder: are we optimizing for education or convenience?==

**It's Fall.**

The leaves are doing their thing. You're probably holding something pumpkin-flavored, and if you're not, no judgment.

The important thing is: You made it to Friday.

This week, we featured [a guy who spent $70,000 on a Zoom-based MBA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz9M0v_mezI&utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_GDRRnteQxDRNox0mffWiNF3RuP65Yn9NZMLT_lMphNaacOTClusi-k05vPrg84cw96lf1) and called it "the worst learning experience of [his] life." Then he built a virtual school that teens binge-watch like it's Netflix.

We also learned that [middle schoolers' brains are like toddlers on steroids](https://opened.co/blog/why-middle-school-matters-more-than-college-prep-the-science-parents-are-missing?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_GDRRnteQxDRNox0mffWiNF3RuP65Yn9NZMLT_lMphNaacOTClusi-k05vPrg84cw96lf1) (in a good way) and most of us are wasting that window.

And Isaac shared a [clever rule](https://x.com/OpenEdHQ/status/1973097417772851586?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_GDRRnteQxDRNox0mffWiNF3RuP65Yn9NZMLT_lMphNaacOTClusi-k05vPrg84cw96lf1) for getting your kid to engage creatively with the digital world (rather than just numb out consuming endless Minecraft streaming videos).

Grab your end-of-week beverage of choice, and let's get into it.

– Charlie _(the OpenEd newsletter guy)_

P.S. If you know a parent in Arkansas, Kansas, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, or Utah who's been quietly Googling "alternatives to traditional school" while their kid melts down over math homework—share this. [Midyear applications close November 10th](http://opened.co/?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_GDRRnteQxDRNox0mffWiNF3RuP65Yn9NZMLT_lMphNaacOTClusi-k05vPrg84cw96lf1) (that's soon!).

# ==**DEEP DIVE:**== ==The Changing Faces of Virtual School==

==March 2020: Teachers broadcast from their kitchens. Kids stared into the void of Gallery View. Parents became unpaid IT support, printing worksheets and resetting passwords. Virtual school wasn't working.==

==Fast forward to 2025: A seventh grader in rural Idaho takes AP Calculus online and scores a 5. A dancer in California attends virtual prep school while touring with her company. A kid in Montana learns marine biology from an actual marine biologist in Florida.==

==Both can be called "virtual school." But they're worlds apart.==

==Michael Vilardo watched the pandemic from a unique vantage point. He'd just spent $70,000 on a UCLA MBA via Zoom—"the worst learning experience of my life." By day, brutal online classes. By night? Netflix.== _==The Last Dance.==_ _==Tiger King.==_ ==He'd binge these shows, loving every episode.==

=="That was the institutional equivalent of pointing a camera at a stage play and calling it a movie," Vilardo says. "The problem wasn't the technology. It was the failure of imagination."==

==So Vilardo built== ==[Subject](https://www.subject.com/?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--e81souTmR98KhCpkAt_X24SL9hQBVXyWu8yxEakeZFH9ZBuGsh238oBSl_8eEe0KH5EMo)====—premium courses delivered through five-minute videos by teachers who speak to the camera like trusted influencers. Student athletes and dancers can complete rigorous academics in focused blocks, freeing time for what defines them.==

==Meanwhile, Amir Nathoo's== ==[Outschool](https://outschool.com/?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--e81souTmR98KhCpkAt_X24SL9hQBVXyWu8yxEakeZFH9ZBuGsh238oBSl_8eEe0KH5EMo)== ==offers 140,000+ classes. "Every teacher can spin up their own little one-room schoolhouse," he explains. Kids pop from one to another, assembling education like we assemble the rest of our lives.==

==We all know that screens come with issues. But before you throw the virtual baby out with the bathwater, consider how you might leverage online resources in a targeted, strategic way—ultimately with the goal of having more time for real-world exploration.==

# ==**PODCAST HIGHLIGHT:**== ==Why Middle School Matters==

==Did you know that—after the explosion of brain development in early childhood—there's a== _==second==_ ==major window of neuroplasticity during ages 11-14—when the brain reorganizes almost as dramatically as in toddlerhood?==

==[Jean Eddy of American Student Assistance](https://www.asa.org/?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--e81souTmR98KhCpkAt_X24SL9hQBVXyWu8yxEakeZFH9ZBuGsh238oBSl_8eEe0KH5EMo)== ==claims that "[m]iddle school kids have brains that are as thirsty, as willing to take in information as toddlers."==

==(And she has data to prove it).==

==But by 15, peer pressure intensifies. The willingness to try new things dampens. Most schools introduce career exploration in high school. By then, it's too late.==

=="We work a very long time in this life," Eddy says. "You better figure out what it is you love to do."==

# ==**THOUGHTS OF THE WEEK**==

==**Create Before You Consume**== ==[Isaac's kid wanted to watch YouTube all day.](https://x.com/OpenEdHQ/status/1973097417772851586?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--e81souTmR98KhCpkAt_X24SL9hQBVXyWu8yxEakeZFH9ZBuGsh238oBSl_8eEe0KH5EMo)== ==So he made a rule: create an episode before you watch one. "It doesn't have to be good. You don't even have to like it. Just create something, then go study what others built."==

==**Relationships Trump Delivery Method**== ==[Ray Ravaglia's 30-year discovery: purely self-paced online courses have 30% dropout rates](https://opened.co/blog/ray-ravaglia-online-school?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--e81souTmR98KhCpkAt_X24SL9hQBVXyWu8yxEakeZFH9ZBuGsh238oBSl_8eEe0KH5EMo)====, even for gifted kids. Add live sessions where students see each other? Attrition drops to 2-3%. "When you've learned something new, you need that interaction."==

==**The Definition Problem**== ==[Researcher Brian Ray of the National Home Education Research Institute says we need a uniform definition of homeschooling: parent-controlled, home-based, and privately funded](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5211580&utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--e81souTmR98KhCpkAt_X24SL9hQBVXyWu8yxEakeZFH9ZBuGsh238oBSl_8eEe0KH5EMo)====. But what about roadschoolers in RVs? Families sharing studio space? As definitions get stricter, reality gets messier.==
