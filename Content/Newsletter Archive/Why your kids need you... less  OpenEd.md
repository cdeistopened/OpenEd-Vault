# ==The Three-World Collapse==

==The "olden days" weren't perfect, but there were three worldsthat stayed in their lanes:kid world(bikes, adventures, playing),adult world(politics, procedures, polyps), andfamily world(dinner, vacation, quality time). LenoreSkenazy—the infamous "World's Worst Mom" and founderof Free Range Kids—says we've completely lostthe boundaries between them. Kids used to vanish into their world after breakfast and reappear fordinner. Adults had their boring stuff. Families had their intentional together time. Now, parentsare texting their kids during recess.Even when we're not physically there, we'rethere. The worlds are out of whack.Skenazy's solution comes via a controversially-titled TED talk:== ==[Why you should spend less time with your kids.](https://www.ted.com/talks/lenore_skenazy_why_you_should_spend_less_time_with_your_kids)====" Her point: when kids organize their own games, they negotiaterules, handle disputes, learn compromise—the life skills we'redesperately trying to teach them.==

# ==The 40% Fear Floor==

==49% of parents are extremely or very concerned about a violent intruder entering their child's school—a 9-point increase from last year, with no major event triggering it. Not once since== ==[EdChoice started tracking this has the figure dropped below 40%](https://edchoice.morningconsultintelligence.com/assets/329770.pdf)====. It’s worth noting that students are 70 times more likely to die in a car accident than at school. A University of Michigan study found that 50% of parents won't even let their 9-11 year olds go to another aisle in the store. The math doesn't match the fear. But the fear is real.==

# ==Practical Life, Real Confidence==

==You might not be ready to send your nine-year-old on the subway alone. But here's what you CAN do today:== ==**start building "I did it myself" confidence at home.**== ==[[guidelinesonwhattypeofchor]]====:==

==Ages 1-3: toys in basket, wiping tables.  
Ages 4-7: setting the table, feeding pets, simple snacks.  
Ages 8-12: meal prep, laundry, vacuuming.==

==**IMPORTANT:**== ==Let them do it their way at first. Resist the urge to hover or correct.==
