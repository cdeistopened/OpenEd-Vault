==**1.**== ==**[HOW TO GET KIDS THINKING INSTEAD OF MIMICKING IN MATH CLASS](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/64539/how-to-get-kids-thinking-instead-of-mimicking-in-math-class?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=kids-begged-for-more-math-when-teachers-did-this)**== _==(KQED)==_ ==- The "thinking classrooms" model flips traditional math teaching on its head. Instead of rows of desks and worksheets, students work in groups of three at whiteboards, with new partners every day chosen by playing cards. Sixth graders who used to watch the clock now say "that was two periods already?" The key: when kids can't predict their group or role, they stop playing passive and start actually thinking.==

==**2.**== ==**[TWIN STUDIES: NATURE VS. NURTURE REVISITED](https://x.com/jonatanpallesen/status/1929904923899990058?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=kids-begged-for-more-math-when-teachers-did-this)**== _==(@jonatanpallesen)==_ ==- Research comparing identical twins raised apart shows genetics play a larger role in outcomes than previously thought. While this doesn't mean parenting is meaningless, it does suggest that agonizing over every decision—organic vs. conventional, screen time limits, extracurricular choices—might matter less than we think. Maybe good-enough parenting is actually... good enough.==

==Matt Bowman told Deb Fillman: "We don't even know what AI will look like two years from now. People aren't even predicting out because it's impossible."==

==Now along comes== ==[AI 2027](https://ai-2027.com/summary?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=twain-was-right-don-t-let-schooling-interfere-with-your-education)== ==— a thought experiment from the AI Futures Project. They ARE attempting to predict it, and while obviously fraught with potential for error, their scenario should make every parent pause:==

- ==2025: AI agents can code and browse the web, but they're buggy and expensive==
- ==2026: Junior programmers lose their jobs while AI managers thrive==
- ==2027: AI becomes better than humans at AI research itself==

==The speed is breathtaking: by the end, what takes humans a year of research happens in a week.==

==Even if the details are wrong, the direction seems clear: massive change that makes memorizing state capitals and solving quadratic equations seem almost quaint.==

==What does education look like when your fifth grader's "future career" might not exist by middle school? When the skills you're drilling today are automated tomorrow?==

==The only answer: Help kids become learners, not schoolers. Teach adaptability over memorization. Focus on judgment, creativity, and ethics — the uniquely human skills that matter when machines can do everything else.==

==**IN THIS EDITION**==

==🍎 From career-ending tremor to creative triumph.  
🍎 Montessori: Fad, philosophy, or free-for-all?  
🍎 Homeschooling's surprising surge: a deeper look.==

### ==💡 1 THOUGHT==

==Phil Hansen’s hand shook. Badly.==

==For a pointillist—an artist of tiny dots—it was over. Years of dedication, gone. He quit.==

==But the itch to create stayed. So he came back. This time, he let the tremor lead.==

==The art wasn't what he planned, but it was== _==his==_==. Born from the shake.==

==He found freedom in his biggest limit.==

==**1. Montessori: What's In A Name?**== ==Once a buzzword, now a question mark for some. A major Montessori-inspired chain is shrinking. Is it the economy? Charter school competition?

==**2. The Real Reason Some Families Homeschool.**== ==It's not always about curriculum choice.
