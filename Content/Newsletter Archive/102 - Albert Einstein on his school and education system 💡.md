==And now, let’s take a look back at the week that was.==

### ==💡THE BIG IDEA==

## ==**‘My kid hates learning.’**==

==Your kid doesn't hate learning. They probably never did. They just know – like Albert Einstein did – that there's a better way.==

==When Einstein wrote about his early schooling, he didn't mince words:==

==❝==

=="The teachers behaved like sergeants.== ==_**I wanted to learn what I wanted to know, but they wanted me to learn for the exam**_====... I felt that my thirst for knowledge was being strangled."==

==Albert Einstein==

==More than 100 hundred years later, the same system Einstein suffered under is still the norm. That's why so many of us are choosing a different path. We’ve seen that same thirst for knowledge in our kids and refused to let it be strangled.==
