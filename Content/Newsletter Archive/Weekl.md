    ==As schools nationwide rush to become "brain-science informed," one neuroscientist took it a step further: she left her tenured professorship to apply brain science directly to her children's education.==
    
    ==Dr. Claire Honeycutt specialized in how the brain learns after stroke at ASU. But watching her daughter transform during COVID revealed something profound about natural learning patterns. Her daughter had been struggling at school - having emotional outbursts and resisting all academic work. "She didn't want to read, she didn't want to write, she didn't want to do anything," Honeycutt recalls. Within two weeks at home, the emotional outbursts disappeared. "I was healed by the presence of my children," she says. Now that same child voluntarily tackles complex books like== _==The Once and Future King==_==.==

    ==Bauer champions rigorous classical education - systematic study of great works, sequential skill-building, and structured development of analytical thinking.
