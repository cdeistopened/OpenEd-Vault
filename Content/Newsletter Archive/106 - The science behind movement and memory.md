### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**Move more, ‘member more**==

==Want your kid to remember what they learn?==

==_Let them move._==

[==New research shows a single exercise session before learning improves memory for a full week==](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39572311/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=106-the-science-behind-movement-and-memory)==.==

==This is why forest schools, movement-based learning, and active education models work.==

==Schools that restrict movement aren't just making kids bored of learning. They're limiting their potential.==

### ==📊 TREND==

## ==**The Forest School Revolution**==

==The traditional classroom is getting a breath of fresh air - literally.== [==Forest schools are experiencing explosive growth worldwide==](https://www.teachaway.com/recruitment/blog/the-growth-of-forest-schools-around-the-world?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=106-the-science-behind-movement-and-memory)==, with the UK alone reporting over 5,000 qualified forest school leaders working in more than 3,000 settings.==

==Why? A 13-month Swedish study found that forest school students showed:==

- ==Better social skills==
- ==Improved attention spans==
- ==Enhanced coordination==
- ==Higher overall happiness levels==

==But here's what's really interesting: These benefits persisted even after students returned to traditional classrooms.==

==The movement is catching fire globally. South Korea is creating hundreds of forest kindergarten spaces, while Singapore is weaving outdoor learning into its national education system. Even Japan, known for its rigorous academic standards, has made "forest education" mandatory for over a century.==
