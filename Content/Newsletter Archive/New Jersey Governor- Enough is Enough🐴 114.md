### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**Why modern America creates fragile children**==

=="Beginning with kids born in 1995, they spend a lot less time going out with friends... What are they doing? They're spending a lot more time sitting on their beds with their devices," observes Jonathan Haidt, author of== [==_The Anxious Generation_==](https://www.amazon.com/Anxious-Generation-Rewiring-Childhood-Epidemic/dp/0593655036?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=new-jersey-governor-enough-is-enough-114)==_._==

==**Reminder:**== ==Parents who let their kids take reasonable risks aren't being careless. They're preparing them for life.==

==The most anxious kids today are often the most protected ones, and the most dangerous thing we can do to our kids is try to remove all danger from their lives.==

==Haidt has also been leading a national conversation around cell phones and youth – not just in schools, but in the culture more broadly. He notes the trend of states banning phones across the entire public school system. We don’t take an official stance on whether phones should be allowed in schools, but the topic deserves more discussion.==

==Kids today spend more time sitting inside on screens than ever before in history. And then we expect them to sit inside even more at school. No wonder== [==(mis)behavior is “off. the. chain.” according to one teacher==](https://x.com/MrDanielBuck/status/1877474470757106134?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=new-jersey-governor-enough-is-enough-114)==.==

==Wait… you can draw in the snow??==

==**What you need:**==

- ==Snow==
- ==Regular markers (Crayola will do fine)==
- ==Adventurous spirit==

==**Pro tip:**== ==Tilt markers slightly sideways for best coverage (this even works with markers you thought were dried out.)==

==Beth, the mom of 3 behind the popular blog promoting play-based learning, notes, "My first grader needed a carrot for the nose on his snowman... he ran inside for the orange marker."==

### ==🌳== ==**(TRIVIA) OF THE DAY**==

### ==Why Did the Trees in Biosphere 2 Keep Falling Over?==

==In the 1990s, scientists built a perfect replica of Earth's environment. Everything was precisely controlled, but the trees kept collapsing. What were they missing?==
