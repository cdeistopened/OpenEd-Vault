## ==💡 THOUGHTs==

### ==Beyond School Choice==

==**“When parents can choose their child’s school, they become more invested in their communities.”**==

==– Denisha Allen, Founder of Black Minds Matter==

==We== [==agree with Denisha Allen’s thought==](https://standtogether.org/stories/education/how-school-choice-drives-civic-engagement#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWhen%20parents%20can%20choose%20their,of%20their%20parents'%20community%20engagement.)==, but why stop at choosing a school?==

==Imagine if we== ==_truly_== ==opened up education:==

- ==Public libraries transform into lecture halls==
- ==Museums become living laboratories==
- ==Local businesses offer apprenticeships and hands-on entrepreneurship experiences==

==Contrary to the myth that homeschooling or alternative education models isolate kids, a more open approach broadens horizons.==

==When education extends beyond four walls, kids can’t help but engage more with their communities. They’re not just reading about civic responsibility – they’re living it.==

==This is what we mean when we talk about opening the world for every learner.==

==It’s not just about choosing between School A (public) or School B (private). It’s about empowering families to curate an education as unique as their child, drawing from the rich resources of their entire community.==

### ==ESAs: The Swiss Army Knife of School Choice==

==“School choice” was once a narrow debate between public schools and private school vouchers. However,== [==as Michael Horn notes, education savings accounts (ESAs) are opening up the conversation==](https://michaelbhorn.substack.com/p/the-questions-behind-implementing?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=047-beyond-mere-choice)==. Unlike old-school vouchers, ESAs let families customize their child’s education.==

==States like Utah are joining== [==the bandwagon of states that have created ESAs==](https://www.ncsl.org/education/state-actions-on-education-savings-accounts?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=047-beyond-mere-choice)==, but the laws have their critics. Some say private schools are jacking up tuition to soak up the new funds. But when it comes to more customized== ==_à la carte_== ==educational offerings, more options mean more competition, and that’s good news for families.==

==At OpenEd, we’re following these developments closely. Our goal is not just to increase choice but also to help families make the most informed choices possible.==

## ==(WORD) OF THE DAY==

### ==a·gen·cy (ā′jən-sē)==
