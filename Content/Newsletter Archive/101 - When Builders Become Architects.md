### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**Public vs. Private? How about BOTH?**==

==The Public vs. Private school war is over==

==The winners? Everyone who stopped choosing sides.==

==In Utah, a homeschooled kid takes robotics at the local high school. In Florida, a private school student joins the public school band. In Arizona, a public school offers à la carte classes to anyone with an Empowerment Scholarship Account.==

==It’s not about choosing public OR private anymore. It's about choosing what works for YOUR child.==

==The future of education isn't about walls - it's about bridges.==

### ==📊 TREND==

## ==**From Builder to Architect: Dads Redesigning Education**==

==Brooks Sullards, a construction industry veteran and father of eight, recently shared how dads are finding new ways to engage in their children's education. In== [==a thoughtful piece for Classical Conversations==](https://classicalconversations.com/blog/homeschooling-from-a-dad-to-a-dad/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=101-when-builders-become-architects)==, he describes his journey from being hands-off to becoming an active architect of his kids' learning.==

=="It's easier for me not to be involved," Sullards admits. "It is easier for me to simply 'bring home the bacon' and leave the homeschooling to my beautiful wife."==

==But like many fathers, he's discovered something more valuable than easy – the power of intentional design. The new education architects are:==

- ==Breaking down complex subjects into manageable pieces==
- ==Mapping learning paths based on each child's wiring==
- ==Creating space for failure and iteration==

### ==🛠️ TOOL==

## ==**Physics in a Minute (or Three)**==

==Need to explain why the solar system is flat to your curious 10-year-old? (Or maybe you're the one wondering…)==

==Enter the== [==MinutePhysics==](https://www.youtube.com/@MinutePhysics?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=101-when-builders-become-architects) ==YouTube channel: Where complex science meets simple stick figures.==

==Created by Henry Reich, these bite-sized videos have racked up over 500 million views explaining everything from quantum mechanics to why stars are star-shaped. Reich’s secret is breaking down mind-bending concepts into digestible pieces using nothing fancier than marker drawings (okay, and occasionally some killer visual effects).==
