- ==Ask guiding questions rather than giving lectures==
- ==Help them develop independent research skills==

==You're not failing if you don't know everything. You're succeeding when you show your children how to learn anything.==

==While many parents worry about screen time, a== ==[new study from Bath Spa University (it’s legit - we checked) and Liberty University](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11159-023-10041-x?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=baby-agency-transforming-screen-time-128)== ==found that when children are given agency in their learning, they develop different relationships with technology:==

- ==They tend to use devices for active learning rather than passive consumption==
- ==They naturally develop digital literacy through interest-driven projects==
- ==They find ways to collaborate with other learners across distances==

==The key finding wasn't about the technology itself - it was about the learning environment. When students are given the freedom to pursue their interests, technology becomes a tool for exploration rather than just task completion.==

### ==🔨 TOOL==

## ==**Want to transform how your child uses technology?**==

==Try these 3 shifts:==

1. ==Let them choose topics that fascinate them==
2. ==Show them how technology can help explore those interests==
3. ==Connect them with other learners who share their passions==

### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**“When normal is broken, weird wins."**==

=="In a time when normal is broken, weird actually wins."==

==That’s Matt Barnes – entrepreneur, father of 3, and co-founder with Matt Bowman of the annual== ==[Youth Entrepreneur Award!](https://www.yea.education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=when-weird-wins-129)== 

==The “double Matt B’s”== ==[teamed up on today’s podcast](https://youtu.be/5Mimv_vwyQ8?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=when-weird-wins-129)== ==to share tips for winning up to $5,000 in prize money.==

### ==Here are 3 highlights:==

==**1/ Matt and Matt aren’t looking for the next ‘unicorn’ startup (think Facebook).**==

==They're looking for young people who can articulate what they're LEARNING through entrepreneurship.==

==**2/ The best applications they’ve seen?**==

==Kids who openly share their failures, pivots, and lessons learned (not the ones with heavily-rehearsed pitches like you see on Shark Tank.)==

==**3/ What they**== _==**really**==_ ==**want to see:**==

- ==How you solve real problems==
- ==How you handle money/decisions==
- ==How you deal with failure==

==**YEA is open to ANY entrepreneur 18 or under, anywhere on the planet**== ==(community projects and social entrepreneurship count too).==

==Apply at== ==[yea.education](https://yea.education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=when-weird-wins-129)== ==before March 15th, and forward this to any teens you know who might fit the bill.==

### ==📊 TREND==

## ==**The Surge**==

==Traditional wisdom says tough times crush small businesses.== ==[These compiled stats from ThinkImpact](https://www.thinkimpact.com/entrepreneur-statistics/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=when-weird-wins-129)== ==tell a different story:== ==**Entrepreneurship jumped 29% during the pandemic.**==

==Women now make up nearly half of all new business owners (up from 29% in 2019). Perhaps most tellingly, a whopping 95% of self-employed people plan to stay self-employed.==

==The most interesting part? Despite economic uncertainty, 63% believe self-employment is the== _==smartest==_ ==choice in turbulent times.==

### ==🔨 TOOL==

## ==**Kid-Run Markets Are Taking Over**==

==Remember when a lemonade stand was peak kid entrepreneurship? The== ==[Children's Entrepreneur Market](https://childrensentrepreneurmarket.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=when-weird-wins-129)== ==is rewriting that playbook.==

==Starting with just 3 locations in Utah in 2017, they've now hosted over 400 markets across the country, giving 43,000+ young entrepreneurs their first taste of real-world business. This year, they plan to operate in 44 states.==

==**Here's how it works:**==

- ==Ages 5-17 can participate==
- ==Kids sell anything from handmade crafts to services==
- ==Parents help set up, then step back==
- ==Young entrepreneurs handle everything else==

==These aren't just cute craft fairs. They're serious business incubators where kids learn:==

- ==Real-world pricing strategies==
- ==Customer service skills==
- ==Basic market economics==
- ==Sales techniques==
- ==Confidence in public speaking==

==Visit== ==[Children's Entrepreneur Market](https://childrensentrepreneurmarket.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=when-weird-wins-129)== ==to find a market near you or help bring one to your area.==
