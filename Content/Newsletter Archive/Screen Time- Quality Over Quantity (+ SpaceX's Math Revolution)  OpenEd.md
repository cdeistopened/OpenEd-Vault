==This tweet from tech founder Peter Yang gets at the heart of what we often misunderstand about technology and learning. The issue isn’t the screen – it’s what’s on it. Just as we carefully choose books for our children’s reading level and interests, we should be equally discerning about digital content.==

==Technology itself is neutral – it’s how we wield it that matters.==

### ==Sweden’s Screen Time Wake-Up Call==

==Last week we shared== [==some research==](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-edtech-revolution-has-failed?r=5d1ba&utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true) ==that revealed the mixed effects of technology in the classroom. Overall, screens didn’t seem to help much. Now,== [==the Swedish government is investing over 100 million euros to bring textbooks back to classrooms after seeing declining academic performance in their heavily digitized schools==](https://glassalmanac.com/government-study-confirms-screen-time-significantly-lowers-student-achievement/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=087-screen-time-quality-over-quantity-spacex-s-math-revolution)==.==

==As our study last week showed, tech integration works best when truly personalized to each child. This raises an interesting question: Why stick 25 kids in a one-size-fits-all classroom just so they can receive personalized education through an iPad?==

==The solution might be simpler than we think. Instead of full days of screen-based learning, imagine a space where students spend a focused two hours on self-paced digital academics, followed by group projects, hands-on activities, and real-world problem solving. What Sweden reminds us is that effective education isn’t about choosing between old and new – it’s about finding the right tool for each learner at each moment.==

## ==⚒️ TOOL==

### ==Synthesis: SpaceX-Grade Math Learning==

==Speaking of the right tools at the right time – let’s talk about== [==Synthesis==](https://www.synthesis.com/teams?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=087-screen-time-quality-over-quantity-spacex-s-math-revolution)==, born from Elon Musk’s experimental school at SpaceX. As Peter Yang noted, some screen time can be valuable when the content is right, and Synthesis exemplifies this principle.==

==Instead of just digitizing worksheets, Synthesis creates an engaging, personalized experience focused on deep understanding rather than rote memorization. The AI tutor turns abstract math concepts into hands-on play, adapting in real time to how your child thinks and learns.==

==Beyond the math tutor, Synthesis also offers “Teams” – where kids can join other young learners from around the world in collaborative problem-solving sessions led by expert coaches.==

==Parents report their kids going from “hating math” to begging for more Synthesis time (perhaps the ultimate measure of educational technology done right).==

==They’re== [==running a fall special for $35/month==](https://www.synthesis.com/teams?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=087-screen-time-quality-over-quantity-spacex-s-math-revolution)==, and you can try it free to see if it’s a good fit for your family.==
