# ==DEEP DIVE: Setting the Record Straight==

==ICYMI,== ==[The New York Times just published an interesting piece about the "home-school" movement](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/27/style/home-schooling-movement.html?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8XF2LwTR2DUXebikkyH8Qe-6_gMzk-IkkRv5nMNh95GdOzyXcvCTo9uXfVz2CR6pK3jRlM)====.==

==Tl;dr: the author goes to a homeschool convention to paint a picture of a movement that represents the fracturing of shared American values – values once embodied (apparently) by the traditional school system.==

==The problem with this political framing is that it conceals the real story about what's happening with education outside traditional classrooms. A vibrant, diverse, and forward-facing ecosystem is emerging, made up of as many approaches to education as there are families pursuing them.==

==Each expert addresses a different type of kid with different interests and abilities. Some approaches will resonate with your family; others won't. That's the point.

_=="Just pull them out of school for a couple weeks and take them on some learning adventures."==_

==So he tried it. His kids missed some school, but they gained far more valuable experience from traveling and shadowing their dad's work trips. Back at school, they still got good grades. Heck, they even made student council. But they never looked at school the same way again.==

Meanwhile,== ==[the New York Times reports the most comprehensive study to date found children on ADHD medication performed the same as those who received behavioral therapy or were left to find their own solutions](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/magazine/adhd-medication-treatment-research.html?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8XF2LwTR2DUXebikkyH8Qe-6_gMzk-IkkRv5nMNh95GdOzyXcvCTo9uXfVz2CR6pK3jRlM)====.
