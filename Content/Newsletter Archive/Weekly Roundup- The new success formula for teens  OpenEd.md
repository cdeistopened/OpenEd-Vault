==And now for a look back at the week that was…==

## ==💡 THOUGHTs==

### ==The new success formula for teens:==

==**Real projects + Work experience + Self-education + Networking = Job offers.**==

==In a world where 52% of recent college grads are underemployed, being an average graduate doesn’t signal much anymore.==

### ==Curiosity > Curriculum==

==Humans are born learners. Just look at a toddler’s natural curiosity. When a child uses an object in a new way (like standing on a footstool they’ve only seen used for sitting), they’re making analogies and connections – demonstrating a deep, intuitive grasp of the world. When you allow kids to follow their curiosity, they can’t help but learn.==

### ==Rethinking risk==

==We let 15-year-olds drive 70mph on the freeway with nothing but their parents screaming at them, yet balk at the idea of them flying planes with a trained pilot.== [==Watch==](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h53EZNNeFhM&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=036-weekly-roundup-the-new-success-formula-for-teens) ==or== [==listen==](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/the-opened-podcast/episodes/Hands-on-aviation-learning-with-Mark-Hyatt-of-Falcon-Aerolab-e2oiu2j?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=036-weekly-roundup-the-new-success-formula-for-teens) ==to Isaac’s podcast with our friend Mark Hyatt== [==from OpenEd partner Falcon AeroLab==](https://www.mytechhigh.com/falcon-aerolab?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=036-weekly-roundup-the-new-success-formula-for-teens)==, and tell us how== ==_you_== ==think about risk.==
