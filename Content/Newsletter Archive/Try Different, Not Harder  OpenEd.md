## ==💡 THOUGHT==

### ==“Try Different, Not Harder”==

==When our kids struggle, our first instinct is often to say, “try harder.”==

[==Andrea Fife (OpenEd VP of Learning) shared a different approach on this week’s Q&A podcast==](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-019-qa-adhd-social-skills-making-hard-choices-in-alternative-education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=074-try-different-not-harder)==:==

==**“If what you’re doing isn’t working, don’t just try harder – try something different.”**==

==**Case in point:**== ==Andrea’s teenage son struggles with boring tasks. What does she do? Rather than just white-knuckling it through the boredom, she and her son take their laptops to the roof. The slight element of adventure boosts his engagement enough to get the work done.==

==This isn’t just about being quirky. It’s about recognizing that what looks like resistance might be a signal that the current approach isn’t working.==

==Small changes in the environment can have huge impacts on learning.==

==Innovation often beats intensity.==

==Next time your child hits a wall with learning, instead of asking, “How can we try harder?” try asking, “How can we try different?”==

==P.S. Curious about other questions keeping parents up at night?== [==In this week’s Q&A episode==](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-019-qa-adhd-social-skills-making-hard-choices-in-alternative-education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=074-try-different-not-harder)==, we also tackled:==

- ==Where to find “your people” when doing alternative education (hint: sometimes the old-school approach works better than social media)==
- ==Which subjects are truly essential to teach (and which ones you can let go)==
- ==How to know when to push through vs. when to pivot on activities==
- ==Plus, more stories from families finding their unique path==

[==**Listen to the full episode here**==](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-019-qa-adhd-social-skills-making-hard-choices-in-alternative-education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=074-try-different-not-harder)

### ==The New Math==

[==States across the country are now accepting computer science courses as math credits==](https://theconversation.com/computer-science-now-counts-as-math-credit-in-most-states-is-this-a-good-idea-123424?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=074-try-different-not-harder)==. Why? Because they’ve recognized coding is just math in different clothes. For students who’ve always said, “I’m not a math person,” coding offers a fresh perspective.==

==Instead of memorizing formulas, they’re solving puzzles. Rather than crunching numbers, they’re creating logic flows.==

==Isaac shared his own lightbulb moment on the podcast:==

==_**“I never liked math until I took symbolic logic in college. Suddenly, I realized coding and algebra are both just a bunch of if-then statements.”**_==

==Why didn’t anyone tell us math could look like this?==

### ==The Attention Span Calculator: Is Your Child’s Focus “Normal”?==

==Have you ever wondered how long your child should be able to focus? Here’s a simple rule of thumb: multiply their age by 5 minutes, and you’ll get their approximate maximum attention span for focused work.==

==But before you start timing your 8-year-old for exactly 40 minutes,== [==here’s a more nuanced breakdown from educational psychologist Natalie Hutton==](https://www.nataliehutton.com/blog/attention-span?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=074-try-different-not-harder)==:==

==For Young Learners:==

- ==**Age 3:**== ==3-8 minutes (up to 15 with engaging new options)==
- ==**Age 4:**== ==7-15 minutes solo, 5-10 minutes with others==
- ==**Age 5:**== ==10-15 minutes alone, up to 25 minutes in groups==

==Moreover, you can== ==**double**== ==these times by focusing on activities they love.==

==**Quick Attention Hacks:**==

1. ==Add movement or music to make tasks multi-sensory==
2. ==Remove obvious distractions==
3. ==Rate task difficulty together (1-5 stars) to better understand their struggles==
4. ==Take body breaks between focused sessions==

==These aren’t rigid rules. Some kids hyperfocus for hours on passion projects while struggling to spend 5 minutes on other tasks.==
