==Happy Monday!==

==Remember Mario Teaches Typing? That pixelated plumber who taught us to type while jumping on Koopa Troopas? Well, typing instruction got a serious upgrade.==

==And== ==[Indiana just went from 6 microschools to 130 in one year](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerrymcdonald/2025/05/27/public-microschooling-gains-popularity-and-support/)====—with public schools now leading the charge.==

==Let's dive in.==

==**THOUGHT:**== ==Success Theater====**TREND:**== ==The Rise of the Intrapreneurs====**TOOL:**== ==Fix Your Kid's Hunt-and-Peck Problem==

# ==Success Theater==

==We judge restaurants by whether the food tastes good.  
We judge gyms by whether people get fit.  
But in education, we applaud the credential—not the life that follows.==

==Parents proudly announce: "My kid graduated with honors from this university."==

==Their kid could be 27, unemployed, eating chicken wings in the basement. But the diploma on the wall?== _==That's==_ ==success.==

==The educational conveyor belt claims to prepare kids for life. Yet we measure its success by grades, test scores, and acceptance letters—never by whether kids actually thrive afterward.==

==[Adapted from Isaac's comments on the Hannah Frankman Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jk9sdqL__wg)==

# ==The Rise of the Intrapreneurs==

==Indiana had 6 microschools in 2023. Today they have over 130.==

==[A public school superintendent saw families making the shift and thought, "We should build those too."](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerrymcdonald/2025/05/27/public-microschooling-gains-popularity-and-support/)==

==Phil Hauer runs Eastern Hancock school district in rural Indiana. He just launched the state's first network of public charter microschools—while keeping his superintendent job.==

==Instead of fighting innovation, he's embracing it and bringing microschool flexibility to families who can't afford private options.==

==Kerry McDonald calls leaders like Hauer== ==["intrapreneurs"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerrymcdonald/2025/05/27/public-microschooling-gains-popularity-and-support/)====—entrepreneurs working inside the system. They're proof that open education works everywhere: in your living room, at a learning pod, or even in a public school that decides to reinvent itself.==

# ==Fix Your Kid's Hunt-and-Peck Problem==

==Your kid thinks at 150 words per minute, but types at 15.==

==That's a ten-to-one bottleneck between brain and screen.==

==Alicia Hutchinson from Learning Well discovered== ==[Typesy](https://www.typesy.com/homeschool/)== ==and calls it "====[the best typing program for homeschool.](https://www.aliciahutchinson.com/the-best-typing-program-for-homeschool/)===="==

=="My middle schooler actually looks forward to typing practice—something I didn't expect!" she says.==

==Her high schooler uses it differently—brushing up on accuracy and speed before tackling writing-heavy assignments. Same program, different goals. Both kids making progress.==

==Beyond typing, kids learn Microsoft Office skills, Google Drive, even time management. Fifteen minutes each morning after Morning Meeting. Parents track progress with one click.==

==$67 gets your entire family lifetime access.==

==And if you’re still nostalgic for the pixelated plumber who taught== _==you==_ ==typing—well,== ==[there’s an app for that](https://playclassic.games/games/educational-dos-games-online/play-mario-teaches-typing-online/)== ==too.==

# ==WORD OF THE DAY: Intrapreneur==

==**In·tra·pre·neur**== ==(IN-truh-pruh-NUR)==

==Someone who acts like an entrepreneur inside an established organization. The safer cousin of entrepreneurship—sometimes just as effective.==
