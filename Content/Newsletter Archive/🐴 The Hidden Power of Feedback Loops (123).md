## ==**When Physics Meets the Pavement**==

==In Florida’s== [==Surf Skate Science==](https://www.surfandskate.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-hidden-power-of-feedback-loops-123) ==program, Newton's Laws aren't abstract concepts – they're the difference between landing a kickflip and eating concrete. Students learn physics and other STEM concepts through direct experience: each attempt, success, or fall provides instant feedback that no textbook can match.==

==Instead of schools trying to be everything to everyone, we're seeing the rise of specialized, part-time ‘====_a la carte_====’ programs like Surf Skate Science that do one thing exceptionally well. These programs work precisely because they shrink the time between learning and application. When you can immediately see how force and momentum affect your ride, concepts stick.==

==If you can teach your kids at home, you can make a professional transcript.==
