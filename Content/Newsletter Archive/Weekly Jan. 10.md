## ==**Move more, ‘member more**==

==Want your kid to remember what they learn?==

_==Let them move.==_

==[New research shows a single exercise session before learning improves memory for a full week](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39572311/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=106-the-science-behind-movement-and-memory)====.==

==This is why forest schools, movement-based learning, and active education models work.==

==Schools that restrict movement aren't just making kids bored of learning. They're limiting their potential.==

### ==📊 TREND==

## ==**The Forest School Revolution**==

==The traditional classroom is getting a breath of fresh air - literally.== ==[Forest schools are experiencing explosive growth worldwide](https://www.teachaway.com/recruitment/blog/the-growth-of-forest-schools-around-the-world?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=106-the-science-behind-movement-and-memory)====, with the UK alone reporting over 5,000 qualified forest school leaders working in more than 3,000 settings.==

==Why? A 13-month Swedish study found that forest school students showed:==

- ==Better social skills==
- ==Improved attention spans==
- ==Enhanced coordination==
- ==Higher overall happiness levels==

==But here's what's really interesting: These benefits persisted even after students returned to traditional classrooms.==

==The movement is catching fire globally. South Korea is creating hundreds of forest kindergarten spaces, while Singapore is weaving outdoor learning into its national education system. Even Japan, known for its rigorous academic standards, has made "forest education" mandatory for over a century.==

==Then 2020 hit, and things got... complicated.==

==The pandemic sent the numbers soaring to 3.7 million students. But that wasn't the end of the story. As schools reopened, some families returned to traditional classrooms. Others didn't. And many, like the student in our opening story, created something entirely new.==

==That's why counting "homeschoolers" in 2024 is like measuring water with a ruler. The numbers – still officially counted around 3.7 million – tell only part of the story. The real trend isn't just about how many students learn at home. It's about the dissolving boundaries between home, school, and everything in between.==

==We're not just seeing the growth of homeschooling. We're watching the birth of something new: open education.==

## ==**GoNoodle: Movement Breaks That Make Sense**==

==Kids aren't built to sit still for hours. We know this. They know this. Their wiggles remind us constantly.==

==[GoNoodle](http://gonoodle.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=107-the-death-of-labels-in-education)== ==is a free platform that can turn those wiggles into features rather than bugs. It offers guided movement, dance breaks, and mindfulness exercises disguised as fun videos.==

==The concept is simple: Take a 3-minute dance break between math problems. Do some "Rainbow Breath" before writing practice. Get the bodies moving so the minds can focus.==

==**Perfect for:**==

- ==Breaking up longer study sessions==
- ==Transitioning between subjects==
- ==Getting the wiggles out on rainy days==
- ==Making "boring" topics fun through movement==
- ==Teaching mindfulness and emotional regulation==

==**Pro tip:**== ==Create a free account and the platform remembers your family's favorite videos. Available on most devices, including phones, tablets, streaming boxes, and smart TVs.==

### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**Your brain can't multitask (but here's what it can do)**==

==Remember being told your brain can juggle multiple things at once? Turns out that's a myth.==

==[Cognitive scientist Megan Sumeracki explains](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/multitasking/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=108-what-happened-in-2012)== ==we== _==can==_ ==multitask! But only when one activity is on autopilot (like walking while listening to a podcast). It’s when we attempt to engage in two activities requiring focused attention that we miss crucial parts of both (like trying to watch two movies simultaneously).==

==This matters because traditional classrooms often force kids to multitask without realizing it: Taking notes while listening to lectures. Reading slides while processing explanations. Even having a phone nearby (not using it, just nearby) creates a cognitive tax.==

## ==**What happened in 2012? (The “Great Rewiring”)**==

==Something changed dramatically for young people in the early 2010s. The data is striking:==

- ==Depression and anxiety rose >50%==
- ==Academic achievement reversed decades of steady gains==
- ==Social connection and dating plummeted==

==So… what happened? Sometime around 2012,== ==[social psychologist Jonathan Haidt notes](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/teen-childhood-smartphone-use-mental-health-effects/677722/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=108-what-happened-in-2012)====, smartphones went from luxury to necessity. Social lives moved online; constant connection became the norm.==

==We're not just seeing "kids these days" struggling – we're witnessing the first generation to grow up with== _==**perpetual digital connection**==_==, and their development looks fundamentally different.==

==**A common trap in education:**== ==Creating reward systems that frame learning as "the bad thing I need to get paid to do."==

==Instead, try a framework from education innovator Niels Hoven:==

==Use== _==**temporary**==_ ==rewards strategically when at least one of the following criteria applies:==

1. ==The activity becomes more fun with practice==
2. ==The skill becomes easier with time==
3. ==You're building initial momentum==

==**Real example**====: Temporary rewards for ski lessons until the natural thrill of skiing takes over.==

==Think of it as a jumpstart, not a bribe. The goal is to help them discover what naturally motivates them.==

==The best reward is discovering you don't need the reward anymore.==

## ==**Q: In what year did the first iPhone come out?**==

==(Hint: It was before things went sideways in 2012...)==

==Answer: ㄥ00ᄅ 'ㄣ ʎlnſ==

==Fun fact: When Steve Jobs unveiled it, he actually presented it as three revolutionary products: "A widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough Internet communications device." Then he revealed it was all one device. The audience went wild.==

==That’s all for today!==

==We dug into the method. It works. But before jumping to the conclusion that we should change the way we teach multiplication, we should note that this clever hack== _==**only works for a very specific kind of problem**==_ ==– 90-something x 90-something. The irony is that China’s education system actually embraces a foundations-first “Mastery Method,” where students only move on to the next concept after mastering each skill.==

==**True:**== ==American math comprehension just hit a 30-year low.==

==**False:**== ==The solution lies in faster ways to long multiplication.==

==Should we question the way things have always been done? Yes! But let’s not throw the baby (long multiplication) out with the bath water (one-size-fits-all learning).==

### ==🛠️ TOOL==

## ==**Math Academy**==

==While the traditional classroom tries to teach everyone math at the same pace,== ==[Math Academy](http://mathacademy.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=when-math-finally-clicks-oed-109)== ==takes a different approach: You move forward when you're ready. Not before. Not after.==

==Many students advance multiple grade levels in a single year. One parent, watching their child go from struggling with basic algebra to mastering calculus in under a year, put it this way: "It sounds hyperbolic, but it's not—I saw it happen with my own eyes."==

==According to the company, this is what happens when you solve three core problems:==

==**Problem #1: Moving too fast (or too slow)**== ==Most students are either bored or lost in math class. Math Academy's AI adapts to each student's exact level - not their grade level or age.==

==**Problem #2: The forgetting curve**== ==Remember learning something in math class only to forget it by next semester? Spaced repetition system ensures concepts stick.==

==**Problem #3: Shaky foundations**== ==You wouldn't try to build a house on sand. But that's what happens when we push kids forward before they've mastered the basics.==

==If you’re looking for a change, you can try it out for $49/month, with a 30-day guarantee.==
