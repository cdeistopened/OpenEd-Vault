==Happy Sunday!==

==Our weekly Friday round-up decided to take a weekend getaway. But like a good field trip, sometimes the best learning happens when we go off-schedule.==

==Last week flew by – we covered everything from the surprising benefits of “wasting time” with plastic bricks to groundbreaking research on raising happy kids.==

==**In this edition:**==

- ==**The new science of raising happy kids**== ==🛝==
- ==**Worldschooling 101:**== ==No passport required! 🌍==
- ==**Deschooling vs. Unschooling:**== ==A tale of two educational rebels 🎨==
- ==**Free app alert:**== ==Teach your monster to read 👹==
- ==**Meet Lily:**== ==Our pickleball champion and OpenEd superstar 🏆==

==Let’s dive in, shall we?==

### ==**The new science of raising happy kids**== ==🧠==

==A== [==50-year study involving over 126,000 families across 38 countries==](https://opened-daily.beehiiv.com/p/tldr-tuesday-new-science-raising-happy-kids) ==reveals that ‘autonomy-supportive parenting’ leads to happier, healthier kids. This approach encourages age-appropriate choices and provides rationales for rules, nurturing decision-making skills within boundaries. It aligns with principles of self-directed learning – supporting children as they explore their unique interests and goals. So== [==next time you feel guilty about letting your kid build LEGO instead of drilling math facts==](https://opened.co/blog/i-played-with-legos-instead-of-doing-math/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=confession-i-played-with-lego-instead-of-doing-math)==, remember: you might be on the right track!==

### ==**Worldschooling 101: No passport required!**== ==🌍==

[==Worldschooling==](https://joinprisma.com/blog/worldschooling?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=3-quick-bites) ==isn’t just for globetrotting families. It’s about turning the whole world into a classroom, whether you’re exploring Nepal or just visiting your local international market. We looked at how the Thygerson family blends online learning through OpenEd with real-world experiences. From building robots at home to studying marine biology with wild dolphins, worldschooling is all about seeing learning opportunities in everyday experiences. Ready to turn your next family outing into an educational adventure?==

### ==**Deschooling vs. Unschooling: A tale of two educational rebels**== ==🎨==

==Confused by the terminology? You’re not alone. We unpacked two influential approaches to learning outside the box:==

- ==**Deschooling**====: Proposed by Ivan Illich in 1971, it argues for a societal shift away from dependence on traditional schooling.==
- ==**Unschooling**====: Developed by educator John Holt, this approach lets kids pursue their passions and learn through real-life experiences.==

==While not identical, both challenge traditional notions of education and emphasize self-directed learning. These philosophies have influenced much of modern education reform, including the growth of project-based learning and personalized education plans.==

### ==**Quick Hits: Free Apps, Champions, and Critical Thinking**== ==📚==

==📱== ==**Free “Teach Your Monster to Read” App**== ==– For a limited time,== [==download this highly-recommended early reading app for free==](https://www.teachyourmonster.org/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=3-quick-bites) ==(usually $8.99 on iOS, $3.99 on Android).==

==**🏆 Meet Lily: Pickleball Champion and OpenEd Star**== ==– At 14,== [==Lily Goodwin won two Gold Medals at the Pro Tour of Pickleball Juniors event==](https://opened-daily.beehiiv.com/p/3-quick-bites-eeb6)==. She’s proof that with OpenEd’s flexibility, you can chase your dreams without compromising education.==

==🧠== ==**Sharpen Your Critical Thinking**== ==– In== [==our latest podcast==](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-006-deschooling-your-mind-with-hannah-frankman/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=deschooling-vs-unschooling)==, Hannah Frankman (==[==@rebeleducator==](https://twitter.com/rebeleducator?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=deschooling-vs-unschooling)==) shares tools to help young learners navigate complex information.==

==That’s a wrap for this week! We’d love to hear your thoughts on any of these topics. What resonated with you? What challenges or inspires you about the changing face of education?==

==Wishing you a weekend full of curiosity and learning,==
