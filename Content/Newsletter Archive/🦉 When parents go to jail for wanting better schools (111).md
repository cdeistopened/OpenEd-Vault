### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**When Your Address Matters More Than Your Aspirations**==

=="I remember my mother and grandmother having this conversation about whose address we might use so I could attend Mount Royal,"== [==50CAN==](https://50can.org/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=when-parents-go-to-jail-for-wanting-better-schools-111) ==President Derrell Bradford recalls with a knowing smile. "Looking back now, I realize - that was highly illegal. But it was also deeply subversive in an important way."==

==Bradford, now a leading voice in education reform, breaks down how families typically access school choice:==

=="There are really just four ways: You're lucky. You're connected. You're rich enough to buy in the right neighborhood or pay tuition. Or you lie - which is how most families actually do it."==

==His conclusion is stark:== ==**"A system that prioritizes a child's address over their aspirations is not one I aspire to."**==

### ==📊 TREND==

## ==**Zoning Out: Schools Drop the ZIP Code Game**==

==In 2011,== [==Ohio mom Kelley Williams-Bolar spent 10 days in jail==](https://availabletoall.org/report-when-good-parents-go-to-jail/?et_fb=1&PageSpeed=off&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=when-parents-go-to-jail-for-wanting-better-schools-111)==. Her crime? Using her father's address to enroll her daughters in a better school district.==

==In nearly half of U.S. states, parents can face criminal prosecution – including jail time – for using a different address to access better schools. Some districts even hire private investigators to track down families they believe "don't belong."==

==But the tide is turning. States are finally recognizing that a child's potential shouldn't be limited by their postal code. Here's what's happening:==

- [==Colorado: More than 199,000 students (28% of public school enrollment) now attend schools outside their assigned zones==](https://www.the74million.org/article/last-year-200k-colorado-kids-used-open-enrollment-to-pick-their-district-school/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=when-parents-go-to-jail-for-wanting-better-schools-111)
- ==Florida: 273,000 students use open enrollment to choose their schools==
- ==Arizona: All districts must accept transfer students tuition-free, with buses allowed to cross district lines==

==Instead of criminalizing parents for seeking better opportunities, we should be breaking down the barriers that force them to make such desperate choices in the first place.==
