## ==💡 THOUGHT==

### ==“But I Work Full-Time…”==

==Last week, we shared== [==research on the “ROI” of homeschooling==](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.hqn5fvRZGNlF5Uv2NRQYleumk5kEk5K_4mpEDgDEwf2KmBafUTuSFchWOx1Es1A2C7J-jPflYmPw-tqdb4DAO4yXkv2Je1LPcmWhlAv48YAGgigdJyZBq-GOn-5NmDJ3Vwn-qqO9dMQOz5TmGD76lXhYGvsEehZ03cRe-gxAfYaTXyVkrmdwoYHoFxxafA8OUDmkPMBnOES5WXr_PrsQWCZajXrce6SPxn7D0XMfm-xbesWwhtMpVXRgg1TO8be5gTnwJaU44qpeSi-s69Rk4bV0dztdjFO4Lx5UgNvfGdQ/4av/ZXE40ilHRVCd2MHhmmoOew/h7/h001.HwJyyDoYCsTrP446VQYBfcErvr2yoHsseXZeBfqqOdQ?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=064-custom-education-for-single-and-working-parents)==, showing how it can be more affordable and effective than traditional private education. But a reader, Virginia, replied with an important reality check:==

==_“I work in technology, and I’ve been unable to find a work-from-home position that would allow the flexibility to homeschool. My husband and I both work outside the home… it is 100% of the reason I am not homeschooling my kids.”_==

==She’s right – the “true cost” of homeschooling must include the opportunity cost of reduced work hours or staying out of the workforce entirely. And that’s a deal-breaker for many families.==

==But here’s the good news:== ==**You don’t have to choose between work and personalized education.**==

[==Meet Sunny Simkins==](https://youtu.be/Y5U8Hm0iei4?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=064-custom-education-for-single-and-working-parents)==, a single working mom with two kids in public school, who works in OpenEd’s Learning division.==

==“Public school provides the daytime support I need,” she explains. “But I’ve identified my kids’ learning styles and interests… and I make sure they have outlets for all of that. I don’t just assume school will handle it all.”==

==Her solution? Strategic add-ons and after-school programs:==

- ==Mathnasium for her daughter who needs extra help with math==
- ==Ninja Warrior classes for her son who needs movement==
- ==Community theater for creative expression (who doesn’t need that?)==

[==Watch Sunny’s full story==](https://youtu.be/Y5U8Hm0iei4?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=064-custom-education-for-single-and-working-parents)

==If you can’t homeschool… If you need to work full-time… If public school is your only option… You can STILL customize your child’s education. The secret isn’t fighting the system. It’s getting creative with the pieces you have..==

### ==Gaming Gets Serious About Digital Literacy==

==A conversation between== [==AEI’s education scholar Rick Hess==](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/this-group-is-trying-to-teach-digital-literacy-heres-how/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=064-custom-education-for-single-and-working-parents) ==and a former Stanford professor just revealed how Microsoft’s Minecraft – the world’s best-selling video game with over 300 million copies sold – is tackling one of education’s biggest challenges: digital literacy.==

==The Digital Inquiry Group (DIG), founded by former Stanford professor Sam Wineburg, has partnered with Microsoft to teach kids something more valuable than building virtual worlds—how to navigate the== ==_real_== ==digital world. Through interactive lessons and Microsoft’s new “Search Coach” browser, students learn to spot unreliable sources and identify conflicts of interest.==

==We were ahead of this curve with== [==our Minecraft STEAM Foundations course (available for grades 3-8)==](https://launchpad.neolms.com/visitor_catalog_class/show/4742474?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=064-custom-education-for-single-and-working-parents)==, which blends creative exploration with real-world problem-solving. Students tackle engineering challenges, design sustainable cities, and even explore historical sites – all while gaining access to Microsoft Office 365 tools to document their journey.==

## ==⚒️ TOOL==

### ==The Sacred Hour==

==Whether you’re homeschooling full-time or supplementing after school, here’s a powerful technique we’ve heard from dozens of families: Create a “sacred hour” for learning.==

==**The concept is simple:**==

- ==Pick one consistent hour==
- ==Make it completely distraction-free==
- ==Be fully present (no multitasking!)==
- ==Treat it like an important appointment==

==**For example:**== ==If your child struggles with math, make 4-5 PM your “sacred math hour” every Tuesday and Thursday. No phones, no dishes, no distractions – just focused learning time.==

==That’s all for today!==
