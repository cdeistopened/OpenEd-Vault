==We’ve all been there – someone sends you a long article/email/podcast, and you think, “====_who has time for this??_====”==

==Enter== ==**tl;dr Tuesday**====. Tl;dr used to stand for “====**Too Long; Didn’t Read**====” but for us, it means “====**today’s learning, directly relevant**====.” We’ll break down long, complex educational topics into quick, skimmable summaries – so you can absorb the latest trends and research (without needing to read/listen on 3x speed).==

==In this edition:==

- ==Pam Barnhill’s podcast reminds us that there’s no one ‘right way’ to educate.==
- ==When switching schools isn’t enough.==
- ==Kids are craving creativity and hands-on learning. Are we listening? (====**Plus, how OpenEd is already making it happen.**====)==

==Let’s dive in.==

### ==🎨== ==**The ‘Eclectic’ approach (aka Open Education)**==

==Montessori… Waldorf… Acton… Deschooling, Unschooling, Worldschooling… and don’t forget Classical Education!==

==The variety of alternative schooling methods can be intriguing – but also overwhelming.== [==Pam Barnhill’s latest episode of the==](https://pambarnhill.com/homeschool-methods-thoughts/?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=homeschool-methods-thoughts) [==**Homeschool Better Together**==](https://pambarnhill.com/homeschool-methods-thoughts/?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=homeschool-methods-thoughts) [==podcast==](https://pambarnhill.com/homeschool-methods-thoughts/?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=homeschool-methods-thoughts) ==reminds us that there’s no one ‘right way’ to educate.==

==Barnhill introduces a catch-all term:== ==**Eclectic**====. This approach combines elements from various methods to create a personalized curriculum for each child. Sound familiar? We call this “open education” – tailoring learning to fit the child (instead of the other way around).==

==**Key Takeaways:**==

- ==Embrace diversity in educational approaches==
- ==Mix and match methods to suit your child’s needs==
- ==Remember: What works for one child may not work for another==

==_**Coming soon:**_== ==_We’ll be doing deeper dives into these different approaches in future editions. Comment on this post if there’s a specific schooling approach you’re curious about._==

### ==🚸 **When one-size-****====_doesn’t-_====**====**fit-all**==

==The recent== [==2024==](https://tytonpartners.com/choose-to-learn-2024-press-release/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday) [==_Choose to Learn_==](https://tytonpartners.com/choose-to-learn-2024-press-release/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday) [==report==](https://tytonpartners.com/choose-to-learn-2024-press-release/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday) ==sheds light on how parents are reimagining education nationally. It breaks down “Open-minded” parents (a whopping 48% of all K-12 parents!) into three categories:==

1. ==**School Supplementers (64%)**====: Enhancing their child’s current school experience with additional programs and resources.==
2. ==**School Switchers (10%)**====: Moving from public to private or charter schools, hoping for greener educational pastures. (Sometimes, they find it’s just a different shade of the same challenges.)==
3. ==**Customizers (26%)**====: The educational innovators, mixing and matching ‘a la carte’ options to create a personalized learning experience.==

==While we support expanded choice in all directions, we’re particularly excited about the growth of “customizers.” Want to blend online courses with hands-on apprenticeships? Go for it. Fancy a mix of homeschooling and part-time classroom experiences? That’s on the menu too.==

### ==🇩🇰== ==**What kids really want from education**==

==Ever wonder what would happen if we actually asked kids what they want from their education?== [==A Danish media company teamed up with the LEGO Foundation and surveyed over 1,000 young people in Denmark==](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/loniatimagineif_pbl-projectbasedlearning-activity-7196757683188707329-5NHr?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday)==. Here’s what they found:==

### ==**What Kids Want MORE of:**==

- ==55% want to choose their own topics for assignments==
- ==62% crave creative use of technology (video making, coding, etc.)==
- ==56% desire learning outside the classroom==
- ==51% want more hands-on, creative activities==

### ==**What Kids Want LESS of:**==

- ==Passive lectures with teachers talking at the front==
- ==Individual work==
- ==Standard online learning programs==

==We’re glad to see research backing up what we’ve already known: kids learn best when they’re engaged, challenged, and having fun.==

==_Check out our kit-based programs, like the_== [==**Code, Craft, and Create with Minecraft and LEGO Robotics**==](https://shop.opened.co/products/lego-robotics-for-problem-solvers?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday)==******.**== ==_These programs are available through Dreamlink at a discount for those enrolled in the OpenEd program in Oregon or Utah, or can be purchased_== ==à la carte_. See how we’re enabling project-based learning for all grade levels._==
