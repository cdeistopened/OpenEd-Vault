### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**Don't Rush to College Just Because You're Bored**==

==I used to hear young people coming to me all the time saying, "I'm bored in high school. I'm itching. I want to do more; I want to move faster." They were ready to jump straight into college.==

==And I would tell them:== ==_"You're probably going to be bored in college too."_==

==Instead, think about where you're trying to go. What do you want to learn? What kind of experiences do you want to have? What do you want to discover about yourself and the world?==

==Then, list every possible path to get there in the next few years: college, working, apprenticeships, starting a business, and traveling the world. Look at the costs, what you'd enjoy, what you'd have to tolerate.==

==Then map it out semester by semester: which path moves you closer to your goal?==

==It may be college, but don't assume it's the magic ticket.==

==– Isaac==

## ==**3 Real-World Ways to Teach Kids Financial Literacy**==

==Want to teach your kids about money? Skip the lectures and worksheets. Here are three hands-on approaches that will get them excited and make the lessons stick:==

1. ==**Entrepreneurship:**== ==Isaac’s kids' first business was selling water bottles at a parade. They bought a case wholesale and sold them for $1 each. Nothing teaches margins, value, and honest profit quite like watching people happily pay for something they need exactly when they need it.==
2. ==**Zillow:**== ==Kids love browsing houses online. It sparks natural conversations about costs, interest rates, and how time changes value. "Three years ago, this house was half the price!” “Know why? Interest rates were different..."==
3. ==**“Bank of Dad”:**== ==When kids get money, give them a choice: spend it or put it in the "Bank of Mom/Dad" – a savings account with interest. Watching $100 grow to $105 transforms their thinking about money. Isaac first heard this concept on== [==a podcast back in 2012==](https://www.econtalk.org/owen-on-parenting-money-and-the-first-national-bank-of-dad/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-150k-teenage-side-hustle-119)==, but now there are apps like== [==GoHenry==](https://www.gohenry.com/uk/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-150k-teenage-side-hustle-119) ==that achieve the same outcome with less setup.==

### ==**(WORD) OF THE DAY**==

## ==**arbitrage**== ==(ahr-bih-trahzh),== ==_noun_====:==

==The practice of profiting from price differences between markets. (Like when a savvy kid buys water bottles at Costco and sells them at a parade – the equivalent of an MBA in middle school.==

==That’s all for today!==
