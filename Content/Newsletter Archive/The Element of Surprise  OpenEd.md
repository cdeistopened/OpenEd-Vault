## ==💡 THOUGHT==

### ==“Why do you care so much about personalized education?”==

==When Ela asked Keri Mae this question on our podcast, her answer stopped us in our tracks:==

==**“Love. That’s what it’s about at the end of the day.”**==

==Keri described something every parent has witnessed: Kids arrive in this world as little sponges, vibrating with curiosity, ready to absorb everything around them. Eyes wide. Questions endless. Wonder unlimited.==

==Then something happens.==

==“It’s heartbreaking to see that squashed,” she says. “To see a kid in kindergarten going ‘I hate school’ or ‘I can’t read.’ You came in with such vibrancy… what happened?”==

==This is why we fight for open education. Not because of test scores or college admissions or future earning potential.==

==Because we love our kids. Because we see their spark. Because we refuse to let that spark die.==

[==ICYMI – check out the full podcast with Keri.==](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-022-how-this-working-mom-ditched-homework-transformed-her-kids-education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=086-the-element-of-surprise)

### ==Real Learning Happens in the Real World==

[==A new report from Getting Smart==](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2024/11/15/authentic-learning-experiences/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=086-the-element-of-surprise) ==reiterates what we can’t say enough:==

==👏 👏 👏 Learning sticks better when it connects to real life.👏 👏 👏== 

==When researchers studied over 2,300 third-graders, students doing real-world projects outperformed their peers by 8 percentage points – regardless of reading level or background.==

==But the real evidence? Think about how your toddler learned to walk. They didn’t read a manual or take a “Bipedal Movement 101” course. They watched, tried, failed, adjusted, and tried again. That’s authentic learning.==

==Now imagine if we applied this to all education:==

- ==Instead of memorizing business terms, start a mini-business==
- ==Instead of reading about ecology, plant a garden==
- ==Instead of studying local government, attend city council meetings==

==The classroom isn’t just a room with four walls. It’s everywhere your child’s curiosity takes them.==

==Looking to make chemistry less… elementary? Meet== [==the delightful world of TED-Ed’s Periodic Table Videos==](http://ed.ted.com/periodic-videos?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=086-the-element-of-surprise)==, where every element gets its moment in the sun.==

==Take== [==Meitnerium==](https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/ig0uBdYP?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=086-the-element-of-surprise) ==(element 109), for instance. Its namesake, Lise Meitner, could detect radioactive parcels in the mail before opening them (paging Professor X – we have a potential mutant). As the talking head narrator notes with classic British understatement:==

==**“People weren’t quite so careful when they sent radioactive samples in those days as they are now.”**== ==🤯==
