# OpenEd Weekly - August 18-22, 2025

## Opening Letter

**Welcome back to the OpenEd Weekly!**

Did you hear about the math teacher who's afraid of negative numbers? _He'll stop at nothing to avoid them._

Or the one about the homeschool mom who tried to teach her kids about infinity? _She's still working on it._

And my personal favorite: Why did the math teacher start ignoring the textbook? _She realized it was teaching kids to solve for X when they should be solving for ‘why?’_

But seriously, math teachers nationwide are going off-script (and it's making their bosses nervous). We’ve got the scoop.

But first, we're diving deep into classical education—one of many "off-script" approaches to education that's making a comeback.

_Carpe Diem!_

## Deep Dive: Classical Education Explained

Classical education is having a moment.

Rick Hess reports that the [number of classical schools has doubled in the past decade](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/classical-education-is-taking-off-whats-the-appeal/), with hundreds opening since the pandemic alone. But homeschoolers have been at the forefront of this revival, mixing online courses, local co-ops, and traditional curricula in ways that exemplify what we call "open education."

But what exactly _is_ classical education? And why are families choosing it over standardized approaches?

Pinning down exactly what makes education _classical_ has proven surprisingly difficult. We see this as a feature rather than a bug—the variety of options means families can choose approaches that align with their specific goals.

But to understand the options, we first need to understand what families might be trying to recover. And whether you're ready to dive headlong into Latin or just want to escape the 50-minute subject blocks in favor of a more integrated approach to grammar, logic, rhetoric, and history, there are more options than ever (including many available at no cost through OpenEd.)

We did our best to untangle the definitions and highlight the best resources to get started, from free options to full programs.

## This Week's Top Trends

### **Half of Math Teachers Ignore District Curriculum**

The Hechinger Report’s Jill Barshay reveals that [less than 50% of high school math teachers](https://hechingerreport.org/proof-points-many-high-school-math-teachers-cobble-together-their-own-instructional-materials-from-the-internet-and-elsewhere-a-survey-finds/) use their school's recommended materials. In the comments, a 33-year veteran teacher justifies his approach: "The curriculum presented by textbooks does not follow the logical progression of mathematics. Instead it's a hodge-podge of concepts that will be tested." **Translation:** teachers are choosing survival over standardization.

### **Live Beats Asynchronous Learning**

We believe that asynchronous learning can be fantastic for disciplined, self-motivated learners who thrive on flexibility. But Stanford Online High School's data reveals a harsh truth: even gifted students had 30% dropout rates in self-paced courses, compared to only 2-3% attrition in live classes. Research shows [synchronous online courses hit 85-88% completion rates while self-paced MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) struggle to get even 10% of students to finish](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308391574_Massive_open_online_course_completion_rates_revisited_Assessment_length_and_attrition). So, what’s the difference? For that, we turn to our latest podcast guest and online education expert, Ray Ravaglia.

## Podcast Highlight: Technology Was Never the Point

As a founder of the prestigious Stanford Online High School, Ray Ravaglia learned the hierarchy of what makes a virtual school succeed or fail.

"Students will tolerate terrible technology if the people are amazing," Ray explains in [this week's podcast episode](https://opened.co/blog/ray-ravaglia-online-school). "But perfect technology can't save boring teachers and disengaged classmates."

The human factor dominates. Always.

He looks forward to a day when we can beam ourselves into a realistic conference room, Star Trek-style, but notes that Zoom is good enough for most purposes if a program gets the relationships right.

## Open Education Audiobook is here!

We wrote a book, and now you can listen to it while doing literally anything else. The [Open Education audiobook](https://opened.co/resources) is finally here, narrated by Matt Bowman.

## Parting Thought

The most effective learning method hasn't changed in hundreds of years: Watch. Practice. Create.

This apprenticeship model built civilization—observe a master, practice the skill, then create something original. It worked for Michelangelo. It worked for Mozart. It's how your kid learned to walk and ride a bike, and it's how they'll acquire more advanced skills too.

Everything else is just scaffolding around this basic human learning process.

Forward this email to someone who's been thinking about classical education but isn't sure how it fits with open education. Or to someone who needs to hear that it's okay to go "off-script" as long as you are being intentional.

Either way, spread the word: education is opening up!

– Charlie (the guy who definitely didn't go to journalism school)
