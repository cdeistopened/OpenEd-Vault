## ==💡 THOUGHT==

### ==“How do I know if we’re learning anything without grades/standardized tests?”==

==It’s a profound question because it challenges a fundamental belief: that standardized testing can accurately assess learning. But let’s consider what we’re not measuring: compassion, empathy, curiosity, creativity. These are crucial aspects of a child’s development that go unquantified.==

==We need to reframe our perspective on standardized testing. It’s a tool, not the ultimate measure of a child’s potential or progress.==

==Remember, every child is unique—not just in personality and learning style but also in their developmental timeline. We don’t stress when children learn to walk or talk at different ages, so why do we expect all third-graders to read at the exact same level?==

==Instead of fixating on arbitrary state standards, focus on providing resources that help your child succeed at their own pace. True learning isn’t about meeting averages; it’s about continuous growth and development tailored to each individual child.==

## ==📊 TREND==

### ==Bullying in Schools: We Need More than Just Awareness== 

==October is National Bullying Prevention Month, and== [==a new survey from EdChoice==](https://www.edchoice.org/engage/schools-doing-a-poor-job-addressing-bullying-according-to-american-teens/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=055-how-do-i-know-if-we-re-learning-anything-without-grades-standardized-tests) ==shows a troubling trend: both teens and parents say schools aren’t meeting the challenge.==

- ==Just one-third of high schoolers say their school is handling bullying well.==
- ==1 in 10 teens cites fear of safety or bullying as a reason for absences.==
- ==More than half of teens think increased anti-bullying efforts would improve attendance.==

==The surge in chronic absenteeism isn’t just because kids are lazy or underachieving. For many, it’s an attempt to escape toxic environments.==

==Schools need to do more than put up posters and host assemblies. They need to provide real, immediate alternatives for students who don’t feel safe.==

### ==The CRAAP Test: Your Quick Guide to Evaluating Sources==

==The hard part of research today isn’t finding information – it’s evaluating it.==

[==Edutopia shares a quick 5-point test to determine if a source is reliable:==](https://www.edutopia.org/article/students-identify-credible-research-sources?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=055-how-do-i-know-if-we-re-learning-anything-without-grades-standardized-tests)

- ==**C**====urrency: Is it timely?==
- ==**R**====elevance: Does it relate to your topic?==
- ==**A**====uthority: Is the author qualified?==
- ==**A**====ccuracy: Is it supported by evidence?==
- ==**P**====urpose: What’s the intention behind the information?==

==Next time you or your child is doing research, run your sources through the CRAAP Test. It’s a quick way to separate the wheat from the chaff in your information diet.==

## ==(word) OF THE DAY==

### ==**seren·dip·i·ty (ser-ən-ˈdi-pə-tē)**==

==Serendipity sounds like a fancy ice cream flavor, but it’s actually the art of stumbling upon wonderful things you weren’t even looking for. The dictionary defines it as “The occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way.”==

==**Fun fact:**== ==Horace Walpole coined the term in 1754 after a Persian fairy tale, “The Three Princes of Serendip,” in which the heroes always made fortunate discoveries by accident.==

==In the world of personalized education, serendipity often plays a starring role. How has serendipity reared its whimsical head in your journey recently?==

==That’s all for today!==
