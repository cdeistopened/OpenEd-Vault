Tweetables]: “So many kids hate math, and can you blame them? Math in school has nothing to do with reasoning.” — Ana Lorena Fabrega"Change context, visuals, and purpose, and you change the whole equation.""Brain rot isn't limited to social media; it happens when we're forced into repetitive tasks detached from meaning.""More engaging, interactive learning experiences that actually stick are the solution."
Breakdown: "- Thought- Many kids dislike math, often claiming, \"I'm just not a math person.\"- This mindset can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy.- The issue may not lie with the kids, but with how math is taught.- Current teaching methods make math abstract and disconnected from real life, leading to a lack of engagement.- Kids enjoy strategy games that involve reasoning, indicating they can appreciate math when presented in a relatable context.- Changing the context, visuals, and purpose of math instruction can significantly improve students' attitudes towards the subject.- Trends- Play Returns to High School Math- High school teachers are reintroducing playful learning in math.- A study shows a 40% increase in understanding and retention when students engage in playful math activities.- Example: Students create expressions using a limited set of numbers to discover mathematical rules through exploration.- 'Brain Rot' Named Oxford Word of the Year 2024- \"Brain rot\" describes the feeling of disengagement after repetitive or meaningless tasks.- This sensation extends beyond social media and includes experiences like memorizing formulas without understanding.- Engaging and interactive learning experiences are suggested as a solution.- Tools- Numberblocks- An animated series that personifies numbers and makes math concepts engaging for young children.- Parents report significant improvements in counting and understanding mathematical concepts among children.- Prodigy Math- A game-based platform that covers K-8 math aligned with educational standards.- Children solve math problems to defeat monsters, making learning enjoyable.- Offers a free version with core features and a premium subscription for additional content.- Synthesis Tutor- A visual and conceptual digital tutor that focuses on understanding math concepts through interactive puzzles.- Aimed at upper-elementary to early middle school students.- Parents consider it worth the investment for deep learning, despite being pricey.- Additional Segment- Quick poll to gather feedback on the newsletter's content and effectiveness."

==“So many kids hate math, and can you blame them?== ==**Math in school has nothing to do with reasoning.**====” — Ana Lorena Fabrega==

=="I'm just not a math person."==

==How many times have you heard a child (or adult) say this? It’s the epitome of the fixed mindset that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.==

==But what if the problem isn't the kids, but how we teach?==

==We've made math abstract, boring, and disconnected from real life. We've turned what should be a playground of patterns and puzzles into a joyless march through worksheets.==

==Kids who "hate math" will often spend hours on strategy games that involve resource management, spatial reasoning, and algorithmic thinking.==

==The difference? Context, visuals, and purpose. Change those three variables and you change the whole equation.==

### ==📊 2 TRENDS==

==**1.**== ==**[PLAY RETURNS TO HIGH SCHOOL MATH](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/63556/high-school-math-can-be-playful-too?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-most-kids-hate-math-and-how-to-fix-it)**== _==(KQED MindShift)==_ ==– High school math teachers are bringing back play, and the research backs it up. A new study from Santa Clara University shows students who engaged in playful math learning demonstrated a 40% increase in both understanding and retention. For example, when students were asked to create expressions equivalent to integers 0-20 using only three numbers (like 3, 4, and 1), they discovered mathematical rules through exploration rather than memorization.==

==**2.**== ==**['Brain rot' named Oxford Word of the Year 2024](https://corp.oup.com/news/brain-rot-named-oxford-word-of-the-year-2024/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-most-kids-hate-math-and-how-to-fix-it)**== _==(Oxford University Press)==_ ==- We realize we're more than a year late on this one (forgive us for not being hip to the Gen Z lingo), but Oxford's Word of the Year 2024 was "brain rot." It's that feeling you get after scrolling TikTok for hours. But brain rot isn't limited to social media. We feel it when we're forced into repetitive tasks detached from meaning, like memorizing formulas without understanding their purpose. The solution? More engaging, interactive learning experiences that actually stick.==

==This animated series turns numbers into characters and mathematical concepts into adventures. Parents report toddlers learning to count and elementary students understanding square numbers and exponents naturally. Available on BBC iPlayer, YouTube, and Netflix in some regions.==

==**2.**== ==**[Prodigy Math](https://www.prodigygame.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-most-kids-hate-math-and-how-to-fix-it)**== ==- A math RPG that has kids begging for "just one more problem."==

==This game-based platform covers K-8 math aligned with curriculum standards. Kids battle monsters by solving math problems, with difficulty adapting to their level. The free version gives access to core features, while premium ($8.95/month) adds reports and extra content.==

==**3.**== ==**[Synthesis Tutor](https://www.synthesis.com/tutor?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-most-kids-hate-math-and-how-to-fix-it)**== ==– A visual, concept-first digital tutor built with Dr. James Tanton.==

==Unlike rote practice apps, Synthesis walks kids through== _==why==_ ==math works using interactive puzzles and stunning visuals. Parents say it’s pricey, but worth it for deep understanding (ideal for upper-elementary through early middle school).==
