==**IN THIS EDITION**==

==🍎 A math-hating teen sprints to grade level in 90 days  
🍎 A former teacher warns: “These kids cannot read”  
🍎 Art history beats engineering in a surprise job market shift==

### ==💡 1 THOUGHT==

==My 30+ years in education have shown me that the most powerful learning happens at the intersection of three things:==

==–== ==**Choice**====: Some control over how, what, and when learners learn  
–== ==**Competency**====: Adequate time and support to master key skills  
–== ==**Connection**====: Learning tied to topics students care about and that relate to the real world==

==A story: Isaac’s son refused to do math for years. He considered it boring and irrelevant. Then at 13, he wanted to attend a part-time school program with his friends. The only catch? He had to be at grade level in math.==

==He said:== _==“I’ll catch up this summer.”==_

==What happened next surprised everyone.==

==Starting at the kindergarten level on Khan Academy, and spending just 1–2 hours a day, this teenager who “hated math” reached grade level in== ==**less than three months**====.==

==He wasn’t a prodigy. He just had:==

- ==His own motivation (not external pressure)==
- ==The right tools==
- ==Freedom to progress at his own pace==
- ==No artificial timelines==

==When kids have real motivation and the right environment, they learn faster than we expect. This is why I believe in learning sprints rather than endless marathons. Our new book== _==[Open Education](https://geni.us/opened?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-art-history-grads-are-beating-engineers)==_ ==shows how to create the conditions for this kind of breakthrough learning.==

_==– Matt Bowman==_
