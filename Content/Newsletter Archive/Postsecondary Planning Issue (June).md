==Dear Readers,==

==The school summer holidays are nearly upon us, and the post-school future may be the furthest thing from many kids’ minds. Yet, ASA is continually interested in learning about the postsecondary plans teens are making, who is influencing those decisions, and how teens are thinking about their futures. We know that how young people plan, when they start planning, and who informs them along the way are factors that can have a profound impact on their eventual career choices and chances of postsecondary success. These factors are all of increasing importance at a time when,== _==Getting Smart==_ ==reminds us, some 65% of jobs will change significantly every 5-7 years and the value of credentials is evolving rapidly.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2025/04/09/the-transcript-trap-why-our-students-need-credentials-not-just-grades/)**====**.)**==

==To that end, we recently published the results of a new nationwide survey in which we asked more than 3,000 7th-12th-graders about their postsecondary ambitions. Among the most interesting highlights? Teens’ interest in college is down, while nondegree pathways are becoming more popular. Parents are among teens’ biggest influencers, but they remain skeptical of nondegree options. And, we uncovered some interesting findings about how location and other factors may influence postsecondary choices.== ==**(**====**[Read about the research](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/survey-american-student-assistance-reveals-130000120.html?guccounter=1)**====**.)**== ==In addition, for young people who want or need to join the workforce straight out of high school, I invite you to learn about the Launchpad Jobs that offer the most promising career paths for workers without degrees.== ==**(**====**[Join us for our upcoming webinar on this topic](https://asa.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_wYpSVljtTq2DW7fq7yif9A#/registration)**====**.)**==

==It’s really little surprise to me that more kids are considering nondegree pathways; we have seen so much nationwide momentum around the proliferation of high-quality pathways and a much deeper focus on transferrable skills. In Massachusetts, for example, Innovation Career Pathways have been expanded to 20 new schools, meaning even more students will be able to explore careers, participate in work-based learning, and take technical and advanced courses.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://www.mass.gov/news/healey-driscoll-administration-expands-innovation-career-pathways-to-20-new-high-schools)**====**.)**== ==A law has been signed in South Carolina encouraging more students to participate in work-based learning.== ==**(**====**[Read the story.](https://www.wspa.com/news/state-news/gov-mcmaster-signs-bill-to-let-students-participate-in-work-based-learning/)**====**)**== ==The state of Wisconsin saw a 14% increase in youth apprenticeships in 2024-2025.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://dailyreporter.com/2025/05/16/milwaukee-youth-apprenticeship-skilled-trades/)**====**.)**== ==And, some 32 states now require high schools to offer at least one computer science course, speaking to the urgent need for all young people to possess a strong tech skillset before they leave school.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://www.k12dive.com/news/significant-momentum-computer-science-curriculum-ai/748103/)**====**.)**==

==Each month, I invite you to watch the latest episode of “Youth Career Readiness: The One-Question Podcast” — my collaboration with author Michael Horn. This month, we interviewed legendary guitarist Stevie Van Zandt, best known for playing guitar in Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band. He explains how developing a craft can change the course of a young person’s life.== ==**(**====**[Watch the episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCf45kHskGA)**====**.)**== ==You can also explore our past interviews, with well-known guests like Lou Holtz, Yo-Yo Ma, Common, John Pankow, Tanya Wright, and others.== ==**(**====**[Explore the One Question library](https://www.asa.org/the-one-question-podcast/)**====**. Scroll down to the “Episodes” section of the page.)**==

==I wish you a relaxing summer holiday period. With our minds fresh and rested, we can continue in our mission of helping more kids realize a bright and successful future!==

==Sincerely,==

==Jean==
