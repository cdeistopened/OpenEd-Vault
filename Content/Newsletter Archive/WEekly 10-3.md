# ==**DEEP DIVE:**== ==The Changing Faces of Virtual School==

==March 2020: Teachers broadcast from their kitchens. Kids stared into the void of Gallery View. Parents became unpaid IT support, printing worksheets and resetting passwords. Virtual school wasn't working.==

==Fast forward to 2025: A seventh grader in rural Idaho takes AP Calculus online and scores a 5. A dancer in California attends virtual prep school while touring with her company. A kid in Montana learns marine biology from an actual marine biologist in Florida.==

==Both can be called "virtual school." But they're worlds apart.==

==Michael Vilardo watched the pandemic from a unique vantage point. He'd just spent $70,000 on a UCLA MBA via Zoom—"the worst learning experience of my life." By day, brutal online classes. By night? Netflix.== _==The Last Dance.==_ _==Tiger King.==_ ==He'd binge these shows, loving every episode.==

=="That was the institutional equivalent of pointing a camera at a stage play and calling it a movie," Vilardo says. "The problem wasn't the technology. It was the failure of imagination."==

==So Vilardo built== ==[Subject](https://www.subject.com/?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--e81souTmR98KhCpkAt_X24SL9hQBVXyWu8yxEakeZFH9ZBuGsh238oBSl_8eEe0KH5EMo)====—premium courses delivered through five-minute videos by teachers who speak to the camera like trusted influencers. Student athletes and dancers can complete rigorous academics in focused blocks, freeing time for what defines them.==

==Meanwhile, Amir Nathoo's== ==[Outschool](https://outschool.com/?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--e81souTmR98KhCpkAt_X24SL9hQBVXyWu8yxEakeZFH9ZBuGsh238oBSl_8eEe0KH5EMo)== ==offers 140,000+ classes. "Every teacher can spin up their own little one-room schoolhouse," he explains. Kids pop from one to another, assembling education like we assemble the rest of our lives.==

==We all know that screens come with issues. But before you throw the virtual baby out with the bathwater, consider how you might leverage online resources in a targeted, strategic way—ultimately with the goal of having more time for real-world exploration.==

# ==**PODCAST HIGHLIGHT:**== ==Why Middle School Matters==

==Did you know that—after the explosion of brain development in early childhood—there's a== _==second==_ ==major window of neuroplasticity during ages 11-14—when the brain reorganizes almost as dramatically as in toddlerhood?==

==[Jean Eddy of American Student Assistance](https://www.asa.org/?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--e81souTmR98KhCpkAt_X24SL9hQBVXyWu8yxEakeZFH9ZBuGsh238oBSl_8eEe0KH5EMo)== ==claims that "[m]iddle school kids have brains that are as thirsty, as willing to take in information as toddlers."==

==(And she has data to prove it).==

==But by 15, peer pressure intensifies. The willingness to try new things dampens. Most schools introduce career exploration in high school. By then, it's too late.==

=="We work a very long time in this life," Eddy says. "You better figure out what it is you love to do."==

# ==**THOUGHTS OF THE WEEK**==

==**Create Before You Consume**== ==[Isaac's kid wanted to watch YouTube all day.](https://x.com/OpenEdHQ/status/1973097417772851586?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--e81souTmR98KhCpkAt_X24SL9hQBVXyWu8yxEakeZFH9ZBuGsh238oBSl_8eEe0KH5EMo)== ==So he made a rule: create an episode before you watch one. "It doesn't have to be good. You don't even have to like it. Just create something, then go study what others built."==

==**Relationships Trump Delivery Method**== ==[Ray Ravaglia's 30-year discovery: purely self-paced online courses have 30% dropout rates](https://opened.co/blog/ray-ravaglia-online-school?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--e81souTmR98KhCpkAt_X24SL9hQBVXyWu8yxEakeZFH9ZBuGsh238oBSl_8eEe0KH5EMo)====, even for gifted kids. Add live sessions where students see each other? Attrition drops to 2-3%. "When you've learned something new, you need that interaction."==

==**The Definition Problem**== ==[Researcher Brian Ray of the National Home Education Research Institute says we need a uniform definition of homeschooling: parent-controlled, home-based, and privately funded](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5211580&utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--e81souTmR98KhCpkAt_X24SL9hQBVXyWu8yxEakeZFH9ZBuGsh238oBSl_8eEe0KH5EMo)====. But what about roadschoolers in RVs? Families sharing studio space? As definitions get stricter, reality gets messier.==
