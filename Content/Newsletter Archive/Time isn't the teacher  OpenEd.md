## ==💡 THOUGHT==

### ==**Showing up ≠ learning**==

==Have you ever noticed how much of traditional education is built around simply being present? Show up at this time, sit in this chair, stay for this many hours.==

==But showing up ≠ learning. A child who is deeply absorbed in solving a real problem for 30 minutes can learn more than one passively sitting through a 2-hour lecture.==

==When we focus on creating the conditions for deep engagement – whether through hands-on projects, real-world problem solving, or following genuine curiosity – the clock becomes less relevant.==

## ==📊 TREND==

### ==**“A Nation at Risk”**==

==When== [==_A Nation at Risk_==](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED226006&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=093-time-isn-t-the-teacher) ==arrived in 1983 from President Reagan’s National Commission on Excellence in Education, it delivered a stark warning of a “rising tide of mediocrity” in American education. The report painted a dire picture of declining academic standards and global competitiveness, diagnosing the problem as simple arithmetic: our students weren’t spending enough time at their desks. Never mind that American pupils already log 1,022 hours annually in class – more daily time than most developed nations, if spread across fewer calendar days. The solution, we were assured, was straightforward: More time translates into more learning.==

==But reality has a way of complicating our tidy assumptions.==

==Consider== [==the Summit School in Colorado==](https://www.educationnext.org/time-for-school-assessing-inequality-access-instructional-time-united-states/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=093-time-isn-t-the-teacher)==, where students achieve two years of mathematical growth in a single year – while spending== ==_less_== ==time in traditional instruction. Their secret isn’t quantity but quality: small groups, personalized pathways, focused attention on what works.==

==The pattern is spreading. Nine hundred school districts have now moved beyond the five-day calendar (up from 650 in 2020). Half of Colorado’s districts have embraced scheduling flexibility. Microschools and learning pods continue to multiply, each proving that innovation doesn’t require more hours.==

### ==Learning Sprints: A Better Way to Structure Your Child’s Learning Time==

==Forget rigid hourly schedules. Many OpenEd families are finding success with “learning sprints” – focused 1-2 week periods where children dive deep into topics they care about. Here’s how to run one:==

==**Step 1: Sprint Planning (10-minute family meetup)**==

- ==Help your child choose a topic they’re excited about==
- ==Define 3-5 key learning goals, and the resources required==
- ==Pick a creative way to present findings (video, presentation, game design, etc.)==

==**Step 2: Mid-Sprint Check (10 minutes)**==

- ==Quick progress review; adjust course if needed==
- ==Celebrate small wins==

==**Step 3: Sprint Showcase (20 minutes)**==

- ==Child presents what they learned==
- ==Family celebrates both successes and “noble failures”==
- ==**Simple self-assessment:**== ==What was mastered? What needs more time?==
- ==Save a sample for their portfolio==

==Keep the meetups short and fun (add snacks!), and consider inviting extended family to virtual showcases. The beauty of sprints is that they create natural momentum and clear finish lines.==

## ==(FACT) OF THE DAY==

==Finnish students, who consistently rank among the world’s highest performers, spend 5,500 fewer hours in class between ages 7-14 than American students – nearly two full years less instructional time.==

==That’s all for today!==
