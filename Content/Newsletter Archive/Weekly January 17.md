==Happy Wednesday!==

==Sometimes the most obvious solutions are wrong. Today we're looking at how cognitive science is upending traditional study methods, why microschools are taking off in Florida, and what brain research tells us about how we actually learn.==

==In this edition:==

- ==📊 Half a million Florida students choose alternative education==
- ==🛠️ The science of studying (that actually works)==
- ==📖== ==**Word of the day:**== ==How your brain builds memories==

### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**The Box Called Learning**==

==[Katie Martin at Learner-Centered Collaborative writes](https://learnercentered.org/blog/learning-is-a-process-not-an-event/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=is-your-child-using-outdated-study-habits-113)== ==about a fundamental mistake in education: treating learning as an event rather than a process.==

==❝==

=="Transformational learning is a process, not a singular event."==

==– Katie Martin==

==Think about your own childhood memories. The deepest learning probably didn't happen between 9 AM and 3 PM. It happened when you:==

- ==Fixed your bike after it broke (engineering)==
- ==Counted change at the store (math)==
- ==Argued with friends about rules (debate)==
- ==Got lost and found your way home (navigation)==

==Education isn't a 9-3 event. It's a 24/7 process happening whether you plan it or not.==

==When you force kids to "start learning" at 9 AM, you're accidentally teaching them that learning is unnatural, needs an authority figure, and follows a schedule.==

==The most successful people never learned this lesson. They never stopped being curious.==

### ==📊 TREND==

## ==**The Rise of Micro**==

==In Liberty City, Miami, seventh-grader Albrielle Jones is making lip gloss.==

==Not for fun – for market. She's developing products to sell at local farmer's markets while her classmates work on their own ventures. One's planning a food truck. Another is learning to code.==

==[This is happening at Primer, one of Florida's fastest-growing microschool networks](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/education/article296185394.html?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=is-your-child-using-outdated-study-habits-113)====. Their model is simple:==

- ==Classes capped at 15 students==
- ==Teachers paid 40% above market==
- ==Afternoons reserved for passion projects==
- ==Full scholarships available==

==It's working. Their Liberty City campus opened in November with 120 students. By December, the waitlist hit 80.==

==This is part of a larger shift.== ==[Florida just announced that over 524,000 students](https://alachuachronicle.com/governor-ron-desantis-announces-school-choice-success/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=is-your-child-using-outdated-study-habits-113)== ==– nearly 1 in 6 of the state's 2.9 million K-12 students – now use education scholarships to customize their learning. Another 30,000 access supplemental learning funds for tutoring and curriculum.==

==[Read more in the Miami Herald](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/education/article296185394.html?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=is-your-child-using-outdated-study-habits-113)====.==

### ==🛠️ TOOL==

## ==**The Learning Scientists**==

==A team of cognitive scientists is making research on learning accessible to parents and students. Their work matters because most popular study methods (highlighting, re-reading notes) don't actually work.==

==[The Learning Scientists](https://www.learningscientists.org/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=is-your-child-using-outdated-study-habits-113)== ==focuses on two questions:==

- ==How does the brain actually learn?==
- ==What strategies match this biology?==

==Here are two key findings worth implementing:==

[![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/adb788ef-7545-4bbd-b300-6424f94b3fdc/Screenshot_2025-01-15_at_8.42.49_AM.png?t=1736959374)](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/adb788ef-7545-4bbd-b300-6424f94b3fdc/Screenshot_2025-01-15_at_8.42.49_AM.png?t=1736959374)

==**Retrieval Practice**====: Having your child explain concepts without notes strengthens neural pathways more than passive review. Even wrong answers help – the effort to recall is what matters.==

==**Spaced Practice**====: The brain consolidates information between study sessions. Three 30-minute sessions across a week create stronger memories than a single 90-minute cram.==

==Their website offers:==

- ==Visual guides for each strategy==
- ==Implementation tips for parents==
- ==Free downloads==

==No products, courses, or upsells – just researchers translating science into practical tools.==

### ==**(WORD) OF THE DAY**==

## ==**consolidation (kon·sol·i·day·shuhn)**==

==From Latin== _==consolidare==_==: "to make firm." The process by which your brain converts short-term memories into long-term knowledge. Like concrete hardening, memories need time to set. This is why cramming the night before a test rarely works – your brain hasn't had time to consolidate the information.==

==This also explains why "sleeping on it" often helps solve problems. Your brain is strengthening connections while you rest.==

==That’s all for today!==

==**Reminder:**== ==Parents who let their kids take reasonable risks aren't being careless. They're preparing them for life.==

### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**Why Critics Get Defensive About Your Educational Choices**==

==Ever notice how the loudest critics of your educational choices are often the most insecure about their own?==

==Their judgment usually isn't about you—it's about their own doubts.==

==When someone reacts strongly to your educational choices, they're usually not judging you—they're defending themselves against imagined judgment. They hear "we homeschool" and translate it to "you're doing it wrong."==

==The solution? Turn the conversation toward their choices instead. Ask what they love about their children's education. Show genuine interest.==

==Remember: Confident parents don't feel threatened by different choices.==

### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**When Your Address Matters More Than Your Aspirations**==

=="I remember my mother and grandmother having this conversation about whose address we might use so I could attend Mount Royal,"== ==[50CAN](https://50can.org/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=when-parents-go-to-jail-for-wanting-better-schools-111)== ==President Derrell Bradford recalls with a knowing smile. "Looking back now, I realize - that was highly illegal. But it was also deeply subversive in an important way."==

==Bradford, now a leading voice in education reform, breaks down how families typically access school choice:==

=="There are really just four ways: You're lucky. You're connected. You're rich enough to buy in the right neighborhood or pay tuition. Or you lie - which is how most families actually do it."==

==His conclusion is stark:== ==**"A system that prioritizes a child's address over their aspirations is not one I aspire to."**==

## ==**Zoning Out: Schools Drop the ZIP Code Game**==

==In 2011,== ==[Ohio mom Kelley Williams-Bolar spent 10 days in jail](https://availabletoall.org/report-when-good-parents-go-to-jail/?et_fb=1&PageSpeed=off&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=when-parents-go-to-jail-for-wanting-better-schools-111)====. Her crime? Using her father's address to enroll her daughters in a better school district.==

==In nearly half of U.S. states, parents can face criminal prosecution – including jail time – for using a different address to access better schools. Some districts even hire private investigators to track down families they believe "don't belong."==

==But the tide is turning. States are finally recognizing that a child's potential shouldn't be limited by their postal code. Here's what's happening:==

- ==[Colorado: More than 199,000 students (28% of public school enrollment) now attend schools outside their assigned zones](https://www.the74million.org/article/last-year-200k-colorado-kids-used-open-enrollment-to-pick-their-district-school/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=when-parents-go-to-jail-for-wanting-better-schools-111)==
- ==Florida: 273,000 students use open enrollment to choose their schools==
- ==Arizona: All districts must accept transfer students tuition-free, with buses allowed to cross district lines==

==Instead of criminalizing parents for seeking better opportunities, we should be breaking down the barriers that force them to make such desperate choices in the first place.==
