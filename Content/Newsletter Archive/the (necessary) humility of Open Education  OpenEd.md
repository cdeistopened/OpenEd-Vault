## ==💡 THOUGHTs==

### ==The Humility of Open Education==

==It takes courage to step away from traditional schooling. But true open education requires humility in both directions.==

==I’ve spent years advocating for alternatives to the standard system. Yet when my son expressed interest in attending public school, I had to check my ego. It would have been easy to say, “But I’m the alternative education guy!”==

==Instead, I listened to his reasons and supported his choice. Open education isn’t about rigidly adhering to any single approach – even an alternative one. It’s about remaining flexible and attuned to each child’s evolving needs.==

==Sometimes that means trying homeschooling or unschooling. Other times, it might mean embracing a more traditional path for a season. It’s not about us or any individual educational philosophy. It’s about empowering our children to find what works best for them, even if that challenges our preconceptions.==

### ==High Schools Embrace Flexibility and Real-World Experience==

==With climbing, chronic absenteeism, disengaged students, and declining college enrollment, high schools are starting to adapt.==

[==Education Week==](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/how-should-high-school-change-these-districts-may-have-the-answer/2024/09?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=049-the-necessary-humility-of-open-education) ==highlights a recent Colorado Department of Education report that found a glaring mismatch between workforce needs and high school graduates’ readiness. In response, some schools are reimagining the high school experience:==

- ==Chesterton High in Indiana is letting seniors intern in fields they’re actually interested in.==
- ==School Districts are playing matchmaker between students and local businesses, and launching career-oriented “pathway programs” that don’t sacrifice college readiness.==

==We think we’d get along well with Chip Pettit, superintendent of Duneland School Corporation in Indiana, who said: “Philosophically, what we’re trying to do is individualize or personalize the process for students.” (Chip, if you’re reading this, call us!)==
