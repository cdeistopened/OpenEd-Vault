When instructed to draft a weekly, you will Create a weekly roundup email comprising short witty summaries of the M-Th emails, in the format of the "examples of format of weekly" document.

If there are ways to arrange materials logically or to connect one day's Thoughts, Trends, or Tools to the others, go for it.

First step is to identify the 4 previous day's Thoughts, Tools and Trends, and organize them in a clear outline. Thus there should be 3 bullet lists with 4 items:

Thoughts:

- day 1  
    day 2  
    day 3  
    day 4

Trends:  
day 1  
day 2  
day 3  
day 4

Tool:  
day 1  
day 2  
day 3  
day 4

We also will look for a single concept tha tmight make for a more interesting "deep dive"

USe these as the prime example for voice / style / formatting of the WEEKLY

### ==💡 DEEP DIVE==

## ==HOME IMPROVEMENT==

==In this week's== ==[Q&A episode](https://youtu.be/rcozKxOF0VU?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stop-stressing-start-designing-a-mom-of-7-explains)====, Coach Meg Thomas shared an analogy that sheds much-needed light on the problem of stress and burnout:==

==**"If you've ever been to a spa... it's very calming and the lights are low, and even the color of the paint on the wall is soothing. There’s music and they usually have a diffuser or something in the air that just smells good… you just come to relax."**==

==Then she flipped it:==

==**"My kids love to go to an arcade, where there’s loud music, bright flashing lights, and it's high energy."**==

==Both environments are intentionally designed. Applied to the home, one creates calm. The other creates chaos.==

==Which one does your home resemble during learning hours?==

==While we're busy searching for the perfect curriculum or the ideal schedule, Meg has been focusing on something more fundamental:==

==**"You don't have a lot of control over things that your children do and say, but one of the things that you do have control over that makes a humongous impact is the home."**==

==Meg is talking about invisible design choices that shape behavior without a single word being spoken. And these choices don’t have to amount to a Pinterest-perfect space.==

==It’s the little choices that make the biggest differences.==

==For example, if her kids are grumpy, she’ll put on an upbeat playlist, like a musical, and== ==**“all of a sudden the mood of the house has become fun."**==

==No lectures about attitude or empty threats. Just Hamilton on the speakers and suddenly everyone's in a different headspace.==

==For focus time, she employs classical music via Spotify.==

### ==**Less Stuff = More Learning.**==

==Meg also gave attendees permission to get rid of clutter.==

==[Claire Honeycutt shared a similar insight on her Substack this week](https://substack.com/home/post/p-161898400?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stop-stressing-start-designing-a-mom-of-7-explains)====, about the connection between too much stuff and stress. Kids experience it unconsciously as anxiety, while parents feel it as burnout. We think our kids will feel deprived without so much stuff, but in reality calm kids are focused kids. And focused kids are kids who can actually absorb what you're teaching them.==

==Instead of being the enforcer, Meg teaches parents to create what she calls the "Happy Habits Triangle":==

1. ==**Example**== ==- You model it first==
2. ==**Teach**== ==- Show them how (like teaching shoe-tying)==
3. ==**Praise**== ==- Look for the good and tell them==

=="All of a sudden they are realizing, ‘Oh, Mom's not getting mad at me,’” says Meg, “It's super simple to learn this basic skill."==

### ==**What This Means for Your Weekend**==

==Whether you homeschool or not, try to look at your home spaces more like a designer than a disciplinarian or teacher.==

- ==What music could shift the energy without you saying a word?==
- ==What clutter is creating visual stress for everyone?==
- ==What systems could run themselves if you stepped back?==

==As Meg discovered: "When you work on changing the environment, the child's behavior naturally changes itself."==

==You can start this weekend (not that you needed permission). One playlist. One decluttered surface. One system that runs without you.==

## ==📊 THIS WEEK'S TOP TRENDS==

==**[Math Teaching Gets Flipped](https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/64539/how-to-get-kids-thinking-instead-of-mimicking-in-math-class?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stop-stressing-start-designing-a-mom-of-7-explains)**== _==(KQED)==_ ==- The "thinking classrooms" model has kids working in groups of three at whiteboards, with new partners every day chosen by playing cards. Sixth graders who used to watch the clock now say "that was two periods already?" The key: when kids can't predict their group or role, they stop playing passive and start actually thinking.==

==**[Montessori's Identity Crisis](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2025-06-09-montessori-schools-are-hot-until-they-re-not-what-does-that-mean-about-education?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stop-stressing-start-designing-a-mom-of-7-explains)**== _==(EdSurge)==_ ==- Once a buzzword, now a question mark. A major Montessori-inspired chain is shrinking. Is it the economy? Charter competition? Or that "Montessori" isn't trademarked, meaning quality varies wildly? The magic might be fading—or just getting diluted.==

==**[Screens Are Sabotaging More Than We Thought](https://www.kqed.org/education/532207/screen-time-how-much-is-too-much?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stop-stressing-start-designing-a-mom-of-7-explains)**== _==(KQED)==_ ==- Research shows direct links between screen exposure and emotional dysregulation. As Meg Thomas points out: "It actually makes them have a shorter attention span... it can create anxiety and it lowers social skills."==

==**[AI Could Change Everything in 3 Years](https://ai-2027.com/summary?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stop-stressing-start-designing-a-mom-of-7-explains)**== _==(AI Futures Project)==_ ==- Matt Bowman told Deb Fillman on== ==[The Reason We Learn podcast](https://thereasonwelearn.substack.com/p/stop-pretending-school-works?r=4fh5in&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true)====: "We don't even know what AI will look like two years from now." The AI 2027 thought experiment predicts: by 2027, AI becomes better than humans at AI research itself. What does education look like when your fifth grader's "future career" might not exist by middle school?==

==**[Gen Z Chooses Sobriety](https://www.instagram.com/p/DK2PtEzpMpU/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stop-stressing-start-designing-a-mom-of-7-explains)**== ==- Annual alcohol spending by generation shows Gen Z spending dramatically less than any previous generation. The generation facing an uncertain future is choosing clarity over escape.==

==**[The Real Reason Families Homeschool](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/367271/homeschooling-public-school-accommodations-autism-learning-differences-disabilities?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stop-stressing-start-designing-a-mom-of-7-explains)**== _==(Vox)==_ ==- It's not always about curriculum choice.

🎧 THIS WEEK'S HIGHLIGHT  
HOW MEG THOMAS CREATED A SELF-RUNNING HOMESCHOOL (WITH 7 KIDS)  
"Children don't need to ask how to behave or make decisions because your family becomes a self-managing family thanks to its culture. The culture is present in the details of every decision."

– Meg Thomas, OpenEd parent and homeschooling coach  
When Meg Thomas started homeschooling, she had five children under the age of six. Most parents would be in survival mode. Instead, she built something remarkable – a family culture where her children practically manage themselves.

The morning of our interview, she ran 16 miles. How does a mom of seven maintain her identity, create independent learners, and still have time for herself?

Her secret isn't more curriculum or better scheduling – it's something far more powerful. And it starts with laundry day.

💡 DEEP DIVE  
THE GHIBLIFICATION OF ALL THINGS  
This week, your social media feeds likely featured someone you know transformed into a Miyazaki-inspired character – perhaps a grandparent reimagined as a gentle elder from My Neighbor Totoro, or a toddler rendered with those unmistakable oversized “Studio Ghibli” eyes. The "Ghiblification" phenomenon has spread with the velocity only possible with internet memes.

What makes this moment particularly interesting is the collision of two trends we covered this week: AI educational tools promising to revolutionize learning, and the sudden explosion of AI-generated art. The irony? The very artist whose style has become the internet's favorite AI plaything has been one of its most vocal critics.

This Ghiblification-spree raises questions for young people (and their parents) considering future careers and skills development. Should students still pursue animation when AI can generate characters in seconds? Is it worth learning how to form grammatical sentences when algorithms can write essays? The answer depends on whether we view these skills as merely a means to produce content or as disciplines that develop uniquely human capacities for attention, care, and meaning-making.

In 2017, a team of young animators proudly presented late animation legend Hayao Miyazaki with an AI program they had developed:

The program generated a disturbing zombie-like figure that crawled along the ground using its head instead of limbs. The young technologists were excited about the possibilities.

Miyazaki was not.

"I am utterly disgusted," the 76-year-old master filmmaker said. "I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself."

When pressed by Miyazaki about their goal, one young animator explained, "We would like to build a machine that can draw pictures like humans do."

Miyazaki's response was grim: "I feel like we are nearing the end of times."

Since then, the technology has improved. Now, anyone with internet access can convert themselves into a Ghibli character with a single prompt. The new reality would likely horrify Miyazaki further, and yet here we are, enthusiastically "Ghiblifying" everything from family portraits to historical photographs to pets.

This raises thorny questions about copyright, artistic integrity, and the ethics of AI training data. Did ChatGPT "learn" to create Ghibli-style art by ingesting thousands of copyrighted Studio Ghibli images without permission? Almost certainly. Does this constitute a form of artistic theft, or is it merely the next evolution of influence and homage that has always characterized art history? The courts will eventually decide.

For parents and educators, the Ghiblification trend—and AI more broadly—presents both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, these tools can spark creativity and introduce children to artistic styles they might otherwise ignore.

Instead of Ghiblifying, you might consider Matisse-ifying, Van Goghing, or Rembranditicizing your family photos to introduce your kids to the trademark styles of these master artists.

On the other hand, these tools risk teaching that creation is merely about output rather than process—that creating art, writing, and even thinking are things machines can do for us rather than things we must ultimately learn to do ourselves.

What's easily forgotten in all this is the staggering human effort behind Miyazaki's original works. A typical Studio Ghibli film contains 60-70,000 hand-drawn frames, meticulously painted with watercolors. As Trung Phan recently highlighted, a mere 4-second clip from 'The Wind Rises' took one animator 15 months to complete. When the animator lamented that it was 'so short,' Miyazaki simply replied: 'But it was worth it.'

This level of dedication—putting 15 months into four seconds of beauty—represents something AI fundamentally cannot replicate: the human capacity to care deeply about creation. While algorithms can mimic styles, they cannot experience the satisfaction of pouring oneself into work that matters.

Perhaps the most valuable lesson here for education is that we must nurture the very qualities machines lack: curiosity, dedication, and the willingness to immerse ourselves in difficult work. The most meaningful application of AI might not be to replace human creativity but to inspire it—showing children artistic wonders, then giving them tools to create their own.

In the end, the "Ghiblification of everything" reveals not just our fascination with AI, but our enduring hunger for human touch in an increasingly automated world.

🔍 TRENDS WE’RE WATCHING  
The Astonishing Math of Childhood: By the time your child turns 18, you've already spent 95% of all the time you'll ever spend with them.

The VAM Equation Reshaping Schools: The Value-Added Model is a statistical formula used to evaluate teachers based on student test scores. Developed in the 1970s and later embedded in policies like No Child Left Behind, this mathematical equation attempts to predict how students "should" perform, then judges teachers on whether students exceed these predictions. The problem? It treats children as standardized units, ignoring individual learning styles and circumstances. The result is a system where teaching to the test replaces genuine learning and exploration.

AI Tutors Moving from Theory to Reality: Marc Andreessen predicted back in 2023: "Every child will have an AI tutor that is infinitely patient, infinitely compassionate, infinitely knowledgeable." Some parents are reporting that tools like Synthesis Tutor are already delivering on this promise for young learners. (Check out our "AI Learning Companions" section below for specific tools worth exploring!)

When Learning "Disabilities" Become Superpowers: Shark Tank's Barbara Corcoran says this about her dyslexia: "Everything I've done in my life has been one long attempt to show the world that I'm not stupid." What we often label as learning disabilities might actually be learning differences that create unique advantages, like drive, persistence, and grit.

🔨 TOOLS OF THE WEEK  
The 4-Minute Math Explanation: Patrick J's lo-fi "Completing the Square" video has amassed 4.4 million views since 2008, with comments like "This 4-minute video made MORE sense than my professor's hour-long lecture." What makes this 16-year-old video so timeless? It breaks complex ideas into simple, repeatable steps that actually make sense.

Ghiblify Your Family Photos: ChatGPT's latest upgrade enables it to transform any picture into the magical style of Studio Ghibli animations. Upload a photo and ask it to "create image in the style of Studio Ghibli" to add a touch of whimsy to family memories.

Early College Through SNHU: Meg Thomas's teenage children leveraged OpenEd's partnership with Southern New Hampshire University to earn college credits during high school. "When other kids are graduating from high school, you get to put on your resume that you are a college graduate."

Linguistic Rules We Never Learned: Ever wondered why "little red ball" sounds right but "red little ball" sounds wrong? There's an order to adjectives that we follow instinctively: opinion, size, age, shape, color, origin, material, purpose. What other patterns might be operating in our minds without awareness?

🧠 AI LEARNING COMPANIONS WORTH EXPLORING

If you're interested in trying out AI tutoring with your children, here are some tools to consider:

Khanmigo - Khan Academy's AI tutor adapts to individual learning styles, explains concepts, asks guiding questions, and recognizes when a student is stuck.

Duolingo Max - Helps language learners practice conversations without judgment, explains grammar concepts, and provides instant feedback on pronunciation.

Synthesis - Originally created for Elon Musk's Ad Astra school, uses AI to create simulation-based learning environments where children develop critical thinking through collaborative problem-solving.

Socratic by Google - Provides step-by-step explanations for questions across a range of subjects.

Osmo - Combines physical play with AI technology to create interactive learning experiences for younger children in math, spelling, and creative problem-solving.

Numerade - AI-powered STEM learning platform offering video solutions to textbook problems and personalized study paths.

🤔 PARTING THOUGHT  
LEARNING = SERIAL INCOMPETENCE  
"Learning is serial incompetence on our way to getting better."

Education systems often focus on compliance and memorization. But real learning is trying, failing, adjusting, and trying again until the struggle leads to mastery.

Embracing "serial incompetence" means seeing mistakes as essential stepping stones rather than something to be avoided.

You can read about swimming forever, but you'll never learn to swim until you get wet. The reading is preparation; the failing is learning.

That’s all for this week!
