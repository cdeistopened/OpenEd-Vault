==Education systems often focus on compliance and memorization. But real learning is trying, failing, adjusting, and trying again until the struggle leads to mastery.==

==Embracing "serial incompetence" means seeing mistakes as essential stepping stones rather than something to be avoided.==

==You can read about swimming forever, but you’ll never learn to swim until we get wet. The reading is preparation; the failing is learning.==

### ==**WORD OF THE DAY**==

## ==**Ghiblification (jib-luh-fi-KAY-shun) - noun**==

==The magical transformation of ordinary photos into whimsical Studio Ghibli-inspired art, causing subjects to look like they might start floating, befriend forest spirits, or live in a bathhouse for gods.==

==_**EXAMPLES:**_== ==_"Thanks to ghiblification, my LinkedIn headshot now suggests I might be the secret keeper of an ancient forest rather than someone who knows Excel."_==

==Side effects may include: sudden hair movement despite no wind and eyes growing to 40% of face size.==

==That’s all for today! See you tomorrow.==
