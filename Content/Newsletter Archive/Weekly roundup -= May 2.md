==The college debate isn't yes or no—it's about value. As Ramsey puts it: "Think about what it is you're gonna get for what you pay. Is this in your budget? Am I getting quality for what I'm paying?"==

==The extremes of the debate are both wrong:==

==**Extreme #1:**== =="College is never worth it!"====**Extreme #2:**== =="College is always worth it at any cost!"==

==When the value proposition fails, it often fails spectacularly. Ramsey shares an example:==

=="I talked to a young lady from South Carolina who wanted to go to Ole Miss, which involves out-of-state tuition that triples her cost of college. I said, 'So why is it you want to go to Ole Miss?'“==

==The answer: “'It's a pretty town.'"==

==His verdict? "When you go out of state, you are not paying for an increased value. You're paying for geography, which when it comes to education would be known as stupid."==

==Meanwhile, "a good aircraft mechanic, a good diesel mechanic make 100K, and a whole bunch of you with master's degrees in sociology making 28 grand."==

==Chase Buffington, 18, skipped the lecture hall for a paid HVAC apprenticeship. His reasoning? Cold, hard economics.==

==For Buffington, college remains an option—but for later, if actually needed.==

==McDonald spotlights both sides of the employer/employee equation: Mike Harris—Vanderbilt engineering alum turned HVAC company owner—actively seeks apprentices like Chase.==

=="I wish I'd discovered the trades earlier," he admits.==

==We're witnessing the rise of the apprentice class. Teenagers with toolbelts instead of textbooks. Young entrepreneurs building instead of borrowing. A generation discerning whether that diploma is worth the price tag, free of the old dogmas.==

### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**THE LEGO LESSON**==

=="Education advances through people willing to try new approaches - to see the mountain of possibilities where others see only one prescribed path."==

_==Open Education==_==, Chapter 5==

==In their new book, Matt and Isaac tell the story of Ole Kirk Christiansen, whose observation of how children play with toys led him to create LEGO - a system where simple, interchangeable blocks could build almost anything.==

[![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/a80ff39d-3588-44d1-a1fb-aa41840592d3/image.png?t=1745883704)](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/a80ff39d-3588-44d1-a1fb-aa41840592d3/image.png?t=1745883704)

==This LEGO analogy captures what we call== _==the open education mindset.==_ ==LEGO's success illustrates how creativity flourishes within a framework of simple, flexible rules (much like how we’ve seen families thrive when given the right building blocks for designing their child’s education).==

==As Matt and Isaac write, "The key isn't finding every possible resource - it's identifying the right ones for your child's interests and needs."==

==What learning blocks are you helping your child connect today?==

### ==📊 TREND==

## ==**BREAKING DOWN THE FALSE BINARY**==

==For decades, we've faced a false choice in education:== ==**traditional school or homeschool**====. Open education is about shattering this binary.==

==In== _==Open Education==_==, Matt and Isaac aren't just offering critique of either/or thinking —they're creating== ==**an entirely new category in the education landscape**====. While existing categories like homeschooling, unschooling, and micro-schooling have paved important paths, "open education" represents a distinct mindset that transcends any single approach.==

==This new category is emerging at a crucial moment. Parents increasingly recognize that existing labels don't capture what they're looking for—the freedom to blend approaches, customize learning, and adapt as their children grow and change.==

==The book highlights students and families who embody this category-defining approach:==

- ==Sarah, a 15-year-old "Renaissance Kid" combining high school classes with entrepreneurship==
- ==The Chen siblings, whose parents created a hybrid plan leveraging each child's unique strengths==
- ==Kai, who thrived when allowed to split time between school, his projects, and tutoring younger students==

==The question is no longer "which box do you fit in?" but "how do you build something that truly works for our child?"==

### ==🛠️ TOOL==

## ==**MAP YOUR LEARNING LANDSCAPE**==

==One of the most powerful tools in the book is a three-step process for mapping your child's learning landscape:==

==**Step 1: Analyze Interests**== ==Create a "Discovery Zone" on your wall where family members can post sticky notes answering questions like "What do you enjoy learning about?" and "What would you like to improve?"==

==**Step 2: Connect to Real Needs**== ==Ask: How can these interests solve real problems? This might mean household responsibilities, community challenges, or broader issues your child cares about.==

==**Step 3: Survey Available Resources**== ==Take inventory of what's available: free library programs, community classes, online courses, family expertise, and more.==

==**Want to dive deeper?**== ==[Come to our launch event](https://opened.co/book/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=open-education-the-book-launch-countdown-begins)== ==and get exclusive bonus resources including customizable templates, worksheets, and a planning guide to help you implement these tools immediately. Whether you're planning for next school year or ready to start your open education journey right away, these resources will give you a clear starting point.==

### ==📚 WORD OF THE DAY==

## ==**Antifragile**==

_==adjective==_==: Gaining strength from stressors rather than being harmed by them.==

==When trees grow without wind, they develop weak trunks and eventually collapse under their own weight. They need that stress to develop what botanists call "reaction wood."==

==Children are similar. Without appropriate challenges, they don't develop the resilience and problem-solving abilities needed to thrive.==

## ==**THE BOOK THAT CALMS PARENTS' BIGGEST FEAR**==

_==By Isaac Morehouse, CEO of OpenEd==_

==Every day I talk to parents who love the idea of opening up their kids' education, but are so worried about them being "on track" and measuring up against whatever (sometimes arbitrary) standard is deemed "normal." That's the biggest fear.==

==Whenever I start mentioning research and anecdotes from the book== _==[Free to Learn](https://www.amazon.com/Free-Learn-Unleashing-Instinct-Self-Reliant/dp/0465025994?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=screens-have-taken-over-classrooms)==_ ==[by Dr. Peter Gray](https://www.amazon.com/Free-Learn-Unleashing-Instinct-Self-Reliant/dp/0465025994?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=screens-have-taken-over-classrooms)====, it blows their minds.==

==If you've never read this book, it's a mainstay for helping ease parents' fears about whether kids can learn without so much structure. It's on the more radical "Sudbury Valley" or "Unschool" end of the spectrum, but it's pretty great in just helping shift mindset.==

==If kids who literally had== _==no formal instruction whatsoever==_ ==can learn reading and math, then surely your kid who is doing a twice-a-week co-op can!==

==You don't need to unschool to gain some needed perspective on the fact that your kids might do well with a little less structure and a little more breathing room.==

### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**NOT ALL SCREEN TIME IS CREATED EQUAL**==

==“We blame our kids for our issues. That’s what’s happening.”==

==That’s what Outschool CEO Amir Nathoo said in a recent== ==[conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASuPwY3PSR0&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=bigfoot-wizard-cooking-and-a-minecraft-modding-class)== ==with OpenEd’s Isaac Morehouse about our conflicted attitudes towards screen time.==

==Yesterday, we shared a== _==Wall Street Journal==_ ==article showing students now spend over 2 hours per day on school-issued devices (with the predictable fatigue among the students).==

==But Nathoo offers a more nuanced view:==

### ==📊 TREND==

## ==**THE ERA OF NETWORKED SCHOOLING**==

==Education is being unbundled — and reassembled in smarter, more personalized ways.==

==“Alternative education has blossomed into far more than homeschooling,” says Nathoo. “You’ve got part-time enrollment, dual enrollment, microschools… It’s harder now to define what someone is even doing.”==

==He calls it== ==**networked schooling**== ==— families connecting learning experiences across multiple people, platforms, and places, instead of relying on a single institution.==

==We call it open education. Isaac put it this way:==

==“The box is closed if you’re all in one school all day, every day. Anyone who’s doing two or more education approaches at the same time has basically opened the box…”==

==If you’re layering online classes onto public school, joining a co-op while using curriculum at home, or taking a hybrid approach — you’re already part of this new learning network. One that often works better than any single system ever could.==

## ==**THE WEIRD AND WONDERFUL WORLD OF OUTSCHOOL**==

==When Isaac’s son wanted to learn Minecraft modding, neither parent knew how to help.==

==“I don’t know how to code,” Isaac recalls. “But I found a class on Outschool — six weeks, once a week.”==

==His son took the class, and by the end, he was showing== _==Isaac==_ ==how he built custom blocks.==

==This is what happens when curiosity meets access.==

==Outschool isn’t just a supplement to traditional curriculum — it’s a gateway to topics schools don’t touch.== ==**[Bigfoot investigations](https://outschool.com/classes/cryptozoology-do-mythical-animals-exist-pl3UByIs?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=bigfoot-wizard-cooking-and-a-minecraft-modding-class)**====******.**== ==**[Wizard cooking](https://outschool.com/classes/cryptozoology-do-mythical-animals-exist-pl3UByIs?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=bigfoot-wizard-cooking-and-a-minecraft-modding-class)**====******.**== ==**[Math-based escape rooms](https://outschool.com/classes/escape-from-math-mystery-mountain-an-escape-room-for-math-adventurers-xLAfVJgO?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=bigfoot-wizard-cooking-and-a-minecraft-modding-class)**====******.**== ==And the instructors?
