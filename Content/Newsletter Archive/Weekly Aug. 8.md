If you’re homeschooling a struggling reader, [this week’s deep dive](https://opened.co/blog/the-homeschool-parents-guide-to-dyslexia-when-to-diy-vs-when-to-call-the-experts?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PeredrU355DOzhyfyDK3v_rJvzh1oZ0x8DE8HVzlvmJSizvRgYZVTJyYRC-4pYJTcUDJE) could save you a lot of trial and error – covering practical dyslexia strategies you can use now, plus the moment when expert help makes all the difference.

And because no OpenEd Weekly is complete without variety, we’ve got: a two-hour school day with jaw-dropping results, a viral multiplication hack, and the rise of yet another college dropout billionaire.

==**Reading is too important to force a false choice.**== ==Traditional schools bring trained specialists, proven programs, and formal support systems; homeschooling offers time, personalization, and daily attention tailored to your child. You can have both—and you should.==

==[Our new guide](https://opened.co/blog/the-homeschool-parents-guide-to-dyslexia-when-to-diy-vs-when-to-call-the-experts?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PeredrU355DOzhyfyDK3v_rJvzh1oZ0x8DE8HVzlvmJSizvRgYZVTJyYRC-4pYJTcUDJE)== ==shows how to combine the best of home-based, structured literacy with professional screenings, coaching, and specialist support—through programs like OpenEd—so you can spot real red flags early, start the right interventions with confidence, and bring in experts at the exact moment they can make the biggest difference.==

### ==**Two Hours, 99th Percentile**==

==[Alpha School](https://alpha.school/?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PeredrU355DOzhyfyDK3v_rJvzh1oZ0x8DE8HVzlvmJSizvRgYZVTJyYRC-4pYJTcUDJE)== ==students spend just 2 hours daily on academics yet achieve exceptional test scores. Third-graders hit 7th-grade math levels.== ==[Austin Scholar shares the surprising science and methodology behind these amazing results](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-173-the-science-behind?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PeredrU355DOzhyfyDK3v_rJvzh1oZ0x8DE8HVzlvmJSizvRgYZVTJyYRC-4pYJTcUDJE)====.==

### ==**Community Makes a Comeback**==

==Matt Bowman points out that families are rediscovering neighborhoods as antidote to virtual overload. Co-ops expanding, learning pods multiplying, Gen Z gravitating toward "IRL" experiences. When the digital world feels artificial, parents bet on what they can touch and verify. (==_==Source:== ==[Elite Expert Industry podcast](https://eliteonlinepublishing.com/the-future-of-learning-with-matt-bowman/?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PeredrU355DOzhyfyDK3v_rJvzh1oZ0x8DE8HVzlvmJSizvRgYZVTJyYRC-4pYJTcUDJE)==_==)==

### ==**Billionaire Dropout Strikes Again**==

==Dylan Field becomes 4th billionaire to emerge from the Thiel Fellowship with Figma's $71B valuation. Started with $100K to drop out of Brown, now worth billions. Another data point that markets care more about what you build than where you studied. (==_==Source:== ==[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/03/figma-ceo-dylan-fields-path-from-college-dropout-to-billionaire.html?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PeredrU355DOzhyfyDK3v_rJvzh1oZ0x8DE8HVzlvmJSizvRgYZVTJyYRC-4pYJTcUDJE)==_==)==
