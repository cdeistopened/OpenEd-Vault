### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**Your brain can't multitask (but here's what it can do)**==

==Remember being told your brain can juggle multiple things at once? Turns out that's a myth.==

[==Cognitive scientist Megan Sumeracki explains==](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/multitasking/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=108-what-happened-in-2012) ==we== ==_can_== ==multitask! But only when one activity is on autopilot (like walking while listening to a podcast). It’s when we attempt to engage in two activities requiring focused attention that we miss crucial parts of both (like trying to watch two movies simultaneously).==

==This matters because traditional classrooms often force kids to multitask without realizing it: Taking notes while listening to lectures. Reading slides while processing explanations. Even having a phone nearby (not using it, just nearby) creates a cognitive tax.==

### ==📊 TREND==

## ==**What happened in 2012? (The “Great Rewiring”)**==

==Something changed dramatically for young people in the early 2010s. The data is striking:==

- ==Depression and anxiety rose >50%==
- ==Academic achievement reversed decades of steady gains==
- ==Social connection and dating plummeted==

==So… what happened? Sometime around 2012,== [==social psychologist Jonathan Haidt notes==](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/teen-childhood-smartphone-use-mental-health-effects/677722/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=108-what-happened-in-2012)==, smartphones went from luxury to necessity. Social lives moved online; constant connection became the norm.==

==We're not just seeing "kids these days" struggling – we're witnessing the first generation to grow up with== ==_**perpetual digital connection**_====, and their development looks fundamentally different.==

==This isn't about demonizing technology (it’s here to stay). It's about recognizing that how we structure learning environments matters more than ever.==

### ==🛠️ TOOL==

## ==**Using rewards strategically**==

==**A common trap in education:**== ==Creating reward systems that frame learning as "the bad thing I need to get paid to do."==

==Instead, try a framework from education innovator Niels Hoven:==

==Use== ==_**temporary**_== ==rewards strategically when at least one of the following criteria applies:==

1. ==The activity becomes more fun with practice==
2. ==The skill becomes easier with time==
3. ==You're building initial momentum==

==**Real example**====: Temporary rewards for ski lessons until the natural thrill of skiing takes over.==

==Think of it as a jumpstart, not a bribe. The goal is to help them discover what naturally motivates them.==

==The best reward is discovering you don't need the reward anymore.==

### ==🤓== ==**(TRIVIA) OF THE DAY**==

## ==**Q: In what year did the first iPhone come out?**==

==(Hint: It was before things went sideways in 2012...)==

==Answer: ㄥ00ᄅ 'ㄣ ʎlnſ==

==Fun fact: When Steve Jobs unveiled it, he actually presented it as three revolutionary products: "A widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough Internet communications device." Then he revealed it was all one device. The audience went wild.==

==That’s all for today!==
