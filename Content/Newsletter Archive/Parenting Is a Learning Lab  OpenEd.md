# ==Parenting is a learning lab==

==Parenting has never felt like a manual to me—it’s a learning lab. With five kids (and now an army of grandsons), my wife and I learned the hard way that you can’t standardize an unstandardized population. We kept the chores and job charts consistent, sure, but when our two basketball-loving sons asked for different schools, I let them choose—even as the district tried to guilt me into keeping them together so the town could chase a championship. The result? Two confident young men who know their education wasn’t copied from my playbook; it was co-designed with them. We’re all learning out loud; the experts are the kids in front of us.==

==—Matt Bowman, Founder of OpenEd==

# ==Learning Labs Are Everywhere==

==Spaces like the== ==[Wichita Learning Lab](https://www.golearninglab.org/)== ==– a parent-built hub tucked inside a renovated warehouse – are changing the default. It operates like a mash-up of co-op, makerspace, and community center: weekday workshops in one room, self-directed learners prototyping in another, and parents co-working along the perimeter. Families map interests, swap mentors, and schedule field trips as a collective. We hope (nay, expect!) to see 1,000 similar learning labs blossom in the years ahead, as parents demand and then build alternatives to one-size-fits-all. Until then, keep learning and exploring with whatever you have, wherever you are.==

# ==The Learning Landscape Worksheet==

==As Matt advised in his talk, the first step toward map your child's interests is to give them unstructured time – so you can observe what they actually do when nothing is assigned. Then, layer in the non-negotiables—family budgets, chores, caregiving, screen rules—and note them alongside the interests. Finally, take inventory of the resources at your disposal – from free-to-fee.==

==What’s in your home? Who lives in your neighborhood? What community hubs (like the== ==[Learning Lab](https://www.golearninglab.org/)====) are available?== 

==Our Open Education toolkit guides you through that conversation.== ==[Download the template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FlbK2z4wbfvJhc0ibj9kWOwnR24DR7Dc/view?usp=sharing)====, run a two-week learner-led sprint, and celebrate the share-out over pizza.==
