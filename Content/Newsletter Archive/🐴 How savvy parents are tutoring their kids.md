==**IN THIS EDITION**==

==🍎 The tutoring myth that's keeping kids behind  
🍎 Why some "reading problems" need an eye doctor, not a reading specialist  
🍎 Three new weapons for your reading arsenal==

### ==💡 1 THOUGHT==

## ==**THE 'LESS IS MORE' APPROACH FOR READING SUCCESS**==

==We've been overdosing kids on tutoring.==

==Traditional wisdom says struggling readers need TONS of help—longer sessions, extra hours, weekend work. But what if small doses of the perfect 'medicine' is all they need?==

==Most reading tutor solutions available to families only offer 60-minute sessions.==

==But Tony Mickelsen from== ==[Savvy Learning](http://savvylearning.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-savvy-parents-are-tutoring-their-kids)== ==makes a point that seems obvious once it’s said out loud:==

_==**"What child is going to have fun learning to read for 60 minutes? That's tough for me as an adult."**==_

==The solution isn't long tutoring sessions—it's shorter, more frequent tutoring sessions. Like medicine, there's an optimal amount that produces maximum results. For reading, that dose is surprisingly small: 25 minutes, four times weekly.==

=="At the end of a session with Savvy, the kids are hyped," Tony reports. "They want to come back. In part, because the shorter sessions aren't leaving them burned out."==

==The key word here is "dosage," not "duration." It's about consistency and engagement, not endurance.==

### ==📊 2 TRENDS==

==**1. THE ADULT LITERACY CRISIS CREATES GENERATIONAL CYCLES -**== ==The reading crisis doesn't end at graduation. According to the== ==[U.S. Department of Education](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2019/2019179.pdf?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-savvy-parents-are-tutoring-their-kids)====,== ==**54% of American adults**== ==read below a 6th-grade level.==

==This creates a vicious cycle: Parents who struggle with reading often can't help with homework, skip bedtime stories, and pass on reading anxiety. The== ==[National Assessment of Educational Progress](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-savvy-parents-are-tutoring-their-kids)== ==shows== ==**66% of 4th graders**== ==now read below proficiency—and== ==**70% never catch up**== ==without intervention.==

==The pattern repeats: Parent avoids reading → Child misses early literacy exposure → Child struggles in school → Becomes an adult who avoids reading. Breaking this cycle requires treating family literacy as interconnected, not isolated problems.==

==**2. HIGH-DOSAGE TUTORING -**== ==Harvard economist Roland Fryer's award-winning== ==[research on high-dosage tutoring](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23792?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-savvy-parents-are-tutoring-their-kids)== ==found that 130+ hours of small-group tutoring significantly improved outcomes—but only when delivered in the right "dosage."==

==**The key finding:**== ==It's not about total hours but frequency and engagement. Schools implementing Fryer's model—high-dosage tutoring—saw gains equivalent to eliminating the racial achievement gap in three years.==

### ==🔨 3 TOOLS==

==**1.**== ==[Savvy Learning Free Reading Assessment](https://savvylearning.com/free-reading-assessment/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-savvy-parents-are-tutoring-their-kids)== ==**- Know Your Child's Level in 15 Minutes**==

==Designed by experts using Science of Reading principles, it evaluates key skills and provides actionable insights.
