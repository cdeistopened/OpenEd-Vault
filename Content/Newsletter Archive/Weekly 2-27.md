### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**THE SIMPLE VIEW OF READING**==

==**Reading Comprehension = Decoding × Linguistic Comprehension.**==

==If either piece is weak, reading comprehension breaks down. This isn’t just theory—it’s the core issue behind most reading struggles.==

==A child who struggles with== ==**decoding**== ==(turning letters into sounds) will fall behind, no matter how strong their vocabulary or reasoning skills. Conversely, a child who decodes well but lacks== ==**language comprehension**== ==(understanding words and sentences) will also struggle.==

==Because it’s multiplication, a zero in either area results in failure. The key to better reading instruction is diagnosing== _==which part of the equation is broken==_ ==and targeting the fix.==

### ==📊 TREND==

## ==**THE SCIENCE OF READING (WHY PHONICS STILL MATTERS)**==

==For decades, reading instruction was a battleground between phonics-based methods and “whole language” approaches. Today, the debate is largely settled—explicit, systematic instruction in foundational skills is essential to help most children become proficient readers.==

==But== ==[the “Science of Reading”](https://www.thereadingleague.org/what-is-the-science-of-reading/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-simple-formula-behind-reading-success-141)== ==is more than just phonics. It’s a body of research from neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and education that explains how our brains learn to read. Unlike speaking, reading isn’t innate; our brains must forge new neural pathways connecting visual recognition (letters), phonemic awareness (sounds), and meaning. Phonics is a necessary piece of the puzzle—just not the entire picture. Kids also need vocabulary development, fluency practice, and rich comprehension activities to thrive.==

### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**ORDINARY HEROES**==

==When you picture a school founder, who comes to mind? A tweed-jacketed professor? A billionaire with a fondness for naming buildings?==

==Try this instead: the homeschool mom down your street.==

==Enter Dalena Wallace, Kansas's unofficial Microschool Maven and Queen of Customized Education. A homeschooling mom of six who had an epiphany: "Ten years in, homeschooling my kids, I realized—this is hard. I need community."==

==So she did what entrepreneurs do. She solved her own problem.==

==She opened her home. Invited a few friends. They shared teaching duties. Three families became five, became ten, became a 16-family co-op.==

==No education degree necessary. No million-dollar endowment. No permission slip from the Department of Education.==

==This isn't isolated. Across America, regular folks—moms, dads, pastors, business owners—are stepping up. They see a need, have a vision, and start building.==

==The revolution isn't coming from education departments or policy think tanks. It's happening in living rooms and church basements.==

==Turns out you don't need special credentials to create extraordinary learning environments. You just need to care enough to start.==

## ==**THE GREAT EDUCATION MIGRATION**==

==National School Choice Awareness Foundation's latest data:==

==**⬇️ Traditional public schools:**== ==22% decrease====**⬆️ Private/faith-based schools:**== ==24% increase====**⬆️ Homeschooling:**== ==39% increase====**⬆️ Microschooling/hybrid learning:**== ==220% increase==

==No, that's not a typo. 220% jump in families considering microschools.==

==This isn't a pandemic blip or passing fad. It's education's tectonic plates shifting.==

==What's driving it? Parents want:==

- ==Schedules that work for actual humans==
- ==Input on what their kids learn==
- ==Community without conformity==

==As Dalena put it: "We've realized traditional private schools don't have to be so expensive, five days a week, or in traditional buildings."==

==The freedom is contagious. One family breaks free, others notice. They ask: "Wait, we can do that?"==

==Yes. Yes you can.==

### ==🔨 TOOL==

## ==**PRENDA: MICROSCHOOL IN A BOX**==

==Ever wanted to start a microschool but got stuck on the how?== ==[Prenda](https://prenda.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=honey-i-started-a-school-the-microschool-revolution-143)== ==might be your answer.==

==Dalena Wallace's microschool journey began here: "I opened a Prenda Microschool in my home as part of a Kansas pilot program. It completely turned me on to the idea that anybody can do this."==

==Think of Prenda as "microschool with training wheels." They provide:==

- ==**Ready-to-use curriculum**== ==(aligned to standards but actually interesting)==
- ==**Guide training**== ==(so you facilitate, not lecture)==
- ==**Administrative backend**== ==(handling paperwork while you handle minds)==
- ==**Community connection**== ==(because pioneers need fellow travelers)==
- ==**Funding pathways**== ==(in states with school choice or ESAs)==

==The formula is refreshingly simple: 5-10 kids, one adult guide, a learning space. Mix well.==

==What separates Prenda from DIY? They've battle-tested their model with thousands of students. They've made the mistakes so you don't have to.==

==It's perfect for homeschool co-ops ready to level up, or educators wanting to build something human-scale. Prenda offers the framework of an established system with the soul of a community effort.==

==Visit== ==[prenda.com](https://prenda.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=honey-i-started-a-school-the-microschool-revolution-143)== ==and join the growing tribe of "regular people" creating extraordinary learning environments that would make education PhDs jealous.==

==The mom wanted to provide her child with a quality education plus peer interaction for her children while avoiding excessive screen time.==

==The most upvoted comments emphasized that education isn't an either/or decision:==

- =="Do you have charter school options? My daughter is enrolled in a remote charter school. We choose and teach the curriculum... The charter school provides funds for any secular curriculum or activity." (sound familiar?)==
- =="We tried public middle school, but by 7th did a private school/home school co-op... The school has 3 in-school days and 2 at home."==

==And lastly:==

- =="You are not locked into a single choice for all 13 years of their education."==

==The old binary of "school vs. homeschool" is giving way to new hybrid possibilities—part co-op, part traditional classroom, with varying levels of structure, technology, and parent involvement.==

==That's what Nobel Prize winner Dr. Richard Feynman told quantum computing pioneer David Deutsch in a rare one-on-one conversation. Why such a grim prediction from one of the most brilliant minds of the 20th century?==

==**Our education system.**==

==Feynman thought standardized schooling was killing creativity. When everyone learns the same material in the same way, innovation dies. He saw the physics curricula becoming narrower, more uniform, more test-focused.==

==The freedom to think differently made Feynman who he was. He constantly approached problems in ways "people didn't approve of" - and revolutionized physics as a result.==

==What future Feynmans are we losing to standardization today?==

### ==📊 TREND==

## ==**BRING BACK MASTERS**==

==Before modern classrooms, scientists learned through apprenticeship and hands-on experimentation.==

==Parents are rediscovering this approach:==

- ==DIY science kit sales are on the rise.==
- ==Community maker spaces are booming==
- ==Apprenticeship-style STEM programs have waitlists at top universities==

==Why? Because== _==real==_ ==science isn't just about memorizing the periodic table. It's about curiosity, questions, and the freedom to explore what others haven't.==

### ==🔨 TOOL==

## ==**5-MINUTE FEYNMAN TECHNIQUE**==

==Feynman once famously said, "If you can't explain something to a first-year student, then you don't really understand it."==

==The next time your child struggles with a concept, try this simple technique:==

1. ==**Choose a concept**== ==your child is learning==
2. ==**Have them explain it**== ==as if teaching someone who knows nothing about the subject==
3. ==**Notice where they get stuck**== ==- these are the knowledge gaps==
4. ==**Review and simplify**== ==- go back to source material together, then try again with simpler language==

==Feynman’s trademark technique reveals instantly whether your child truly understands or has just memorized facts. Better yet, it teaches them to recognize the difference themselves.==

_==Try it this week: Ask your child to explain something they're learning to a stuffed animal. The results might surprise you both.==_
