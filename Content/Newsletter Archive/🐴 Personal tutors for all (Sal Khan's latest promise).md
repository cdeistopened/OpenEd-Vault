==Khan points to== ==[Benjamin Bloom's famous "2 sigma problem,"](https://web.mit.edu/5.95/www/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=personal-tutors-for-all-sal-khan-s-latest-promise)== ==which showed one-on-one tutoring could dramatically improve student performance. The challenge has always been scaling personal tutoring economically. Khan believes AI is the answer.==

==The demos are impressive:==

- ==It identifies specific math misconceptions rather than just flagging wrong answers==
- ==Students can debate historical figures and literary characters (one student apologized to Jay Gatsby for taking up his time)==
- ==It provides writing feedback by highlighting text and asking Socratic questions==

==For teachers, it generates lesson plans and handles administrative tasks.==

==But questions remain. Can AI replicate the emotional intelligence of great human tutors? Will it reinforce existing educational inequalities? And what about student privacy with all these recorded conversations?==

==While it's easy to get caught up in the techno-optimism, the real test will be in the real world, not TED stages.==

==We want to know from our families who have tried it. Does the tool live up to the hype?==

### ==🛠️ TOOL==

## ==**CROWDSOURCED BOOK SCREENING**==

==Ever picked up a children's book only to discover content you weren't ready to discuss with your 8-year-old? A new platform called== ==[ScreenItFirst](https://screenitfirst.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=personal-tutors-for-all-sal-khan-s-latest-promise)== ==aims to eliminate those awkward moments.==

==This crowdsourced site lets parents anonymously flag and view potentially sensitive content in children's books across multiple categories:==

- ==Sexual content==
- ==Violence/death==
- ==Foul language==
- ==Dark content (demons, witches)==
- ==Potty humor==

==Users upload actual screenshots and images from books with the questionable content highlighted. You see exactly what appears on the page, allowing you to make your own judgment.==

==The site’s tagline is, "The right book at the right time builds a healthy mind"—emphasizing timing and appropriateness rather than censorship.==
