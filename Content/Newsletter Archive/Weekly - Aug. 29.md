# ==The Third-Floor Tutoring Tower==

==Mike's charter school tried project-based learning. It wasn't working.==

==What did work? One-on-one tutoring for foundational skills.==

==The problem is, tutoring is expensive.==

==So== ==[Mike came up with a wild solution.](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7365790224016175104?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_7ToLHwZwA9dUtiGpg7nJgKHvM0V2zZkLt-XoGXp5VbXYQNPbm1EQnZkuTPdbanAM3KLvN)== ==When they bought their three-story building, the original plan was to rent out the top floor to help pay the mortgage. Instead, the school built it out as a college dorm with 14 triple rooms and bunk beds.==

==They recruited 42 recent college grads to live and tutor for a year, Teach for America style. The pay was minimal, but housing was free. Every day at 8:00 AM these 22-year-olds would come downstairs and spend their entire day tutoring students one-on-one.==

=="We got maybe 250 people to apply for these 40 full-time tutoring slots," Mike says. These were Princeton grads who didn't know if they wanted to be teachers but liked the idea of a year of public service.==

## ==**The Problem with "Back to School"**==

==Every year, the same ritual plays out. New backpacks. Fresh notebooks. That first-day photo by the front door. Parents breathe a sigh of relief (or shed a tear) as kids board the bus. September (or thereabouts) means school starts. June means it ends. This is how it's always been.==

==But this outdated schedule was designed for a world that no longer exists. The traditional school calendar emerged when kids needed summers free to help with farm work. The September start made sense for the harvest schedule. We're now generations removed from that agricultural society, yet we're still following a calendar created for it.==

==Meanwhile, your eight-year-old's fascination with ancient Egypt doesn't suddenly shut off in June. Your teenager's coding projects don't need a three-month pause. And that moment when your child finally understands fractions might not happen according to the specific syllabus pacing.==

==For families in== ==[the OpenEd program](https://opened.co/?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--E1OSjOtZzAkpe65MkBEPLkE5vxyd-Y5DwK9BNDphFlygmW12APzeOxq_zTFkoHhqqJIrU)====, you've already taken the brave step of recognizing that learning doesn't have to follow someone else's schedule. Yes, our program year is starting, and if you need a moment to mark new beginnings, this season works as well as any. But here's what we want you to understand: you can create these fresh starts whenever your family needs them. In January after the holidays settle. In March when the days get longer. Or any time throughout the year that you sense your child needs renewed energy and focus.==

## ==**The Real Solution: Your Own Learning Calendar**==

==In 2012, NASA's Curiosity rover touched down on Mars. Before it could begin exploring, engineers had to solve a fundamental challenge: how do you design something to explore a world you've never visited?==

==They started with three essential questions:==

- ==What does Mars need us to discover?==
- ==What unique capabilities can we develop?==
- ==What resources do we have?==

==Your child's education requires the same approach. Your child’s educational landscape is an unmapped terrain waiting to be explored. You can't use someone else's map or calendar. You need to chart your own course.==

==Here's a simple exercise that can transform how your family approaches learning. It doesn't require expensive curriculum or elaborate planning. Just sticky notes and genuine curiosity.==

==I share a detailed template for this exercise in the== _==[Open Education](https://opened.co/book?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--E1OSjOtZzAkpe65MkBEPLkE5vxyd-Y5DwK9BNDphFlygmW12APzeOxq_zTFkoHhqqJIrU)==_ ==[book](https://opened.co/book?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--E1OSjOtZzAkpe65MkBEPLkE5vxyd-Y5DwK9BNDphFlygmW12APzeOxq_zTFkoHhqqJIrU)====, and you can also get started with a free printable worksheet before reading the whole chapter. Here’s a condensed version of how it works.==

## ==**Step 1: The Discovery**==

==Create a "Discovery Zone" in your home - a wall, poster board, or even the back of a door. Post these five questions:==

1. ==What do I like to learn about?==
2. ==What do I like to do or think about in my free time?==
3. ==What do I believe I'm good at doing?==
4. ==What am I not yet good at, but would like to improve?==
5. ==What activities do I genuinely dislike and have no interest in developing?==

==Give each family member a different color of sticky notes. Over the course of a week, everyone adds their thoughts whenever inspiration strikes. No judgment. No editing. No "right" answers.==

## ==**Step 2: The Two-Week Sprint**==

==Once you've gathered these insights, resist the urge to plan an entire year. Instead, use what we call "learner-driven sprints" - focused two-week learning adventures.==

==Why two weeks? Here, we can learn from the way that elite athletes train. They spend most of their time working at a moderate, sustainable pace and only a tiny percentage in bursts of intense, all-out exertion. Learning works the same way. Short, focused sprints followed by celebration and reflection create better results than constant grinding.==

==The sprint structure is simple:==

- ==**Day 1:**== ==10-minute launch meeting to set goals==
- ==**Day 7:**== ==Quick check-in to adjust course if needed==
- ==**Day 14:**== ==Celebration where learning is shared==

## ==**Step 3: Starting with What You Have**==

==The next step is to take inventory of what you already have:==

- ==**Library card:**== ==Access to thousands of books, audiobooks, and programs==
- ==**Kitchen:**== ==A chemistry and math laboratory==
- ==**Backyard or local park:**== ==Biology and physics classroom==
- ==**YouTube, Out school, and Khan Academy:**== ==Millions of teachers at your fingertips==
- ==**Family and Community skills:**== ==Every adult in your life has expertise in something==

==OpenEd families have discovered that true personalization in education means curating the best options and letting parents and students choose what works best for them—by subject, by grade, by provider, and especially by child.==

==The traditional education system assumes all children should learn the same things at the same pace. But even identical triplets need different approaches to math. If children sharing the same DNA and home environment learn differently, how can we expect a standardized system to work for millions of unique minds?==

==This is why the open education mindset is so powerful. Instead of asking "What should my child know by this age?" we ask "What would my child like to discover right now?"==

## ==**Your Family's Unique Rhythm**==

==Some OpenEd families organize their year around dad's travel schedule. Others align with mom's busy season at work. Some do monthly sprints, others follow interests for entire seasons. We've seen families who:==

- ==Combine morning homeschool with afternoon public school enrichment==
- ==Discovered their night-owl teenager does best with math at 10:30 PM==
- ==Have kids who learn better while moving, standing, or even lying on the floor==

==The freedom to choose isn't about having ZERO structure. It's about having the== _==right==_ ==structure for your unique child.==

## ==**Making It Happen This Week**==

==Start small. You don't need perfect conditions.==

==**This week:**==

- ==Put up your Discovery Zone (even if it's just painter's tape on a door)==
- ==Give everyone their sticky notes==
- ==Set the expectation: one note per day minimum, no maximum==

==**Next week:**==

- ==Gather to discuss what you've discovered==
- ==Look for patterns and connections (especially across siblings and parents!)==
- ==Choose one interest per family member for your first two-week sprint==

==**In two weeks:**==

- ==Hold your first sprint celebration to share what each person learned==
- ==Make it special but simple (pizza or ice cream works great)==
- ==Adapt and plan your next sprint based on what the family discovered==

==Thousands of OpenEd families are discovering the open education mindset - recognizing that learning happens everywhere, all the time, in ways as unique as each child.==

==If you want to hear me elaborate on this exercise, and the 5 basic building blocks that I unpack with my co-author Isaac Morehouse, I invite you to== ==[come (with your questions!) to my free live event next Thursday, September 4 at 5pm MT](https://opened.co/open-education-breakthrough-event?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--E1OSjOtZzAkpe65MkBEPLkE5vxyd-Y5DwK9BNDphFlygmW12APzeOxq_zTFkoHhqqJIrU)====.==

==Zach Koon's son loves geology. So instead of reading about rocks in a textbook, he collects them at Zion National Park while his dad explains how rivers carved the canyon over millennia.==

==A few years ago, he and his wife decided their house felt too cramped for their growing family. Instead of buying a bigger house, they moved into the RV and turned the world into their extended playground/classroom.==

==How's that working out for them?==

# Why are Tech CEOs sounding more like 90s homeschool moms? | OpenEd (1)

==Greetings!==

==Today's newsletter explores the "Goldilocks Effect" in education—finding the learning environment that's "just right" for your child at each stage of development. We dive into why switching schools isn't a failure but an intelligent response to evolving needs, what tech CEOs are saying about the skills that matter in an AI world, and where to find alternatives to traditional education.==

==**THOUGHT**====: The Goldilocks Effect  
‍TR====**END:**== ==The nerds have become the crunchy moms  
‍TOOL====**: A**== ==Field Guide to the Education Underground==

# ==The Goldilocks Effect==

==Choosing a school for your child feels like a permanent, high-stakes decision. It's not. The reality is that what works for your five-year-old might not work for them at age 10, let alone 15.==

==Kerry McDonald - author of a new book on unconventional schooling (see below) -== ==[calms fears around “school-switching.”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerrymcdonald/2025/08/22/dont-like-your-childs-school-make-a-switch/)==

==Just as Goldilocks had to try different bowls of porridge, chairs, and beds before finding the one that was “just right,” sometimes parents and learners have to try a few schools or learning models before they find the best fit.==

==An education isn't a single path you choose once stick with for thirteen years. For many families, it's becoming a series of tours through different models - a microschool for elementary, a self-directed learning center for middle school, maybe a hybrid program for the high school years.==

==Each switch is just an adjustment based on what a child needs== _==right now==_==. The goal isn't to find the 'perfect' school, but the right fit for the right stage of development. Each switch is a rational adjustment to a child's evolving needs. It’s a feature, not a bug.==

# ==The nerds have become the crunchy moms==

==In a recent== ==[[amazonawsceothemostimpor]]====, the incoming CEO of Amazon Web Services said the most important skill in the age of AI is critical thinking. Even OpenAI's Sam Altman admits that human insight is what drives real progress. Funny how the closer we get to superintelligence, the more tech leaders start sounding like homeschool parents from the 90s. It wasn't long ago== ==[we featured Anthropic co-founder Ben Mann, explaining how he learned to stop optimizing for academics and embrace the Montessori method](https://x.com/lennysan/status/1947810003169292371)====.==

==When your AI assistant can write an essay, what matters is your ability to tell if it's any good. The entire premium is shifting from what you know to how you think - a skill the old assembly-line system was never designed to build.==

# ==A Field Guide to the Education Underground==

==For those ready to explore the growing ecosystem of learner-centered models, Kerry McDonald's new book,== _==[Joyful Learning](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1541705521/)==_==, is a practical field guide. It showcases the sheer variety of options people are building right now.==

==For a multimedia tour, browse the episodes of the== _==[LiberatED](https://www.liberatedpodcast.com/)==_ ==podcast. You can hear directly from all kinds of microschool founders and edupreneurs, and get a feel for the diversity of the ecosystem.==

# ==The Word of the Day:== ==**Heutagogy**==

==**Heutagogy**== ==(HOO-tuh-go-jee)==

==Think of it as the final boss of learning. Pedagogy is for kids (teacher-led). Andragogy is for adults (self-directed). Heutagogy is for the truly sovereign learner - it's not just directing your own learning, but deciding== _==what==_ ==is worth learning and== _==how==_ ==you're going to learn it.==

==It's the educational framework for a world where you can't possibly know what's coming next.==
