==Stop picking sides. Start picking what works. That’s open education.==

## ==📊 TREND==

### ==Breaking Down Education Walls==

==OpenEd has long championed flexible education, with students mixing home-based learning, community classes, and public school courses. Now, with== [==Utah’s new education funding program==](https://yeseverykidfoundation.org/why-public-schools-should-love-esas/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=095-the-power-of-yes-and)==, more public schools are embracing this approach.==

==Case in point: Canyons School District just announced they’re opening their doors wider for part-time students. Want to take just engineering? Done. Need access to the robotics lab? No problem. Looking for marching band or sports? Come on in.==

==It’s part of a larger shift away from “either-or” thinking in education. A recent survey found 80% of families want customizable education, but only 38% feel they can currently achieve it.==

==The future of education looks more like a buffet than a set menu.==

### ==Growing Readers Naturally==

## ==(CORRECTION) OF THE DAY==

==**Two quick fixes from yesterday’s newsletter:**==

1. [==Infinite Mind==](https://infinitemind.io/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=095-the-power-of-yes-and) ==is actually a free app (not $199 as we stated). It’s available at no cost in both Apple and Android app stores.==
2. ==Utah families: The link to express interest in Falcon AeroLab’s summer aerospace camp was temporarily disabled. You can express your interest== [==here==](https://forms.gle/BMKoQhE83RwitPVm8?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=095-the-power-of-yes-and)==. We apologize for any confusion!==

==That’s all for today!==
