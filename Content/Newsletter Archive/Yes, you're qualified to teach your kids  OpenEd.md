==Homeschooling dad M.A. Franklin has a good reminder not to let anyone make you feel inadequate about your ability to teach your children.==

==His insight touches on something we see often at OpenEd: Parents doubting their ability to guide their children’s education, despite having unique insights into how their kids learn best.==

==Here’s what we know from thousands of families:==

- ==The most important qualification is caring deeply about your child’s development==
- ==Enthusiasm for learning is contagious==
- ==You don’t need to know everything – you just need to know how to find resources==

==The question isn’t whether you’re qualified. It’s about finding the right mix of tools and approaches that work for your family.==

Their “Signature Career Academies” let students earn industry credentials while still in high school. The results:==

- ==2020-21: 2,966 credentials earned==
- ==2021-22: 7,118 credentials earned==
- ==2022-23: 10,766 credentials earned==

==At the same time, the district’s graduation rate hit 92.2% – an all-time high.==

==Why? Because when learning feels relevant, students show up. When students see the direct connection between their education and their future, they engage.==
