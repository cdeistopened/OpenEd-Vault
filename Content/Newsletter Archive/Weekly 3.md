==Developed in the 1970s and later embedded in education policy through programs like No Child Left Behind (2001) and Race to the Top (2009), the VAM attempts to measure teacher effectiveness through student test scores. The model uses complex statistical analysis to predict how students "should" perform, then evaluates teachers based on whether their students exceed or fall short of these predictions.==

==But here's where it gets problematic: the formula assumes all children learn the same way and at the same pace. It fails to account for unique learning styles, individual circumstances, and personal growth patterns.==

==The consequences? As Price notes, "Real learning? Replaced by test preparation. Critical thinking? Sacrificed for memorization. Life skills? Left behind entirely."==

## ==**COMPLETING THE SQUARE**==

==Speaking of frightening formulas, if the words "quadratic equation" trigger flashbacks of high school math trauma, I’ve got good news! There's a reason one particular math tutorial has amassed over 4.4 million views since 2008.==

- =="I wasn't even born when you posted this, and now I'm watching it at 14 for my exams."==

==Education systems often focus on compliance and memorization. But real learning is trying, failing, adjusting, and trying again until the struggle leads to mastery.==

==Embracing "serial incompetence" means seeing mistakes as essential stepping stones rather than something to be avoided.==

### ==🎧 THIS WEEK'S EPISODE==

## ==**HOW A MOM OF 7 CREATED A SELF-RUNNING HOMESCHOOL**==

[https://youtube.com/embed/uW3iGbGAWso](https://youtube.com/embed/uW3iGbGAWso)

=="Children don't need to ask how to behave or make decisions because your family becomes a self-managing family thanks to its culture. The culture is present in the details of every decision."==

==[– Meg Thomas, OpenEd parent and homeschooling coach](https://www.instagram.com/coachmegthomas/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=coach-meg-thomas-on-creating-a-self-managing-homeschool)==

==In this episode,== ==[veteran homeschool mom Meg Thomas](https://www.instagram.com/coachmegthomas/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=coach-meg-thomas-on-creating-a-self-managing-homeschool)== ==reveals how she homeschooled seven children without losing her mind (or her identity) by creating a family culture where responsibility and independence are baked into everyday life.==

==The morning of our interview, Meg ran (wait for it)… 16 miles. Her commitment to maintaining her identity beyond "homeschool mom" is a powerful reminder for all parents:==

=="I knew I needed to make myself still a priority. I always kept something that was mine. Saturday mornings were always mine. Everybody knew they were just mine."==

==This might seem like an impossibly high bar, but it started to make more sense once she unpacked her teaching philosophy.==

### ==💎 GEMS==

## ==**LEVELS OF LIBERTY**==

==Most parents find themselves between the twin traps of either micromanagement or completely letting go. Meg's== ==["Levels of Liberty" approach](https://opened.co/blog/coach-meg-thomas-how-i-built-a-self-managing-homeschool-of-7-kids-with-the-successful-six/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=coach-meg-thomas-on-creating-a-self-managing-homeschool)== ==offers a brilliant middle path: Children earn increasing freedom by demonstrating responsibility in six key areas.==

1. ==**Financial:**== ==Understanding economics, tracking spending, using credit wisely==
2. ==**Emotional:**== ==Taking responsibility for feelings, processing challenges==
3. ==**Mental:**== ==Pushing through difficult tasks, academic skills, home management==
4. ==**Physical:**== ==Cooking, cleaning, hygiene, exercise, grocery shopping==
5. ==**Social:**== ==Being a good friend, serving others, community involvement==
6. ==**Spiritual:**== ==Building a foundation in faith, meditation, or connection to nature==

==This creates a powerful growth path where privileges are matched with capability rather than granted by age. "Teaching them responsibility is not burying them in work,” says Meg, “It's setting them up to win."==

### ==🛠️ THE ESSENTIALS==

## ==**HEART, HABITS, HOME**==

==Before adding another curriculum or attempting a perfect schedule, focus on these three foundational elements:==

==**1. Heart:**== ==Build strong relationships first. Children naturally follow and learn from people they feel connected to and safe with.==

==**2. Habits:**== ==Establish consistent routines for daily life—laundry, meals, chores. These create the infrastructure that makes homeschooling sustainable.==

==**3. Home:**== ==Cultivate an intentional family culture where learning is a natural extension of who you are, not something separate from "real life."==

=="When you have those three things functioning,” says Meg, “school is just another extension of your family. Of course we read books, of course we study, of course we finish things that we started—because that is the culture we've intentionally created."==
