### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**ORDINARY HEROES**==

==When you picture a school founder, who comes to mind? A tweed-jacketed professor? A billionaire with a fondness for naming buildings?==

==Try this instead: the homeschool mom down your street.==

==Enter Dalena Wallace, Kansas's unofficial Microschool Maven and Queen of Customized Education. A homeschooling mom of six who had an epiphany: "Ten years in, homeschooling my kids, I realized—this is hard. I need community."==

==So she did what entrepreneurs do. She solved her own problem.==

==She opened her home. Invited a few friends. They shared teaching duties. Three families became five, became ten, became a 16-family co-op.==

==No education degree necessary. No million-dollar endowment. No permission slip from the Department of Education.==

==This isn't isolated. Across America, regular folks—moms, dads, pastors, business owners—are stepping up. They see a need, have a vision, and start building.==

==The revolution isn't coming from education departments or policy think tanks. It's happening in living rooms and church basements.==

==Turns out you don't need special credentials to create extraordinary learning environments. You just need to care enough to start.==

## ==**THE GREAT EDUCATION MIGRATION**==

==National School Choice Awareness Foundation's latest data:==

==**⬇️ Traditional public schools:**== ==22% decrease====  
====**⬆️ Private/faith-based schools:**== ==24% increase====  
====**⬆️ Homeschooling:**== ==39% increase====  
====**⬆️ Microschooling/hybrid learning:**== ==220% increase==

==No, that's not a typo. 220% jump in families considering microschools.==

==This isn't a pandemic blip or passing fad. It's education's tectonic plates shifting.==

==What's driving it? Parents want:==

- ==Schedules that work for actual humans==
- ==Input on what their kids learn==
- ==Community without conformity==

==As Dalena put it: "We've realized traditional private schools don't have to be so expensive, five days a week, or in traditional buildings."==

==The freedom is contagious. One family breaks free, others notice. They ask: "Wait, we can do that?"==

==Yes. Yes you can.==

### ==🔨 TOOL==

## ==**PRENDA: MICROSCHOOL IN A BOX**==

==Ever wanted to start a microschool but got stuck on the how?== [==Prenda==](https://prenda.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=honey-i-started-a-school-the-microschool-revolution-143) ==might be your answer.==

==Dalena Wallace's microschool journey began here: "I opened a Prenda Microschool in my home as part of a Kansas pilot program. It completely turned me on to the idea that anybody can do this."==

==Think of Prenda as "microschool with training wheels." They provide:==

- ==**Ready-to-use curriculum**== ==(aligned to standards but actually interesting)==
- ==**Guide training**== ==(so you facilitate, not lecture)==
- ==**Administrative backend**== ==(handling paperwork while you handle minds)==
- ==**Community connection**== ==(because pioneers need fellow travelers)==
- ==**Funding pathways**== ==(in states with school choice or ESAs)==

==The formula is refreshingly simple: 5-10 kids, one adult guide, a learning space. Mix well.==

==What separates Prenda from DIY? They've battle-tested their model with thousands of students. They've made the mistakes so you don't have to.==

==It's perfect for homeschool co-ops ready to level up, or educators wanting to build something human-scale. Prenda offers the framework of an established system with the soul of a community effort.==

### ==🎓 WORD OF THE DAY==

## ==Micro·pre·neur (mī′krō-prə-nûr′)==

==**noun**====: Someone who launches a tiny education revolution, typically from their living room, with a focus on personalization over standardization.==

==**Origin:**== ==What happens when "microschool" and "entrepreneur" have a very innovative baby==

==Example: "The abandoned Sears at the mall now houses seven micropreneurs who've turned retail therapy into actual therapy for burned-out students."==

==That’s all for today! See you tomorrow.==
