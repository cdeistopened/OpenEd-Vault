==Dear Readers,==

==Our recent report,== _==Extending the Runway: A 50-State Analysis of Middle School Career Exploration==_==, found that while there is nationwide career exploration momentum, a number of states are leading the charge in showing what high-quality programming can look like for middle schoolers.== ==**(**====**[Read the report](https://www.asa.org/extending-the-runway/)**====**.)**== ==Together with Education Strategy Group, we recently launched the Middle School Career Exploration Impact and Learning Network. It is designed to accelerate the work of those states while sharing resources and inspiration for others.== ==**(**====**[[americanstudentassistanceandeducationstrategygrouplaunchmiddleschoolcareerexplorationimpactandlearningnetworktoprovidemodelpoliciesandasingularvisionforensuringallmiddleschool]]**====**.)**==

==In my scan of the summer education news, I see endless signs that more young people are finding their pathways. Some 337 seniors across New Jersey’s vocational and technical schools received their diplomas after earning associates degrees, setting a class record for the number of vocational students to earn a degree while still in high school.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://njbiz.com/nj-vocational-students-earn-associate-degrees-2025/)**====**.)**== ==A fund of $10 million has been made available for work-based learning initiatives in Connecticut.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://www.ctinsider.com/opinion/article/ct-youth-employment-lamont-20351252.php)**====**.)**== _==USA Today==_ ==reports on research that shows more teens are bucking the college-after-high-school trend in favor of options like vocational training that may be a better fit for their needs. On a related note, you may have also seen the video featuring Mike Rowe, host of Discovery Channel’s hit show Dirty Jobs and a longtime advocate for nondegree career pathways, with some advice for parents of teens. He== ==[shares insights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ee3Vw8H0j8)== ==from ASA’s research, as featured in== _==USA Today==_==, on his highly influential YouTube channel.== ==**(**====**[Watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ee3Vw8H0j8)**====**.)**== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2025/06/15/kids-ditch-traditional-college-after-high-school/84027992007/)**====**.)**==

==And,== _==Hechinger Report==_ ==tells the story of high school students who gained hands-on professional experience at the American Museum of Natural History this spring through a mentoring program. One high school junior said of her experience researching microplastic pollution that she “fell in love with science.”== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://hechingerreport.org/high-school-sleuths-search-fish-guts-for-clues-to-plastics-pollution/)**====**.)**== ==These are the stories that validate our mission to help more kids find their unique passions and pathways, and that validate the tireless work of those educators and school leaders who understand the power of career exploration.==

==Each month, I invite you to watch the latest episode of “Youth Career Readiness: The One-Question Podcast” — my collaboration with author Michael Horn. This month, we interviewed Alec Ingold, fullback for the Miami Dolphins and advocate for youth development. He explains how making a daily, actionable plan can help young people achieve their goals.== ==**(**====**[Watch the episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFJGL7HOp1A)**====**.)**== ==We also interviewed Kensington Tallman, the actress and singer who is the voice behind Riley in Pixar’s hit film,== _==Inside Out 2==_==. She urges young people to find their unique voice.== ==**(**====**[Watch the episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uJS-Me-Ne8)**====**.)**== ==You can also explore our past interviews with well-known guests like Stevie Van Zandt, Lou Holtz, Yo-Yo Ma, Common, John Pankow, Tanya Wright, and others.== ==**(**====**[Explore the One Question library](https://www.asa.org/the-one-question-podcast/)**====**. Scroll down to the “Episodes” section of the page.)**==

==I hope you all enjoy the remainder of your summer. I’m excited to see what the school year ahead holds for our young learners.==

==Sincerely,==
