==Greetings!==

==Last week we shared== ==[Dave Hoffman's story](https://opened.co/blog/why-a-public-school-principal-told-me-to-homeschool-my-kids)====—a public school administrator who unschooled all six kids.==

==He== ==[dispelled the myth about learning gaps among homeschoolers](https://www.facebook.com/share/r/1G1XA9fm5K/)== ==by pointing out the even larger gaps created by schools that breed conformity.==

==This week, a Reddit post offers something rare: an honest homeschooler sharing the real gaps they experienced. Plus,== ==[what makes you irreplaceable in an AI world](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2025/09/16/3-human-skills-that-make-you-irreplaceable-in-an-ai-world/)====, and why a 3D printer could be the solution to your screentime woes.==

==Let's dive in.==

==**THOUGHT:**== ==The 5 Real Gaps Homeschooling Creates====**TREND:**== ==What Makes You Irreplaceable?====**TOOL:**== ==Creation Beats Consumption==

# ==The 5 Real Gaps Homeschooling Creates==

==Critics have spent decades warning about homeschool learning gaps. Then== ==[an actual homeschooler shows up on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1nvcvt9/5_gaps_homeschooling_did_leave_in_my_education/)== ==with a refreshingly honest list of real gaps they experienced—before going on to attend an Ivy League school:==

1. ==Collaboration skills and taking input from others on group projects==
2. ==Sitting through repetitive content when you've already mastered the material==
3. ==Listening to others' presentations and giving constructive feedback==
4. ==Meeting deadlines over pursuing perfection==
5. ==Separating school from the rest of life to avoid burnout==

==Ask yourself: Are these the skills that make you a thriving, curious human being?==

==Or are they the skills that make you good at filling out forms and sitting quietly through PowerPoint presentations?==

==One gap you can fix in an afternoon at the DMV. The other kind is more stubborn.==

# ==What Makes You Irreplaceable?==

==[Ed Elson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ed-elson-314283158/)====, host of the Prof G Markets podcast, asks a simple question:== ==["What would make me irreplaceable in an AI world?"](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2025/09/16/3-human-skills-that-make-you-irreplaceable-in-an-ai-world/)==

==His answer:== ==**Curation, Curiosity, and Connectivity.**==

==**Curation**== ==means selecting the tone and frame of a message. Developing taste. Reading widely, and choosing narrowly.==

==**Curiosity**== ==is about building creative range. Exploring outside your lane, chasing ideas without immediate payoff, and connecting dots others don't see.==

==**Connectivity**== ==means showing up with warmth and follow-through. Being the person who brings the group together, who makes others feel smarter when they work with you. Trust is impossible to automate.==

==Most schools teach what AI does best—standardized knowledge, recall, following instructions. The 3 C's, on the other hand, can't be standardized. They're hard to test and harder to measure. So schools struggle to teach them.==

==The observant reader might notice the similarity between these 3 C's and the ones essential to learning talked about in the== _==[Open Education](https://opened.co/book)==_ ==[book](https://opened.co/book)====: Choice, Competency, and Connection. Families pursuing an open education have been prioritizing these skills all along.==

# ==Creation Beats Consumption==

==Speaking of Reddit...==

==A mom tried everything to pull her teenage son away from screens.== ==[Sports didn't stick. Clubs didn't stick. Art classes didn't stick.](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeschool/comments/1o0rgb5/how_a_3d_printer_surprisingly_helped_my_kid_spend/)==

==Then she bought a 3D printer – the== ==["Bambu Lab P1S"](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/p1s?srsltid=AfmBOoqfAwV8ZknbmjtSx96_LC_harOqQHH2U50-wuPsSt_wRrHWMTGl)== ==– thinking of it as a creative tool rather than a screen time solution. Now, he spends 1-2 hours daily painting 3D models. The phone is still there but it's no longer the default. The shift wasn't about removing technology—it was about redirecting it.==

==Isaac has a rule in his house:== ==[Make a YouTube video before you watch YouTube](https://x.com/OpenEdHQ/status/1973097417772851586)====. Create before you consume. Make before you take.==
