### ==📝 WORD OF THE DAY==

## ==**chi·as·mus (kī-ăz′məs)**==

==From the Greek letter "chi" (X), chiasmus is a writing technique where words, grammar, or concepts are repeated in reverse order, creating a satisfying X-shaped pattern.==

==Examples:==

- =="Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country." - JFK==
- =="I meant what I said and I said what I meant." - Dr. Seuss==
- =="Whether you think you can or think you cannot, you are right." - Henry Ford==
