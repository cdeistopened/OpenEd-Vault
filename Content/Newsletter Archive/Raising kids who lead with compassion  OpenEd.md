# ==The Kid Who Didn't Want To Go==

==Kerry Owen needed help delivering food to a family. Her 22-year-old son said no. She said, "I need you to carry this into the apartment." He was grumpy in the car.==

==They got there. The family had lots of little kids. The kids climbed all over him. Wanted him to play. Wanted to color with him.==

==In the car afterward, Kerry said, "They loved you." He said, "I know. Actually, that was pretty fun."==

==Most of us think we need to== _==feel==_ ==like serving before we do it. Kerry's son proves the opposite: you do it first, then discover you needed it.==

# ==Service Is the New Curriculum==

==When Kerry is running== ==[Reach Out Today](https://www.reachouttoday.org/)====, she brings her kids along. They assemble food kits, organize pop-up hair salons for underserved communities, coordinate volunteer teams. One daughter manages donor relations. Another runs "walk in their shoes" school visits. They're not volunteering once a month. This is family culture.==

==And colleges are noticing, asking for evidence of contribution—project logs, leadership stories, documented impact.==

==Flexible schooling makes this possible. Online classes in the morning, meal distribution in the afternoon. You can't coordinate a feeding program stuck in a classroom until 3pm. But when you control your schedule, service becomes curriculum, not something you squeeze in after homework.==

# ==The Transcript That Shows Real Work==

==The== ==[Mastery Transcript Consortium](https://mastery.org/)== ==created transcripts for students doing real-world learning. Instead of a vague line item like, "Community Service: A+" (lol), it shows real competencies with evidence.==

==Each transcript includes artifacts—photos, testimonials, project logs. Over 400 schools use MTC transcripts. Colleges accept them because they show initiative and real-world impact, not just grades.==
