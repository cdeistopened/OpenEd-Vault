==It's efficient—just like Ford's assembly line. It's also completely backward.==

=="People's individuality is not selfishness," Rose insists. "That distinctiveness is everything."==

==Imagine designing education around humans rather than factories—celebrating differences instead of smoothing them away. Crazy idea: what if schools adapted to children instead of forcing children to adapt to schools?==

### ==📊 TREND==

## ==**THE END OF EDUCATION MONOPOLIES**==

==People throw around the word “disruption” a lot these days.==

==But== ==[Michael B. Horn isn’t exaggerating when he says we’re experiencing the first true disruption of K-12 education](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhorn/2025/04/24/disrupting-us-schools-wasnt-possible-before-that-may-be-changing/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-factory-model-of-education-is-dying)== ==in decades.== _==**40% of American students no longer attend their assigned neighborhood schools.**==_

==One of the main catalysts has been families gaining direct control of education funding through choice programs—which is rewiring the power dynamics. When families control education dollars, they weigh value vs. cost for the first time. Innovation emerges from the bottom up as providers compete to serve families. And customized learning becomes financially viable at scale.==

### ==Before there was ChatGPT, before there was Google, there was Marilyn vos Savant – certified by Guinness World Records as having the highest IQ ever recorded at 228.==

==For decades, she's answered questions in her weekly Parade Magazine column, ranging from complex probability puzzles to philosophical inquiries about human nature. Yet her most valuable insights may be about our education system itself.==

## ==Yesterday's Trivia: The Monty Hall Showdown==

==In yesterday's newsletter, we asked you about the famous Monty Hall problem that once sparked a national controversy:==

==You're on a game show with three doors. Behind one door is a car; behind the others are goats. You pick Door #1. The host, who knows what's behind each door, opens Door #3 to reveal a goat. Should you stick with Door #1 or switch to Door #2?==

[![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/f5921cde-772e-4eaf-bdba-b961119b2516/preview.jpg?t=1747758742)](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/f5921cde-772e-4eaf-bdba-b961119b2516/preview.jpg?t=1747758742)

==Most of you either chose to stick with Door #1 or thought it doesn't matter which door you pick.==

==Most people instinctively believe it doesn't matter whether you switch or not. After all, there are now just two doors left, so it seems like a 50/50 chance. The car is either behind your original choice or the other remaining door—flip a coin, right? WRONG!==

==Vos Savant correctly stated that switching doors doubles your chances of winning—from 1/3 to 2/3.==

==Think of it this way: When you first picked a door, you had a 1/3 chance of being right. That means there's a 2/3 chance you picked wrong. Nothing about the host opening a door changes your original odds. If you initially picked wrong (which happens 2/3 of the time), switching will ALWAYS win. If you initially picked right (which happens 1/3 of the time), switching will ALWAYS lose. Since you're more likely to have picked wrong initially, switching is the better strategy.==

==The backlash to her explanation was immediate and fierce. Nearly 10,000 readers – including hundreds of "expert" mathematics professors – wrote in to tell her she was wrong. Many were condescending:==

=="You blew it, and you blew it big!" wrote one Ph.D. from the University of Florida.==

==Some even suggested gender played a role: "Maybe women look at math problems differently than men."==

==Despite the overwhelming criticism, vos Savant stood firm. She encouraged readers to test it themselves by running simulations. Computer models added evidence to her logical proof, and many critics eventually admitted their error.==

==But this wasn't just about a math problem. The controversy revealed something deeper about how we learn and think.==

## ==Lesson 1: Standardized Schooling Creates Intellectual Passivity==

=="One of the problems is compulsory schooling," vos Savant explains, "Children are sitting there and they are taught and told what to believe. They are passive from the very beginning."==

==The highest measured intelligence in history pinpoints a fundamental contradiction in education: Our system treats all children as identical units in an assembly line, processing them through the same curriculum at the same pace regardless of their unique abilities, interests, or learning styles. Yet children are wildly different from one another—some visual, some verbal, some fast, some methodical, all curious in their own ways.==

==This one-size-fits-all approach doesn't just fail to serve individual needs; it actively damages children's natural learning instincts. Traditional schooling methodically replaces active exploration with passive absorption in the name of standardization.==

==The result? "They never learn to think independently."==

## ==Want to Learn More?==

==Vos Savant's critique of education goes much deeper than this one insight.== ==[On our blog, we explore four additional lessons from the world's smartest person](http://opened.co/blog/whe%E2%80%A6)====, including:==

- ==Why "intellectual aggression" is essential for true intelligence==
- ==How multiple sources create critical thinkers==
- ==The surprising connection between permissiveness and intellectual development==
- ==Why motivation matters more than natural ability==

### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**THE PRESENCE PARADOX**==

==It started with a simple prompt in our \#teachers-bulletin-board on Slack… Megan asked: "How do== _==you==_ ==make it work with kids at home?"==

[![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ab503321-0b7b-4e39-9e85-fec024b24623/Screenshot_2025-05-21_at_9.43.43_AM.png?t=1747845842)](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ab503321-0b7b-4e39-9e85-fec024b24623/Screenshot_2025-05-21_at_9.43.43_AM.png?t=1747845842)

==What followed was a masterclass in collective parenting wisdom on the topic of "being present" with our children.==

==Turns out, the "always be present" mantra might not tell the full story. Our teachers aren't trying to be everywhere at once—they're creating clear boundaries followed by undivided attention.==

==As Liz put it: "I try to be VERY present when not working. So we are actively doing lessons, playing a game (no phone or computer near me), cooking together, whatever it is so that I don’t feel as bad when I do need to be looking at a phone/computer even while they are there.”==

==**Translation**====: Quality beats quantity every time.==

==But here's the plot twist: When those boundaries inevitably collapse (like when Jordan's 3-year-old son chose her big presentation moment for an epic meltdown) something unexpected happens.==

==Instead of disaster, a colleague offered this consolation: "I love when people can see your kids, it humanizes us."==

==So, how do== _==you==_ ==work from home? Reply to this email with your answers!==

==Move over treadmill desks… The greatest workplace innovation of 2025 is happening in minivans, gymnastics studios, and swimming pool bleachers.==

==Working parents have stopped fighting geography and started turning every waiting moment into an opportunity for productivity.==

==Hayley's approach is simple: "Our local gymnastics place has open gym every week for 2 hours, and I just sit there and work while they play."==

==Julie reclaims transit time while her husband drives.==

==We’re witnessing a reimagining of the work "day" as a series of strategic sprints that fit== _==around==_ ==the family’s schedule, not despite it.==

### ==🔨 TOOL==

## ==**THE ENGAGEMENT ARSENAL**==

==The most effective working parents aren't just managing time—they're building systems that make their work periods the highlight of their kids' day. Their secret arsenal:==

==**1. The Special-Occasion Activities Box**==

==Nicole's approach is brilliant: "I have a box full of things she does when I am working, and that is the only time that box comes out. It makes it a little more exciting for her. Some of the things that it includes are puzzles, books, kinetic sand, bubbles, Leapfrog tablet, lacing animals, etc."==

_==Why it works: This limitation creates anticipation rather than deprivation.==_

==**2. The Mess-Permitted Zone**==

==Rachael harnesses children's love of sensory activities: "I set up a fun activity ahead that I know will keep them occupied like bubble foam, mud pit in the yard, kinetic sand, etc. They make a mess, but it buys me an hour of time to work completely uninterrupted."==

==Emily shared one of Rachael's brilliant hacks: "get dry erase markers and have them make a masterpiece on the washer or dryer!"==

_==Why it works: When mess is part of the plan, everyone wins.==_

==**3. The Independence Builder**==

==Hayley shares a game-changing strategy: "A huge flex was teaching them to make their own lunches since a lot of meetings/events fall during those hours."==

==Tammy leverages technology: "We make good use of our Alexa. They add items to the shopping list (better to be on the Alexa list than languishing in mom's memory!) and we use it as an intercom."==

==Becca establishes clear communication: "if mom's door is closed, she is probably on a Zoom call and they need to wait until it is opened."==

_==Why it works: Far beyond just "keeping kids busy," these strategies teach crucial life skills that serve families long after work hours end.==_

==Again, what strategies do== _==you==_ ==use to balance work and parenting?==

### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**BUILDING EDUCATION FROM THE GROUND UP—AROUND YOUR CHILD**==

==After 15 years of helping over 100,000 students, we've learned that parents know their children better than any system or expert. That's why== ==[OpenEd Academy](http://openedacademy.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=opened-academy-the-school-that-adapts-to-your-child-not-the-other-way-around)== ==operates on a completely different premise than other virtual schools. We start with your child—their strengths, interests, learning style, and goals—and build education from there.==

=="What we're trying to build is a buffet," explains Teresa King, CEO of the OpenEd Foundation. "In so many settings, you sit down and you're handed a menu with three choices. What we want is for it to be a buffet where you leave what you don't want and take what you do."==

==This buffet approach changes the game in four key ways:==

==**1. Customized Curriculum Selection -**== ==Choose from multiple curriculum options for each subject based on how your child learns best—visual, text-based, interactive, or hands-on approaches.==

==**2. Flexible Scheduling That Fits YOUR Life -**== =="We're never going to say, 'You signed up for school so every day at two o'clock you better be online,'" Teresa emphasizes. "That doesn't meet the needs of every family."==

==Set your own start and end dates, determine your pace for each subject, and create a schedule that works for YOUR family.==

==**3. Real-World Learning on Their Transcript -**== ==When your teen works as a shift leader, masters a skill through independent study, or completes meaningful community service, that learning counts for transcript credit.==

==**4. Education Built on Trust -**== =="Schools don't typically seem to trust parents," Teresa observes. "What does it look like when a school trusts parents to know their child and then works with them to create the education that would work best for them? That's really where we want to start."==

==The result is education that feels natural, effective, and joyful—because it's actually designed for your unique child.==

### ==📊 TREND==

## ==**THE END OF "SIT STILL AND LISTEN"**==

==Standardized education was designed for a world that no longer exists. Built for assembly line workers, it teaches children to:==

- ==Sit quietly for hours==
- ==Follow directions without question==
- ==Do the same work at the same pace==
- ==Prioritize compliance over creativity==

==Yet the real world of 2025 rewards the opposite: creative thinking, self-direction, adaptability, and personalized skill development.==

==The schools that will thrive in this new landscape are those that can adapt to children's diverse needs, rather than demanding children adapt to them. This doesn't mean abandoning structure—it means creating the right structure for each learner.==
