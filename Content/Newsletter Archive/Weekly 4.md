## 🐴 The 3-day school week (#116)

==Is anyone else's brain still in weekend mode? Same. Perfect time to question why we're still doing school like it's 1903.==

- ==A Post-it note trick that gets kids talking==

### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**Questioning the 30-hour school week**==

==We expect teens to be in class 6+ hours a day, then stack on homework, sports, and college prep. When do they get to explore real careers or earn money?==

==What if instead of defaulting to 5 full days, teens could attend classes 3 days a week and use the other days for work, apprenticeships, or hands-on learning?==

==When teens can work real jobs or complete internships during high school, they make better decisions about their next steps. They can evaluate whether college makes sense for their goals or if they should jump straight into their career.==

==Your teenager's potential isn't measured in classroom hours.==

### ==📊 TREND==

## ==**Same Room, Different Century.**==

==Compare a classroom photo from 2025 with one from 1905. You might notice the tablets on desks or a smartboard instead of chalk. But the core setup – rows of desks, teacher at the front, kids sitting still – hasn't changed in over a century.==

=="Think about that," says former public school principal== ==[Jon England in our latest podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNCnCAzESuY&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-3-day-school-week-116)====.

==The answer, he suggests, lies in a well-intentioned but flawed approach:== ==**trying to be everything to everyone.**== ==Public schools are asked to serve every student, meet every requirement, and follow every regulation.==

==The result? "They do a lot of things, but they don't do a lot of things very well."==

==This leaves passionate teachers with a tough choice: follow the rules or follow their instincts. As England notes, "The good teachers just decide to be civilly disobedient and do what they think is best."==

### ==🛠️ TOOL==

## ==**The Exit Ticket**==

=="Before students can leave class, they have to hand me a 'ticket' – just a quick note showing what they learned,"== ==[says physics teacher Abby Randall](https://www.theteachertoolkit.com/index.php/tool/exit-ticket?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-3-day-school-week-116#:~:text=Use%20this%20technique%20to%20show,lesson%20or%20unit%20of%20instruction.)====. "It takes two minutes, but it reveals exactly what clicked and what didn't."==

==**The concept is beautifully simple:**==

- ==End of learning block==
- ==Quick question or problem==
- ==Short written response==
- ==Instant feedback loop==

==Want to try it at home? Keep a stack of Post-its near your learning space. Before transitioning to the next activity, have the student jot down one thing they learned and one question they still have.==

==It’s not about testing them. It’s about giving kids a low-pressure way to say "I don't get it yet."==

==High schoolers using ChatGPT outperformed peers by 127% during practice... but bombed the actual test.==

### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**Don't Rush to College Just Because You're Bored**==

==I used to hear young people coming to me all the time saying, "I'm bored in high school. I'm itching. I want to do more; I want to move faster." They were ready to jump straight into college.==

==And I would tell them:== _=="You're probably going to be bored in college too."==_

==Instead, think about where you're trying to go. What do you want to learn? What kind of experiences do you want to have? What do you want to discover about yourself and the world?==

==Then, list every possible path to get there in the next few years: college, working, apprenticeships, starting a business, and traveling the world. Look at the costs, what you'd enjoy, what you'd have to tolerate.==

==Then map it out semester by semester: which path moves you closer to your goal?==

==It may be college, but don't assume it's the magic ticket.==

==– Isaac==

## ==**3 Real-World Ways to Teach Kids Financial Literacy**==

==Want to teach your kids about money? Skip the lectures and worksheets. Here are three hands-on approaches that will get them excited and make the lessons stick:==

1. ==**Entrepreneurship:**== ==Isaac’s kids' first business was selling water bottles at a parade. They bought a case wholesale and sold them for $1 each. Nothing teaches margins, value, and honest profit quite like watching people happily pay for something they need exactly when they need it.==
2. ==**Zillow:**== ==Kids love browsing houses online. It sparks natural conversations about costs, interest rates, and how time changes value. "Three years ago, this house was half the price!” “Know why? Interest rates were different..."==
3. ==**“Bank of Dad”:**== ==When kids get money, give them a choice: spend it or put it in the "Bank of Mom/Dad" – a savings account with interest. Watching $100 grow to $105 transforms their thinking about money. Isaac first heard this concept on== ==[a podcast back in 2012](https://www.econtalk.org/owen-on-parenting-money-and-the-first-national-bank-of-dad/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-150k-teenage-side-hustle-119)====, but now there are apps like== ==[GoHenry](https://www.gohenry.com/uk/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-150k-teenage-side-hustle-119)== ==that achieve the same outcome with less setup.==

### ==**(WORD) OF THE DAY**==

## ==**arbitrage**== ==(ahr-bih-trahzh),== _==noun==_==:==

==The practice of profiting from price differences between markets. (Like when a savvy kid buys water bottles at Costco and sells them at a parade – the equivalent of an MBA in middle school.==
