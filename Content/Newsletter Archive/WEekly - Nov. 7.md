## ==00:00 - How Brenna Discovered a Passion for Teaching==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==Welcome back to the Open Ed podcast. I'm your host Ela Richmond, and today I'm joined by Brenna Clarke Gray, an educator, researcher, and podcast host. Can you tell us how you got fascinated by education?==

==**Brenna Clarke Gray:**== ==I started being interested in teaching when I was an undergraduate at Carleton University in Ottawa. Carleton was a leader in supplemental education—these workshops that run alongside courses where students might otherwise fail or withdraw. The model was entirely peer-led. A student who'd done well in the course would run workshops, modeling the skills for success. I loved it immediately. I loved the environment and the philosophy behind it.==

==The Centre for Initiatives in Education did a lot of in-service training for facilitators, teaching us about learning and active learning in particular. The big revelation was that so much of what we do at the post-secondary level is really great for information transfer, but it isn't actually about learning.==

==From there, I decided I was going to be a professor. I did a PhD in English and became a college instructor outside Vancouver for nine years. I was always more interested in the hows and whys of what was happening in the classroom than in my subject material itself. I did all the expected things—publishing articles on Canadian literature and comic books—but what I really enjoyed was talking through rich pedagogical problems with colleagues.==

==I became interested in faculty support. Most of us in post-secondary come with no teaching experience whatsoever. We're subject matter experts, but we're lucky if we've had teaching assistantships or real conversations about teaching and learning. We run into problems in the classroom and have no strategies to deal with them.==

==I was also particularly interested in technology and how it mediates education. A tenure-track job in faculty support became available at Thompson Rivers University, and I took it. Now I'm in the research stream, studying how universities procure technology and why that matters.==

---

## ==02:10 - Information Transfer vs. Real Learning: The Relational Core==

==**Ela:**== ==To bring it to a basic level, parents ask the same questions tech companies do: What do I actually need? What's actually useful?==

==**Brenna:**== ==Exactly.==

==**Ela:**== ==I want to step back to when you were teaching struggling students. What are the basics of good teaching? You mentioned the difference between information transfer and learning.==

==**Brenna:**== ==At its core, teaching and learning is relational work. If you don't have a relationship with the person teaching you—if they don't care about your progress through the material—it becomes pure knowledge transfer. You might as well watch a video lecture because there's no relationality, no connection.==

---

## ==05:30 - Why Active Learning Faces Resistance in Traditional Systems==

==**Brenna:**== ==I've always been really interested in how hard it is to convince people that active learning works. Whether it's project-based learning, gamification, or any method where students engage with material instead of just doing rote work—we know we learn better when actively engaging. But education systems aren't actually conducive to it. If you're lecturing to 400 students, it's nearly impossible to get everybody up and working on a group project.==

==And even in traditional schools, methods are based on compliance. We measure what's easy to measure: attendance, participation, exercises turned in. We haven't typically thought of especially post-secondary education as something that needs to be relational or active.==

---

## ==08:20 - The Compliance Trap: Measuring What's Easy Instead of Learning==

==**Brenna:**== ==Measuring learning is incredibly hard. Measuring compliance is easy. Because of austerity, funding, precarity, and staffing constraints—and just time—we often end up in a situation where we find ourselves looking for what we can measure rather than where the learning is actually taking place. I think we'd all be better off if we acknowledged how hard it is to measure whether somebody has actually learned something.==

==**Ela:**== ==Before you get into teaching, accepting that is something really important. Learning is going to matter much more than these compliance things, and it's going to be hard to measure over time. In my own experience, science class was hands-on and group-based, but I still struggled. When do you know if a student has gaps?==

==**Brenna:**== ==Learning is experimental. You try something, observe what doesn't click, and try to figure it out. Some gaps are foundational—maybe you didn't memorize key things and then couldn't build on them in group projects.==

==Part of this is how we signal value to learners. The content test is weighted most heavily, so students study to the test, not the discipline. Active activities become the "nice to haves," weighted lightly. Learners are smart. They prioritize their time based on what they think matters most. I always told my students: my class might not be your major priority in life, and that's okay. But you're making decisions based on what you think is weighted most heavily.==

---

## ==11:15 - Universal Design for Learning: Multiple Ways to Know and Show==

==**Brenna:**== ==I love Universal Design for Learning as a framework. It's often thought of as an accessibility strategy, but it benefits everyone. It's about multiple ways of sharing information and multiple ways of demonstrating knowledge.==

==I won't just stand and lecture at you. I'll also send you on research exercises where you find information yourself and bring it back to class to discuss. Or I'll show you a video, or maybe a VR walkthrough of a situation.==

==Similarly, I offer lots of different opportunities to show what you've learned. Some learners do best with essays—I'm one of them. I love sharing everything on the page with footnotes for extra details. But it's not for everybody. Many classes assume essay writing ability without actually teaching it within that discipline.==

==Maybe some students learn best in dialogue and relationship. Maybe they should do a group project. Maybe some students hate being on screen—they'd rather die than make a video. So maybe they propose their own project. Maybe testing works for some students.==

==The more different ways I invite learners to share their learning with me, the less likely I am evaluating for things I don't actually care about—like their essay writing ability unless it's an essay writing class, or their video editing skills unless that's the point.==

==Multiple assessment methods also mean students can't just learn to a test. It's not "I need these facts memorized" but "I need to show how I implement and work with these facts." That's hard because it demands multiple ways of sharing information and offering multiple opportunities to demonstrate knowledge. It puts enormous demand on instructors. But even in small ways, if we can offer different units and different modalities so students can shine in different ways connected to their capacities and interests, that helps multiple kinds of learners.==

---

## ==15:45 - The Content Overload Problem: Less Information, More Learning==

==**Ela:**== ==How much time would you recommend spending on a lesson? Teachers have constraints—many students, required curriculum, time limits. How do you decide what to do?==

==**Brenna:**== ==Very few teachers actually get to decide. We work within systems. Even homeschooling works within a 24-hour day. Constraints are always part of teaching.==

==I often think we try to do too much information transfer. We have curriculum standards—often state or provincial—which are hard to challenge. Passionate teachers stack amazing, cool content on top of required material. But we often don't articulate what's core versus what's added. So first, I think most of us should scale back content to have time for students to actually work with material.==

==It's great to say, "I have all this information to share," but if students aren't retaining anything because we're drowning them, did we gain anything? That's a huge piece, and a difficult piece, because we're up against standards and externally mandated facts.==

==**Ela:**== ==If they walk away with one or two pieces as a solid foundation, that's good enough. What would you rather—them knowing those things, or grasping at ten extras? I had a philosophy class recently that was so much content so fast. If I hadn't studied philosophy before, I would have walked away with nothing. If they'd stripped it to bare fundamentals, that would have made sense.==

==**Brenna:**== ==You learn to the test, not for the discipline itself. As teachers, we joke about students asking, "Will this be on the test?" But that joke belies bad signposting. A lost, overwhelmed student asks that question, not one who's kept up. Managing learner overwhelm is huge for learning success.==

==I'm guilty of this. Teaching British survey literature, I'd dump all the historical context before reading Wordsworth. That was too much. But you don't need two hours on the Industrial Revolution to understand that Romantics felt something was lost in England's transformation and wrote nostalgic poetry. We all know that feeling—going back to a place from childhood and finding it's now a Costco. That's Tintern Abbey's vibe. Once you have that, if British history becomes your thing, a whole world opens up. You didn't need drowning information in a survey class.==

---

## ==18:30 - The Pandemic's Missed Opportunity to Redesign Education==

==**Brenna:**== ==The pandemic offered an opportunity. We said: students can't get through this at home alone, or they might miss two weeks. How do we rethink our course material? Scale back. Offer less. Let them do more with it. I hoped we'd recognize that students actually learn more when offered less information. But we just went back to normal.==

---

## ==21:30 - Signals of Value: How Grading Shapes What Students Actually Learn==

==**Ela:**== ==That's fascinating. It comes back to relationship and humanity, right? History matters because the story matters, not because of all the facts. People in the moment didn't know all the facts—they knew the story.==

==**Brenna:**== ==Exactly. Part of the problem with multiple-choice testing as the main assessment method is that the narrative arc gets lost. You focus on high-detail facts, making it hard to assess understanding of the semester's arc or the discipline when drilling down to details.==

---

## ==24:35 - Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation: The Learning Paradox==

==**Ela:**== ==Have you studied motivation? Most teachers get frustrated because the student has to decide they're willing to learn. No matter your teaching style or lesson, if they've decided they're not learning, they won't.==

==**Brenna:**== ==Motivation is a huge frustration. Ways we try to influence it—grades, candy—are extrinsic motivations. We've known for generations that intrinsic motivation is more valuable. When you want to learn something for yourself, you're more motivated.==

==I'm an obsessive Formula One fan. Nobody tests me, but I have a vast catalog of details because it helps me understand races better, making them more fun. That's intrinsic motivation. You can't achieve that in every course for every student because there's a baseline interest level needed. We're in tension: how much do we rely on extrinsic motivation versus how much is that actually killing desire for intrinsic motivation?==

==If I only learn for marks, focusing on details, I may destroy my own intrinsic motivation for the subject. Many students think they dislike subjects in high school, then love them in university or later. Learning to tests, rote exercises, overwhelming content—all of that kills intrinsic motivation.==

==I don't have an answer because it's so difficult to figure out what helps any individual learner, especially early in their journey, develop intrinsic motivation. What I know is that learning to tests, rote exercises, and overwhelming content destroy it. But we're trapped in systems making it hard to resist. I have state-mandated tests. I don't have a choice. Or we're pressured to approach learning a particular way.==

==When I first started teaching, I took attendance because I thought I had to—everyone else did. I hated it and was terrible at it. After five years, I read the attendance policy and realized we could opt not to activate it. I had no idea. What mattered to me was engagement, not whether their body was in the seat. We're sometimes trapped in systems, sometimes just thinking we are.==

==These structures aren't designed for intrinsic motivation. I think knowing the issue and helping students see the bigger picture of the discipline matters. When students make personal connections, that helps. Something might not click now. A student might hate my essay class, then five years later thank me because they used everything in grad school. Motivation and learning don't follow a school-year rhythm. A connection at age 14 might become something they pursue for life. We just don't know. We plant seeds and hope we're not crushing them with education's other structures.==

---

## ==30:10 - Boredom as Fuel: How Her Son Discovered a Lifelong Love of Mythology==

==**Ela:**== ==If we had a single answer, we'd be very wealthy. I'm curious about your take on helping kids become lifelong learners. You have children—how do you instill that internal drive early?==

==**Brenna:**== ==I have an eight-year-old and a one-year-old. Boredom is incredibly important to learning. My eight-year-old loves mythology from anywhere in the world. Stacks of books, mythology podcasts, facts about mythology. Often I'm like, is that true? We're beyond my understanding of basic Greek and Roman mythology, so I just take it on faith.==

==That came from boredom, particularly during pandemic closure. He was three or four, just starting to read. He had time to figure stuff out. Many new interests emerged that became lifelong, like the ancient world. He was reading about ancient Egypt just recently. That didn't come from me—I have no inherent interest in it. But other interests emerged too, like encyclopedic Pokemon knowledge. Do I care about Pokemon? No. Has every fact been against my will? Yes. But by letting kids be bored and find interests, they'll find some you love and some you don't.==

==Giving kids space for boredom is a real strength of homeschooling. This year we've added martial arts and flute, so less boredom time, less searching random facts. I see benefits of commitment—strong discipline, willingness to improve. But there's a trade-off: less time for mythology books and library trips.==

==I've also noticed my kid doesn't want to do school projects about mythology just because he loves it. Nothing kills intrinsic motivation like assigning grades to it. Everybody who's good at a craft, then opens an Etsy store and hates that craft. As soon as you impose external standards on something you loved for its own sake, that kills motivation for a lot of us. Hard for education systems though—do a project on this thing you love, now you hate it and I killed it.==

---

## ==37:00 - Home Culture, Books, and Why Tech Matters Less Than We Think==

==**Ela:**== ==It's that difference between doing something for yourself versus for others. I've talked with Substack writers who love writing until they start writing for what others want to hear. It changes quality and care.==

==**Brenna:**== ==Exactly.==

==**Ela:**== ==I'm curious about the culture of your home. I'm fascinated by subtle things you can do building your home. I've been learning about interior design, and something fascinating is building a space that serves your purposes—making it subconsciously easier to do things you want. I want to read, so I have reading spaces throughout. I read a lot growing up because my parents had books everywhere. When bored, I'd pull a book. What's the learning culture in your home, and how does your family use technology?==

==**Brenna:**== ==I grew up similarly with books everywhere. We had TV, but it wasn't wall-sized. A small black and white TV in one room, one with a VCR in another. TV was there—I watched The Simpsons live—but wasn't the focal point. I've tried doing that in my home. My husband is a big TV guy, but our TV is in the basement. It's our only TV. I noticed when we moved from small apartments with TV in the living room to a townhouse with TV in the basement, the TV never comes on. I don't go down because my husband's office is there and I won't bring a noisy baby to that space.==

==That's exactly what you're saying about home architecture. We're a techy home—I'm an educational technologist with gadgets and devices. But for my kids, my eldest has an iPad primarily for connecting with family across the country via FaceTime. Very useful in the pandemic.==

==But in my house, you see books before tech. I want my kids to understand the world and not feel out of step with times—that's hard on kids. But we read every day. Reading is family life. And podcasts. We listen to so many podcasts. When my kid was babysat and offered TV shows, he asked for his podcast instead. I don't know how that happens except I grew up in a CBC household—Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, always news and information. My brother joked there was a nail through the radio dial. For me, podcasts took that place. I'm comforted by human voices. The culture is lots of talking, listening to people talk, very verbal.==

---

## ==41:20 - Intentional Boundaries: How Her Family Uses Technology==

==**Ela:**== ==You're taking in information, connecting dots. He probably asks questions about podcasts constantly. That makes it easier for mythology to become a default interest. How do you decide what limits to set on tech? What do you intentionally bring in?==

==**Brenna:**== ==It's a hard conversation. Weekdays are easier—time is limited. My eldest gets 20 minutes of screen time after school while eating snacks, unwinding, changing clothes. Largely unsupervised, they have an iPad with Netflix, Disney Plus, Apple Arcade games. I like Apple Arcade—no ads or microtransactions. I feel comfortable giving full access because it's a walled garden. No YouTube unsupervised—that worries me with political radicalization in those spaces. As a family, we watch TV Friday nights with dinner. That's when YouTube comes out, watched together. I've seen tedious Pokemon videos I'd never watch alone, but we do it together because I'm not comfortable with unsecured YouTube.==

==They play video games—Nintendo Switch. My kid loves Pokemon, Animal Crossing, games at that level. He's never been big on peril, so war games and violent content haven't appealed. Lately, with Magic the Gathering passion, he plays World of Warcraft only with his dad. It's not tech-free, but I limit ecosystems we engage with. We don't have smart speakers anymore—I'm concerned about data harvesting. I feel responsible for how much of my children's data escapes into the world. They're not on social media. We don't use their names online. We're careful about how much of their presence exists on the internet before they can meaningfully consent. Sometimes complicated with school, which uses Google ecosystem. We have conversations with teachers about what goes where.==

==I'm resolutely anti-AI. I find generative AI deeply troubling from intellectual property, environmental, and labor rights perspectives.==

# Best Homeschool Math Curriculum | OpenEd (1)

[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e31168e49f5b7e6f76f0e5/690bc23fd10a25559d1aefa5_Gemini_Generated_Image_4oms9y4oms9y4oms.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e31168e49f5b7e6f76f0e5/690bc23fd10a25559d1aefa5_Gemini_Generated_Image_4oms9y4oms9y4oms.png)

==Laura Feller, a mom using OpenEd in Utah, made a confession on== ==[the OpenEd Podcast](https://youtu.be/1zfEhRJq_sI?si=lFFSB8w9KZTKcl1z)====: "Math is not my strong suit. It is where I struggled most in school."==

==She never expected her teenager to reach calculus (after all, she had never taken it herself). She worried she wasn't qualified to teach it; that her own math struggles would somehow transfer to her kids like an inherited curse.==

==Then she found== ==[Math-U-See](https://www.mathusee.com/)====.==

==This curriculum didn't require her to have all the answers. Her son learned through video lessons, and when he occasionally got genuinely stuck, Laura could call the company and someone would actually answer the phone.==

==The lesson to be drawn from this story is not that Math-U-See is the best curriculum for your family. Rather, it's an illustration of a change in the way parents are approaching math—less as frontline instructors who have all the answers, and more as== _==architects==_==.==

==How many parents who would otherwise consider an open education have kept their kids in schools that weren't working simply because they thought they needed a teaching credential? Or because they feared they couldn't teach advanced subjects?==

==Laura's family shows a different way. She didn't need to master calculus herself. She just needed to find resources that could teach it effectively.==

## ==Understanding Homeschool Math Curriculum==

==To be a good architect, you have to understand the job. And the first job is busting a myth: the belief that you either have a math brain or you don't. This myth of the "math person" ranks among America's most damaging educational myths (right up there with the food pyramid and "you'll use cursive every day as an adult.")==

==According to Shalinee Sharma, founder of== ==[Zearn](https://www.zearn.org/)== ==and author of== _==[Math Mind: The Simple Path to Loving Math,](https://about.zearn.org/math-mind-book)==_ =="All humans have an inherent number sense and ability to think mathematically.== ==[Babies only a few days old can distinguish between two and three](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/babies-are-born-with-an-innate-number-sense/)====."==

==Yet somewhere between birth and pre-algebra, things go sideways for many kids. Most often, a child falls behind when they don't fully grasp a foundational concept before their class moves forward. In a traditional classroom setting, a teacher can't pause for individual students, so the child gets moved along anyway—sometimes with remedial options, but only after they've already internalized the belief that they're "not a math person."==

==Moving to a self-paced model is so powerful because it lets you== _==interrupt that pattern==_==. That requires you, as the architect, to make a choice.==

==In the early days of== ==[OpenEd](https://opened.co/)====, founder Matt Bowman and his wife Amy surveyed 92 families with what seemed like a simple question: "What is your favorite core curriculum for math, English, history, and science?"==

==They expected clear winners in each category—something to standardize around. Instead, they got 92 different responses. Even more surprising: different preferences within the same families. One mother had triplet teenage girls. Same DNA, household, and parents. Surely they'd all thrive with the same approach to math, right?==

==It turns out Jane and Jackie loved one curriculum, whereas Julia needed something completely different.==

==If even triplets—sharing identical genetics and environment—require different math approaches, what does that say about a standardized system trying to work for millions of unique children?==

==This was the aha moment. True personalization in education doesn't mean finding the One True Curriculum™ that works for everyone for all time. It means curating the best options and letting parents, teachers, and students choose what works for them—by subject, by grade, by provider, and especially by child.==

==Isaac discovered this principle accidentally as a homeschooled kid. Between ages 4 and 13, he estimates roughly half his time was spent playing with LEGO. His mom felt guilty. So did he—worried "real school kids" would be far ahead.==

==That day never came.==

==His mom would sometimes assign Saxon Math, which he'd complete as fast as possible, not caring or comprehending. He'd grade it with the answer guide and fix errors, but mostly he stared out the window at the excessively fat Squirrels of Milwood running some kind of animal cartel. The fattest was an albino squirrel, probably immortal. He called him The Godsquirrel.==

==Only later did Isaac realize how much more valuable playing with LEGO was than pretending to learn from textbooks. Building entire cities with plastic blocks taught problem-solving, spatial reasoning, and confidence. You want to make a lightsaber but don't have the right pieces? Break some in half and improvise. LEGO building is nothing but complex design problems with constant absence of the right pieces.==

==That's algebra. That's problem-solving.==

==So if every kid is different, what's the common goal? It's not just to memorize rules; it's to develop a deep, intuitive feel for the concepts.==

==In the film== _==Oppenheimer==_==, Neils Bohr captures this idea when he tells the young physicist, "Algebra is like sheet music. It's not important if you can read the music, it's== _==can you hear it==_==... Can you hear the music, Robert?"==

==He’s talking about this intuitive leap. But "hearing the music" isn't magic; it's a specific cognitive skill. All humans process mathematics through visuospatial working memory—the brain's ability to manipulate visual patterns and spatial relationships. Math savants who "see" the math aren't doing anything different; they're just exceptionally skilled at this visuospatial manipulation. This is the skill that predicts mathematical reasoning, and it's the skill you can build.==

==However, everyone builds this skill differently. Some need to see it. Some need to touch it. Some need to hear it explained. Some need all three, just not in the order you'd expect.==

### ==The Three Main Approaches to Math==

==As an architect, your "building materials" fall into three basic philosophical camps:==

==**Mastery-Based Programs**== ==teach one concept at a time until complete understanding, with constant review to maintain mastery. I.e., You don't move to division until multiplication is automatic.==

==Programs like== ==[Saxon Math](https://www.hmhco.com/programs/saxon-math)====,== ==[Math-U-See](https://www.mathusee.com/)====, and== ==[Math Mammoth](https://www.mathmammoth.com/)== ==exemplify this approach.==

==**Conceptual/Visual Programs**== ==prioritize understanding the== _==why==_ ==behind math before the== _==how==_==.== ==[Singapore Math](https://www.singaporemath.com/)== ==uses bar models to make fraction relationships visible.== ==[Beast Academy](https://beastacademy.com/)== ==turns multiplication into puzzles where the operation is the key to solving, not just the assignment.== ==[RightStart Mathematics](https://rightstartmath.com/)== ==builds number sense through hands-on manipulation, and the puzzle-based== ==[ST Math](https://www.stmath.com/)== ==teaches concepts visually without words.==

==These programs follow a concrete-to-pictorial-to-abstract progression: physical manipulatives first, then visual models, then pure symbolic manipulation.==

==**Spiral/Incremental Programs**== ==touch multiple concepts and return to them repeatedly in deeper ways over time. This is the model used by programs like== ==[Horizons Math](https://aop.com/products/horizons-math-box-set-jmc100?_pos=1&_sid=95c6ecad1&_ss=r)====, which builds connections by seeing how addition relates to multiplication relates to fractions relates to algebra. Great for kids who like variety, but can leave gaps if a child doesn't master something before moving on.==

==These three approaches aren't mutually exclusive—they're different tools for different learning styles. Your visual learner might thrive with== ==[Singapore Math](https://www.singaporemath.com/)== ==but prefer== ==[IXL](https://www.ixl.com/)== ==for practice. Your mastery-focused kid might need== ==[Saxon](https://www.hmhco.com/programs/saxon-math)== ==for structure but supplement with== ==[Beast Academy](https://beastacademy.com/)== ==for problem-solving.==

==You can switch mid-year. Math is unusually modular—if== ==[Teaching Textbooks](https://www.teachingtextbooks.com/)== ==isn't working in October, you can switch in November without destroying continuity.==

## ==Kindergarten Homeschool Math Curriculum==

==Your kindergartener's brain processes math through visuospatial working memory.== ==[Dr. Claire Honeycutt](https://x.com/HippyMomPhD)====, a neuroscience researcher who left her tenured position at Arizona State University to homeschool her own children, identifies two key components:== ==**visuospatial manipulation**== ==(recognizing and mentally rotating patterns and images) and== ==**spatial sequencing**== ==(keeping steps and locations in order). Dr. Honeycutt shares her research and homeschooling insights at== ==[ClarifiEd](https://www.clarified.life/)====.==

=="Visual is processing images or patterns," she explains, "while spatial means handling locations or sequences. Together, this means that your brain thinks of math as objects or patterns in different places or sequences."==

==When your five-year-old instantly recognizes there are three blocks without counting, they're using this same visuospatial system that will later handle fractions, geometry, and algebra.==

==At this age, less formal curriculum is often better. Blocks, puzzles, and pattern games are curricula masquerading as toys, building the cognitive architecture math requires.==

==**For Visuospatial Manipulation:**==

- ==**Wooden blocks, magnetic tiles, and LEGOs**== ==– Let children create structures, then ask them to copy it "upside down" or "on its side" to practice mental rotation==
- ==**Puzzles**== ==– Start with 24-piece puzzles and increase complexity==
- ==**Shape sorters**== ==– Create custom sorters with objects that have rotational symmetry for added challenge==
- ==**Mirror play**== ==– Can they build "mirror objects"? Use an actual mirror to help them see reflections==
- ==**Train tracks**== ==– Look for sets with unusual connections. Mix brands and see how kids figure out how to connect them==

==**For Spatial Sequencing:**==

- ==**Simon Says with spatial moves**== ==– "Left, forward, spin" (2-3 moves)==
- ==**Obstacle courses**== ==– Navigate 3-4 moves, then repeat from memory==
- ==**Clapping patterns**== ==– Clap short rhythms, have them repeat exactly==
- ==**Bead patterns**== ==– Make necklaces with 3-4 color patterns, mix them up, rebuild from memory==
- ==**Beginner dance routines**== ==– 3-4 moves in order==

==As Honeycutt puts it: "I know it doesn't seem right but letting your kid become great at origami or model planes will help them be better at math!"==

==Same goes for LEGO. Isaac may not have known it, but he was adhering to the science when he skipped algebra homework in favor of his building sets.==

==**If you want formal curricula**====, the programs from the three philosophical camps all have kindergarten levels.== ==[RightStart](https://rightstartmath.com/)== ==Level A uses manipulatives heavily.== ==[Math-U-See Primer](https://mathusee.com/products/math-u-see-curriculum/primer/)== ==provides video-based instruction.== ==[Singapore Math Kindergarten](https://www.singaporemath.com/)== ==takes a visual, concrete approach. For a gamified, app-based approach, many families also use== ==[Math Seeds](https://mathseeds.com/)== ==for this age.==

## ==Elementary Homeschool Math Curriculum==

==Third through fifth grade is when many kids start deciding they're "not math people." The curriculum you choose can either reinforce that myth or dismantle it.==

==Elementary math must build two things simultaneously: speed and understanding. Your child needs multiplication to be automatic== _==and==_ ==needs to grasp why multiplication works. They need to drill fraction operations== _==and==_ ==understand what fractions actually represent. You can't trade one for the other.==

==**The programs from the three philosophical camps continue through elementary**== ==(====[Singapore](https://www.singaporemath.com/)====,== ==[Math-U-See](https://www.mathusee.com/)====,== ==[Saxon](https://www.hmhco.com/programs/saxon-math)====,== ==[Beast Academy](https://beastacademy.com/)====,== ==[RightStart](https://rightstartmath.com/)====). Choose based on your child's learning style and your family's needs, not on which program is "best."==

==Remember the triplets? This is where their paths diverged. Jane and Jackie thrived with the mastery-based approach of== ==[Math-U-See](https://www.mathusee.com/)====—they needed to own one concept completely before moving on. Julia, however, hated this. She needed variety, multiple concepts at once. Same mom, same family, completely different architecture needed.==

==If your child is already deciding they're "not a math person" because worksheets feel like punishment, this is where AI-adaptive platforms shine by removing the "worksheet" feel:==

==**[Zearn (K-5)](https://www.zearn.org/)**== ==— Free digital lessons serving 1 in 4 elementary students. "If a student gets stuck, the lessons adapt... helping them visualize it," Sharma explains. A RAND Corporation study of 10,000+ students showed students using Zearn gained 11 additional weeks of math learning per school year. Strong research backing.==

==**[DreamBox](https://www.dreambox.com/)**== ==— Intelligent adaptive learning that adjusts to student in real-time. DreamBox analyzes 48,000 data points per hour per student. Research shows students completing 5+ lessons weekly (one hour/week) averaged 30 points more growth than non-users.==

==**[Prodigy Math](https://www.prodigygame.com/)**== ==— Gamified practice with 100+ million registered users battling through fantasy world. The free version includes all curriculum, but the freemium model creates two tiers of students with premium members ($75-360/year) visibly distinguished through exclusive pets and member badges.== 

==**[IXL](https://www.ixl.com/)**== ==— Comprehensive platform with strong research backing (Johns Hopkins study shows effectiveness, especially for Hispanic students, special education, and ELL students). However, student reviews reveal significant anxiety issues. The SmartScore algorithm drops 5-20 points for one wrong answer while adding only 1-3 points for correct answers. Multiple reviews report students "came up to me crying" and being "sent to guidance because IXL is so frustrating." Choose carefully based on child's temperament—high risk for anxiety-prone students despite strong effectiveness data.==

==**[Imagine Math](https://www.imaginelearning.com/products/math/math/)**== ==— Personalized pathways with bilingual support and live tutoring. Particularly effective for students furthest below grade level.==

## ==Middle School Homeschool Math Curriculum==

==The transition from elementary to pre-algebra is where "I'm not a math person" becomes self-fulfilling. But it's also where good curriculum can make the biggest difference.==

==**The core programs continue**== ==(====[Saxon](https://www.hmhco.com/programs/saxon-math)====,== ==[Math-U-See](https://www.mathusee.com/)====,== ==[Singapore](https://www.singaporemath.com/)== ==all have middle school levels). But new options become relevant:==

==**For Independence:**==

==[Teaching Textbooks](https://www.teachingtextbooks.com/)== ==becomes more appealing here. Automated grading, video explanations, less parent involvement needed. It may not be rigorous enough for gifted math students, but for average students needing confidence or busy parents managing multiple children, it can be liberating. Video-based programs like== ==[CTC Math](https://ctcmath.com/)== ==also cover all grade levels (K-12) in one family subscription, allowing students to work independently.==

==**For Challenge-Hungry Kids:**==

==**[Art of Problem Solving (AoPS)](https://artofproblemsolving.com/)**== ==— Problem-solving over procedure. Community of mathematically curious kids. Rigorous, proof-based. Not for everyone, but life-changing for the right student. Since 2015, all USA International Math Olympiad team members have been AoPS students. In 2024, Team USA won first place—all six members AoPS alumni. But AoPS itself warns: students accustomed to 100% accuracy may start answering just 50-60% correctly. This is where you go if your kid is bored by traditional approaches.==

==**AI-Adaptive Platforms:**==

==These create custom learning paths, adapting in real-time:==

==**[Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/)**== ==— AI-powered adaptive learning from elementary through calculus. Uses spaced repetition and mastery-based progression. Internal data claims students progress "4x faster" with some completing calculus in under a year from 6th grade math. However, no formal peer-reviewed studies found—effectiveness claims rest on internal data. Math educators note it "overstates value of procedural fluency" and may not expose weak conceptual understanding until too late. Best as supplement to conceptual resources rather than standalone curriculum.==

==**[Aleks](https://www.aleks.com/)**== ==— AI assessment creates custom path based on knowledge gaps. When ALEKS determines a student is ready to learn a concept, they master it 90-95% of the time—the highest success rate reported. Works well for filling specific holes in understanding.==

==**[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)**== ==— Free, comprehensive. Adaptive practice with instant feedback. Good for review, filling gaps, extra practice. The key metric: 30+ minutes per week leads to 20% greater-than-expected learning gains.==

## ==High School Homeschool Math Curriculum==

==High school is where a parent's confidence in their ability to teach often wavers. You might remember enough long division and basic algebra to guide elementary work. But geometry proofs? Trigonometry? Calculus? That's when panic sets in.==

==When we== ==[spoke with Laura Feller on the OpenEd Podcast](https://youtu.be/1zfEhRJq_sI?si=lFFSB8w9KZTKcl1z)====, her youngest was working through algebra. She explained that== ==[Math-U-See](https://www.mathusee.com/)== ==goes all the way through calculus—a course she'd never taken and never planned to. "My youngest son may get to calculus," she said, "and this curriculum will help him do that because I certainly won't be able to."==

==There's liberation in that statement. Parents don't need to know the math—they need to choose resources that teach it. The video lessons walk both parent and student through concepts together. When Laura gets stuck, she calls and someone answers. Her son isn't limited by her math education.==

==Not every student needs calculus, but algebra proficiency is essential. Sharma's research is clear: "Algebra completion is one of the best predictors of high school and college graduation, getting into college, and future earnings."==

==**The core programs continue through high school**== ==(====[Saxon Advanced Mathematics](https://www.hmhco.com/programs/saxon-math)====,== ==[Math-U-See](https://mathusee.com/)== ==through Calculus,== ==[Art of Problem Solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com/)== ==Algebra through Calculus,== ==[Teaching Textbooks](https://www.teachingtextbooks.com/)== ==through Precalculus).==

==**What's new at this level:**==

==**Specialized Programs:**==

==**[VideoText Algebra](https://www.videotext.com/)**== ==— Particularly strong for algebra specifically.==

==**[Thinkwell](https://www.thinkwell.com/)**== ==— Video-based, college-prep focused. Professor-led lectures.==

==**[Jacobs Geometry](https://www.masterbooks.com/jacobs-geometry)**== ==— Proof-focused, challenging. Excellent for students who struggled with algebra but excel at geometry—they can see the relationships.==

==**Dual Enrollment**== ==— Community college math courses provide high school AND college credit. Built-in credential validation. Access to professors for help. Often more cost-effective than AP courses.==

==**Online High School Courses**== ==—== ==[Derek Owens](https://www.derekowens.com/)====,== ==[Outlier.org](https://www.outlier.org/)==

### =="What If They Fall Behind?"==

==Isaac's son refused to do math for years. He considered it boring and irrelevant.==

==Then at 13, he wanted to attend a part-time school program with friends. The only catch? He needed to be at grade level in math.==

==With sudden motivation, he said, "I'll catch up this summer."==

==Starting at kindergarten level on== ==[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)====, spending just 1-2 hours a day, this teenager who "hated math" caught up to grade level in less than three months.==

==He wasn't a math prodigy. He had his own motivation (not external pressure), the right tools, freedom to progress at his own pace, and no artificial timelines.==

==You can absolutely guide your child through high school math without having taken calculus yourself. Video lessons exist. Answer keys exist. Phone support exists. AI tutors exist. Your job: keep them moving, and find resources when stuck.==

## ==Free Homeschool Math Curriculum==

==For the architect on a budget, free resources are plentiful and powerful. They just require more of your "curation" time.==

_==**[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)**==_ _==**(K-12)**==_ _==— Comprehensive video lessons and practice problems. Weakness: pure lecture format, no physical textbook. Best use: supplement for practice, review, filling gaps. Can work as core for motivated, independent learners.==_

==**[Zearn](https://www.zearn.org/)**== ==**(K-8)**== ==— "Teachers and families can access our full library of digital math lessons for free," Sharma explains. Serves 1 in 4 elementary students and over 1 million middle schoolers. Designed by teachers, research-backed.==

==**[CK-12 Foundation](https://www.ck12.org/)**== ==— Free textbooks, adaptive practice. Comprehensive K-12.==

==**[Math is Fun](https://www.mathsisfun.com/)**== ==— Explanations, worksheets. Good for reference.==

==**YouTube Channels:**==

- ==**[Professor Leonard](https://www.youtube.com/@ProfessorLeonard)**== ==— College-level math explained clearly (Calculus, Statistics, Precalculus)==
- ==**[3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown)**== ==— Visual, intuitive explanations of higher math concepts==
- ==**[PatrickJMT](https://www.youtube.com/@patrickjmt)**== ==— Clear, concise math tutorials covering algebra through calculus==
- ==**[The Organic Chemistry Tutor](https://www.youtube.com/@TheOrganicChemistryTutor)**== ==— Comprehensive tutorials for high school and college math==

==**The Trade-Off:**== ==Free often means you do more curation work. Not worse—just different architectural challenge. Many families use== ==[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)== ==plus== ==[Singapore](https://www.singaporemath.com/)== ==workbooks, or== ==[Zearn](https://www.zearn.org/)== ==plus supplemental problem-solving from other sources.==

==**When to Invest:**== ==When free isn't clicking. When parent support/structure matters. When you need phone support (Laura's== ==[Math-U-See](https://mathusee.com/)== ==experience).==

## ==Tips for Homeschooling Math==

### ==The Architect's Toolkit: 5 Core Strategies==

==**1. Make abstract concepts visual.**== ==Use manipulatives even in upper grades and bar modeling for word problems (a core of the== ==[Singapore Math](https://www.singaporemath.com/)== ==approach). As Shalinee Sharma notes, "Understanding lies in bridging abstract concepts to the concrete and physical world." Consider fractions: Is 1/3 or 1/4 larger? Cut a cake into thirds and fourths. It becomes intuitive—especially for a kid.==

==**2. You're allowed to switch and mix.**== ==Math is modular—if== ==[Teaching Textbooks](https://www.teachingtextbooks.com/)== ==isn't working in October, switch in November. Different kids in the same family can use different programs (remember the triplets). You can even use different programs for different topics:== ==[Singapore](https://www.singaporemath.com/)== ==for conceptual understanding plus== ==[Saxon](https://www.hmhco.com/programs/saxon-math)== ==for practice, or== ==[Beast Academy](https://beastacademy.com/)== ==for problem-solving plus== ==[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)== ==for fluency.==

==**3. Make facts automatic through play.**== ==Math facts need to be automatic, but skip the worksheets. Board games (====[Battleship](https://a.co/d/h7Dppg9)== ==for coordinates), card games (====[multiplication war](https://a.co/d/cgXwurg)====), and apps like== ==[Prodigy](https://www.prodigygame.com/main-en)== ==or== ==[DreamBox](https://www.dreambox.com/)== ==all work. Shalinee Sharma explains that "purposeful practice builds fluency, making basic math processes automatic and freeing mental capacity for complex problem-solving."==

==**4. Leverage AI strategically.**== ==Platforms like== ==[Zearn](https://www.zearn.org/)====,== ==[DreamBox](https://www.dreambox.com/)====, and== ==[Aleks](https://www.aleks.com/?_s=3595466162593171)== ==adapt in real-time to student performance, freeing up parent time. Tools like== ==[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)== ==and== ==[Synthesis Tutor](https://www.synthesis.com/tutor)== ==don't just give answers—they walk through reasoning. Use these to supplement curriculum, not replace human connection.==

==**5. Consider tutoring without guilt.**== ==Einstein famously had tutors. It's not a sign of failure; it's a sign of good architecture. Consider it for topic-specific struggles (fractions, negative numbers), building confidence alongside curriculum, or preparing for high school placement.==

## ==Building Your Math Architecture with OpenEd==

==You don't have to be a math expert, choose one curriculum forever, or re-learn calculus. You just have to be an architect—someone who sees what's available, understands what your child needs, and builds the combination that works.==

==Through OpenEd, you can:==

- ==Access any secular math curriculum (====[Singapore](https://www.singaporemath.com/)====,== ==[Math-U-See](https://www.mathusee.com/)====,== ==[Saxon](https://www.hmhco.com/programs/saxon-math)====,== ==[Beast Academy](https://beastacademy.com/)====,== ==[RightStart](https://rightstartmath.com/)====,== ==[Art of Problem Solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com/)====,== ==[Math Mammoth](https://www.mathmammoth.com/)====, and more)==
- ==Use adaptive platforms (====[Zearn](https://www.zearn.org/)====,== ==[DreamBox](https://www.dreambox.com/)====,== ==[Aleks](https://www.aleks.com/)====,== ==[IXL](https://www.ixl.com/)====,== ==[Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com/)====)==
- ==Access specialized programs (====[VideoText](https://videotext.com/)====,== ==[Thinkwell](https://www.thinkwell.com/)====,== ==[Teaching Textbooks](https://www.teachingtextbooks.com/)====,== ==[CTC Math](https://ctcmath.com/)====)==
- ==Assist with tutoring when needed==
- ==Switch programs if something's not working==
- ==Use different approaches for different kids==

==The "math person" myth is just that: a myth. Every child can develop mathematical ability—they just might need different tools to get there. Your job isn't to be the math expert. It's to be the architect who finds what works.==

==Greetings!==

==An education expert recently published something that's making a lot of parents nervous. Chad Aldeman looked at data from 250,000 kids across 1,400 schools and concluded:== ==[if your child isn't reading on track by kindergarten, don't wait](https://www.chadaldeman.com/p/do-not-wait)====. Act fast. Every week you delay, he says, makes it harder for them to recover later.==

==The data he ushers sounds brutal, but is he interpreting it correctly?==

==Let's dive in.==

==**THOUGHT:**== ==Aldeman's Alarm====**TREND:**== ==Finland FTW====**TOOL:**== ==Read Not Guess==

# ==Aldeman's Alarm==

==[Among kids who started kindergarten on track in reading, 87% stay on track through third grade](https://www.chadaldeman.com/p/do-not-wait)====. But among kids who started kindergarten== _==off track==_==, only 49% caught up by third grade. And of those who were still behind third grade,== _==**only 5% finished on grade level**==_==.==

==In a nutshell,== ==**the earlier a child falls behind, the steeper the hill to climb.**== ==That's why Chad Aldeman is ringing the alarm bell.==

==But should you panic if your first grader isn't reading "at their grade level?"==

==If your child is going to traditional school, maybe. Schools operate on a track system. First grade moves forward regardless of whether every kid has mastered kindergarten skills. If you haven't grasped phonics, you move to the next classroom anyway. Now you're in a room where all instruction assumes reading fluency you don't have. You fall further back. The gap compounds.==

==**But if you have options?**== ==If you can use a self-paced program or homeschool—anything that isn't locked into the tract system—it's different. A kid with mastery-based instruction stays at the phonics lesson until it clicks. Sometimes they're seven or eight when they start reading fluently. But then—they accelerate. The foundation is solid. No gap to close.==

==**[Read Aldeman's full article](https://www.chadaldeman.com/p/do-not-wait)**==

# ==Finland FTW==

==The nail in the coffin for Aldeman's analysis comes from Finland—one of the world's highest-performing education systems.== ==[They don't even start formal schooling until kids reach the age of seven](https://www.npr.org/2014/03/08/287255411/what-the-u-s-can-learn-from-finland-where-school-starts-at-age-7)====.== 

==Even more striking: Finnish schools achieve better results with shorter school days, less homework, and more play-based learning in early years than American schools.== 

==Waldorf schools report the same pattern: students read later, but once they start, they catch up by fourth grade and often become more engaged readers because they have the maturity to understand what they're reading.==

==There's no doubt that kids should be immersed in books, words, and reading from a young age. But let's not panic over arbitrary benchmarks.==

# ==Read Not Guess==

==While we're critiquing Aldeman's premise, his solution is solid.== ==**[Read Not Guess](https://www.readnotguess.com/)**====, the free program he created, is exactly the kind of mastery-based, parent-friendly tool that works within a home-pacing model.==

==Alderman discovered that schools often teach kids to== _==guess==_ ==at words using pictures and context clues instead of teaching them to decode. Read Not Guess fixes that by going back to basics: letter sounds, blending, decoding.==

==Daily lessons take 5-10 minutes. Whether you're schooling from home or trying to help your kid catch up with their peers in the classroom, try a sample lesson at== ==[readnotguess.com](https://www.readnotguess.com/)====—you'll immediately see if your child can identify letter sounds and blend them. That response to instruction is what matters.==

# ==WORD OF THE DAY: Leikki== 

==Leikki (LAY-kee) — In Finland, early childhood education prioritizes leikki—play-based learning—over formal instruction. Count on Finland to dedicate== ==[an entire museum](https://museoleikki.fi/en/)== ==to the concept!==

==[Peter Gray](https://www.petergray.org/)== ==is a retired research psychologist who spent decades studying how children actually learn. His work has become the intellectual foundation for the Self-Directed Education movement, emphasizing how things like== _==play==_ ==are foundational to learning (especially at a young age).==

==In== ==[a recent Substack essay, he asks a puzzling question](https://petergray.substack.com/p/61-my-vision-for-the-future-of-education)====: If children come into the world biologically designed to educate themselves, then what are we doing for $16,000 per child per year on average?==

# ==The Design Flaw==

_=="Children come into the world biologically designed to educate themselves."==_ ==– Peter Gray (====[My Vision for the Future of Education](https://petergray.substack.com/p/61-my-vision-for-the-future-of-education)====)==

==Kids arrive in the world curious, self-motivated, and obsessed with mastering new skills. Their curiosity, playfulness, sociability, and== _==willfulness==_ ==were all shaped by natural selection to serve the function of education.==

==So what do we do? At great expense, we put them in classrooms that shut off their learning instincts—quashing their curiosity, playfulness, sociability, and willfulness—and then condition them through systems of reward and punishment that play on hubris, shame, and fear.==

==We sometimes talk about the need to "take more control" over our kids' education. But what we really mean is this: whatever method, school, or approach you choose, the goal is to create an environment where kids can direct as much of their own education as possible.==

==**[Join the conversation on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/openedhq/posts/pfbid0HuAXjy2Q4PEUcG39rz9ToFR9MTMVgcXSyJzFhX8UPkQcmPHXNAVp9uVPB97B4Mzwl)**==

# ==The Shift Is Happening==

==Peter Gray writes: "The cat is slowly scratching its way out of the bag." More families are figuring this out every year. Companies are dropping degree requirements. College enrollment peaked in 2011 and has been declining since. But what replaces these?==

==Gray's three-phase alternative vision is simple:==

==**Phase I (ages 0-18): Discovery.**== ==Self-chosen play and exploration in age-mixed learning centers. Let kids pursue interests, develop skills, and start thinking about how they'll support themselves as adults.==

==**Phase II: Career exploration.**== ==Before specialized training, work in real settings. Want to be a doctor? Work as a medical assistant first. Interested in law? Spend time in a law office. Find out if you actually like the work before spending years and thousands of dollars training for it.==

==About the author==

==Charlie Deist==

==Charlie Deist (aka “the OpenEd newsletter guy”) is the editor of OpenEd Daily and Head of Content at OpenEd, where he curates compelling thoughts, trends, and tools for parents rethinking education. When he’s not writing or wrangling content calendars, he’s tending to a small homestead in rural Northern California, where he lives with his wife, four kids, and a rotating cast of cows, pigs, and chickens. Most of his best ideas come while hauling feed buckets or chasing animals that found a new way to escape.==
