==**IN THIS EDITION**==

==🍎 The difference between schooling and education  
🍎 Why we can't even predict 2 years into the future anymore  
🍎 3 physics lab resources for home-based learners==

### ==💡 1 THOUGHT==

=="I never let my schooling interfere with my education."==

==– Mark Twain==

==Matt Bowman would agree. In his recent conversation with Deb Fillman on== ==[The Reason We Learn](https://thereasonwelearn.substack.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=twain-was-right-don-t-let-schooling-interfere-with-your-education)== ==podcast, the OpenEd founder puts it this way:==

==**"Schooling is something that is done to you. Education is something that you pursue for a lifetime."**==

==Schooling happens in segments. It's imposed from the outside. But learning?==

==**"Learning happens inside learners, not inside buildings."**==

### ==📊 2 TRENDS==

==**1.**== ==**[WHAT IF AI CHANGES EVERYTHING IN 3 YEARS?](https://ai-2027.com/summary?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=twain-was-right-don-t-let-schooling-interfere-with-your-education)**==

==Matt Bowman told Deb Fillman: "We don't even know what AI will look like two years from now. People aren't even predicting out because it's impossible."==

==Now along comes== ==[AI 2027](https://ai-2027.com/summary?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=twain-was-right-don-t-let-schooling-interfere-with-your-education)== ==— a thought experiment from the AI Futures Project. They ARE attempting to predict it, and while obviously fraught with potential for error, their scenario should make every parent pause:==

- ==2025: AI agents can code and browse the web, but they're buggy and expensive==
- ==2026: Junior programmers lose their jobs while AI managers thrive==
- ==2027: AI becomes better than humans at AI research itself==

==The speed is breathtaking: by the end, what takes humans a year of research happens in a week.==

==Even if the details are wrong, the direction seems clear: massive change that makes memorizing state capitals and solving quadratic equations seem almost quaint.==

==What does education look like when your fifth grader's "future career" might not exist by middle school? When the skills you're drilling today are automated tomorrow?==

==The only answer: Help kids become learners, not schoolers. Teach adaptability over memorization. Focus on judgment, creativity, and ethics — the uniquely human skills that matter when machines can do everything else.==

==**2. GEN Z ISN'T DRINKING**==

==Annual alcohol spending by generation:==
