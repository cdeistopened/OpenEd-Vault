==Michael Gibson, a co-founder of the fellowship, describes being inspired by Elon Musk's approach to engineering: challenge requirements, remove what can't be justified, then optimize what remains. Applied to education, they questioned whether traditional degree requirements actually lead to innovation and success.==

==Critics called it "the most misdirected philanthropy of the decade," but the results suggest otherwise.==

==The program has launched 11 companies worth over $1 billion, including Figma (acquired by Adobe for $20 billion), Ethereum, and Luminar. All this while student debt has ballooned to $1.7 trillion and college costs have increased 1000% in real terms over 40 years.==
