Meta Description: Math teachers are moving away from traditional district curricula, opting instead for customized materials that better suit their teaching styles and student needs. This shift raises concerns among education leaders while highlighting the challenges of standardized educational approaches.
Best Quotes: "1. \"But seriously, math teachers nationwide are going off-script and it's making their bosses nervous.\"2. \"The most effective learning method hasn't changed in hundreds of years: Watch. Practice. Create.\"3. \"Teachers say it's how they survive.\"4. \"The curriculum presented by textbooks does not follow the logical progression of mathematics.\"5. \"We've seen this pattern before. School districts standardize curriculum to guarantee a minimum bar.\"6. \"Bierstadt was living the watch-practice-create method: observe the wilderness firsthand, practice capturing it in sketches, then create something magnificent.\""

# ==**THOUGHT**====: Watch, Practice, Create  
====**TREND**====: Half of math teachers are ignoring district curriculum  
====**TOOL**====: Charlotte Mason-inspired Albert Bierstadt picture studyWatch, Practice, Create==

==The most effective learning method hasn't changed in hundreds of years:==

==Watch. Practice. Create.==

==This apprenticeship model built civilization—observe a master, practice the skill, then create something original.==

==It worked for Michelangelo. It worked for Mozart. It's how your kid learned to walk and ride a bike, and it's how they'll acquire more advanced skills too.==

# ==Everything else is just scaffolding around this basic human learning process.Teachers Ignoring District Curriculum==

==The Hechinger Report shares a survey showing== ==[less than 50% of high school math teachers](https://hechingerreport.org/proof-points-many-high-school-math-teachers-cobble-together-their-own-instructional-materials-from-the-internet-and-elsewhere-a-survey-finds/?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8of_cKHY9k0hUD0KXxADPtx4zpqlvrvZS_Lmre7yZwgjQnEQ_f0kOP0LL7CwxuRaoeHvfn)== ==use their school's recommended materials.==

==The researchers say this a problem. Teachers say it's how they survive.==

==A 33-year veteran math teacher comments: "The curriculum presented by textbooks does not follow the logical progression of mathematics. Instead it is a hodge-podge of concepts that will be tested."==

==Another teacher: "For the last 15 years, I have been using my own written curriculum, with great success. Each skill is built on the mastery of the skill learned before."==

==We've seen this pattern before. School districts standardize curriculum to guarantee a minimum bar. It's supposedly evidence-based. But when it comes in contact with the classroom reality, it falls apart.==

# ==Of course, not every teacher who goes rogue will improve on the recommended materials. And so most schools will remain stuck insisting on the lowest common denominator. 😮‍💨Hold My Bierstadt==

==Some artists paint in comfortable studios. Albert Bierstadt strapped on boots, joined government survey teams, and rode into unmapped wilderness with soldiers and scientists. On his trips to the American frontier, he'd sketch by campfire, then return to New York to paint massive canvases that made viewers gasp.==

==Bierstadt was living the watch-practice-create method: observe the wilderness firsthand, practice capturing it in sketches, then create something magnificent.==

==[19th-century educator Charlotte Mason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Mason?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8of_cKHY9k0hUD0KXxADPtx4zpqlvrvZS_Lmre7yZwgjQnEQ_f0kOP0LL7CwxuRaoeHvfn)== ==understood that kids learn art the same way Bierstadt learned the West—through direct observation. Show a kid a great painting for 5-10 minutes. Let them look, and ask what they notice. In short: you don't need a fine arts degree to instill an artistic sensibility in your child.==
