==Welcome back to the weekly edition of OpenEd Daily!==

## ==💡 THOUGHTS==

### ==Education Beyond the Classroom== ==**🎓**==

==Jon England’s== [==heartfelt mini-manifesto on X==](https://twitter.com/Principal_Jon/status/1852735255792472154?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1852735255792472154%7Ctwgr%5Ef74182c299f285996cb631cb8018298f8fa760ce%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fopened-daily.beehiiv.com%2Fp%2Fnew-post-c7b1&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=082-chores-before-ap-scores) ==reminds us that true education follows curiosity and passion, not just classroom schedules.==

### [==**The Hidden Power of Chores**==](https://opened-daily.beehiiv.com/p/079-the-hidden-value-of-chores) ==🧹==

==Isaac reflected on how his mom’s enforcement of household tasks enabled him to excel where his high school peers struggled. Your child might never use AP Biology again, but their ability to manage time and complete tasks will last forever.==

### ==It’s Like Having a Baby 👶==

==Sometimes, the best gift we can give our children isn’t a stress-free life, but permission to be human. Appropriate vulnerability – sharing our own challenges and failures – can help kids feel less alone in their own struggles.==

## ==📊 TRENDS==

### [==**Tech’s Mixed Report Card**==](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-edtech-revolution-has-failed?r=5d1ba&utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true) ==**💻**==

==New research shows the “EdTech revolution” might not be living up to the hype. While technology shows promise for specific learning needs, throwing computers at education isn’t a magic solution.==

### [==**The AP Score Inflation Crisis**==](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/academic-rigor-is-in-decline-a-college-professor-reflects-on-ap-scores/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=079-the-hidden-value-of-chores) ==📈==

==In just one year, AP U.S. History scores jumped from 25% to 46% scoring 4-5. But are students actually learning more? University professors aren’t so sure.==

### [==**Gen Z’s Identity Quest**==](https://www.humilityanddoxology.com/aestheticore/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=080-3-words-to-transform-conversations-with-your-kids) ==🎨==

==From “dark academia” to “cottagecore,” today’s teens are searching for identity through aesthetics. But as one 17-year-old essayist points out, they need deeper foundations, not just Pinterest boards.==

### [==**Trust Your Parental Instincts**==](https://www.edchoice.org/engage/empowered-parents-navigating-educational-choices-with-confidence/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=081-to-shield-or-to-share-that-is-the-question) ==❤️==

==Stories from MOMCON show that there’s no single “right way” to learn. Whether it’s homeschooling, virtual school, or mix-and-match approaches, parents are increasingly trusting their instincts over institutional pressure.==

## ==⚒️ TOOLS==

### [==**Big History Project**==](https://www.oerproject.com/Big-History?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=078-education-school) ==**🌍**==

==Tired of history being just about “dead people”? This free resource takes students on a 13.8-billion-year journey from the Big Bang to modern civilization. Perfect for science lovers who think history is boring or students who need to see the “big picture.”==

### [==**Teaching Multiple Levels**==](https://classicalconversations.com/blog/how-to-homeschool-multiple-ages-10-helpful-tips/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=079-the-hidden-value-of-chores) ==**📚**==

==Managing kids at different stages? Try these field-tested strategies from the Classical Conversations blog:==

- ==Schedule independent work for older kids during younger ones’ peak times==
- ==Create a “Morning Time” ritual for shared learning==
- ==Think “one-room schoolhouse” – let older kids teach younger ones==
- ==Work in waves throughout the day, starting with youngest learners==

### [==**“Tell Me More” Conversation Starter**==](https://youtu.be/1bboqTABn9c?si=Bsp3qd3iRXXtcEeA&t=2083&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=082-chores-before-ap-scores) ==**🗣️**==

==Cassie Shepherd has stopped asking so many “what” questions in favor of these three magic words:== ==**“Tell me more.”**== ==The prompt opens conversations instead of closing them, lets your child lead the story, and invites deeper sharing.==

### [==**Chrome Music Lab**==](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=081-to-shield-or-to-share-that-is-the-question) ==🎵==

==Turn your browser into a musical playground with this free tool that connects music to math and science. Features like “Song Maker” let kids compose by drawing – it’s like Paint, but for music. No account needed, works on any device, and best of all: it’s free.==
