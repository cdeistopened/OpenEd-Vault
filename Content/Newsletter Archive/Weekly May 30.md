Breakdown: "- Thought: Earn the Privilege- Parents may create entitled children by giving privileges without requiring effort.- Example: A 12-year-old receiving a phone without earning it learns to expect things without effort.- Coach Meg Thomas suggests making privileges contingent on responsibility.- Younger children benefit from instant gratification (e.g., rewards for chores).- Teenagers need to understand delayed gratification.- Tool: The Privilege Contract- For younger kids (ages 5-10): Instant trades- Clean room → Screen time- Finish homework → Park visit- Help with dishes → Choose dessert- For tweens/teens (ages 11+): Earned privileges- Phone = Demonstrate responsible communication for 3 months- Mall trips alone = Master budget tracking + safety protocols- Later bedtime = Consistent morning responsibility- Focus on helping children identify skills to master and celebrate their independence through effort.- Trend: Thinking Beyond the GPA- New USC study indicates that transcendent thinking predicts teen brain development and future happiness more than GPA or IQ.- Emphasis on personal growth and deeper questioning versus compliance in education.- Fourth Segment: Tuttle Twins- Thought: Just in Time vs. Just in Case Learning- Traditional education focuses on memorization for hypothetical scenarios.- Real-world learning is about finding and applying information when needed.- Tool: Tuttle Twins Educational Series- Teaches complex concepts through stories and adventures rather than lectures.- Encourages problem-solving, persistence, and resourcefulness in kids."

## ==**EARN THE PRIVILEGE**==

=="I actually see more parents create entitled children," says homeschooling coach Meg Thomas, mother of seven. "Parents give their kids all of these liberties... without having to work for it."==

==The 12-year-old who gets a phone "just because" learns a dangerous lesson:== _==I deserve things without effort.==_

==Coach Meg’s approach? Make privileges contingent on responsibility. If your 13-year-old wants mall privileges without adult supervision, work with them master necessary skills—like tracking spending and demonstrating trustworthiness.==

==While younger children benefit from instant gratification (clean room, then toys), teenagers (and adults, ahem) need to understand== _==delayed==_ ==gratification.==

### ==📊 TREND==

## ==**THINKING BEYOND THE GPA**==

==Forget GPAs. A new USC study found that "transcendent thinking"—the ability to connect personal experiences to bigger ideas—predicts teen brain development and future happiness, regardless of IQ or socioeconomic status.==

=="You have to go through the work of growing yourself," says researcher Mary Helen Immordino-Yang. Teens who showed more of this thinking had more brain growth over two years, which led directly to greater life satisfaction.==

==The kicker? Our current educational system "actually punish[es]" this kind of deep, questioning thinking in favor of "unquestioning compliance."==

### ==🔨 TOOL==

## ==**THE PRIVILEGE CONTRACT**==

==Transform Meg Thomas's approach into action with a simple Privilege Contract system:==

==**For younger kids (5-10):**== ==Instant trades==

- ==Clean room → Screen time==
- ==Finish homework → Park visit==
- ==Help with dishes → Choose dessert==

==**For tweens/teens (11+):**== ==Earned privileges==

- ==Phone = Demonstrate responsible communication for 3 months==
- ==Mall trips alone = Master budget tracking + safety protocols==
- ==Later bedtime = Consistent morning responsibility==

==**The key:**== =="I want you to win," Meg emphasizes. Work together to identify skills they need to master, then celebrate when they achieve independence through effort.==

==**What's the driving philosophy behind your work with the Libertas Institute, Tuttle Twins, and other initiatives?**==

==If I were to distill it down, it's opening minds. It's getting people to consider things they haven't considered before. It's breaking people free of the conveyor belts that they've been trapped on their whole life.==

==I see a lot of our work as not only helping support different options, but getting parents, getting people to realize, "My gosh, it's a new world. Look at all the abundant opportunities there are."==

==And to step out with a little bit more confidence and courage to go in a different direction than what they may have experienced when they were a student.==

==**You often talk about intentionality in education. What exactly do you mean by that?**==

==You'll remember this Isaac. You contributed a chapter to the book we did a few years ago,== _==[Skip College](https://www.amazon.com/Skip-College-Launch-Without-Distractions/dp/1943521387?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-kids-forget-what-they-learn-in-textbooks)==_==. Most people assume the co-authors are anti-college and want everyone to stop going. The thesis of the book was never to say college is inherently bad. It was to say, “Let's be intentional.”==

==If you're intentional about going to college, there are often much better, cheaper and faster ways to get that degree. Or it may be that that's not your path and you need to go to== ==[Praxis](https://discoverpraxis.com/blog/praxis-joins-libertas-network?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-kids-forget-what-they-learn-in-textbooks)====, or a trade school, or some other model.==

==What I don't want for parents is to just be caught in a trap or on the conveyor belt. If at the end of the day, you're going to put your kids in that same system, great—but do it with eyes wide open. It's not that any particular route is bad, but that you need to be intentional so that you know the cost-benefit analysis.==
