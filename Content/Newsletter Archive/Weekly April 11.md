=="They wanted us to learn reading, writing, and arithmetic, but it wasn't number one," he explains.==

==Rather than seeing being “different” it as a limitation, he flips the script: "You can be homeschooled, you can be the cool kid, and you can break the trends... you're different, but in a good way."==

==Not quite. The feeling of accomplishment was fleeting.==

=="It felt so good... for about 15 seconds,” he says, "But there must come a 16th second. And on that 16th second, I sat down, looked at my silver stole, and thought... 'That's it?'"==

==In our achievement-obsessed culture, we're conditioned to believe that grades, scores, and accolades are the measure of success. But as Martin discovered – as many do – these external markers offer little fulfillment compared to meaningful human connections.==

==The goal of education isn't to create perfect students who reach the "top" at all costs. It's to nurture whole humans who can learn, grow, and build relationships that make life worth living.==

## ==**GRADE LESS, LEARN MORE**==

==Edutopia just published a== ==[research roundup](https://www.edutopia.org/article/why-teachers-should-grade-less-frequently/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=valedictorian-s-confession-that-s-it-the-empty-feeling-at-the-top)== ==with nine compelling reasons that less is more when it comes to grading.==

==A few that caught our attention:==

==**Feedback gets ignored when it comes with a grade.**== ==A 2021 study found that when students see a grade before they see feedback, they're likely to ignore teacher comments entirely. Delay the grade, and students actually engage with how to improve.==

==**Grades create artificial endpoints.**== ==That A or C stamp signals "learning complete" – even when it's just beginning. Creating more low-stakes practice opportunities and fewer high-stakes assessments helps students embrace the journey, not just the destination.==

==**Peer assessment accelerates growth.**== ==Students who evaluate their own or others' work exhibited "significantly better academic performance" across all age groups. It turns out, the act of grading itself is a powerful learning opportunity.==

## ==**BEYOND THE ‘FIVE PILLARS’**==

==When a principal saw minimal improvement in reading scores despite implementing science-backed phonics instruction, she was bewildered.==

==[Reading researchers Catts and Kamhi explain why](https://www.aft.org/ae/winter2024-2025/catts_kamhi?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-john-taylor-gatto-quit)====: we've misunderstood comprehension. Unlike phonics and fluency, comprehension isn't a skill but== _==a complex ability dependent on knowledge.==_

==Their solution? Teach comprehension through content-rich curricula in science, history, and the arts. North Carolina schools that implemented this approach saw significantly better standardized reading test scores, with gains sustained over time.==

==Meaningful learning happens when reading connects to content that builds knowledge systematically. The question shifts from "How well can my child read?" to "How much is my child learning from what they read?"==

==Need simple rules to cut through complex decisions? Mental razors are elegant thinking tools that eliminate bad options and clarify choices.==

==Here are five powerful razors for your parental toolkit:==

==**The Feynman Razor:**== ==If you can't explain it to a 5-year-old, you don't understand it. Perfect for checking whether you truly grasp a concept before teaching it.==

==**The Rooms Razor:**== ==Choose environments where you're likely to be the least knowledgeable person. This creates optimal conditions for learning.==

==**The Gratitude Razor:**== ==When in doubt, show more gratitude to people who have mentored or supported you.==

==**The Uphill Decision Razor:**== ==Choose the option that's more difficult in the short-term. The path of resistance often leads to greater rewards.==

==**The Lion Razor:**== ==To do creative work, be a lion: Sprint when inspired. Rest. Repeat. Don't force creativity on a schedule.==

==Which razors have you found most helpful in making educational decisions?==
