==Happy Friday!==

==Well, we’ve made it through another week of questioning everything we thought we knew about education. If you’ve been following along, your brain might be a bit sore from all the mental gymnastics. Don’t worry, unlike Simone Biles, you won’t be graded on your performance.==

==We’ve covered everything from why LeBron James would be a D student to why treating education like a one-size-fits-all commodity makes about as much sense as Spotify only offering one playlist for every subscriber.==

==**In this edition:**== 

- ==What if we graded LeBron like a student? 🏀==
- ==The great unbundling of education 🎓==
- ==Redefining “back-to-school” for open learners 🏠==
- ==AI, edupreneurs, and brain-boosting audiobooks 🤖==

### ==Let’s recap the madness, shall we?==

### ==Grading LeBron James: A New Perspective on Academic Success==

[==Matt Bowman challenged our traditional grading system==](https://opened.co/blog/beyond-a-to-f/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-opened-weekly-rethinking-education-from-lebron-to-back-to-school) ==with a provocative question: What if we applied academic standards to sports legends? A few data points:==

- ==Roger Federer won 80% of matches but only 54% of points (F)==
- ==LeBron James’ all-star stats would earn mostly F’s – maybe a few D’s==
- ==Even Simone Biles’ unprecedented Olympic success rate would earn her a failing grade==

==The lesson? Rigid grading scales often fail to capture real-world excellence. Matt introduces competency-based education (CBE) as a potential solution that better reflects the way people learn and succeed in the real world.==

### ==The Great Unbundling: Customizing Education for the 21st Century==

==In== [==our latest podcast episode==](https://opened.co/podcast/%f0%9f%8e%99%ef%b8%8fepisode-004-the-great-unbundling-with-michael-horn/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-opened-weekly-rethinking-education-from-lebron-to-back-to-school)==, Michael B. Horn, co-founder of the Clayton Christensen Institute, discusses the “unbundling” one-size-fits-all schooling is becoming obsolete.==

==**Highlights:**==

- ==The daunting challenge of customizing education (and why many parents default to a single provider)==
- ==How Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) are opening doors… but also creating decision paralysis==
- ==Why Utah parents are more comfortable with the ‘mix-and-match’ approach==

==**The future of education is already here; it’s just unevenly distributed.**==

### ==Redefining “Back-to-School” for Open Learners==

==As traditional schools gear up for fall, we explored how open educators can create meaningful transitions and learning spaces without rigid schedules.==

==**Ideas we loved:**==

- ==Creating cozy reading nooks or nature observation spots==
- ==Starting the year with educational gifts (==[==homework caddy, anyone?==](https://www.instagram.com/p/C-LasiwuKG2/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=redefining-back-to-school)==)==
- ==Creative ways to capture learning goals and aspirations==

==Remember, it’s about inspiring curiosity and joy, not recreating a classroom at home.==
