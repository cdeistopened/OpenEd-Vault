==Welcome back to the weekly edition of OpenEd Daily!==

## ==💡 THOUGHTS==

### [==**What Comes First: The Lessons or the Test?**==](https://twitter.com/stijnnoorman/status/1853478706817163760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1853478706817163760%7Ctwgr%5E9679f5afb87534313719e63ac1285a40b68e00a4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fopened-daily.beehiiv.com%2Fp%2Fnew-post-1b5f&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=roadschoolers-rebels-rooftop-classes)

==Life itself is often our greatest teacher. Some call it the school of hard knocks – we just call it life. Traditional education often starts with lessons before testing knowledge, but real-world learning often works in reverse.==

### [==**Try Different, Not Harder**==](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-019-qa-adhd-social-skills-making-hard-choices-in-alternative-education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=074-try-different-not-harder)

==When our kids struggle, our first instinct is often to say “try harder.” But OpenEd VP of Learning Andrea Fife suggests a different approach: “If what you’re doing isn’t working, don’t just try harder – try something different.”==

### [==**You Won’t Ruin Your Kids**==](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-020-the-secret-to-not-ruining-your-homeschool-kids-veteran-moms-20-year-journey/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=076-the-four-hour-revolution)

==After homeschooling six kids over two decades, Sandy Grant shares a vital message for anxious parents: “No matter what curriculum you’re using, no matter whether you’re an unschooler or an online schooler, whatever you’re doing, as long as you keep trying, you won’t ruin your kids.”==

## ==📊 TRENDS==

### [==**The Tutoring Boom**==](https://edworkingpapers.com/sites/default/files/ai21-367_0.pdf?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=073-what-comes-first-the-lessons-or-the-test)

==Over half of tutoring centers cluster in the wealthiest 20% of school districts. But new alternatives are democratizing access: online platforms, AI tutors like Khanmigo, and community learning pods where families pool resources and expertise.==

### [==**The New Math**==](https://theconversation.com/computer-science-now-counts-as-math-credit-in-most-states-is-this-a-good-idea-123424?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=074-try-different-not-harder)

==States are counting coding as math credit. It’s opening doors for students who struggle with traditional math – turning abstract formulas into practical problem-solving through computer science.==

### [==**The Rise of “Roadschooling**==](https://simplehomeschool.net/life-of-a-roadschooler/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=075-how-to-create-a-high-school-transcript)==“==

==The Douse family turned Spain into their classroom. Morning academics, afternoon adventures: surfing for PE, market visits for Spanish practice, architecture tours for art history. The world is becoming the new classroom.==

### [==**The New Career Navigation Crisis**==](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2024/11/05/empowering-students-to-bridge-the-gap-between-high-school-and-career-success/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=076-the-four-hour-revolution)

==Today’s students face endless career possibilities but minimal guidance. With counselors averaging 408 students each, schools can’t keep up. Sierra College’s solution: mapping local job data directly to course offerings, showing students exactly where their education leads.==

## ==⚒️ TOOLS==

### [==**Khanmigo: Your AI Study Buddy**==](https://www.khanmigo.ai/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=073-what-comes-first-the-lessons-or-the-test)

==Khan Academy’s new AI tutor guides without giving answers away. It walks students through problems step-by-step, supports writing processes, engages in debates, and even role-plays historical figures. Unlike generic chatbots, it’s built specifically for learning.==

### [==**The Attention Span Calculator**==](https://visionreadingacademy.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=071-is-reading-a-struggle-check-for-these-signs)

==Quick rule: multiply age by 5 minutes for maximum focus time. But you can double it with engaging content. Add movement or music, remove distractions, rate task difficulty together, and take body breaks between sessions.==

### [==**The “Translation Method” for Transcripts**==](http://code.org/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=072-weekly-roundup-from-bullies-to-night-owls)

==Turn real-world learning into academic credits. Nature journaling becomes “Biology with Lab,” Civil War reenactments become “U.S. History.” Pro tip: save creative course names for family records, use conventional titles for official documents.==

### [==**The Four-Hour School Day [WATCH]**==](https://youtu.be/762cE8SJRyM?si=OTiO6q82ymoH6Opj&t=1626&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=roadschoolers-rebels-rooftop-classes)

==Strip away the busywork and most core academics fit in 4 hours. Morning block tackles the heavy lifting (math, reading, writing), afternoon opens up for independent work and projects. The rest of the day? That’s for real-world learning.==

==The world is discovering the power of personalized learning!==

==That’s all for this week, folks! Have a great weekend.==
