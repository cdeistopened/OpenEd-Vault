==The sign, at least, is correct. You need to be able to do basic math in your head quickly or you aren’t really numerate. You can’t make decisions with numbers.==

## ==**IS THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BEING ABOLISHED?**==

==**Short answer:**== ==No (or at least, not yet).==

==**Longer answer:**== ==A== ==[recent executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/improving-education-outcomes-by-empowering-parents-states-and-communities/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nobel-prize-winner-i-don-t-believe-in-honors)== ==created plenty of dramatic headlines, appearing to herald the closure of the Department of Education, but the reality is far less radical. While staffing has been reduced, the Department of Education continues to operate.==

==By and large, the real changes in education aren’t happening through department reorganizations or policy debates. They’re happening through individual families discovering they have the power to build learning environments tailored to their children's needs—regardless of what happens in Washington.==

==While the database excels at identifying whether materials align with Common Core standards (the project's original purpose), finding resources based on other important criteria can be challenging.

==When Ansel Adams was 12, his father made the courageous decision to remove him from traditional school entirely, giving him instead a year's pass to the 1915 World's Fair and telling him "that would be his school."==

==We’re all born with this "internal spark.” But too often it’s extinguished by rigid schedules, standardized expectations, and emphasis on external validation.==

==The courage to protect your child's spark can be hard to muster against conventional wisdom about what "proper" education looks like (especially in the early years).==

## ==**RETHINKING "KINDERGARTEN READINESS"**==

==If your five-year-old isn't mastering Mandarin while coding an app between violin practice and advanced fractions, clearly they're falling behind—at least if you let certain Pinterest-perfect social media influencers set your expectations for what’s normal.==

==But what does the research actually say about early childhood education?==

==Our== ==[latest blog post](https://opened.co/blog/homeschool-kindergarten-curriculum/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-ansel-adams-father-pulled-him-out-of-school)== ==challenges the conventional "kindergarten readiness" narrative and explores an alternative approach.==

==Rather than asking whether your child is ready for a particular curriculum, consider whether your educational approach is ready to meet your unique child where they are.==

==Dr. Raymond Moore, one of homeschooling's pioneering researchers, spent decades studying child development and concluded: "Many children are not developmentally ready for formal academics until age 8-10. Pushing academics too early can create unnecessary frustration and may actually delay a child's progress."==

==We’re not suggesting you wait until fifth grade to begin formal academics, but it’s worth considering what 5-6 year olds actually need developmentally.==

### ==🛠️ TOOL==

## ==**THE THREE C'S OF EFFECTIVE LEARNING**==

==Creating a personalized learning environment doesn't happen by chance. We've observed that meaningful education consistently happens at the intersection of three critical elements—what we call the "Three C's":==

==**1. Choice:**== ==Real agency over how, what, and when learning happens. Psychology professor Dan Ariely has found that a person's willingness to work hard at something is directly tied to how meaningful they perceive the task to be.==

==**2. Competency:**== ==Adequate time, resources, and support to develop and master key skills at an individual pace. This means measuring progress against personal growth rather than arbitrary grade-level expectations.==

==**3. Connection:**== ==Learning topics that actually matter to the learner and spark genuine curiosity.==

==These principles become especially powerful in the early years when children are forming their fundamental relationship with learning itself.==

=="We have a society dedicated to making sure children won't have to deal with anything scary," Skenazy explains. "What they're not getting is the opportunity to face little problems along the way and realize 'oh that wasn't so bad.'"==

==We're seeing the consequences of well-intentioned overprotection far beyond childhood. College counselors report skyrocketing anxiety rates among students who've never learned to navigate uncertainty independently, and employers encounter young adults unable to handle basic workplace conflicts.==

==The most powerful protection we can give our children is to equip them to handle struggles confidently when they arise.==

==When Cassie Tinsmon watched her daughter's learning transform in the company of peers, she discovered that learning is fundamentally social.==

=="I watched how her curiosity changed when other kids were around. She engaged a lot more."==

==Humans are wired to learn through social connection, mimicry, and collaborative problem-solving. It's why her homeschool collective builds learning around interactive "spark sessions" instead of isolated workbooks.==

==Want to harness this power without building an entire school? Here's a 5-step startup plan:==

==**1. Recruit your minimum viable community**== ==Find 2-3 families with complementary strengths and compatible values. You don't need an army—just enough diversity of perspective to create what Cassie calls "spark."==

==**2. Establish a consistent rhythm**== ==Weekly is ideal, but bi-weekly works too. Consistency matters more than frequency. Pick a day and time and protect it religiously.==

==**3. Share the load through rotation**== ==Take turns planning, teaching, and hosting. This prevents burnout and leverages each parent's unique expertise.==

==**4. Start with integrative themes**== ==Choose topics that naturally connect multiple subjects. Cassie's example: basketball incorporates math, design, writing, and physical education without artificial divisions.==

==**5. Balance structure with freedom**== ==Intentional activities provide focus, but leave ample room for the magic that happens when curious minds interact without constant adult direction.==

==The payoff? Children who learn from diverse perspectives, parents who share the educational load, and a support network that makes the homeschool journey sustainable.==
