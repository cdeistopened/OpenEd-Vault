==This is what learning looks like—not the polished Neil Armstrong moment we remember.==

==Every master was once a disaster. Show your kids the disasters.==

==**2.**== ==**[THE "CAGED ANIMAL" APPROACH TO AI IN EDUCATION](https://www.pcmag.com/opinions/rebindai-ai-book-annotation-surprised-me?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=print-books-beat-screens-for-memory)**== ==- PCMag's Will Greenwald calls AI a "caged animal" that should be "carefully watched and fed, only trusted when handled by professionals, and kept away from kids"—yet he found one exception worth praising.== ==[Rebind.ai](https://rebind.ai/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=print-books-beat-screens-for-memory)== ==eliminates AI hallucination by constraining responses to actual recorded interviews with scholars.

### ==🔨 3 TOOLS==

==**1. George Orwell's Writing Cure**== ==- Many schools teach kids to write like Victorian novelists when they should teach them to write like Hemingway. Orwell's 1946 essay== ==**["Politics and the English Language"](https://t.co/21y1vWXb5z?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=print-books-beat-screens-for-memory)**== ==cuts through 12 years of bad English instruction with six simple rules.

==**2.**== ==**[How Writing Should Be Taught in School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tIcxPxL52E&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=print-books-beat-screens-for-memory)**== ==- Ellen Fishbein tells Hannah Frankman we’ve been teaching writing backwards. Kids who speak brilliantly write like robots because we make them outline before they think. Their solution? Let them write messy first, clean up later.==

==**3.**== ==**[Rebind AI-Enhanced Classics](https://www.rebind.ai/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=print-books-beat-screens-for-memory)**== ==- $30 per book gets you Roxane Gay explaining Wharton or Margaret Atwood unpacking Dickens. No app needed. Works on any device. Founded by a philosopher and a plumbing heir who couldn't get through Heidegger alone. Now 100+ classics available with expert guides baked in.==
