==**IN THIS EDITION**==

==🍎 The mom who discovered she wasn't as essential as she thought  
🍎 Free Play Fridays spread as antidote to over-structured childhoods  
🍎 Three tools for natural, hands-on learning at home==

### ==💡 1 THOUGHT==

## ==**I THOUGHT I HAD TO BE TEACHING MY KIDS ALL. THE. TIME.**==

==In a recent article for the Let Grow Foundation, homeschool mom Abigail Weidmer shared her journey from over-teaching to embracing free play. During her first year homeschooling kindergarten, she felt immense pressure to teach everything: reading, math, music, art, STEM, emotional health, money management.==

==Then she had a realization:==

=="I was not as essential to my child's education as I thought I was."==

==The breakthrough? Walking downstairs to find her daughter had created a space museum—complete with solar system map, rocket crafting station, and guided tours—all without adult instruction.==

=="My kids actually learned more when I did less."==

### ==📊 2 TRENDS==

==**1.**== ==**[THE UNSTRUCTURED PLAY MOVEMENT](https://letgrow.org/program/anxious-generation/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=my-kids-learned-more-when-i-backed-off#:~:text=TO%20THERAPY%20PAGE-,FREE%20PLAY%20FRIDAYS,-Every%20Friday%20from)**== _==(Let Grow Foundation)==_

==Schools and neighborhood play clubs are blocking off Friday afternoons for unstructured play. The Free Play Fridays program, launched by the Let Grow Foundation, designates 2-3 hours where kids get minimal supervision and maximum freedom. No lesson plans. No adult-led activities. Just basic safety rules and access to simple materials like balls, art supplies, and building blocks.==

==Schools report dramatic improvements in social skills, conflict resolution, and even academic focus during regular class time. In Philadelphia, one elementary school saw playground behavior incidents drop 30% after implementing the program.==

==Neighborhood play clubs are adopting the same model, with families rotating hosting duties while adults deliberately stay hands-off.==

==**2.**== ==**[THE FORGOTTEN SCIENCE OF LIGHT IN EDUCATION](https://x.com/BrianRoemmele/status/1921952763044663332?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=my-kids-learned-more-when-i-backed-off)**== _==(Brian Roemmele on X)==_

==A short film from the 1970s shows something surprising: kids in a classroom calm down and focus—just by changing the lighting.==

==The film was made by Dr. John Ott, who believed that natural, full-spectrum light helps our bodies and minds work better. He even said bad lighting could affect us like poor nutrition.==

==His early tests claimed full-spectrum lights helped students focus and boosted test scores—sometimes by over 30%.==

==Today we often resort to medication. But maybe the light matters more than we think.==
