==Greetings!==

==A few months ago, an OpenEd parent reached out with a familiar dilemma.== ==[Her student had done 9th grade on the diploma path, but she was switching to non-diploma-seeking status for more flexibility](https://opened.co/blog/to-diploma-or-not-to-diploma)====.==

==Yet she had still had some concerns. "I worry a lot about not following the traditional, earn a diploma and go to college path."==

==Society has pushed one linear path for so long: diploma → college → job → success.==

==Except that path is just one among many. This week, we came across a story that helps clarify the "diploma vs. no diploma" question.==

==Let's dive in.==

==**THOUGHT:**== ==Education as a Canvas, Not a Checklist====**TREND:**== ==When Employers Don't Understand Homeschooling====**TOOL:**== ==How to Create a Valid Diploma==

# ==Education as a Canvas, Not a Checklist==

==Here's what we've been told: Follow the traditional path or risk your child's future. Get the diploma. Check the box. Move to the next checkpoint.==

==But== ==[sometimes seeking a diploma imposes limits that exceed its value](https://opened.co/blog/to-diploma-or-not-to-diploma)====.==

==What's more, the definition of a "traditional path" is becoming more and more slippery. Colleges and employers care more about demonstrated skills, portfolios of work, and real-world experience.==

==A diploma proves you can complete requirements. A portfolio proves you can do something useful. Approach education as a canvas for growth, not a checklist of requirements.==

# ==When Employers Don't  Understand Homeschooling==

==James Isabele Jr. began working in manufacturing shortly after graduating high school. 15 years later, he had certifications in inventory management, shipping and receiving, and forklift operation—everything required for a new job opportunity that came up. The interviewer loved his experience and everything seemed to be going well... until they asked for his "state-issued homeschool diploma."==

==[James called the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), which sent a letter to the company noting that there's no such thing as a "state-issued homeschool diploma" in most states](https://hslda.org/post/employer-asks-homeschool-grad-for-state-issued-diploma-it-doesn-t-exist)====. Instead,== _==parents==_ ==are empowered to issue diplomas.==

==Lucky for James, his mom had kept records and documented his entire high school program. Shortly after receiving HSLDA's letter with those documents attached, James got the job.==

==**The lesson**====: Keep records. Keep transcripts. Even if your teen isn't going for a diploma now, these might come in handy!==

# ==How to Create a Valid Diploma==

==If you wish to issue a diploma yourself, here are some options:==

==**Quick DIY**====: Canva (search "homeschool diploma"), Google Docs templates, Twinkl==

==**Professional print**====:== ==[HomeschoolDiploma.com](http://homeschooldiploma.com/)== ==(starts at $34.99), DiplomaPrints==

==**What to include**====: School name, student's full name, graduation statement & date, parent signatures, optional seal==

==**California note**====: Most CA homeschoolers use a Private School Affidavit (PSA)—you're legally a private school and can issue diplomas.==

==**Need a notary?**== ==Generally no. Transcripts and signatures matter more.==

==For more on diploma-seeking vs. non-diploma paths within OpenEd, early college credits, and life after high school:== ==[To Diploma or Not to Diploma?](https://opened.co/blog/to-diploma-or-not-to-diploma)== ==OpenEd's diploma-seeking specialists can provide personalized guidance based on your goals.==

# ==WORD OF THE DAY==

==**Credentialism**== ==(noun): The practice of overemphasizing credentials—especially academic degrees—in hiring and admissions, often at the expense of practical skills or real-world experience.==

==**Example**====: "James had 15 years of proven manufacturing experience, but credentialism nearly cost him the job when compliance fixated on a diploma that doesn't exist."==
