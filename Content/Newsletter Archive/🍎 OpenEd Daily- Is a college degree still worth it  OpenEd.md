==One of the most common worries we hear from parents is around college readiness.==

- ==Am I doing enough to prepare my child?==
- ==Will he/she be competitive with other applicants if they don’t have a traditional diploma?==
- ==Is college even worth the price of admission these days?==

==**Let’s explore…**==

### ==In this edition:==

- ==📜 What’s a diploma worth without the skills to back it up?==
- ==🎓 How do homeschooler’s get into college?==
- ==🚀 Early College Programs: Earning Your Degree While Still in High School==

==Before getting into the advantages homeschoolers often have in college admissions (including the flexibility to take college courses early), let’s take a step back and ask: Is college the best path for everyone?==

==Here’s a sobering stat:== ==**52% of college graduates are underemployed.**==

==Now, let’s get real about what a degree actually does for you in the job market. Outside of fields where it’s legally required? Not much. There are often better ways to showcase your skills to employers. (====**Pro tip:**== ==Send a video pitch demonstrating your abilities. Nine times out of ten, they won’t even ask about your degree.)==

==So why the near-universal push for college? Often, it’s parents feeling the heat pressure to signal to society they did a good job.==

==There are plenty of good reasons to go to college, but social pressure isn’t one of them!==

==Make sure you know what your goals are and whether it’s truly the best way to reach them.==

### ==🎓 College Admissions Myth-Busting: Homeschoolers Edition==

==If your child is determined to go to college, the question arises…== [==how do homeschoolers get in?==](https://www.joinprisma.com/blog/how-do-homeschoolers-get-into-college?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=is-a-college-degree-still-worth-it) ==The Prisma blog debunks the myth that you need a traditional diploma to stand out in admissions. A few datapoints:==

- ==Homeschoolers graduate college at a 10% higher rate than public school peers==
- ==UNC Chapel Hill admits 47% of homeschoolers vs 17% overall admission rate==
- ==Homeschoolers are also well-represented at Ivy League schools like Yale, Harvard, and MIT==

==Beyond test scores and an official-looking transcript, colleges are increasingly interested in “spiky” applicants. But what does that mean?==

==A “spiky” application showcases deep expertise or passion in a specific area, rather than being well-rounded but average across the board.==

==**For example:**==

- ==A student who’s published research on local water quality==
- ==An aspiring filmmaker with a portfolio of short films and festival submissions==
- ==A budding entrepreneur who’s already launched a small business==

==So instead of forcing your 14 year old into weekend SAT prep classes, consider encouraging them to start a portfolio showcasing their projects and passions or seek out mentorship or internships in their field of interest==

==Use the flexibility of an open education to develop these distinctive “spikes” – they might just be their secret weapon.==
