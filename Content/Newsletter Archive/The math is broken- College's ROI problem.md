==His answer isn't anti-college, but pro-analysis: "My point of view on college is based on unemotional math." For decades, college was ROI-positive for most careers because a degree guaranteed returns. That reality has shifted for many—though not all—fields.==

==Gary acknowledges that certain professions still require degrees: "Do you need a degree for certain professions if you want to be a doctor, lawyer? I understand all that."==

==Today's question isn't whether college is universally "good" or "bad" – it's whether the specific investment matches your child's desired outcome. Each family needs to calculate their own ROI equation.==

==Meanwhile, as colleges face enrollment challenges and== [==campuses close at record rates==](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/a-new-problem-with-four-year-degrees-the-surge-in-college-closures-7f68c4aa?st=fnry5247fjnwzew&reflink=article_email_share&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-math-is-broken-college-s-roi-problem)==, it's worth having this honest conversation before making a $200,000 decision.==

==When OpenEd CEO Isaac Morehouse created== [==Praxis==](https://discoverpraxis.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-math-is-broken-college-s-roi-problem) ==over a decade ago, he had a radical idea: you don't need a college degree to build an awesome career.==

==Hundreds of students later, the results speak for themselves. Through 6-month apprenticeships with growing companies, Praxis participants get real skills, actual experience, and a job. No debt required.==
