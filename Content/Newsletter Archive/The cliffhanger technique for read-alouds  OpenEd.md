### ==Memory: Storeroom or Showroom?==

[==A recent article by Master Teacher Mr. Steven Battaglia on the Hillsdale K-12 blog==](https://k12blog.hillsdale.edu/thoughts-on-memory-for-assimilation/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=044-the-cliffhanger-technique-for-read-alouds) ==highlights two distinct types of memory:==

==**Memory for “Memory Work”**==

==**Memory for**== ==_**Assimilation**_==

==Short-term== ==_recall_==

==Long-term== ==_understanding_==

==Isolated== ==_facts_==

==Connected== ==_knowledge_==

==For passing== ==_tests_==

==For gaining== ==_wisdom_==

==Real learning isn’t about filling a bucket with facts, but lighting a fire of understanding. When we ask students to “retell the history of the Vietnam War” instead of just listing outcomes, we train them to assimilate and connect dots, not just collect them.==

### ==The Great Testing Shell Game Continues==

==Remember when “No Child Left Behind” promised 100% proficiency by 2014? Well, it’s 2024, and states are still playing musical chairs with testing standards. Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Alaska, and New York are lowering their proficiency benchmarks. Translation? More kids magically become “proficient” overnight!==

==It’s like watching a high-stakes game of limbo – how low can you go?==

==Some officials claim these changes provide a “more accurate reflection” of student knowledge. But if we have to keep changing the ruler, maybe we’re measuring the wrong thing. In the real world, no one will ask your kid what their standardized test score was. They’ll want to know what they can do. Let’s stop lowering the bar and change the measuring stick.==
