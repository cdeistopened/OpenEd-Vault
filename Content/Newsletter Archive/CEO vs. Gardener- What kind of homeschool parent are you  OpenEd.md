==Greetings!==

==We've all seen it, felt the pressure, and asked ourselves the same nagging question:== _==Am I doing enough for my child?==_

==It can be tempting to add more activities, lesson plans, and overall structure.==

==But in the recent== ==[open education breakthrough event](https://opened.co/blog/how-to-homeschool-the-open-education-way)====, Matt & Isaac talk about how the obsession with structure can go wrong. They’re also joined by school teacher-turned-homeschool mom Janae Daniels, who shares what she learned from her disastrous first day of homeschooling.==

==[You can watch the whole recording, or read the article version](https://opened.co/blog/how-to-homeschool-the-open-education-way)====.==

==Let's dive in.==

==**THOUGHT:**== ==CEO or Gardener====**TREND:**== ==The Un-Scheduling Arc====**TOOL:**== ==The Sticky Note Method==

# ==CEO or Gardener?==

==The homeschool CEO tries to manage every variable. They optimize, dictate, and control. The gardener does something different. They know you can't force a seed to grow. You just cultivate the right conditions and trust the process.==

==As Isaac put it, "Your kids are going to be okay. You can relax a little bit."==

==The foundation of a great education isn't a perfect schedule; it's a loving, engaged environment. Everything else is just fine-tuning. Don’t compare yourself to some other family you see on Instagram.==

==Fire the CEO. Become the gardener.==

# ==The Un-Scheduling Arc==

==How can you kill the schedule without creating chaos? The key is to replace rigidity with an== _==adaptable==_ ==framework that changes as your kids go through different phases.==

==Isaac laid out a simple roadmap for the appropriate amount of structure based on his own experience.==

==**Early Years (0-10):**== ==Minimal structure, leaning into unschooling and play.==

==**Middle Years (10-14):**== ==A bit more parent-led structure to guide them through the pre-teen funk.==

==**Teen Years (14+):**== ==They build their own structure, driven by jobs, sports, or projects.==

==Of course, even this framework isn’t to be taken too rigidly. Janae notes that her 9-year-old daughter with a sensory processing disorder thrives with more structure, while her other kids benefit from ample unstructured time to get bored.==

==Even the appropriate level of structure resists one-size-fits-all structure.==

==Think of structure like a trellis – it's there to support growth, not confine it. Different plants need different amounts of support, and the same is true for kids.==

# ==The Sticky Note Method==

==Once the trellis is in place, you need to know what the kid actually wants to climb toward. Matt shared a simple tool for this:== ==**The Sticky Note Method**====. For one week, have your kids jot down answers to a few questions:==

- _==What do you think about in your free time?==_
- _==What are you good at?==_
- _==What do you want to get better at?==_
- _==What do you dislike?==_

==This makes their inner world visible. Then, the magic happens when you connect their interest to a real-world need. For example, a kid who loves baking (interest) can start a cookie business for neighbors (need).==
