==Greetings!==

==[Ken Danford had spent six years teaching eighth-grade U.S. history in public school](https://opened.co/blog/what-happens-when-a-teacher-tells-teens-to-stop-going-to-school)== ==when a colleague handed him== _==The==_ _==[Teenage Liberation Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Liberation-Handbook-School-Education/dp/0962959170)====.==_

==In it, he found case studies of teens who left school and turned out... fine!==

==That was 1996. Danford quit his job, and ever since, he's been running== ==[North Star](https://northstarteens.org/)====—a physical community center where teens can legally homeschool, connect with mentors, and rebuild their lives outside of compulsory classrooms.== 

==Let's dive in.==

==**THOUGHT:**== ==The Invitation====**TREND:**== ==School Refugees Need Infrastructure====**TOOL:**== ==Two Paths for Families with No North Star==

# ==The Invitation==

==When a kid who's struggling in school comes to Ken Danford, his first question comes as a surprise:==

_==**"Have you considered not going to school?"**==_

==But he backs this question up with an exit ramp that keeps teens safe and on track: file a homeschooling plan, use North Star as your headquarters, keep a weekly advisory to stay accountable, and rebuild a life around interests, jobs, college classes, or rest.==

==Over the past 30 years, he's helped hundreds of teens trade hall passes for autonomy while keeping their college and career options open.==

==When critics ask if teens are ready for that autonomy, Ken flips the question: "Why assume they aren't? That's insulting."==

# ==School Refugees Need Infrastructure==

==70% of North Star's teens came directly from school—leaving because of anxiety, bullying, neurodiversity needs, or straight-A culture that was breaking them. They wouldn't have homeschooled without an exit ramp.==

==Homeschooling used to signal ideology. Now it's one option in a growing ecosystem of learning centers, mentors, and programs that provide structure without rigid requirements.==

==Ken's== ==[Liberated Learners network](https://liberatedlearners.net/)== ==includes Launchpad (NY), Compass (VA), Lighthouse (NYC), and new centers in Texas, Oregon, and the UK. These are physical buildings with couches, kitchens, and drop-in hours—teen coworking hubs, not virtual programs.==

==The model is spreading because infrastructure for school refugees didn't exist before. Now it does.==

# ==Two Paths for Families with No North Star==

==Ken's blunt with parents who say, "We can't pull out—we have no alternative."==

==His answer comes in two parts:==

==**Path 1: Stay for the social piece, not the grades.**== ==If school still provides friendships or activities, use it like a community center. Let your child skip assignments that trigger panic. Assume they'll eventually leave, take a GED, and pursue community college or work. That diploma isn't the only ticket forward. Treat the school as a service provider, not a master.==

==**Path 2: Build a patchwork week.**== ==If staying is untenable, stitch together a life from what you already do after 3 p.m.: music lessons, youth theater, church groups, part-time jobs, volunteering, online classes. Yes, relatives will assume you're ruining your kid. They're wrong. The only barometer that matters is your child's health and curiosity.==

==In both scenarios, the job is to listen when your teen says, "This is hurting me." Ken's advice: Assume they're right. Celebrate that they're standing up for themselves.==

# ==Book of the Week==

_==[The Teenage Liberation Handbook: How to Quit School and Get a Real Life and Education](https://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Liberation-Handbook-School-Education/dp/0962959170)==_ ==by Grace Llewellyn is the book that convinced Ken to quit teaching and start North Star.==

==Published in 1991, it's been called "required reading" and "a dangerous book" that "contradicts all the conventional wisdom about dropouts."==

==The dangerous idea? Teenagers can design their own education (goats are optional). Missing algebra at 15 doesn't doom your life.==

==**[Get the book on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Teenage-Liberation-Handbook-School-Education/dp/0962959170)**==
