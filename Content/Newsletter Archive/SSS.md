Tools: "- Surf Skate Science- Whiteboard"
Tweetables]: '- "Feel F = ma in real time."- "Should be seconds, not semesters."'
Breakdown: "- Thought- The importance of experiential learning in physics.- Emphasizing understanding concepts through real-life applications.- Tool- Traditional physics:- Repetitive writing of formulas (e.g., F = ma).- Classroom-based learning with theoretical focus.- Surf Skate Science approach:- Engaging with physics concepts through physical activities (e.g., skateboarding).- Trend- Shift from traditional classroom learning to experiential learning.- Growing recognition of the need for hands-on experiences in education.- Fourth Segment- The urgency of bridging the gap between theoretical learning and practical application.- Advocating for immediate connection between learning concepts and real-world experiences."

Traditional physics:  
Write F = ma 100 times

Surf Skate Science:  
Feel F = ma in real time

  

  

Physics in traditional classroom:  
'F = ma on a whiteboard'

Physics at Surf Skate Science:  
'Feel F = ma in your bones'

The gap between learning and doing?  
Should be seconds, not semesters."
