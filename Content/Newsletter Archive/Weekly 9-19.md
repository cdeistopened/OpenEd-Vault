# ==**DEEP DIVE:**== ==Play is the Job of Kids==

==Ginger Montezon still has the Post-it note, yellowing at the edges now. She'd stuck it on Kristin Fink's desk during a particularly brutal week in 2019:== ==**"Kristin, you need to start a school and I'll come work for you."**==

==Three years later, that Post-it became the founding document of== ==[SKOLA](https://skolamicroschool.com/?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--3ECcNdwtfXIwgPqeom2kGF7ZiF9IoTeUM6SZ9XCav8NWagpbFXg2fAdHEi9OvA8e1V1uV)====: a microschool where kids spend three hours outside every day, and where boredom is celebrated as the gateway to discovery.==

==Here's the stark reality: American children now spend just== ==**4-7 minutes a day playing outside**====—less time than maximum-security prisoners spend in the yard. Meanwhile, anxiety disorders affect 31.9% of adolescents.==

==But when you actually ask kids what they want, they don't choose screens. "Being glued to screens is their DEFAULT not their DESIRE,"== ==[says Lenore Skenazy, founder of Let Grow](https://letgrow.org/let-grow-in-the-atlantic-the-surprising-reason-kids-are-glued-to-their-phones/?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--3ECcNdwtfXIwgPqeom2kGF7ZiF9IoTeUM6SZ9XCav8NWagpbFXg2fAdHEi9OvA8e1V1uV)====.==

==Screens are simply filling a void we've created by eliminating real-world freedom.==

==What Kristin and Ginger discovered through observation—that== _==play is the job of kids==_==—is confirmed in a massive body of research. When children negotiate rules, manage disappointment, persist through challenges, they're building the exact capacities that predict life success better than IQ or family income.==

# ==**PODCAST HIGHLIGHT:**== ==Every "Weird" Kid Has a Superpower==

==When the Columbine shooting unfolded on live radio in 1999, Hollywood storyboard artist Darrin "Fletch" Fletcher was driving to work on the set of== _==Touched By An Angel==_==.==

==Three days later, he asked his brother's high school students to write essays about their feelings. Several admitted they were "pretty close" to doing something similar.==

==That realization birthed== ==[Sneak on the Lot](https://www.sneakonthelot.com/?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--3ECcNdwtfXIwgPqeom2kGF7ZiF9IoTeUM6SZ9XCav8NWagpbFXg2fAdHEi9OvA8e1V1uV)====—a film program (and OpenEd vendor) that has evolved from teaching basics into a genuine Hollywood pipeline, complete with a virtual 3D backlot where students audition for real productions.==

==Fletcher remembers one student in particular: a goth kid in a trench coat with black-dyed hair who drove 45 minutes each day to their building. Fletcher recognized the gift immediately—this kid was a talented writer, way ahead of his age. At a local film festival, the student won five trophies. "Each time he would go down and get a trophy, he would grow a little," Fletcher recalls. "By the time he was done, that kid was like 10 feet tall."==

==Today, that former goth kid sells scripts for six figures in Hollywood.== 

==As Karalee Sartin discovered when she interviewed Fletcher and his partner Chet Thomas, their curriculum works because "no matter what your talents are, no matter your abilities, whether you fit a traditional mold or not, there's a place for you, and you are valued and needed."==

### ==**The Undoing**==

=="For however many years you're in a system, it's going to take that many months to actually shed everything off before you can rebuild," Kristin discovered. She'd been teaching 18 years, so she gave herself 18 months to unlearn. The same is true for students coming from traditional schools—they look for permission, wait for instructions, ask "Is this right?" about things with no right answer. Freedom takes practice.
