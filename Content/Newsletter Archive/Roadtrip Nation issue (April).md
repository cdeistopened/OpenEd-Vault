==Dear Readers,==

==The roadtrip is truly a great American pastime; the idea of an open expanse of horizon stretching out before you—replete with possibility and excitement—is a vision that inspires us all. And each young person, no matter their challenges or goals, deserves to be inspired by the idea of their own unique ‘roadtrip’ through their education and a career. To further this vision, ASA recently entered into a multi-year initiative with Roadtrip Nation that will motivate tens of millions of students and parents by following three young people on a multi-week, national roadtrip. During the experience, the trio will meet role models and mentors while refining their sense of purpose. In order to bring the power of exploration to even more young people, our two organizations are also working with Strada to deliver a Virtual Roadtrip. The Virtual Roadtrip will provide middle grades-appropriate stories about career exploration, and digital generative AI experiences focused on both career exploration and experimentation for middle and high schoolers.== ==**(**====**[[nationalcareereducationnonprofitsamericanstudentassistanceandroadtripnationlaunchnewinitiativetoscaleaccesstofuturereadyopportunitiesformidd]]**====**.)**==

==This spring, I wish us all the resilience to persevere in our proverbial roadtrips. No matter your age or stage of life, learning and growth must never end. There’s always something incredible on the horizon if you know where to look.==
