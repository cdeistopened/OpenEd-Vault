Breakdown: "### Thought/Tool/Trend Breakdown#### Thought:- Project-based learning was attempted but found ineffective.- One-on-one tutoring was identified as effective for foundational skills.- Challenge: Tutoring is typically expensive.#### Tool:- Innovative solution:- Conversion of the top floor of the school’s building into a college dormitory.- Accommodation for 42 recent college graduates to live and tutor.- Minimal pay with free housing as the incentive.#### Trend:- High-dosage tutoring model:- Tutors commit to full-time tutoring daily.- Significant interest from applicants, with around 250 applications for just 40 slots.- Tutors primarily from prestigious institutions (e.g., Princeton) interested in public service.#### Additional Segment:- Research Support:- Studies by Harvard economist Roland Fryer indicate that high-dosage tutoring can significantly enhance learning outcomes.- University of Chicago's Education Lab findings show potential for closing achievement gaps in mathematics."

# ==The Third-Floor Tutoring Tower==

==Mike's charter school tried project-based learning. It wasn't working.==

==What did work? One-on-one tutoring for foundational skills.==

==The problem is, tutoring is expensive.==

==So== ==[Mike came up with a wild solution.](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7365790224016175104?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_7ToLHwZwA9dUtiGpg7nJgKHvM0V2zZkLt-XoGXp5VbXYQNPbm1EQnZkuTPdbanAM3KLvN)== ==When they bought their three-story building, the original plan was to rent out the top floor to help pay the mortgage. Instead, the school built it out as a college dorm with 14 triple rooms and bunk beds.==

==They recruited 42 recent college grads to live and tutor for a year, Teach for America style. The pay was minimal, but housing was free. Every day at 8:00 AM these 22-year-olds would come downstairs and spend their entire day tutoring students one-on-one.==

=="We got maybe 250 people to apply for these 40 full-time tutoring slots," Mike says. These were Princeton grads who didn't know if they wanted to be teachers but liked the idea of a year of public service.==
