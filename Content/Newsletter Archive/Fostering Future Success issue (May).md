==Dear Readers,==

==Amidst seemingly unprecedented turmoil in the education space, I'm thankful for all of the many ways in which ASA fulfills its mission to foster future success for all young people, in and beyond the classroom. For example, we recently awarded $17 million in grants to nonprofits, with a goal of helping middle and high school students achieve postsecondary education and career success.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/asa-awards-17.7-million-for-youth-career-readiness-programs)**====**.)**== ==We also teamed up with nonprofit Building Hope to give the ASA Career Education Champion Awards to two schools on opposite sides of the country.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-newswire/schools-school-choice-education-funding-47616ed737572f2bd3bbaca976400fcc)**====**.)**== ==And, we’re reaching millions of teens directly through our free EvolveMe career readiness platform== ==**(**====**[visit the site](https://evolveme.asa.org/)**====**)**====, which now includes IBM SkillsBuild to help young people build in-demand skills in areas such as AI, UX design, and cybersecurity.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://www.edtechinnovationhub.com/news/american-student-assistance-and-ibm-partner-to-bring-ai-and-cyber-skills-to-teens-via-evolveme-platform)**====**.)**== ==I'm heartened to see the momentum being generated--across the ecosystem of caring adults who support young people--to improve the way kids move through K-12 education and into postsecondary pursuits. I’m always thrilled to be able to share those stories with you in this newsletter. Here are some highlights:==

==The Association for Middle Level Education (AMLE) has published a book,== _==Successful Middle School Transitions==_==, which educators can use to ensure every student finds their place.== ==**(**====**[Learn more](https://my.amle.org/Shop/Store/Product-Details?productid=%7B77B1C6AA-F9E3-EF11-8EE9-7C1E5219B7F9%7D&_cldee=vAtittlX99mnGZH3vF42dlEp0_Zjg2LCvWSvKpaPlTIq6kpC-SSQeam4EZVmXK1F&recipientid=contact-a15c64f8cc31ec11811b000d3a0de1a1-48ebd265de83441f9cd32a159bf3a8e6&esid=83e186fa-de16-f011-998a-000d3a192feb)**====**.)**== ==More than 150 students and teachers were welcomed to NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland to learn about technical careers.== ==**(**====**[Read the story.](https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/glenn/students-explore-technical-careers-at-nasa/)**====**)**== ==Amazon has awarded $16 million in college tuition and paid internships to 400 U.S. high school seniors through its Amazon Future Engineer program.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://www.edtechinnovationhub.com/news/amazon-funds-next-gen-tech-talent-with-16-million-in-computer-science-scholarships-and-internships)**====**.)**== ==New America reflects on what it takes to build high-quality youth apprenticeships.== ==**(**====**[Read their story](https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/edcentral/what-does-it-take-to-build-high-quality-youth-apprenticeships/)**====**.)**== ==And== _==Getting Smart==_ ==explains how students can benefit from credentials, not just grades.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2025/04/09/the-transcript-trap-why-our-students-need-credentials-not-just-grades/)**====**.)**==

==Each month, I invite you to watch the latest episode of “Youth Career Readiness: The One-Question Podcast” — my collaboration with author Michael Horn. This month, we interviewed former college football coach, Lou Holtz. We asked him what career and life advice he would share with young people. Lou replied by offering three simple rules anyone can use to help them make good choices.== ==**(**====**[Watch the episode](https://michaelbhorn.substack.com/p/lou-holtz-make-good-choices?utm_source=podcast-email&publication_id=35034&post_id=162055805&utm_campaign=email-play-on-substack&utm_content=watch_now_button&r=17drao&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email)**====**.)**== ==You can also explore our past interviews, with well-known guests like Yo-Yo Ma, Common, John Pankow, Tanya Wright, and others.== ==**(**====**[Explore the One Question library](https://www.asa.org/the-one-question-podcast/)**====**.
