## ==**THE POWER OF BOREDOM**==

==When was the last time you let your child get== _==truly==_ ==bored?==

==In our rush to fill every moment with structured learning, we often miss the magic that happens when children have nothing they== _==have==_ ==to do. That empty space is where genuine curiosity begins.==

## ==**YOUTH ENTREPRENEURSHIP: THE ULTIMATE EDUCATION**==

==Entrepreneurship isn't just about building businesses—it's becoming one of the most powerful educational experiences for young people.==

==Why? As Matt explains: "There's something unique you can learn from trying to be an entrepreneur that cannot be learned any other way."==

==Through entrepreneurship, young people develop skills that traditional education often misses:==

- ==Applied problem-solving with real-world consequences==
- ==Financial literacy through actual transactions==
- ==Communication across diverse audiences==
- ==Resilience through trial and error==

==This is exactly why== ==[the Youth Entrepreneur Award (YEA!)](https://yea.education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stop-overscheduling-your-child-s-learning)== ==was created, with its $5,000 prize pool for entrepreneurs 18 and under.

## ==**THE 20-MINUTE METHOD FOR OVERWHELMED PARENTS**==

==If you're feeling completely overwhelmed by your day, this minimalist approach can help you reset:==

- ==20 minutes of focused math==
- ==20 minutes of reading==
- ==20 minutes of writing==
- ==1 hour of free exploration between each==

=="If you're overwhelmed, your kids are gonna be feeling overwhelmed," explains Matt Bowman. "Take a break. Take a little time where you reduce whatever you're doing by 50%. Just cut in half whatever you're doing so that you can breathe a little bit."==

==From ancient Greek, meaning "the right, critical, or opportune moment." Unlike chronos (sequential time), kairos refers to the perfect moment for action.==

### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**MYTHBUSTING**==

==**The myth:**== ==Some kids just don't like learning.==

==**The truth:**== ==Every child is born a natural explorer. They're hardwired for discovery.==

==What often looks like disinterest is usually just:==

1. ==Too much structure==
2. ==Not connected to the real-world application==
3. ==Limited space for wonder==

==When given freedom to pursue their interests, a student’s natural curiosity flourishes.==

==The math, science, and economics flowed naturally. But the real learning came from facing decisions with actual consequences.==

- ==Google, IBM, Apple and Tesla have removed degree requirements from job postings==
- ==Skills verification platforms now provide better signals than transcripts==
- ==Apprenticeship models often deliver superior results to lecture halls==

==His answer isn't anti-college, but pro-analysis: "My point of view on college is based on unemotional math." For decades, college was ROI-positive for most careers because a degree guaranteed returns. That reality has shifted for many—though not all—fields.==

==Gary acknowledges that certain professions still require degrees: "Do you need a degree for certain professions if you want to be a doctor, lawyer? I understand all that."==

==Today's question isn't whether college is universally "good" or "bad" – it's whether the specific investment matches your child's desired outcome. Each family needs to calculate their own ROI equation.==

==Meanwhile, as colleges face enrollment challenges and== ==[campuses close at record rates](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/a-new-problem-with-four-year-degrees-the-surge-in-college-closures-7f68c4aa?st=fnry5247fjnwzew&reflink=article_email_share&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-math-is-broken-college-s-roi-problem)====, it's worth having this honest conversation before making a $200,000 decision.==

==Hundreds of students later, the results speak for themselves. Through 6-month apprenticeships with growing companies, Praxis participants get real skills, actual experience, and a job. No debt required.==
