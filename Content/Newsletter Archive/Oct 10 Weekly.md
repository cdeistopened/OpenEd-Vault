# ==The Kid Who Didn't Want To Go==

==Kerry Owen needed help delivering food to a family. Her 22-year-old son said no. She said, "I need you to carry this into the apartment." He was grumpy in the car.==

==They got there. The family had lots of little kids. The kids climbed all over him. Wanted him to play. Wanted to color with him.==

==In the car afterward, Kerry said, "They loved you." He said, "I know. Actually, that was pretty fun."==

==Most of us think we need to== _==feel==_ ==like serving before we do it. Kerry's son proves the opposite: you do it first, then discover you needed it.== 

==**[Watch the full podcast](https://opened.co/blog/how-to-raise-kids-who-actually-care-about-others)**==

# ==Service Is the New Curriculum==

==When Kerry is running== ==[Reach Out Today](https://www.reachouttoday.org/)====, she brings her kids along. They assemble food kits, organize pop-up hair salons for underserved communities, coordinate volunteer teams. One daughter manages donor relations. Another runs "walk in their shoes" school visits. They're not volunteering once a month. This is family culture.==

==And colleges are noticing, asking for evidence of contribution—project logs, leadership stories, documented impact.==

==Flexible schooling makes this possible. Online classes in the morning, meal distribution in the afternoon. You can't coordinate a feeding program stuck in a classroom until 3pm. But when you control your schedule, service becomes curriculum, not something you squeeze in after homework.==

# ==The Transcript That Shows Real Work==

==The== ==[Mastery Transcript Consortium](https://mastery.org/)== ==created transcripts for students doing real-world learning. Instead of a vague line item like, "Community Service: A+" (lol), it shows real competencies with evidence.==

==Each transcript includes artifacts—photos, testimonials, project logs. Over 400 schools use MTC transcripts. Colleges accept them because they show initiative and real-world impact, not just grades.==

## ==00:00 The Gift of Charity: A Mother's Mission to Feed Hungry Children==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. I'm your sometimes host Ella, and today I'm joined by Kerry. Kerry is a fascinating individual, and we're diving into her incredible journey of feeding hungry children. She recently published a book, and we'll talk about what it looks like to have a kid who's passionate about making change—like she was when she was younger—and how that's evolved into her story today. We'll also explore how she involves her kids in mission-driven work. Welcome to the podcast, Kerry.==

==**Kerry:**== ==Thank you for having me.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==First off, let's plug your book. What is it called?==

==**Kerry:**== ==It's called== _==The Gift of Charity Wrapped in a Korowai of Love==_==, and it's by Kerry Owen and Lisa Norton.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==I love it. Where can people find it?==

==**Kerry:**== ==You can find it on Amazon, Cedar Fort Publishers, and Deseret Books.==

## ==03:29 From Romania to Reality: A Teen's First Charity Project==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==Very cool. I gave a sneak peek about your story and the incredible work you've dedicated your life to, but let's get into it. You mentioned earlier that you were always a mission-driven person—when you were younger, you had this idea that you wanted to change the world. I think there are definitely kids out there who are very passionate. Can you explain what it was like growing up?==

==**Kerry:**== ==The most significant story was when I was watching a news piece about children in Romania. They were in an orphanage, and there were six little toddlers in the same crib. Their diapers were dirty, they were crying, rocking back and forth, and they didn't have love and attention.==

==It really troubled me, and I talked to my parents about wanting to do something. I ended up handwriting letters—back then we didn't have a printer in the home—and I hand-wrote all these letters, put them in each person's mailbox down the street, and arranged to pick up canned food donations.==

## ==04:55 When Nobody Cared: Learning Hard Lessons About Community==

==**Kerry:**== ==When I went door to door, I had hardly anything donated. I remember crying a lot because I was disappointed. I was living in an area with a lot of wealth, yet this canned food I was asking for—obviously no one thought it was important. I'm not sure what the reason was why people didn't donate, but it was a turning point in my life where I was like, "Why wouldn't they care?"==

==That was my first project as a young teen.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==What happened after that? You said you were frustrated that nobody cared.==

==**Kerry:**== ==I did a second attempt where I had more success. My parents and I found out about an agency that was actually driving medical supplies and food over to Romania, to the orphanages. I remember them coming to the door to collect the food I had managed to put together. They were really encouraging and thankful, and they actually said, "You'd be welcome to come with us." But I was young, so that obviously wasn't going to happen. I just remember thinking I would have loved to come and see these children and see what the need was.==

==I think that's where my desire to help was really fueled.==

## ==07:46 Dreams That Won't Let Go: A Vision of Thousands of Hungry Children==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==That's so interesting. What happened afterwards that eventually got you started with actually making change happen as an adult? Was there a period between the early years and now where you took on different projects and missions?==

==**Kerry:**== ==There were a few things. My parents heard about the Chernobyl disaster—the nuclear plant that contaminated the food supply and children were getting cancer. So our parents hosted some children from Chernobyl to come and stay for a holiday, giving them great experiences and good food without contamination.==

==Once I was married, my husband and I would also have these kids come from Chernobyl. When we were dating, I was talking about how I'd love to foster and adopt children. I really hoped I could make a difference in life. I never realized I was going to end up forming a charity.==

==That came later. We moved from England to New Zealand, and it was there where I experienced a series of dreams. These dreams opened my eyes to children going hungry in New Zealand. I had no idea—we were living on the North Shore, a lovely area. I didn't see any poverty. I didn't even know there was anybody hungry, but these dreams opened my eyes to that.==

==So I ended up setting up a charity and delivering food into schools.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==As you were saying, the dreams opened your eyes to children who were hungry. What kind of experiences were they? What did you dream about?==

==**Kerry:**== ==I had three young children of my own at the time, so I was busy, but I would always pray that I'd be able to help people and get opportunities to help. But I never expected this dream. In this dream, I saw thousands and thousands of children in front of me who were going hungry. It was really upsetting because I had no idea how difficult that was for these children living with food insecurity. When I woke up I was like, "I need to do something about this." But then daylight comes and you think, "Well, it was just a dream. Kerry, you don't even know many people here. You haven't lived here long. What do you think you can do about it?" All those insecurities come into your mind—"Am I able to do this? Am I good enough?"==

==But when I had a second dream where I saw the same children again, I felt this guilt. I felt this guilt that I hadn't done anything about it and that these children were still going hungry.==

==It was really that second dream that spurred me on. From then on, I set up this charity, Feed the Need, and ended up delivering food into schools. Back then, New Zealand didn't have a food system at school. Kids who didn't come with a packed lunch would just go hungry. There were other charities doing things like granola bars, muesli bars, some bread in the freezer at schools—emergency snacks. But I wanted to give them proper food, proper home-cooked food that would be nutritious. That's where it began. We did a pilot in a school.==

==We had a lot of mistakes and problems with food and cooking and delivery. But we learned a lot, and that was educational in a different way. Then we ended up doing two more schools, and each year it expanded until we ended up building a big commercial kitchen within the Salvation Army building.==

## ==15:43 Building Community Partnerships: The Salvation Army Connection==

==**Kerry:**== ==That was a great partnership because they're all about helping those in need. We were able to cook and deliver from that building. In fact, they lent us their delivery van when ours broke down. It was just great having that community support with like-minded people.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==What made you say, "Okay, I'm actually going to do something about it"? It sounds like you had these two dreams, you had a moment of extreme conviction, and then you put your effort and money and tears and blood and sweat into this project—while you had three kids, while you're doing all these other things. That's really difficult. So what made you say, "I'm going to actually do this no matter how much it costs"?==

==**Kerry:**== ==I felt a responsibility for these children, and I think that's what the dreams gave me—this feeling of responsibility. I've tried to describe it in the past, but you know that feeling I have for my children, the ones that came naturally and the ones we adopted? It's this feeling like I would do anything for these children—they're my responsibility. I want them to succeed.==

==I want them to have well-being and to be happy. And it was those same feelings that I had for all these children I'd seen in my dream. They might not have been my actual children, but I felt this pure, motherly love for these children. And I could not not do anything, if that makes sense.==

## ==20:55 Raising Mission-Driven Kids: Why Character Beats Curriculum==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==That's really interesting. So what did you do next when you decided, "Okay, I'm going to do something about this. I have to do something about this"? Because I think there are a lot of people in the world, especially when you're young, who have this idealism. You watch a movie about people who are hungry or struggling in some way, and your heart goes out to them and you think, "What if I could be the person to do something about that?"==

==And then over time, you live and go along your life and think, "I don't know if that's going to be me." But this dream called you out of that and said, "You know what? Yes, it is actually going to be you," and you felt conviction around it. How can parents help their children foster the parts of them that want to make change—that want to do something about the things they see as injustices or wrong things in the world that they could solve?==

==**Kerry:**== ==I think first of all, believe in your children and encourage those charitable thoughts. See how you can help them. Going back to those Romanian orphans, my parents were very supportive. They reached out to the agency, they helped me do what I did, and I think having that belief—"Yeah, that's a great idea and this is how we can support you"—I think that's really important for children.==

==I actually think—this is my theory—that most people have ideas and thoughts come to their minds where they think, "I'd love to do something about this." But I think often it's our insecurities that stop us and make us think, "Well, really, what can I do? Can I really make a difference?"==

==I think I was lucky because I had those dreams to fall back on. For the times when it got really hard and it was really hard to juggle everything—and it was an emotional toll, especially when I'd meet with these children—there were times where I thought, "This is hard." But thankfully I had the dreams to go, "Okay, no, this is what I'm meant to be doing." And I don't think we all need to have dreams to be able to do something good in the world.==

==I think if you just have that desire, that's enough. And as parents, we can help our children and give them opportunities. With my children, I include them in the charity work. Over here, I direct a charity called Reach Out Today. We've been here eight years. I'll take my kids along to events and things we're doing. For example, we do these pop-up hair salons. I'm not a hairdresser or hairstylist, but that was a request from one of the schools—could we do a pop-up hair salon with hairstylists and volunteers to give these children who need a little bit of TLC an opportunity to have their hair washed with shampoo and warm water and have a hairstylist give them attention they've never had before? I've brought my kids along to help—sweep up hair, give out hair care kits, assemble hair care kits. My daughter has assembled a lot of kits: food packs, hygiene packs, clothing packs, hair care kits.==

==My daughter's gotten really excited. In fact, she's taking over. She feels like I'm not doing a good enough job putting these kits together. So I'm like, "Great, awesome. You take pride in that." I think giving kids the opportunity helps them open their eyes to the needs out there and also gives them a sense of belief in themselves that they can make a difference. For example, at one of the pop-up hair salons, our daughter was interacting with the younger children and they just adored her. She was really excited afterwards, just talking about these children. I feel like whatever age you are, you can make a difference.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==I love that. That is so beautiful. As a mom, you're building charities, you're building a business, and you're trying to do all these things. And you're also doing open ed with your kids—you're also building their education. What is that like juggling? Is it quite difficult?==

## ==28:42 The Transformation Power of Service: Youth Finding Purpose==

==**Kerry:**== ==All my children attended public school, and it was just a few years back that our youngest boy got scarlet fever and sepsis and ended up becoming very sick. His immune system was compromised. His body was impacted for a good 18 months afterwards from the sepsis, so the hospital recommended that we do online school instead of in-person school. That's actually what forced me to look into online schooling. I'd never thought of ever doing it, I'll be honest. So here we were in this situation where he needed to have online school. And then my daughter was keen to try it too. That's how we stepped into the whole open ed online schooling.==

==It does come with a juggle when you're trying to do things, but also you're aware that your children need extra support from you to help guide them—make sure they're attending their online classes and so forth. But actually, I've really enjoyed it. It's been like each school year has been exciting. We're like, "Okay, so what school trips are we going to be doing?"==

==We could do this as part of school and we can do that as part of school. My kids always say, "Okay, when are we going to do our school trip this week?" So it's a nice opportunity to be able to connect with them and then have them come with me to go and visit a family in need and have them come with me to different things and be able to do schoolwork and have that flexibility.==

==You get what I mean. So I've really enjoyed the flexibility of making sure that we can—okay, if we're doing this at 10 a.m., that's okay, we can do this at 2 p.m. instead. Having that flexibility has been really amazing. With charity work you have to be flexible because you don't know—for example, you might have a refugee family that's just arrived and they need this and they need that. So you don't always know what you need to be doing each day. It can come as, "Okay, so there's this family whose house has burned down, they have nothing, where are they going to stay?" That's how charity work is. It's not always planned. It's just what comes and what the need is.==

==Trying to deal with that need and having that flexibility with the schooling and having them sometimes join me is great. It's really good. I love it actually.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==Has it transformed your relationship with them to involve them, or did you always involve them? Because it sounds like this was your mission—you had those dreams, you were building this. And then it seems like it became not just your mission, but our mission, like a family mission. The more they get involved, it becomes something they're bought into as well. When you have to go serve somebody or do something for somebody, they understand because it's part of their mission too and they've seen the people you're helping. I think that's really fascinating. And also, I would imagine it actually makes it easier for you to be on call in these crazy moments that you wouldn't expect because you're with your kids a lot. If they were in a school setting, it'd be harder because you're not with them during the day and sometimes you need to be called away. But it sounds like you get a lot of really great time with them as well.==

==**Kerry:**== ==Yeah, and it's been great because even our daughter—not for this podcast, but for other things like radio interviews—I'll say to my daughter, "Okay, just ask me some questions. Let me practice." And she'll be asking me these questions and she was like, "Mom, I don't think you should give that answer." So it's been quite funny because she's been my little critic. But it's great because she'll give me advice and thoughts, and because our family knows about everything, it's great having a perspective from her age. Even with this book that we wrote—it's taken years—and so when it was published my youngest boy said, "All of that typing resulted in that small book."==

==So he'd known—well, he's doing schoolwork, I'm talking and having meetings with Lisa. And he was thinking all that work was—literally, this is the book. And he was just like, "All that work for just that?" And so that was kind of funny. So yeah, my kids all know everything. They know about the books. They know about when I go out and do talks or speeches.==

==They'll sometimes come along and listen to me. So one of my sons who's living in Orlando at the time, I actually sent him a book and he said, "Yeah, it was great, but I knew all the stories anyway." So it was kind of like, "Okay, I didn't need to send you the book then." But my hope is that they'll be inspired to do something. I believe everyone has a calling, and whatever that might be—it might be looking after the elderly, it might be looking after veterans—I just feel like there are so many needs out there that if we all decided, "Okay, we're going to do something in this sphere," well then, how much better the world could be.==

==I do know that one of my sons, he's 22, and he would sometimes say, "I don't want to come." And I'm like, "Well, I need you to come. I need you to help carry this food into this apartment." And this one time he was really saying, "I really don't want to come." And I said, "Well, I need you." So he was kind of grumpy in the car—this was a few years back. And then we got there and this young mother with lots of little children were there and they just adored him. They were clambering all over him. They wanted to play coloring with him. And we came out of there and I said, "They loved you." And he was like, "I know." And he said, "Actually, that was pretty fun." So I think sometimes—I think all of us—it's just human nature.==

==Sometimes we think "I'm too tired" or "I don't want to." And I am actually naturally an introvert. So putting myself out there, meeting people I don't know of different cultures and languages, it doesn't come naturally to me, but over the years I've been able to learn how to interact, even if you don't have the language.==

==And hopefully my kids watch that and see that and hopefully it will help them.==

## ==35:12 Making Service Accessible: Practical Ways Families Can Start==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==Yeah, I love this. I heard a quote once and it definitely resonated with me because it aligned with everything I've ever experienced. Anytime you serve other people—something that's quite dear to my heart is actually older people. There are a lot of older people who feel overlooked and like they don't matter as much anymore because they can't offer the world as much. There are lots of underserved communities, people who are just overlooked and not given enough. But I heard this quote once: "We think that they need us, but we actually need them." And it speaks to the peace of our hearts and our souls and minds that are fulfilled by doing things for other people.==

==The experiences you have, the moments you have—like with your son when he goes there. He doesn't even know what he needs, but then he experiences this beautiful thing and it speaks to a part of him that he didn't even know needed speaking to, which I think is so beautiful.==

==**Kerry:**== ==Well, I was just going to say the book,== _==The Gift of Charity==_==, is exactly touching on that point because I had this epiphany at the end of my journey with Feed the Need in New Zealand—my goodness, this wasn't just a gift for the receiver, this was also a gift for the giver. This has just been such a privilege, and I can get emotional about it. I always do because I realize that having all these interactions with all these different children and learning about different cultures and having all this love for the people we served has just enriched my life. I'll never forget them and I'll always be grateful for those experiences. So yeah, you're right.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==Wow, that's absolutely beautiful. You mentioned earlier that part of the reason you wrote the book is because you see this next generation—the kids we're raising, including your kids—as the next group of people to recognize unmet needs and fulfill them, whether that's their main career trajectory or side projects they take on. Can you speak to that a little bit and the whole world of service, charity, philanthropy? What does it look like right now being inside of it?==

==**Kerry:**== ==I think once you delve into the needs in your community, wherever you are, it's never ending. For example, in New Zealand, we were doing this food in schools, but then the communities would come asking, "Can you do something for our youth? We have youth that have been kicked out of school who are getting into crime."==

==So we ended up doing a youth engagement program where these kids that had been kicked out of school, we employed in the kitchens while we were making food for those children going without. It was amazing to see these youth who often themselves had gone hungry. It was incredible because they actually felt they were part of something. They were part of something big. They were solving something in their community.==

==Here they were cooking this food, learning how to cook food en masse and being involved. We were in the kitchens with mayors and leaders of the land and business leaders. And these were youth that had been brushed off to the side, almost forgotten because they were like a "waste of space." And then here they were being valued. They were the ones leading these business leaders on how to cook this food and assemble it and take it into the schools. It was incredible to see the confidence these young people gained just from that experience in the kitchen and being part of something good. I really feel like seeing these young people who were actually really quite insecure—some had been in, I remember one lad said he'd been in 17 foster homes.==

==These kids were basically unwanted, and so to feel wanted, to feel part of something big, their confidence grew and they all went on to do good things. This one girl went off and volunteered in the hospital with terminally ill children. Others went off to further education.==

==It was incredible to see that these youth, given an opportunity to go out and serve, despite themselves being broken, were able to do amazing things in the community and also have that sense of worth. Seeing that, I feel like a lot of youth today could probably realize their sense of worth by getting into charity work.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==It does. Yeah, it's interesting. I think it's weird that we forget all about the things that are not in front of us. If you're thinking about white cars because maybe you're thinking about buying a car, you'll start noticing them more.==

==I think the same is true about needs in your community. If you start asking the question, "What are the needs inside of my community?" you'll start noticing them more. And I think what's interesting is there are a lot of people today talking about the need for purpose inside young individuals—young individuals don't have enough purpose. I think part of that is...==

==I wonder if part of it is the fact that we used to have really dedicated third spaces. We used to have really connected communities. So it made it a lot easier for us to see the needs of our community because we were around it a lot. It was in front of us. You'd be talking to people and there were people who always needed something. I wonder if that has a correlation. In your experience, what does it look like once you start asking the question, "Okay, what does my community need?" Where do you even begin? Where do you start? And then what do you start finding out?==

==**Kerry:**== ==After I had those dreams back in New Zealand, I started talking to people, trying to understand the situation, reaching out to principals in schools which were low-decile. I don't know if they have something like this here, but a low-decile would be an area with more poverty. Once I started talking to teachers, principals, going into the schools and talking to them, it was evident that my dreams were actually accurate—yeah, there are a lot of kids going hungry.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==And out of curiosity, why did you start with schools?==

==**Kerry:**== ==In my second dream, I actually saw myself cooking foods alongside a team of people assembling these individual meals and watching as we went into schools. That's when I realized they don't have a food-in-school system. They don't have the subsidized food system here. It was actually the dreams that opened my eyes to that. And then when I went and started talking to people at schools, it was true. There was no subsidized food-in-school system.==

==There was just emergency foods. So that's why I went into the schools. And when we moved here, I did the same thing. I went into the schools. I feel like often teachers are more aware of their students' needs. Social workers, school counselors—they're often dealing with not just the schooling but also the emotional needs of children, so that's where I'd often get the answers of what was going on in the world.==

## ==46:17 Open Education Meets Open Hearts: Flexible Schooling for Service==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==That's really cool. That's really interesting. Like in the book that Matt and Isaac just published, they have this like workshop where they go through needs, interests, and resources. And they kind of break it down into like, what are all the things that are available to you right now? What are all the things that could possibly be available to you? What are the things in your local community, for example? So like, what are the needs that you could serve in your local community? I think, well, from what you've said, what I'm understanding is like, sometimes there are legitimate needs in your local community that you could definitely solve. Sometimes you can solve them from an entrepreneurial perspective. Other times you can solve them from a charitable perspective.==

==and maybe both of them have an entrepreneurial spirit, but like maybe you create a business versus maybe you create a nonprofit business or something like that, a for-profit business versus nonprofit. Something that's really interesting to me though is you started with the question, who do I want to serve? And then you went to where they were, right? And so like, I think you can take it in both directions now that you've shared your story. Like if a kid is really excited about a specific type of group or like maybe they watched a movie and it was like, wow, you know, I feel for this, this very specific thing. you can also start with the question of like, okay, who do you want to serve? And then where can you go to learn more about them? So if you, for example, want to serve young kids or adopted kids, like you can go to the places where people know and are intimately close with that as a challenge and all the things that are going, going on in that world. And like, just learning from those people even. Like as a kid saying, okay, maybe right now I'm not ready to start a nonprofit, but maybe right now the way that I get involved, the way that I focus in on all the things that are available to me is actually just by asking questions and starting to create a landscape in my mind about like, what is this world of helping, for example, adopted children or hungry children or elderly individuals in the community?==

==what is this all about? What are the gaps that need to be filled? And then maybe they're not ready to do it now, but maybe they're ready to do it in the future. And I feel like that's actually a really fascinating way to do it. It's just like, okay, parents, maybe your kid is like super hyper passionate. Maybe they're ready to go, but also maybe they're not. And maybe they're just ready to learn more and get more curious and get more interested in this community.==

==**Kerry:**== ==I love that, I really love that. Like even if it was just starting the question, know, starting asking the questions and just basically being able to like help open your child's mind to the needs out there. And you know, maybe it'll be something that jumps out to them maybe five or 10 years later that they might go, okay, back then, you know, this is something that kind of impacted me and opened my eyes. And so, yeah, I feel like...==

==If we can just have our kids asking the questions, not necessarily having to go out, make collections, put together kits and whatnot, but just asking those questions would be, I think would be great. Yeah, I like that. So for example, sorry.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==Yeah, just learning about it. And then the other... No, go for it, go for it.==

==**Kerry:**== ==Well, just one of the things that I was thinking is that when we moved here, I wanted to understand about children in foster care and like, you know, could we do something to help these children that are in foster care? And then, you know, talking to, you know, why is there homelessness? Like, what can we do to prevent homelessness? And so all these kind of questions were coming into my mind. So then I went to DCFS, you know, who deal with, you know, child protection and so on. And so, yeah, just asking people. Then I went to like Utah Foster Care and all those organizations that are out there doing that. you know, before I actually did anything of significance, it was asking those questions and just talking to them and trying to understand what the issues were. What could we do to prevent this or that? Or what can we do when a child does enter foster care or does reunite with their biological family, what can we do to help that transition? And so yeah, I think it's just asking those questions will help guide you at this time or in the future.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==I love that. And then something else that you do really beautifully is you bring your kids into it. something that's important to me in the future is like creating the culture that I want my family to embody, right? And like being the first example of that. So if I want my kid to, you know, work out or eat healthy, right? Like we have to embody that first as parents and then then we can have that standard for our kid. Then we can say, hey, you should be doing this, right? Because kids learn a lot from what they see you do more than what you say. And also, it is really important for habit formation, right? Like if something becomes normal to a kid, it's a lot easier for them to maintain it throughout. How would you recommend that parents get involved in the needs of their community and bring their kids along? I think...==

==That is also something that I think like my parents did that pretty well every now and again, but I definitely think that there's room for improvement. I mean, even as I look forward to the future, it's like, okay, how do you get involved in a way that, for example, puts your kid, like you were saying about your son, in an uncomfortable position of, hey, I don't really want to do this right now, but you're going to do it because this is what we do as a family.==

==**Kerry:**== ==Yeah, I think you can go online. for example, JustServe, I don't know if you've heard of that, but people can go online and look for, okay, they can look for service opportunities on JustServe. And so I'll have people coming to my door and it can be whole families coming to donate. And so it could be like a kit for a child entering foster care or it could be Christmas gifts for a child in DCFS and so I love that some families do it together, some youth groups do it together and I love that communities are looking for ways to buy and serve and you know I'm sure that there's plenty other websites that you can go to to seek out ways that you can serve and involve your kids.==

==But you could just, I mean, you know, just simply wherever you're living in the world, you could go looking for local charities, local non-for-profits, and just asking what do they do and have they got any opportunities to, you know, if you're wanting your kids to have that face-to-face interaction, you know, just kind of go talking to different charities and seeing what you can do to help and how could I involve my kids? And so I do sometimes get that question like what can I do to involve my kids with your work with Reach Out today? so yeah and so just kind of looking in your community of ways that you can involve your kids and maybe you could start off with an easy one. For example I'm sure a lot of charitable organizations like Reach Out today and like Feed the Need in New Zealand they always want you know donations like kits for you know like here we've got like all different kits and so you could say to children like hey you know this week we're gonna assemble a kit for this reason and this is why we we should do it and this is the impact it's gonna have. In the book I talk about this 11 year old girl that her whole summer she dedicates to raising money for feed the need and she bakes food==

==and sells it from her garage. And when we meet, she comes and she's almost sheepishly handing me over this money saying, I wish it was more. And honestly, that to me, her donation was one of the most impactful to me because I thought, here she is, an 11 year old girl that sacrificed her summer because she wanted to help children that were going hungry. And so I asked this girl, said, can you imagine?==

==This money is actually going to give 40 whatnot children lunch. Can you imagine now looking out at these 40 children? Do you think they would think that this wasn't good enough? I think they'd be really grateful. I think they'd be really thankful to you. And she actually started having tears rolled down her cheeks because I feel like, yeah, I just feel like kids, like if you can help them realize that that little bit, you know, it's going to have a massive impact on the receiver.==

==But also, like, I wanted her to know that she'd done a good thing. She'd done a really good thing. Not many 11-year-olds would sacrifice their summer to raise money for children that were going without. And so, yeah, just maybe, like, look at, yeah, local charities, just seeing what their needs are, what you could do, how your kids could get involved. I do feel like, you know, a lot nowadays, you know, mental health issues, you know.==

==maybe too much screen time or whatnot, you know, all these different theories. But I do feel like purpose is one of those things that helps your child feel like they've got a reason to be and they've got something to give the world. And so, yeah, I would love it if parents could just kind of encourage their children to look beyond themselves look beyond their family and see what they could do to impact. often I'll get calls at Christmas time. Most people are really keen. We get a lot of help during Christmas time. And I wish that would just keep going through the year because the need is still going after Christmas. But start wherever it is, start small and then just gradually go from there.==

==if that's helpful, I don't know.==

## ==54:27 The Ripple Effect: How One Family's Mission Inspires Others==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==No, that's so beautiful. yeah, I think it's quite valuable to like reiterate the fact that, you know, as a parent, you don't know how much you need this and then you start serving other people and you're like, wow, like, okay, wow. And then as a kid, you don't know you need it either. And then you start serving people. And while it is entirely taxing, like I've definitely been there where it takes an emotional toll on you and it is hard, but on the other side of it, It is so life-giving. I've tried thinking and tried getting involved in different places and it seems like the barriers to entry are pretty high sometimes. How would you recommend dealing with that? So like as a parent, if you're trying to get involved and you're trying to bring your kids places, right? But like there are a lot of places that don't necessarily make it super easy to just say, hey, we're gonna come in for the weekend. It's like, okay, well you need to take these classes or you need a... do all these things in order to make yourself prepared. And probably it's worth it to do that. But have you seen high barriers to entry to in certain areas or would you disagree with that?==

==**Kerry:**== ==Yeah, I think for me it's I think because I'm sort of already in there it's easy for me to get my kids involved and I don't know if I have the answers for that because I'm not quite sure. I found it easy but that I think is because like I've built relationships with different agencies and organizations and so on and so it's easy for me to you know include my kids because I'm already in it. Yeah I mean I would probably... what would I do if there wasn't? I mean just like so for example one of my sons was working at this car wash place and he was given some tips==

==and some friends of ours saw my son giving those tips to a homeless man and my son never mentioned a word of it and then later these friends told us that we saw him giving his tips to this homeless man and I'm like he did yay so you know and I kind of feel like maybe just in the moment if there's a situation if you see somebody that's begging maybe just you know if you've just been to the grocery store and you've got==

==I've literally done this. I've got a baguette in the back seat of my car and I can see this homeless person and I pass him the baguette through the window. And my kids are like, oh mom, seriously, you're embarrassing, know, sort of thing. But like, I think there's always like situations like that, that, you know, that you won't have time to necessarily plan for, but do you think, okay, like I bought some like pastries for a friend's birthday and...==

==I saw this person and I'm like, okay, they need the pastries more than my friend does for a buck. So I apologized to my friend. said, I did buy you some pastries, but on the way, they went to this homeless person and that friend was like, no, I love that. I love that. Like, I'm glad you did that. So I don't know, maybe like there's situations like that, just spontaneously just kind of, even if you haven't got anything to give.==

==This is, think, also important, even if you don't have anything to give, you've got no baguette to hand through the window, you've got no cash or whatever. Give them eye to eye contact. That person, homeless person that stood on the corner with their sign, give them eye to eye contact. I sometimes just say, I'm so sorry, I don't have anything. And I smile. And, you know, I haven't ever spoken to them about that, but I really do feel like just being seen.==

==important as well for these people that are going through what they're going through and so yeah just being that example to your child is important. There was a story I actually wrote in another book, an experience that I had here where I saw this homeless man and I was at an intersection and then from the other direction there was his car==

==with these young 20 year old young men who wound down their windows and they had, they started throwing their soda bottles and cans at this homeless man. And it was just very, it was, I couldn't do anything about it and it was a very emotional experience and came home and just was crying about it to my kids. And I said, if you were ever to do anything like that, like.==

==would be awful if their mums could have seen their sons doing that you know I'm sure they would have been just mortified and so even just sharing experiences my son who was able to drive picked up his keys and went off looking for that homeless man because he wanted to do something to help him and he ended up helping a refugee family and gave them dinner from McDonald's.==

==So I think just also sharing stories with your kids, sometimes it's hard. Like actually one of the lessons we did was on slavery, you know, through Open Ed and it was hard for my youngest son to learn about it and he didn't want to read about slavery. And, you know, I said to my son, said, but you know, this is part of history and we need to learn. If we don't learn about history, then how can the future be changed. And so sometimes it is hard to share those stories. I didn't want to share the story about the homeless band being thrown at and hurt, but it helps open their eyes that, you know.==

==A lot of these people that are vulnerable are also marginalized. They're also demeaned. They're also not treated fairly. And so, you know, just highlighting that, you know, this homeless man was treated unfairly, you know, and he didn't deserve that. He was already in a really difficult situation and that just made him feel even worse.==

==Sorry, I've gone off on a tangent.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==No, I love that. was really interesting and I think speaks to the heart of like, right, we're all people, we're all humans and every single human has a soul and every single human. And I mean, these are my beliefs for sure, but like, think recognizing that, there's another quote, I'm a fan of quotes, but there's another quote by==

==a, okay, good. There's another quote by, I think it was a philosopher or somebody, and he was looking at somebody passing by who had worse circumstances than he, and he was like, his name was Philip, I think he was like, there goes Philip other than circumstance or other than the stroke of luck.==

==Like I could have been that person if I was born in an entirely different situation in an entirely different way. If things had gone very differently, like I could be that person. And I think that's a good thing to remember is that like the reason that these things matter is not because, you know, like.==

==Well, the reason that these things matter is because people matter and it could have been any of us, right? And if it is any of us one day, know, like we've all heard crazy stories about like somebody, you're having a car accident and their life's changing dramatically or just crazy things. Like you would want people to support you and help you. And I think that is really...==

==**Kerry:**== ==Yes, 100%.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==valuable just to be reminded of. I think something that, so initially I'd asked you the question about like, okay, well, how do you get involved whenever the stakes are high? Like whenever it's, it's a little bit harder to get involved and just stop by and say, come on and pop by. And I think part of that is, well, you mentioned things like create kits for people, like really think through, okay, who do I want to serve? And then think through, okay, what does this organization or what do these people need?==

==in order to do their job of the people to people kind of things better. So you were saying kits, I bet there are lot of things where you can support the people who support people. That's if like you're going to pick a Saturday and you're gonna do it once every couple of months and that's it. But I think there's also another question of like, okay, but do you actually wanna get involved? Because it works out really, really well.==

==**Kerry:**== ==Mm-hmm.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==to get involved and deeply involved with one organization and to say, like this is our mission. Like this is what we're going to focus on. This is who we're gonna get to know. And like maybe over time, right, you find other missions around you and you also do those things as well. But it actually is quite valuable to say, okay, this is what I'm gonna dive into and we're actually gonna learn about this and we're actually going to do this consistently at whatever cadence we can maintain as a family. I think there's...==

==Part of it is like, yes, there are barriers to entry for just like dropping in and volunteering, but the other part of it is, well, how badly do you want to volunteer? like, it's probable that those barriers to entry are there for a reason. So I think that's all such great advice and so many great thoughts for, I think just families to think about whenever it comes to, okay, what kind of kids do you want to raise? Right? We want happy and healthy kids, but we also want kids that are==

==productive members of society that look at society and say, what are the problems that I can help solve? And that find their purpose, right? And like, I think it's interesting, but like most of the time purpose has to do with other people and the people around you and the way that things connect. So getting people more involved in the community is never a bad thing.==

==**Kerry:**== ==Yeah.==

==**Kerry:**== ==Yeah, there was a school that did a project called "To Walk in Their Shoes"—actually it was a class in a school and the teacher had asked the kids to learn about refugees coming from Afghanistan and refugees coming from all the different countries. It was awesome. We were able to go in and I took some refugees with me into this class, and these kids knew their stuff.==

==They had really delved in. They understood the culture, the foods, how hard it would be to adjust to a new land, their faith and so forth. I was quite emotional when I left because I just thought these kids were incredible. They really had delved into that whole philosophy of walking in their shoes. And I just loved it.==

==And these refugees felt really uplifted. I feel like you can give those people who feel like their situation is hopeless hope by just learning a bit about them and their struggle and how we could help them.==

==**Ela Richmond:**== ==I love this. This has been so beautiful. It's very refreshing to talk with you and to hear your story and just to hear how much you care. I think something that is quite difficult in the world is just finding people who care. So thank you so, so very much.==

==**Kerry:**== ==Thank you.==

# ==Anjan Katta: Returning Computing to Its Hippie Ideals==

_==Open Ed Podcast with Charlie Deist==_

---

==**Anjan:**== ==It's all about the mind. It's all about productivity. I'm trying to get smarter. But I'm so dysregulated. My circadian rhythms are so toast. I'm so disembodied. I didn't quite appreciate how much the screen, the light, the appearance of a computer—it's dysregulating. The blue light. This thing called flicker. The oversaturated colors and high contrast. Your computer is trying to simulate a Vegas casino. They have figured out to a science, this is how you put the human and their nervous system and physiological state to be most susceptible to getting stuck into these dopamine loops.==

==**Charlie Deist:**== ==Welcome back to the Open Ed Podcast. I'm Charlie Deist, sometimes known as the open ed newsletter guy, coming out from the shadows, away from my usual indoor desk, into the sunlight for a conversation with Anjan Katta, who is the founder of Daylight Computer. Probably my favorite piece of hardware, maybe my favorite piece of technology. Anjan, welcome to the podcast.==

==**Anjan:**== ==Thanks for having me on Charlie. It's delightful to be here.==

==**Charlie:**== ==I want to start with your story. There's a Wired article that I couldn't actually access because it was gated and I don't subscribe to Wired. But the title of the article is something about how Daylight is returning computing to its hippie ideals. It's one of these interesting facts about Silicon Valley that a lot of the giants—you think of Steve Jobs, Stewart Brand, a lot of the people that were around in the early days of Silicon Valley—they had this combination of a technical background but also this very freewheeling creativity.==

==**Anjan:**== ==Right. A lot of people don't know this, but the essence of computing, the early pioneers who were behind it, they were all hippies. The core big idea they had was the human potential movement—we as humans could be and do so much more and feel then what society conditions us to be. And the idea for computers is they are our friends, our sidekicks, our exoskeleton to help us be the best versions of ourselves.==

==There's a funny way that that is the core idea of computing, and what computing has become since then is totally different and totally the opposite of that. Instead of an expansion of who you are, it's a disassociation. It's a mechanization. It's a dehumanization. It's taking away so many aspects of our humanity. It's all about the mind. It's all about productivity, about efficiency. And frankly, you don't even get that with how distracting it is.==

==I think that mirrors my own life and what led me to Daylight. Ever since I was a kid, I've just been a very sensitive person. ADHD, stimuli, novelty, always fidgeting, running around really hyper, and very susceptible to lights. I have seasonal affective disorder, so I'm sensitive to light. I need to be outside if I'm stuck inside all the time. I was sensitive to the seasons, and that's where seasonal affective disorder really comes to be. My sleep was sensitive, so blue light always would just keep me up. It would affect everybody around me, but for me it really would overstimulate my nervous system and keep me up at night.==

==I sort of just shut down all my body and all my sensitivity because life was just too overstimulating, the artificiality of reality, and found my home in books. My dad's a psychiatrist, so our house was covered in all sorts of crazy books—reality is one way, but here's the deep truth of it, whether that's for food or for economics. I ended up spending a lot of my life from here. I grew up in a small town. There wasn't that much to do. Books became my way.==

==Starting from that place of learning and being in my head and being analytical and always accumulating knowledge, that just took me to computers where computers were another way to get really smart and be in my head. I found you could find books online for free and articles and Wikipedia. The books around me were never as limitless as what I could find online. I just tried to consume as much information as possible. I would read and read and read for hours and my eyes were sensitive, so at a certain point, they thought I had glaucoma, but it was actually just such extreme eye strain from being on computers.==

==I was going more and more into my head, more and more into consuming information, trying to get smarter. I think that is actually a reflection of what computers are and what computers try to be. They're just about being completely heady. They completely disembody you, and their promise is like, hey, you're going to be way smarter. Hey, you're going to be able to think better thoughts.==

==The thing I faced in my personal life is, oh my God, this is fraudulent in the sense like I'm reading more, I'm trying to get smarter, but I'm so dysregulated. My circadian rhythms are so toast. I'm so disembodied. I don't remember what I'm reading the next day. I don't even know what I learned. I'm not able to articulate it because my brain and nervous system is frazzled. I'm basically just pretending. Because when you so fetishize the mind and getting smarter and learning and you don't take care of all of your being, it's sort of fake.==

==Seeing that in my own life and facing it and the grief of you're not actually getting smarter here, you're not actually learning as much as you think you are—that made me realize there is no real learning, thinking, true contemplation, true expansion of yourself if you don't take care of the entire stack of your being: your mind, body and spirit, your nervous system.==

==The point of Daylight was like, oh wow, okay. This has hit me as a key wisdom of my life. How do we now refactor computers to reflect this as well?==

==**Charlie:**== ==I heard recently someone describe the internet as the library of Alexandria times ten or times a hundred, but the limiting factor on what allows us to absorb it is not the amount of information or even the interface that we use to interact with it. It's literally the screen.==

==I've had that experience too. I was on screens a lot growing up—video games, computers. I remember the first Macintosh, the one with the swivel screen. I'm sure I was just glued to that thing for hours and my eyesight started to deteriorate. Around my sophomore year of high school, I started to have to strain to be able to see the whiteboard in the classroom. And for the next maybe ten years, my eyesight just kept getting worse and worse. That myopia, progressive deterioration, it's also mirrored in what you're describing with the hyper compression into this headspace.==

==There was a term Marshall McLuhan used to describe modernity—he's talking about the hypertrophy of the eye, which we have literally where your eye muscles get locked in on closeup, and that's basically what nearsightedness is. But we also have it at a mental level where we abstract ourselves into the machine almost. You use the term dysregulate. What in your research is the connection between the screens that we use and some of those underlying symptoms?==

==**Anjan:**== ==My first impression was like, oh, it's just these algorithms. They're so addicting. It's the fact that you can open 300 tabs and you get 20 links. It's only the software that's the problem. To be totally frank, even upstream of that, I thought the problem was myself. I don't have enough willpower, I don't have enough discipline. I'm not good enough.==

==Once I got over beating myself up, which I think is a very honest experience with computers today—you blame yourself for not being good enough because of the way you use it—then you sort of realize, wait a minute, the software here is a huge perpetrator. These things are diabolically designed to be as addicting as possible. That is dramatically different than early computers. That's even dramatically different than computers 20 years ago.==

==But the next layer that really opened me up, and that's where Daylight comes from, is I didn't quite appreciate how much the screen, the light of a computer, the appearance of a computer actually deeply plays a role in the way it's dysregulating. What I learned is: number one, the blue light from computers; number two, this thing called flicker, which I can explain in a second; number three, the brightness mismatch with the rest of the environment; number four, the oversaturated colors and high contrast that a computer has; and number five, it keeps us indoors. All five of these really contribute to dysregulating you at a vagal and nervous system level, at breathing and tidal volume level, at blink rates.==

==And to your point, the associated mood tone, cognitive tone, because that comes from the hypertrophy of the eyes, your dopamine system, your melatonin and circadian system, and all the metabolic processes that come out of that. It's a fancy way of saying basically your body gets put on high alert, high arousal, high stimulation when you're on a computer.==

==The simplest tagline to describe it would be: basically your computer is trying its best job to simulate a Vegas casino in terms of its light environment. The Vegas casino blocks out all the natural light. They have incredibly bright lights. It's a ton of blue light. It's all flashing and flickering, and it's all extremely oversaturated. They do that because they have figured out to a science, this is how you put the human and their nervous system and physiological state to be most susceptible to getting stuck into these dopamine loops, most stuck into these consumptive stimming loops. That's essentially in a smaller way what our computer is doing to us.==

==Just one small example that I find so illustrative: when we feel more tense when we use a computer, one of the reasons why is there's a phenomenon called screen apnea. There is sleep apnea—that's the common one, which is while you sleep, you don't breathe, and there's a whole host of problems in your life that comes from that. Well, some researchers realized there is the equivalent of that for screens and they call it screen apnea. Basically because you have sympathetic overregulation and not enough parasympathetic, and this deer-in-the-headlights response you get with the light of a computer, you actually, when you're on a computer, the screen apnea phenomenon is: one, you breathe less—you literally take less breaths per minute. And number two, your tidal volume is less, meaning you actually breathe shallower. The combination of these two is you're dysregulated. You're a bit more anxious.==

==I could go on, but there's a litany of ways that computers physiologically actually put us in a place that then makes us dysregulated for the rest of our day, but also then more susceptible to the dopamine slot machines that are the YouTubes and TikToks and the feeds. It's a vicious cycle that builds on top of each other. I was like, we have to start with light. That same Vegas casino slot machine on the side of a beautiful river in Northern California, the Yuba River or something? It's not as addicting. There is something about the design of the entire light environment that plays a role. That's why we wanted to reinvent the screen of a computer to really get at the heart of the way the computer uses light to affect us.==

==**Charlie:**== ==Well, I'm just going to briefly show—this is my Daylight. I was an early adopter, so I think I got in maybe in the second or third round that you guys were shipping these. I was super excited to get my hands on one, and it was one of these things where one way to look at it is basically like a faster, more responsive Kindle. But another way is really it's a replacement for your laptop or your desktop.==

==I could have a whole separate conversation about the combination of the new dictation tools to totally change the way that we interact with computers. Less of this hunched over typing locked in, and in a more expansive state where you're maybe using the stylus a little bit and you're speaking and you're interacting with it in a much more detached way. It's putting it back in its place as a tool rather than a machine.==

==I see a lot of debate about the classroom and same thing for homeschoolers doing distance learning or virtual learning. There's this debate about like Chromebook versus textbook or adaptive apps versus pen and paper. Which one is better for kids learning and kids cognition? I think there's sort of a false dichotomy there. We can have now, because of the e-ink technology—what was the technological breakthrough that allowed this and how did you come to understand e-ink as being such a break from traditional screens?==

==**Anjan:**== ==I had this notion like, how do we rethink a computer to be healthy, physically healthy, mentally healthy, and then hopefully intellectually healthy? I was looking around at how do I change light? Over time I wanted to change ergonomics. I wanted to change EMFs, I wanted to change materials to be natural. There's a whole swath of ways to make it more humanistic. But it kept coming back to light. I was like, okay, what's my favorite environment to think and learn something? It's outside, under a tree with a moleskin in my hands, right? Thinking and doodling and this. I was like, this paper is just calm.==

==There's of course many beautiful benefits to paper. You never need to charge it. It's there. It lasts forever. But even putting that aside, just the way paper is so calm, you can use it outside in the sun. Even at nighttime it's—obviously you need to have a lamp or something, but it's just, it doesn't demand. It doesn't put strain on me. It's not intense in the way a computer is. I was like, is there a way to make a piece of paper digital? If I could control Spotify from a piece of paper, if I could read my homework that I would have to have or a PDF or a contract I'm doing, or if I could do my emails, write my emails by hand and send them out—why do I need to go to a computer?==

==You very quickly turn to Kindles and e-ink as the best version of this digital paper. Something that's analog, but actually has computational capabilities and can have apps and PDFs and docs. The main problem we ran into when we tried to turn Kindles into basically iPad replacements or Chromebook replacements is the screen is so slow. The actual screen technology is so slow. You can't actually use it for computer stuff. You can't scroll, you can't zoom in, you can't type easily on the keyboard. You can't scroll through results and search. You can't swipe to the next page very quickly. It's good for Harry Potter and it's not good for what I wanted, which was for it to replace my iPad, to replace my laptop.==

==We went on a six-year journey of basically figuring out how to make these e-paper screens fast enough that they could actually be able to replace what we have to do with a computer, whether it's in school or work or Spotify or Audible or a book you're trying to read, while also retaining the analog paper-like benefits of no blue light, no flicker, being able to use it outdoors, being able to use it at nighttime, being able to have it in a way that's not overstimulating for you.==

==I essentially found an old Japanese technology that some crazy professor has been spending 30 plus years working on and connected it with another material science breakthrough from the Netherlands and from Florida State. Long story short, I was like, okay, if we put this all together, maybe this could solve this key technical problem that makes it so slow. I thought we would do it in two years and it took six years.==

==**Charlie:**== ==Talk a little more about that as a learning process. You're connecting the dots between these different fields. The information, the knowledge hadn't been synthesized into any single source. You had to connect the dots. How were you in the position to or how did you put yourself in the position to connect those dots? Just as a microcosm of how innovation happens.==

==**Anjan:**== ==I'm so glad you asked this question. There's such a good lesson for the wider world here. There's so many innovations that we all would just say we obviously want that are just waiting there because of structural reasons. The entire reason I was able to come up with this is because I was not in the field. Because I was completely new and completely naive to this. I think that's the entire reason I was able to do it.==

==Why? It's because everybody else in the field who believed in these paper-like computer screens, the best they could do is what came in the Kindle. And believe it or not, that was invented in the nineties. It even starts earlier in the seventies if you go all the way back. All the people who believed in it basically just ran out of juice. They've persisted for five years, they persisted for ten years, but after 15 they're like, I can't do this anymore.==

==When you go talk to the key professors, when you talk to the companies, they all had the right idea, but they were too early and it just took too long to create a lot of these underlying material science process technologies—lithography etching, gel polymers, dichroic dyes, I could go on. Everybody in this field is like, this is a graveyard. This is a dead end. For 20 years, everybody's been saying it's three years away and look, nothing has ever worked out.==

==Of course I had to get really lucky, but when I started to look, I did it with open eyes. I didn't know that this has been a graveyard of a field and some of the key breakthroughs happened in 2008, in 2012, in 2015, in 2018. It's sort of interesting that it's so proportional almost. The people who tried in 2010, they didn't have those other breakthroughs. The people who tried in 2014, the people who tried in 2003. I just showed up and finally after 30 years, enough of the underlying technologies had matured enough.==

==Because I was not a professor in one particular field, I wasn't working for Apple in one display division, I was willing to look at a much broader—I was not a specialist—much broader set of things. One of the crucial papers was not even from displays, it was used in other opto-electronic applications and I brought it together.==

==I think that combination of being naive enough to look widely, to not be jaded when everybody else is like, this is dead—sometimes it takes an outsider or a beginner's mind—allowed me to put this all together and be like, this works on paper. And every expert, I'm like, they're like, no, no, no, no. There's no way this works. They couldn't ever say specifically, and I'd give them my math and I'd say, here, there's so many photons. This is how they did it, this is the angles, and can you prove my math's wrong? And they go, nah, but it's not going to work. And whatever my personality type is, I'm like, oh, you haven't told me this is wrong. So I kept going and going and going and going.==

==The Japanese professor was generous enough to take me under his wing, provided his lab to create the first prototypes. Japan was where we did this. It turns out it sort of worked. It tells me how many other fields are there where if a beginner came in, was curious—it did take me two years of deeply studying, being part of it, going to every conference, reading the textbooks. I did have to put my work in, but I'm like, how many other fields are out there that if somebody came in and was curious, in two years you can go to the edge of human innovation? I was average and by the end of it, no one else has come up with this. That's very empowering for how many other things.==

==**Charlie:**== ==A variation of the story comes up so many times. It's kind of like a version of the hero's journey in a way. It's the story of entrepreneurship, rebel academics, people that crack the problem that's eluded the field for a long time. The common thread seems to be they had that mindset of either not knowing that it was impossible or not taking that as a final answer from the people who are supposedly the experts in the field.==

==An entrepreneur seems to be the ultimate autodidact. You have to be able to dive into so many different fields. You mentioned that you got access to the Japanese professor's lab, but just to get to that point, you were operating on a little bit of faith that the answer was possible before you could see it. You had to have the faith that this would actually be possible.==

==At this point, what's to stop one of these big tech giants from coming in, whether it's Amazon with their Kindles or Apple, and kind of taking the underlying technology and just putting their operating system on it?==

==**Anjan:**== ==We spent two years making an RVN Linux, that's a sort of solo OS. We had to throw it away, but the idea was we truly wanted our own operating system that had no Google tracking, no spying. Privacy and security and sovereignty matter a lot to me. But turns out that's—you need a lot more resources to get that to production. So that's another day.==

==To answer your question, the anti-capitalist answer here is I just want in some sense to show the world there is a total other way to do computers that don't need to be so unhealthy. Now it does have a trade-off. The computers are black and white. They're grayscale, right? So they're not for Netflix, they're not for playing Fortnite. But the whole point is there's a lot of other stuff on computers where you don't really need oversaturated stimulating colors if you're listening to an audiobook or reading a book or whatever it may be.==

==I think it would be delightful if people realize this was a way and at all different price points. Obviously a startup has so little scale, things have to be expensive and even then you don't make much money. I think it'd be delightful for people to adopt this and all schools and Chromebooks and tablets and so on could have this technology. Long term I am actually not opposed to that. Maybe my investors would not enjoy me saying this. So that's one perspective on it.==

==The second perspective is it just turns out it's really difficult to copy us on this. There are some very subtle technologies. We have like five patents on it, and these companies can be pretty brutal, so they will eventually find a way to copy you, but there's a lot of different process technologies. There's one manufacturer in the world right now that can actually implement our IP and we have an exclusivity with them for the next couple years. So that helps, at least in the short term. We get a chance to actually bring this into the world and not get squished so quickly.==

==The third thing is, I think generally companies are pretty pessimistic, cynical about things like this. Like who wants a healthier black and white computer? People are dumb. They just want colors. They just want to get distracted. They call it the innovator's dilemma. It's not that they can't do it, they just think it's small and dumb and unrealistic, and then by the time it proves people aren't dumb, they actually do want to reclaim their health, they want to reclaim their attention, they want to not piss away their time, by that time it's too late. The small guy now has his own momentum.==

==**Charlie:**== ==In some sense the consumer appetite for shiny objects functions as a bit of a moat for you guys, that you still have this a little bit more niche audience of more concerned consumers who are worried about their relationship with technology. I think probably there are no consumers who are more concerned about screens than parents with their kids.==

==You hear all this talk about the zombified kid after being on an iPad for an hour. In some cases, they might not even become a zombie—that's the wrong analogy because they're overstimulated. When you take the object away from them, maybe they kind of look like a zombie when they're glued into it, but then they're dysregulated, right? They're keyed up and it's not good.==

==The handful of times I've made the mistake of letting my kids who are three and six use the iPad on occasion, just watching Daniel Tiger or whatever, it's like I definitely don't want that to be the default of how they interact with devices. But at the same time, I do see the potential for personalized learning and there are all these adaptive AI apps that are coming out and it feels like you could be leaving money on the table or learning on the table by just refusing to use technology altogether.==

==That's where I think this technology, whether it's in the schools or parents who are being more selective, it's worth seriously considering, given that kids are spending so much time even outside of school on their devices. The time that we want to put them on devices when they're in school has to be more intentional and we can't ignore what seems like just a lot of mounting evidence that this has very real effects and the effects are not evenly distributed. Some kids might do fine on a regular Chromebook, but the people like you, the more sensitive kid—and I think I might be in the same boat. I don't know if it's a gene or a lot of genes.==

==**Anjan:**== ==Especially those of us who are neurodivergent, we're the ones most susceptible to the way existing computers are built.==

==**Charlie:**== ==Tell us about the new initiative with Daylight Kids.==

==**Anjan:**== ==The high level thing to share here also is not to say that because we've made a healthier screen, we've made a healthier computer—that's the important part. The important part is actually just being outside, being in the dirt, having your hands on physical things, playing with other kids, playing with other people. That to me is the real sauce.==

==The reason we exist is because it's unrealistic and probably not in the best interest of your child's development to be a Luddite, to completely get away with technology. So the point of Daylight is almost like the least computer possible, and you do what you need to and you put it away and you go outside and you put your hands in the dirt and you play with other people. That's the high level of how we think about this.==

==There are aspects of technology that are either hard to get rid of because school has them or they're actually useful, like an audiobook or Spotify or it's actually a very powerful way to stimulate your own kids' learning and thinking and curiosity and expression. Some of the adaptive learning apps that you're talking about—people know about Khan Academy. There's new things like Reading.com and Ava and Alpha Schools and Time Back, which for all intents and purposes are 80% book, 20% teacher, and the teacher is embedded in it. It's personalized to you, and the same way a tutor is like, okay, that's too difficult for you. Let's do this. Okay, you didn't seem to quite get that. Let me do that. Basically, instead of needing a tutor to be there, the actual quote-unquote textbook has that. That's inherently digital.==

==The hope is Daylight gives you a safe, healthy, clean way to be able to access these things. I love the promise here is not like my kid's going to be a million times smarter. Though that may be directionally also true. It's instead of now four hours and more tantrums and more difficulty to have the kid be engaged or do it, it gets done in an hour or 45 minutes and they're engaged and now there's more time. Now you don't have all these negative associations and emotions around learning or reading or this. Frankly, I think this idea that we need YouTube and games is the only way to keep kids engaged, I don't think is true. It's like sugary candy—if that's all that's there, they're going to pick it every time over hummus and carrots. But if hummus and carrots are there, they objectively taste good if your senses haven't been ruined by the other things.==

==We came up with Daylight Kids. It basically has kids software. It's blocked from the internet and distracting apps. It's just got books and drawing and stories and learning apps. It's just the good parts of the digital world. The goal here is to just allow a little bit of digital into your life without it taking over.==

==**Charlie:**== ==My last question here is sort of thinking about the future and different futures that could evolve. We've all seen Apple Vision Pro and there was a lot of fanfare at first. I feel like there's some sense in which most people still kind of recoil at the idea of full-on virtual reality. It's still a little too dystopian. Whenever I put those things on, I just immediately get motion sickness, really bad, and I want to run in the other direction. They just released the iPhone 17 and it's basically the same iPhone, just a little bit slimmer, a little bit shinier, and that seems to be like Apple's only trick these days. Just thinner and shinier.==

==**Anjan:**== ==And shinier.==

==**Charlie:**== ==Right. I wonder if Steve Jobs might have been more on this bandwagon, like if the technology had existed. If he'd be designing a beautiful full desktop—I mean like your whole desktop is a surface, is a computable surface that you can write on and draw on. I think I heard you talk in another interview a little bit about that as sort of the big picture vision. Can you speak to that a little bit and sort of how could this be integrated into the classroom? What are some futures that you see? Where are we going to go with computers?==

==**Anjan:**== ==I think regardless of what future you map out, one of the key questions for human society is: what does a wise relationship to technology look like? It's as simple as that. The point of Daylight is what's the best wisdom we can bring together of what makes a thriving human? It turns out you can't have any discussion if you don't have health. You can have everything in the world, but if your health's not there. You start going up the stack. You can have everything in the world, but if your nervous system is shot, you won't be able to enjoy it.==

==If we can start with the principles of what's the stack that allows a whole human that can then thrive, then the goal of computers is, okay, what are the different capacities a human has that we can take advantage of? One of them is to be spatial. Now we're making basically a fat piece of paper with the tablet, and that's always the way I relate to what a tablet is. It's a fat, magical piece of paper. But to your point, why can't whiteboards? Why can't our desks, why can't other things be calm, feel analog, be part of our house or interior design, not be impinging on our attention or nervous system, but when you want to be like, okay, what's my plan for the week? Or what's the habit streak I'm on? Or what's this physiotherapy thing I want to be doing? Maybe you've seen these Skylight calendars and things like that. It's nice to potentially have these computational surfaces.==

==In lieu of not having them, this is my place. You can see I try to do the analog equivalent of it. I would not recommend this. This is a little bit like conspiracy theory, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia style. But I think this is our vision: how do we have computers that magically disappear into your environment, but give you magic back? I think of Tom Riddle's diary in Harry Potter as the most inspiring example of what technology can be, or the newspapers if Sirius Black's shouting on it, or the Marauder's Map. For all intents and purposes, they feel analog, but they're magical. They can react to you. They have their intelligence, they can help you. To me, that's where I want computers to go, where it's not about computers, it's about magical objects and surfaces we have in our world. And none of that matters if it's not respectful of your attention, your nervous system, your health.==

==In the short term, it'll look like potentially us making a healthy phone, a desktop monitor with a Daylight screen. But further than that, I think it'd be really cool—we're talking about the long term here—to make computational surfaces.==

==**Charlie:**== ==It's a future I'm very excited for and hope that I'll be able to remain an early adopter. It's the only piece of technology that I feel good about bringing into my bedroom and even into my bed for bedtime reading. I often will just switch it onto airplane mode and put it under my pillowcase. Actually I love how the case that it came in—you guys send a little, it's like a little pillowcase around the computer. I feel like if I were to ever go camping, I'd bring that along and I would just use that as my pillow.==

==I know that there's more exciting things coming and the feature that I'm most excited about that I saw you demoing on your Twitter the other day is this little yellow button here on the side. Can you tell me more about why you installed this button before it had a function?==

==**Anjan:**== ==Oh, I'm so glad you asked. There are two main form factors of computers. One is like, oh, I need to do real work, and you need to sit on your laptop or desktop and be hunched over and your shoulders hurt and you're clicking and clacking away, and it's not necessarily the best environment for you, but it's where you have to be. Or you're on your phone, but then your pinky is crooked and you're holding something and it's small.==

==It's felt like these are the two main ways we've been able to do things with computers. I've always felt like the key part of a tablet is it's like holding a book or a legal pad. It's very, as you're saying, lean back. It's a little more expansive. You can be on a couch, you can be on the grass, you can be at a picnic table. It allows you to be in a far greater variety of environments, especially this guy where you can see it outside, but you previously couldn't do serious work on a tablet because tablet keyboard is hard.==

==What really changes this is voice. Because if a computer can understand you and you can just speak into it to type and dictate and ask it to change things and "hey, bold this and justify that, and here I'm going to dictate this part of what I'm doing," then this actually becomes a serious computer. There's no longer a huge disadvantage to you at your desktop with a click-clack keyboard. The point of that button on the side is regardless of where you are in the operating system, we want to make it super easy. We call it the walkie-talkie button for you to be able to just talk and dictate into the thing. Our hope is this creates a new dimension of lean back computing that allows you to still do the stuff you really have to do for school or work or whatever.==

==**Charlie:**== ==I'm a big fan of the voice dictation already just on my desktop, and once I need to start to exercise the muscle of using the Daylight as my primary device—and I feel like there's kind of a learning curve with all these things. You have to—I feel like I'm sort of like the old person who's adapting to a smartphone or something after years of only using word processing on a desktop. But the possibilities I think for kids' education, getting the academic stuff done in a shorter amount of time, but then also just being able to let your imagination run wild and to do your own deep research into the things you're interested in, to be able to be reading and click that button and ask a question about what's on the screen and have it fill in with that context—this is the future of computing. I'm certain of that. I think you guys are doing a lot of good by trying to reclaim the soul of the original Silicon Valley ideas, that freewheeling creativity.==

==Anything else? I know Daylight Kids is ramping up, and I want our families to know that Daylight computers would be reimbursable with their technology allowance. So if your kid is dysregulated, being in front of the computer too much, this is something that is worth a try. And the device, it's under a thousand, right? What's the price point?==

==**Anjan:**== ==$729 with our Kids bundle.==

==**Charlie:**== ==Fantastic. Any kind of closing comments? Speak to the kid in the audience or the child of the parent who's listening, who might be someone like you growing up. Speak to that child right now.==

==**Anjan:**== ==I love the way one of our customers said it. They're like, my kid loves the Daylight because when they previously had an iPad, they were only allowed 45 minutes of screen time a week. I give them unlimited screen time with the Daylight and it turns out there's something called Brilliant.org, which is like an educational game type thing. It turns out that's more interesting than picking on your sister, but less interesting than your backyard. That is what Daylight is for.==

==I would say it allows you to have the engaging aspects of a computer without it being bad for you. For parents, the way I would think about it is Daylight is a guilt-free or healthier iPad. You can think about it as replacing an iPad or if you don't want to give your four-year-old an iPad, here is a middle ground rather than giving them nothing. Or an eight-year-old who's really getting into reading, Daylight is a really great tool for that.==

==The other use case is this holidays we're launching a keyboard case. You can use Daylight as a Chromebook replacement. So for schoolwork and all the things where you're forced to use a Chromebook, our hope is here's a way for that to be a lot healthier. It's an iPad replacement and a Chromebook replacement. A lot of people use it as their secondary device as well. Weekends and nights and mornings, it's a Daylight. No other device is allowed into the bedroom except the Daylight. Then for their normal day, they can use their Windows or Mac. But whenever it's something more flexible, they're able to read something on a Daylight, read the newspaper, listen to Spotify, connect it to their speakers or whatever it is.==

==Our hope is a lot more kids can not be so dysregulated by computers and not have to be totally Luddites.==

==**Charlie:**== ==And adults too. I'm setting a New Year's resolution for myself. I know it's only September, but by January 1st, I want to be writing the Open Ed Daily. I want my default to be writing it with my new keyboard case or even better, would be with voice dictation. So Anjan, please tell me that I'm going to be able to get access to the voice dictation before next year.==

==**Anjan:**== ==We're finally getting the resources we need to hire the folks to do it, but I appreciate knowing that you can be one of the first people on the list.==

==**Charlie:**== ==All right, thanks again Anjan. It's been a pleasure talking with you. Go check it out. Daylight Computer, Daylight Kids. We'll hope to have you back on before long.==

==**Anjan:**== ==Hey, thanks for hosting us. Our goal is just to show people there can be hope. Computers don't need to be so terrible for you. There is another way and these big companies will not let you know this. So I'm glad podcasts like you exist so we can be the rebels.==

==**Charlie:**== ==All right, onward. Thanks Anjan.==

==**Anjan:**== ==Hey, bye.==

# ==The Three-World Collapse==

==The "olden days" weren't perfect, but there were three worldsthat stayed in their lanes:kid world(bikes, adventures, playing),adult world(politics, procedures, polyps), andfamily world(dinner, vacation, quality time). LenoreSkenazy—the infamous "World's Worst Mom" and founderof Free Range Kids—says we've completely lostthe boundaries between them. Kids used to vanish into their world after breakfast and reappear fordinner. Adults had their boring stuff. Families had their intentional together time. Now, parentsare texting their kids during recess.Even when we're not physically there, we'rethere. The worlds are out of whack.Skenazy's solution comes via a controversially-titled TED talk:== ==[Why you should spend less time with your kids.](https://www.ted.com/talks/lenore_skenazy_why_you_should_spend_less_time_with_your_kids)====" Her point: when kids organize their own games, they negotiaterules, handle disputes, learn compromise—the life skills we'redesperately trying to teach them.==

# ==The 40% Fear Floor==

==49% of parents are extremely or very concerned about a violent intruder entering their child's school—a 9-point increase from last year, with no major event triggering it. Not once since== ==[EdChoice started tracking this has the figure dropped below 40%](https://edchoice.morningconsultintelligence.com/assets/329770.pdf)====. It’s worth noting that students are 70 times more likely to die in a car accident than at school. A University of Michigan study found that 50% of parents won't even let their 9-11 year olds go to another aisle in the store. The math doesn't match the fear. But the fear is real.==

# ==Practical Life, Real Confidence==

==You might not be ready to send your nine-year-old on the subway alone. But here's what you CAN do today:== ==**start building "I did it myself" confidence at home.**== ==[[guidelinesonwhattypeofchor]]====:==

==Ages 1-3: toys in basket, wiping tables.  
Ages 4-7: setting the table, feeding pets, simple snacks.  
Ages 8-12: meal prep, laundry, vacuuming.==

==**IMPORTANT:**== ==Let them do it their way at first. Resist the urge to hover or correct.==

# Can AI teach your kid to think? | OpenEd (1)

# ==The Thing AI Can't Do==

==Claire Honeycutt spent two decades as a neuroscientist, receiving millions in federal funding for her research. Her husband builds AI. So when she== ==[writes about AI in education](https://www.clarified.life/p/drawing-the-line-where-ai-belongs)====, we listen.==

==**Tl;dr:**== ==AI can make learning== _==faster==_==—personalized pacing, adaptive quizzing, instant practice generation. Programs like Khan Academy and Synthesis Tutor excel at this. But learning is more than speed. It's reasoning, thinking, creating. And AI can't do those things, she says, because== _==it doesn't actually think==_==.==

=="AI was fed billions of human-created words and learned to predict what usually comes next," Claire explains. "It gives the illusion of thought."==

==Basically, it's auto-predict on steroids. Which is useful (when it’s not correcting omw to ‘On My Way!’). But it's not the same as teaching a child to have an original idea.==

==That still requires humans.==

# ==Kids Are Hacking AI Tutors==

=="Programs that use AI tutors can be easily gamed," Claire warns. "Kids learn the 'cheat codes,' racing to the right answer without real understanding." Her youngest daughter was particularly adept at this—gaming AI tutors without learning anything.==

==The pattern is predictable. AI adjusts difficulty based on performance. Get answers right, move ahead faster. So clever kids click through quickly, use trial and error, or look up answers. The AI thinks they've mastered the concept (they've mastered something, but it’s not the concept).==

==For families using AI tools like== ==[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)== ==or== ==[Math Academy](https://mathacademy.com/)====, Claire's advice is simple: be present. Not to teach the content—AI handles that. But to verify understanding. Ask them to explain what they just "mastered." Have them teach it back to you. Use AI for drill work, but check the learning yourself.==

# ==Custom Coloring Pages==

==**One thing AI can do?**== ==Generate custom coloring pages from any book your kids are reading.==

==Here’s how it works:==

1. ==Go to== ==[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)== ==or== ==[Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)====, with image generation turned on. In Gemini, it’s called “Nano Banana” (don’t ask).==
2. ==Modify this prompt== ==**"Create a simple black and white coloring page suitable for children, showing [describe scene*]. Clear outlines, minimal detail, easy to color."**==
3. ==Save and print.==

==*====**Examples:**== =="Bilbo Baggins meeting Smaug the Dragon," "Charlotte weaving “Some Pig” above Wilbur’s pen", "Matilda reading a tall stack of library books."==

==Kids love it because they get to color their favorite scenes, and it makes the stories more tangible.==
