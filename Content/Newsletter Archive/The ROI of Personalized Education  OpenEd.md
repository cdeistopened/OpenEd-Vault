## ==💡 THOUGHT==

### ==The ROI of Personalized Ed==

==We keep hearing that personalized education is “too expensive.” But what’s the real cost?==

==Jonathan Chizik, a co-founder of SmartPath,== [==runs the numbers==](https://smartpath.school/the-roi-of-homeschooling?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=061-the-roi-of-personalized-education)==:==

- ==Traditional private schools: $12,000-30,000/year==
- ==Customized learning at home: $500-2,500/year==

==Meanwhile, Chizik notes== [==that homeschooled students score 15-30 percentile points higher on standardized tests than their traditionally schooled peers==](https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=061-the-roi-of-personalized-education)==. (Not that standardized tests are the gold standard—we’re more interested in creating lifelong learners than expert test-takers.)==

==**Think about that:**== ==Better results. Lower costs. More flexibility.==

==With today’s tools like Khan Academy, Outschool, and Time4Learning (to name just a few), personalized education isn’t just more affordable – it’s more effective.==

==Why do we think that learning must happen in expensive buildings, or that personalization is a luxury?==

### ==“They’re in the 8th Grade”==

==We’ve covered== ==_Dirty Jobs_== ==host== [==Mike Rowe’s campaign to bring attention to the shortage of skilled trade workers==](https://opened.co/uncategorized/mike-rowes-case-for-career-and-technical-education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=061-the-roi-of-personalized-education)==. Here’s his latest alarming stat:==

==**“For every five tradespeople who retire this year, two will replace them.”**==

==One company building nuclear submarines needs to hire 100,000 skilled workers in the next nine years. When== [==a newscaster asked Mike where to find these workers==](https://x.com/Holden_Culotta/status/1848751959827698048?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=061-the-roi-of-personalized-education)==, his answer was perfect:==

==**“They’re in the 8th grade.”**==

==While traditional schools push students toward four-year degrees, companies desperately seek skilled workers for six-figure jobs that don’t require college diplomas.==

==The jobs are there. The salaries are there. But our education system isn’t preparing students for these opportunities.==

### ==AI Meets Curriculum Planning: SmartPath Beta==

==Finding the right mix of resources for your child can feel like solving a puzzle with too many pieces. That’s why we’re intrigued by== [==SmartPath==](https://smartpath.school/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=061-the-roi-of-personalized-education)==, a new AI-powered tool entering beta testing.==

==The concept is simple: Answer a few questions about your child’s needs, interests, and learning style, and SmartPath’s AI suggests a curated list of homeschooling resources and options.==

==While the platform is still in beta (and we’re eagerly awaiting our chance to test it), early feedback from parent testers sounds promising:==

==Want to be among the first to try it? 👉 Join the waitlist== [==here==](https://smartpath.school/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=061-the-roi-of-personalized-education)==.==

==Meanwhile, we’re brainstorming our own tools for families doing Open Education.== ==**What features would you most want in a curriculum planner?**==

==Pop Quiz! Think eighth grade was easier in 1912? Take a peek at some questions from this graduation exam:==

- ==“Define longitude and latitude and give boundaries of the five zones.”==
- ==“Find cost at 12½ cents per sq. yd. of kalsomining the walls of a room 20 ft. long, 16 ft. wide and 9 ft. high, deducting 1 door 8 ft. by 4 ft. 6 in. and 2 windows 5 ft. by 3 ft. 6 in. each.”==
- ==“Name and locate these cities: Mobile, Quebec, Buenos Aires, Liverpool, Honolulu.” (Without Google Maps!)==

==And here we were, thinking “kalsomining” was just a typo. It’s actually a type of whitewash paint (we had to look it up).==

==That’s all for today!==
