- ==Be a great resource finder (aka "professional Googler")==
- ==Ask guiding questions rather than giving lectures==
- ==Help them develop independent research skills==

==You're not failing if you don't know everything. You're succeeding when you show your children how to learn anything.==

==**Concerns:**==

- ==High price point ($500/month)==
- ==Some parents report bugs and technical issues==
- ==Questions about screen time for very young children==

==For families seeking an alternative to private tutoring ($1000+/month) or elite preschools ($2500+/month), Mentava might offer an intriguing tech-driven option. But the steep price tag and mixed reviews suggest trying the 7-day free trial before committing.==
