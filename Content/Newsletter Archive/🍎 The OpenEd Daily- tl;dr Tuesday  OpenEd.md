==Welcome to another edition of tl;dr (too long; didn’t read) Tuesday, where we compress big ideas into bite-sized morsels.==

==**In this edition:**==

- ==**Podcast recap:**== ==Why AI won’t steal your job (but might make it more interesting) 🤖==
- ==Meet the 25-year-old homeschool-grad-turned-edupreneur (====**spoiler**====: she’s kind of a big deal) 🚀==
- ==**Audiobooks:**== ==A powerful alternative to screen time 🎧==

==Let’s dive in, shall we?==

### ==🎙️== ==**ICYMI… Why AI won’t replace humans in tech (podcast recap)**==

[==In the latest podcast==](https://opened.co/podcast/%f0%9f%8e%99%ef%b8%8fepisode-003-the-truth-about-tech-careers-in-2024-no-degree-required/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday)==, Isaac chats with Aaron Osmond, CEO of== [==Knowledge Pillars==](https://knowledge-pillars.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday)==, about the future of tech careers and why AI won’t make human skills obsolete.==

==**Here are 3 things you need to know:**==

### ==**1/ AI is a tool, not a replacement for human skills.**== 

==While AI makes things happen faster and more efficiently, it doesn’t solve every problem. Aaron emphasizes that understanding how to leverage AI effectively is becoming a crucial skill in itself.==

### ==**2/ Problem-solving and critical thinking are more important than ever.**== 

==The tech industry doesn’t just need coders; it needs people who can think critically about how to apply tools to solve real-world problems.==

==“If you don’t learn problem-solving and critical thinking skills, you will not be successful in any career, regardless of whatever tool you want to use.” – Aaron Osmond==

### ==**3/ Employers want hands-on, practical experience.**== 

==Forget multiple-choice tests about coding theory. The most valuable certifications put you in the driver’s seat, coding in real time and solving actual problems.==

### ==🚸== ==**LiberatED edupreneurs**==

==One of our favorite podcasts (besides our own, of course) is== [==LiberatED==](https://www.liberatedpodcast.com/podcast?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday)==, hosted by Kerry McDonald of the Foundation for Economic Education.==

==[====**Note**====: To those who might accuse OpenEd of jumping on the “-ED” bandwagon, we can only say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery – and that great minds think alike.]==

==Each episode features inspiring conversations with microschool founders and other “edupreneurs.” This week, we’re highlighting a guest who embodies OpenEd’s mission.==

==**Meet Nasiyah Isra-Ul:**== ==homeschool graduate, education advocate, and founder of== [==Homeschool EmpowerED==](https://www.homeschoolempowered.org/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday) ==(yes, there’s that “-ED” again!) – all before 25. Her journey from creating curricula for her brother at 14 to serving 1,100+ families showcases the power of unconventional education in fostering entrepreneurship.==

==“I wouldn’t have had the time to focus on entrepreneurship, learn about innovation, and start working as an online tutor at 14 if I hadn’t been homeschooled.” – Nasiyah Isra-Ul==

==Here’s her advice for empowering young entrepreneurs:==

1. ==**“Find your people”:**== ==Build a supportive community that believes in your vision from the start. Look beyond traditional networks to find mentors, collaborators, and supporters who share your passion.==
2. ==**“Work on your pitch”**====: Clearly communicate your ideas to gain support and resources.==
3. ==**“Embrace being unique”**====: See your youth and perspective as assets, not liabilities. Your fresh viewpoint and digital-native skills can be powerful advantages in solving problems.==

==Listen to the full episode== [==here==](https://www.liberatedpodcast.com/podcast/episode/1a14007f/youth-entrepreneurship-and-empowerment-with-nasiyah-isra-ul?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday) ==and check out the trailer for Nasiyah’s new documentary about homeschool life in Virginia.==

### ==📉== ==**Quick Bite: 5 Ways Audiobooks Boost Kids’ Learning**==

[==A recent article from==](https://www.the74million.org/article/want-to-spur-your-childs-intellectual-development-use-audiobooks-instead-of-videos/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday) [==_The 74_==](https://www.the74million.org/article/want-to-spur-your-childs-intellectual-development-use-audiobooks-instead-of-videos/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday) [==highlights how audiobooks can be a powerful alternative to screen time==](https://www.the74million.org/article/want-to-spur-your-childs-intellectual-development-use-audiobooks-instead-of-videos/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday) ==for nurturing your child’s intellectual growth.==

==Here are five ways they enhance learning:==

1. ==**Spark imagination:**== ==Unlike videos, audiobooks encourage kids to visualize stories, training their “mind’s eye” and boosting problem-solving skills.==
2. ==**Sharpen listening:**== ==Active listening to audiobooks improves focus and concentration.==
3. ==**Expand vocabulary:**== ==Exposure to rich, varied language in context helps children learn new words and proper pronunciation.==
4. ==**Foster independence:**== ==Following complex narratives and making connections promotes self-directed learning and improves study skills.==
5. ==**Protect eyesight:**== ==By eliminating screens, audiobooks give children’s eyes a much-needed break, potentially reducing vision problems.==

==**Bonus tip:**== ==Audiobooks are great for car rides, bedtime routines, or engaging reluctant readers. Many are available for free through local libraries or apps like== [==LibriVox==](https://librivox.org/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday)==.==

==That’s all for this edition.==
