### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**THE LEGO LESSON**==

=="Education advances through people willing to try new approaches - to see the mountain of possibilities where others see only one prescribed path."==

_==Open Education==_==, Chapter 5==

==In their new book, Matt and Isaac tell the story of Ole Kirk Christiansen, whose observation of how children play with toys led him to create LEGO - a system where simple, interchangeable blocks could build almost anything.==

[![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/a80ff39d-3588-44d1-a1fb-aa41840592d3/image.png?t=1745883704)](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/a80ff39d-3588-44d1-a1fb-aa41840592d3/image.png?t=1745883704)

==This LEGO analogy captures what we call== _==the open education mindset.==_ ==LEGO's success illustrates how creativity flourishes within a framework of simple, flexible rules (much like how we’ve seen families thrive when given the right building blocks for designing their child’s education).==

==As Matt and Isaac write, "The key isn't finding every possible resource - it's identifying the right ones for your child's interests and needs."==

==What learning blocks are you helping your child connect today?==

### ==📊 TREND==

## ==**BREAKING DOWN THE FALSE BINARY**==

==For decades, we've faced a false choice in education:== ==**traditional school or homeschool**====. Open education is about shattering this binary.==

==In== _==Open Education==_==, Matt and Isaac aren't just offering critique of either/or thinking —they're creating== ==**an entirely new category in the education landscape**====. While existing categories like homeschooling, unschooling, and micro-schooling have paved important paths, "open education" represents a distinct mindset that transcends any single approach.==

==This new category is emerging at a crucial moment. Parents increasingly recognize that existing labels don't capture what they're looking for—the freedom to blend approaches, customize learning, and adapt as their children grow and change.==

==The book highlights students and families who embody this category-defining approach:==

- ==Sarah, a 15-year-old "Renaissance Kid" combining high school classes with entrepreneurship==
- ==The Chen siblings, whose parents created a hybrid plan leveraging each child's unique strengths==
- ==Kai, who thrived when allowed to split time between school, his projects, and tutoring younger students==

==The question is no longer "which box do you fit in?" but "how do you build something that truly works for our child?"==

### ==🛠️ TOOL==

## ==**MAP YOUR LEARNING LANDSCAPE**==

==One of the most powerful tools in the book is a three-step process for mapping your child's learning landscape:==

==**Step 1: Analyze Interests**== ==Create a "Discovery Zone" on your wall where family members can post sticky notes answering questions like "What do you enjoy learning about?" and "What would you like to improve?"==

==**Step 2: Connect to Real Needs**== ==Ask: How can these interests solve real problems? This might mean household responsibilities, community challenges, or broader issues your child cares about.==

==**Step 3: Survey Available Resources**== ==Take inventory of what's available: free library programs, community classes, online courses, family expertise, and more.==

==**Want to dive deeper?**== ==[Come to our launch event](https://opened.co/book/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=open-education-the-book-launch-countdown-begins)== ==and get exclusive bonus resources including customizable templates, worksheets, and a planning guide to help you implement these tools immediately. Whether you're planning for next school year or ready to start your open education journey right away, these resources will give you a clear starting point.==

### ==📚 WORD OF THE DAY==

## ==**Antifragile**==

_==adjective==_==: Gaining strength from stressors rather than being harmed by them.==

==When trees grow without wind, they develop weak trunks and eventually collapse under their own weight. They need that stress to develop what botanists call "reaction wood."==

==Children are similar. Without appropriate challenges, they don't develop the resilience and problem-solving abilities needed to thrive.==

==That’s all for this week!==
