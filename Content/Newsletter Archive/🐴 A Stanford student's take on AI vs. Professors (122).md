### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**AI vs. Professors: A Stanford Freshman’s Take**==

==A Stanford freshman who writes under the name “Austin Scholar”== [==just made a surprisingly persuasive case that AI and adaptive learning apps are better at teaching than her elite university instructors==](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-146-how-stanford-convinced?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=a-stanford-student-s-take-on-ai-vs-professors-122)==. Why? She offers a few reasons:==

- ==A professor can't rewind and repeat==
- ==A professor can have a bad day, make mistakes, or play favorites==

==And perhaps most important:==

- ==_**A professor can't adapt to 30 different learning speeds simultaneously**_==

==What would happen if we freed the world’s most brilliant professors from daily lectures, and let them use that time for expanded office hours, Socratic discussions, and the like?==

==No, teachers aren’t going away. But their job might be changing.==

==The real issue isn't that students are "failing" to hit arbitrary grade-level benchmarks. It's that our one-size-fits-all approach forces everyone to move at the same pace, regardless of their learning journey.==

==Math is like building with blocks – miss one foundation piece, and everything above it gets shaky. Yet our system pushes students forward regardless, turning small gaps into insurmountable obstacles.==

### ==🛠️ TOOL==

## ==The 2-Hour Learning Revolution==

==Speaking of Austin Scholar (and Stanford), she credits her academic success to== [==Alpha Schools==](https://alpha.school/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=a-stanford-student-s-take-on-ai-vs-professors-122)==, founded by Stanford mom MacKenzie Price after her own kids complained about boring school days. In the Alpha model, students finish core academics by 10 am using adaptive, AI-powered tools, then spend afternoons on passion projects and real-world skills. Adults serve as guides rather than traditional teachers.==

==Alpha touts their average test scores (top 1-2% nationally), but we’re more impressed by how they generate genuine excitement about learning. Alpha is expanding in Miami, Austin, and Brownsville, TX, with more planned locations in Arizona, California, and Florida.==

### ==**(WORD) OF THE DAY**==

## ==**alpha**== ==(al·fa)== ==_noun_==

==From the Greek letter Α, this word has evolved from "first letter" to:==

- ==A leader or dominant force==
- ==The first version of something new==
- ==A measure of outperforming the standard==

==_Fitting that Alpha Schools are doing all three: leading education innovation, pioneering a new model, and helping students outperform national averages – all in just 2 hours a day._==

==That’s all for today!==
