### ==📊 TREND==

## ==**BLUE COLLAR ARBITRAGE**==

==While== [==universities push degrees of questionable ROI==](https://opened.co/blog/is-college-worth-the-cost-a-nuanced-look-at-educational-roi/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=weekly-roundup-the-college-roi-question)==, the jobs that make modern civilization possible are facing catastrophic worker shortages.==

=="For every five tradespeople who retire this year," Rowe notes, "two will replace them."==

==The average skilled tradesperson is now over 55. The American Welding Society projects a shortage of 400,000 welders by 2026. One defense contractor alone is looking for 100,000 skilled workers in the next decade.==

==But what some call a massive market inefficiency, we call an opportunity. It’s just basic supply and demand:== ==**reduce the supply of workers, and the price (wage) rises.**==

==While millions of college graduates compete for oversaturated white-collar jobs, skilled trades offer immediate employment, zero debt, and often six-figure incomes within a few years.==
