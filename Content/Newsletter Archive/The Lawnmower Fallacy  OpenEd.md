# ==The Lawnmower Fallacy==

==Growing up, my mom would always say, "You boys should take a small engine repair class." I don't know where she got this idea—she must have associated it with being a useful grown man. I never did and I still don’t know how to repair small engines. Here I am today: I do work that I love, but have no clue how to fix my lawnmower. If it breaks, I’m fortunate that I can hire someone to fix it.==

==But my mom still has this thing—and I love her for it.==

==For some people, it's much bigger than that. It's like, "I only view you as successful if you have a degree."==

==I've met entrepreneurs who are thriving—making great money, happy with their lives—yet their parents are== _==still==_ ==disappointed they didn't get a degree. Once we lock onto an idea of what success should look like for our kids, it's hard to let go.==

# ==The Soft Bigotry of Education Blather==

==Rick Hess at== ==[AEI calls out "the soft bigotry of education blather"](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/the-soft-bigotry-of-education-blather/)== ==as high school seniors post their worst reading scores since 2005. Half score below basic in math—meaning they can't read tables or apply percentages. That== _==sounds==_ ==bad, but The National Association of Secondary School Principals insists test scores are "only one lens for understanding success" and calls for more funding so students can "thrive."==

==We agree standardized tests aren't the best North Star for education. But Hess says this is blather:==

=="Forget thriving—huge numbers of America's 17-year-olds aren't even learning to read or do math."==

==Schools can't bomb the test and then decide tests don't matter. Either commit to improving the metrics you chose, or ditch them and measure something else.==
