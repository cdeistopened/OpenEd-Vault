### ==📊 TREND==

## ==**THE MICROSCHOOL MIDDLE GROUND**==

==The microschool revolution continues. Five years ago, parents mostly faced a binary choice:== ==**traditional school or homeschool**====. Now they're crafting hybrid solutions, and Tess's== [==Knowledge Seekers Collective==](https://knowledgeseekerspdx.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-kids-lose-their-love-of-learning-134) ==in Portland shows why.==

==Her student-shaped program runs just two mornings a week. Kids in grades 3-5 design their own projects, mixing STEM with arts and humanities. When students recently decided to stage their own play, some wanted written scripts while others preferred improv. The teacher’s role? Guiding the collaboration, not dictating the outcome.==

### ==🔨 TOOL==

## ==**STUDENT VOICE FRAMEWORK**==

==How do you give your child a voice in their education?==

==Here are 3 questions Tess uses with every new student:==

- ==What do you want to learn?==
- ==How do you learn best?==
- ==What brings you joy?==

==Then step back and let the answers guide your approach.==

=="When you have a voice in what you're learning, you're more invested in the outcome,” Scholl says.==
