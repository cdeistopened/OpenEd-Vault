==Good morning!==

==When a teacher recently posted about behavioral issues in schools, hundreds of commenters jumped on the dog pile. But while everyone's busy pointing fingers, some families are quietly building better alternatives. And they're facing an unexpected challenge: criticism from the very people struggling in the system they left.== ==**Let's talk about it.**==

==**In this edition:**==

- ==💭 The psychology behind why your educational choices make others defensive==
- ==📊 New data shows student behavior is "a lot worse" in 72% of classrooms==
- ==🏛️ How to access 200+ years of Smithsonian treasures from your laptop==
- ==💡 Plus: Ben Franklin's surprising innovation (hint: Amazon owes him one)==

### ==💡 THOUGHT==

## ==**Why Critics Get Defensive About Your Educational Choices**==

==Ever notice how the loudest critics of your educational choices are often the most insecure about their own?==

==Their judgment usually isn't about you—it's about their own doubts.==

==When someone reacts strongly to your educational choices, they're usually not judging you—they're defending themselves against imagined judgment. They hear "we homeschool" and translate it to "you're doing it wrong."==

==The solution? Turn the conversation toward their choices instead. Ask what they love about their children's education. Show genuine interest.==

==Remember: Confident parents don't feel threatened by different choices.==

Another 24% say it's "a little worse." Math isn't my strong suit but that's **====_checks notes*_====* basically everyone.==

==We're not talking about passing notes or chewing gum here – we're talking about hallway fights live-streamed for TikTok clout.==

==One teacher put it bluntly: "Students are louder, more belligerent, unkind, and socially awkward." (Translation: the vibes are completely off.)==

==Maybe it's time to consider alternatives that don't involve cramming 30+ socially stunted teenagers into a room for 7 hours a day...==

==Meet America's first postal rate chart from 1765. Before Benjamin Franklin got his hands on it, sending letters was chaos – every route had different prices that made absolutely no sense.==

==So what did Ben do? He standardized distances and rates, basically inventing the postal system as we know it.==

==That’s all for today!==
