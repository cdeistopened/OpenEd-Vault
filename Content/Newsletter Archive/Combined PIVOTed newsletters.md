==Dear Readers,==

==I often share with you the stories of specific schools, communities, and organizations that are doing a fantastic job bridging the gap between education and the workforce. This month, I’m excited to zoom out a little and share that ASA has teamed up with national nonprofit Bellwether to launch a new report. In it, we highlight 10 states that have significantly progressed work-based learning initiatives in recent years. These states are following unique approaches to creating and fortifying work-based learning programs and policies, but they adhere to a few common principles. At the core of each state’s success? A belief in an expanded definition of work-based learning; one that focuses as much on accountability and reporting as it does on the ins and outs of programs.== ==**(**====**[Read the report](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/report-american-student-assistance-bellwether-140000370.html?)**====**.)**==

==Work-based learning offers us a chance to build real equity into the education and employment landscapes by connecting the two. Yet, a recent story of two friends demonstrates that when programs are too sporadic or small in scale, some kids thrive while others needlessly miss out.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://www.the74million.org/article/shut-out-high-school-students-learn-about-careers-but-cant-try-one-that-pays/)**====**.)**== ==I’m therefore encouraged to see bi-partisan examples from states that are expanding access to pathways like apprenticeship and technical education, such as the recent legislation introduced in New Mexico and Kansas.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://ladailypost.com/heinrich-moran-introduce-legislation-to-create-pathways-to-stable-careers-expand-access-to-apprenticeships-technical-education/)**====**.)**== ==I’m excited to see tech companies like Transfr Trek making strides towards accessible and engaging digital career exploration and support for many more kids.== ==**(**====**[Read their announcement](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250204937960/en/Transfr-Launches-the-First-XR-Based-Multi-Modal-Solution-for-Career-Exploration)**====**.)**== ==And, I’m moved to see more schools and organizations rethinking the nature, value, and purpose of credentials — a concept explored by my colleague Judy Goldstein in her recent article.== ==**(**====**[Read the article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/credentialing-landscape-setting-stage-judith-l-goldstein-n8i6e/?trackingId=mF3SrfYIQfGwwPuH1qeeYQ%3D%3D)**====**.)**== ==In light of so much activity that’s transforming the status quo, I truly believe that this is an exciting time to work in and around education.==

==In closing, I invite you to check out what’s been happening on the One Question Podcast series — my collaboration with author Michael Horn. Recently, Michael and I were joined by Roy Spence, the founder of the Purpose Institute and the Make It Movement. Roy explains why ‘What do you want to be?’ is simply the wrong question to ask of kids.== ==**(**====**[Watch our interview](https://michaelbhorn.substack.com/p/roy-spence-show-dont-tell?utm_source=podcast-email&publication_id=35034&post_id=156879832&utm_campaign=email-play-on-substack&utm_content=watch_now_button&r=17drao&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email)**====**.)**== ==In another episode, we were joined by Aaron Rasmussen, the founder of MasterClass, and reminded to help kids look for the common themes that connect their diverse interests.== ==**(**====**[Watch our interview](https://michaelbhorn.substack.com/p/aaron-rasmussen-stay-curious)**====**.)**== ==And most recently, we spoke with actor John Pankow of the hit TV series== _==Mad About You==_==. John talked about harnessing the power of gratitude and explained how this mindset has helped him in his career journey.== ==**(**====**[Watch our interview](https://michaelbhorn.substack.com/p/john-pankow-the-power-of-gratitude?utm_source=podcast-email&publication_id=35034&post_id=157470907&utm_campaign=email-play-on-substack&utm_content=watch_now_button&r=17drao&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email)**====**.)**==

==Dear Readers,==

==The roadtrip is truly a great American pastime; the idea of an open expanse of horizon stretching out before you—replete with possibility and excitement—is a vision that inspires us all. And each young person, no matter their challenges or goals, deserves to be inspired by the idea of their own unique ‘roadtrip’ through their education and a career. To further this vision, ASA recently entered into a multi-year initiative with Roadtrip Nation that will motivate tens of millions of students and parents by following three young people on a multi-week, national roadtrip. During the experience, the trio will meet role models and mentors while refining their sense of purpose. In order to bring the power of exploration to even more young people, our two organizations are also working with Strada to deliver a Virtual Roadtrip. The Virtual Roadtrip will provide middle grades-appropriate stories about career exploration, and digital generative AI experiences focused on both career exploration and experimentation for middle and high schoolers.== ==**(**====**[[nationalcareereducationnonprofitsamericanstudentassistanceandroadtripnationlaunchnewinitiativetoscaleaccesstofuturereadyopportunitiesformidd]]**====**.)**==

==In other exploration-focused news, the state of Washington has moved from a ‘patchwork’ of career exploration platforms, to a new, statewide postsecondary planning site that will be used by students across all 295 school districts.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://www.govtech.com/education/k-12/washington-rolls-out-statewide-student-career-planning-site)**====**.)**== ==Indiana is seeing the payoff from a two-and-a-half-year Department of Education grant aimed at better preparing its young people for the future.== _==District Administration==_ ==writes of the grant’s success: “This year there’s a fresh energy in the lead up to graduation at 16 Indiana school districts because their students have more high-value postsecondary credentials and more high-quality work-based learning experiences than ever before.”== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://districtadministration.com/opinion/work-based-learning-connects-to-communities-in-16-indiana-school-districts/)**====**.)**== ==Education solutions provider Wayfinder recently released a report that demonstrates why, despite rapid technological advances, human skills matter more than ever.== ==**(**====**[Learn more](https://www.newswire.com/news/new-wayfinder-white-paper-bridges-the-gap-between-portrait-of-a-22538011)**====**.)**== ==All of these innovations are particularly encouraging at a time when troubling new research shows that over four million U.S. Gen Z youth are neither in school nor the workforce, with experts blaming the status quo of higher education, and a “system of broken promises.”== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://fortune.com/2025/03/25/gen-z-neet-not-in-education-employment-training-higher-ed-worthless-degrees-college/)**====**.)**==

==To round out the news, I invite you to listen to a podcast I recorded last month with education strategists Julian Alssid and Kaitlin LeMoine over at WorkForce. We talked about the tangible impacts of career exploration programming on middle schoolers.== ==**(**====**[Listen to the podcast](https://www.workforces.info/podcast/episode/53a4a165/jean-eddy-impacts-of-career-exploration-on-k-12-learners)**====**.)**== ==I also urge you to bookmark the One Question podcast, where my co-collaborator Michael Horn and I have the ongoing pleasure of interviewing world-famous artists, thinkers, and role-models on a wide array of career-related topics.== ==**(**====**[Find the entire One Question episode library here](https://www.asa.org/the-one-question-podcast/)**====**.)**== ==Most recently, we interviewed actress Kristine Sutherland—known for her role in== _==Buffy the Vampire Slayer==_==—who spoke about staying true to your interests== ==**(**====**[watch the episode](https://michaelbhorn.substack.com/p/kristine-sutherland-ask-around)**====**)**====; and actor John Pankow of== _==Mad About You==_==, who emphasized the power of gratitude== ==**(**====**[watch the episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGi3-0_F0xQ&t=3s)**====**)**====.==

==This spring, I wish us all the resilience to persevere in our proverbial roadtrips. No matter your age or stage of life, learning and growth must never end. There’s always something incredible on the horizon if you know where to look.==

==Dear Readers,==

==Amidst seemingly unprecedented turmoil in the education space, I'm thankful for all of the many ways in which ASA fulfills its mission to foster future success for all young people, in and beyond the classroom. For example, we recently awarded $17 million in grants to nonprofits, with a goal of helping middle and high school students achieve postsecondary education and career success.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/asa-awards-17.7-million-for-youth-career-readiness-programs)**====**.)**== ==We also teamed up with nonprofit Building Hope to give the ASA Career Education Champion Awards to two schools on opposite sides of the country.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-newswire/schools-school-choice-education-funding-47616ed737572f2bd3bbaca976400fcc)**====**.)**== ==And, we’re reaching millions of teens directly through our free EvolveMe career readiness platform== ==**(**====**[visit the site](https://evolveme.asa.org/)**====**)**====, which now includes IBM SkillsBuild to help young people build in-demand skills in areas such as AI, UX design, and cybersecurity.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://www.edtechinnovationhub.com/news/american-student-assistance-and-ibm-partner-to-bring-ai-and-cyber-skills-to-teens-via-evolveme-platform)**====**.)**== ==I'm heartened to see the momentum being generated--across the ecosystem of caring adults who support young people--to improve the way kids move through K-12 education and into postsecondary pursuits. I’m always thrilled to be able to share those stories with you in this newsletter. Here are some highlights:==

==Dear Readers,==

==The school summer holidays are nearly upon us, and the post-school future may be the furthest thing from many kids’ minds. Yet, ASA is continually interested in learning about the postsecondary plans teens are making, who is influencing those decisions, and how teens are thinking about their futures. We know that how young people plan, when they start planning, and who informs them along the way are factors that can have a profound impact on their eventual career choices and chances of postsecondary success. These factors are all of increasing importance at a time when,== _==Getting Smart==_ ==reminds us, some 65% of jobs will change significantly every 5-7 years and the value of credentials is evolving rapidly.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2025/04/09/the-transcript-trap-why-our-students-need-credentials-not-just-grades/)**====**.)**==

==To that end, we recently published the results of a new nationwide survey in which we asked more than 3,000 7th-12th-graders about their postsecondary ambitions. Among the most interesting highlights? Teens’ interest in college is down, while nondegree pathways are becoming more popular. Parents are among teens’ biggest influencers, but they remain skeptical of nondegree options. And, we uncovered some interesting findings about how location and other factors may influence postsecondary choices.== ==**(**====**[Read about the research](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/survey-american-student-assistance-reveals-130000120.html?guccounter=1)**====**.)**== ==In addition, for young people who want or need to join the workforce straight out of high school, I invite you to learn about the Launchpad Jobs that offer the most promising career paths for workers without degrees.== ==**(**====**[Join us for our upcoming webinar on this topic](https://asa.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_wYpSVljtTq2DW7fq7yif9A#/registration)**====**.)**==

==It’s really little surprise to me that more kids are considering nondegree pathways; we have seen so much nationwide momentum around the proliferation of high-quality pathways and a much deeper focus on transferrable skills. In Massachusetts, for example, Innovation Career Pathways have been expanded to 20 new schools, meaning even more students will be able to explore careers, participate in work-based learning, and take technical and advanced courses.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://www.mass.gov/news/healey-driscoll-administration-expands-innovation-career-pathways-to-20-new-high-schools)**====**.)**== ==A law has been signed in South Carolina encouraging more students to participate in work-based learning.== ==**(**====**[Read the story.](https://www.wspa.com/news/state-news/gov-mcmaster-signs-bill-to-let-students-participate-in-work-based-learning/)**====**)**== ==The state of Wisconsin saw a 14% increase in youth apprenticeships in 2024-2025.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://dailyreporter.com/2025/05/16/milwaukee-youth-apprenticeship-skilled-trades/)**====**.)**== ==And, some 32 states now require high schools to offer at least one computer science course, speaking to the urgent need for all young people to possess a strong tech skillset before they leave school.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://www.k12dive.com/news/significant-momentum-computer-science-curriculum-ai/748103/)**====**.)**==

==Each month, I invite you to watch the latest episode of “Youth Career Readiness: The One-Question Podcast” — my collaboration with author Michael Horn. This month, we interviewed legendary guitarist Stevie Van Zandt, best known for playing guitar in Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band. He explains how developing a craft can change the course of a young person’s life.== ==**(**====**[Watch the episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCf45kHskGA)**====**.)**== ==You can also explore our past interviews, with well-known guests like Lou Holtz, Yo-Yo Ma, Common, John Pankow, Tanya Wright, and others.== ==**(**====**[Explore the One Question library](https://www.asa.org/the-one-question-podcast/)**====**.

==I wish you a relaxing summer holiday period. With our minds fresh and rested, we can continue in our mission of helping more kids realize a bright and successful future!==

==Dear Readers,==

==Our recent report,== _==Extending the Runway: A 50-State Analysis of Middle School Career Exploration==_==, found that while there is nationwide career exploration momentum, a number of states are leading the charge in showing what high-quality programming can look like for middle schoolers.== ==**(**====**[Read the report](https://www.asa.org/extending-the-runway/)**====**.)**== ==Together with Education Strategy Group, we recently launched the Middle School Career Exploration Impact and Learning Network. It is designed to accelerate the work of those states while sharing resources and inspiration for others.== ==**(**====**[[americanstudentassistanceandeducationstrategygrouplaunchmiddleschoolcareerexplorationimpactandlearningnetworktoprovidemodelpoliciesandasingularvisionforensuringallmiddleschool]]**====**.)**==

==In my scan of the summer education news, I see endless signs that more young people are finding their pathways. Some 337 seniors across New Jersey’s vocational and technical schools received their diplomas after earning associates degrees, setting a class record for the number of vocational students to earn a degree while still in high school.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://njbiz.com/nj-vocational-students-earn-associate-degrees-2025/)**====**.)**== ==A fund of $10 million has been made available for work-based learning initiatives in Connecticut.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://www.ctinsider.com/opinion/article/ct-youth-employment-lamont-20351252.php)**====**.)**== _==USA Today==_ ==reports on research that shows more teens are bucking the college-after-high-school trend in favor of options like vocational training that may be a better fit for their needs. On a related note, you may have also seen the video featuring Mike Rowe, host of Discovery Channel’s hit show Dirty Jobs and a longtime advocate for nondegree career pathways, with some advice for parents of teens. He== ==[shares insights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ee3Vw8H0j8)== ==from ASA’s research, as featured in== _==USA Today==_==, on his highly influential YouTube channel.== ==**(**====**[Watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ee3Vw8H0j8)**====**.)**== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2025/06/15/kids-ditch-traditional-college-after-high-school/84027992007/)**====**.)**==

==And,== _==Hechinger Report==_ ==tells the story of high school students who gained hands-on professional experience at the American Museum of Natural History this spring through a mentoring program. One high school junior said of her experience researching microplastic pollution that she “fell in love with science.”== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://hechingerreport.org/high-school-sleuths-search-fish-guts-for-clues-to-plastics-pollution/)**====**.)**== ==These are the stories that validate our mission to help more kids find their unique passions and pathways, and that validate the tireless work of those educators and school leaders who understand the power of career exploration.==

==Each month, I invite you to watch the latest episode of “Youth Career Readiness: The One-Question Podcast” — my collaboration with author Michael Horn. This month, we interviewed Alec Ingold, fullback for the Miami Dolphins and advocate for youth development.
