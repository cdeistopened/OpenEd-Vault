Tweetables]: 1. "At the end of a session with Savvy, the kids are hyped. They want to come back."2. "What child is going to have fun learning to read for 60 minutes? That's tough for me as an adult."3. "You only learn what you care about."4. "Every master was once a disaster."5. "The key word here is 'dosage,' not 'duration.' It's about consistency and engagement, not endurance."6. "You don't have to go to an Ivy League school. You don't have to go somewhere where you're coming out with $100,000, $200,000 of debt because of a college degree."7. "Great! Now you know what you don't want to do. And that's just as important as knowing what you want to do or what you want to try."8. "The reading crisis doesn't end at graduation."9. "If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out."10. "Don't let his schooling interfere with his education."
Breakdown: "### Thought- The 'Less is More' Approach for Reading Success- Traditional wisdom suggests that struggling readers need extensive tutoring.- Shorter, frequent sessions (25 minutes, four times a week) can be more effective.- Engaging shorter sessions prevent burnout and keep kids excited about learning.### Trends1. The Adult Literacy Crisis Creates Generational Cycles- 54% of American adults read below a 6th-grade level.- This creates a cycle where parents who struggle with reading can't help their children, perpetuating reading anxiety and poor literacy.- 66% of 4th graders read below proficiency, with 70% not catching up without intervention.2. High-Dosage Tutoring- Roland Fryer’s research shows that over 130 hours of small-group tutoring can significantly improve outcomes when delivered in the right \"dosage.\"- The focus is on frequency and engagement rather than total hours.### Tools1. Savvy Learning Free Reading Assessment- A 15-minute assessment to determine a child's reading level, providing actionable insights.- Access to high-dosage tutoring options using education funds at no out-of-pocket cost.2. Reading Eggs- Self-paced phonics practice designed to engage kids through gamification and rewards, suitable for ages 2-13.3. Learning Ally- Provides human-narrated textbooks for students with reading barriers, allowing them to follow along with highlighted text.- Available for $135/year for families.### Quick Poll- Options for feedback on today's issue:- Love it!- Not bad.- Missed the mark."

==“So many kids hate math, and can you blame them?== ==**Math in school has nothing to do with reasoning.**====” — Ana Lorena Fabrega==

=="I'm just not a math person."==

==How many times have you heard a child (or adult) say this? It’s the epitome of the fixed mindset that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.==

==But what if the problem isn't the kids, but how we teach?==

==We've made math abstract, boring, and disconnected from real life. We've turned what should be a playground of patterns and puzzles into a joyless march through worksheets.==

==Kids who "hate math" will often spend hours on strategy games that involve resource management, spatial reasoning, and algorithmic thinking.==

==The difference? Context, visuals, and purpose. Change those three variables and you change the whole equation.==

For example, when students were asked to create expressions equivalent to integers 0-20 using only three numbers (like 3, 4, and 1), they discovered mathematical rules through exploration rather than memorization.==

It's that feeling you get after scrolling TikTok for hours. But brain rot isn't limited to social media. We feel it when we're forced into repetitive tasks detached from meaning, like memorizing formulas without understanding their purpose. The solution? More engaging, interactive learning experiences that actually stick.==

==🍎 The mom who discovered she wasn't as essential as she thought  
🍎 Free Play Fridays spread as antidote to over-structured childhoods  
🍎 Three tools for natural, hands-on learning at home==

### ==💡 1 THOUGHT==

## ==**I THOUGHT I HAD TO BE TEACHING MY KIDS ALL. THE. TIME.**==

==In a recent article for the Let Grow Foundation, homeschool mom Abigail Weidmer shared her journey from over-teaching to embracing free play. During her first year homeschooling kindergarten, she felt immense pressure to teach everything: reading, math, music, art, STEM, emotional health, money management.==

==Then she had a realization:==

=="I was not as essential to my child's education as I thought I was."==

==The breakthrough? Walking downstairs to find her daughter had created a space museum—complete with solar system map, rocket crafting station, and guided tours—all without adult instruction.==

=="My kids actually learned more when I did less."==

==Schools and neighborhood play clubs are blocking off Friday afternoons for unstructured play. The Free Play Fridays program, launched by the Let Grow Foundation, designates 2-3 hours where kids get minimal supervision and maximum freedom. No lesson plans. No adult-led activities. Just basic safety rules and access to simple materials like balls, art supplies, and building blocks.==

==Schools report dramatic improvements in social skills, conflict resolution, and even academic focus during regular class time. In Philadelphia, one elementary school saw playground behavior incidents drop 30% after implementing the program.==

==Neighborhood play clubs are adopting the same model, with families rotating hosting duties while adults deliberately stay hands-off.==

==The film was made by Dr. John Ott, who believed that natural, full-spectrum light helps our bodies and minds work better. He even said bad lighting could affect us like poor nutrition.==

==His early tests claimed full-spectrum lights helped students focus and boosted test scores—sometimes by over 30%.==

==Today we often resort to medication. But maybe the light matters more than we think.==

==[The Wall Street Journal reports](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/skilled-trades-high-school-recruitment-fd9f8257?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=high-school-juniors-landing-70k-jobs)== ==companies facing skilled worker shortages are recruiting students directly from high schools, with juniors receiving $70,000/year job offers. One welding student described it as "like I'm an athlete getting all this attention from all these pro teams."==

==Key drivers behind this trend:==

- ==Critical labor shortages in skilled trades==
- ==Astronomical college costs prompting families to reconsider ROI==
- ==Industry-school partnerships creating direct pipelines to careers==

==**IN THIS EDITION**==

==🍎 Why caring is the prerequisite for learning  
🍎 The problem-solving curriculum from Elon Musk's secret school  
🍎 An accessible new book on the science of learning==

### ==💡 1 THOUGHT==

## ==**"YOU ONLY LEARN WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT"**==

### ==Jared Fuller was failing high school.==

=="Son, you have to learn== _==how==_ ==to learn," his dad told him. "You're only going to learn about something you care about."==

==Jared didn't understand it then. But that wisdom would later become his north star and the foundation of his work as COO of OpenEd. He== ==[recently sat down with Justin Gray and Sean Kester of The Cheat Code podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8QMjJLAZ-w&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=what-happens-when-kids-care)== ==to explain how this principle is revolutionizing education for thousands of families across America through programs like OpenEd.==

### ==📊 2 TRENDS==

==**FROM "WEIRD HOMESCHOOLER" TO "WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT TOO"**== ==- When we surveyed OpenEd families last year, we expected 80-90% to be veteran homeschoolers. In reality 50% had come from public schools. The cultural shift is stark—ten years ago, mentioning homeschooling triggered questions about social awkwardness. Now? "Every time I tell someone we homeschool, they say 'We've been thinking about that too,'" Jared notes. The "weird homeschooler" stereotype has been replaced by a new reality: mainstream families seeking more of a say in their kids' education.==

==**THE 20-MINUTE MIRACLE**== ==- Jared shares a story about a non-verbal, autistic child was drowning in 4,000 minutes of weekly instruction—over 13 hours of mandated screen time. His mom sought help from OpenEd, and after joining consulting with our specialists, discovered he needed just 20 minutes of targeted therapy. Today, he's reading independently.==

### ==🔨 3 TOOLS==

==**[NatureEye](https://www.natureeye.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=what-happens-when-kids-care)**== ==- The platform powering OpenEd's virtual field trips. Recent adventures include touring CERN's particle accelerator, meeting Antarctic researchers, and that SpaceX satellite launch drone tour. OpenEd families get access to exclusive sessions where kids can ask astronauts questions or watch heart surgery live.==

==**[Synthesis](https://www.synthesis.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=what-happens-when-kids-care)**== ==- You've probably never heard of the school Elon Musk built for his kids at SpaceX headquarters. But when it shut down, two teachers spun out its problem-solving curriculum into Synthesis—weekly team challenges where kids aged 8-14 collaborate to solve complex simulations.

==**IN THIS EDITION**==

==🍎 A quote correction that reveals more than just a misattribution  
🍎 Why schools are banning deepfakes  
🍎 The case for letting kids move (a lot) while learning==

### ==💡 1 THOUGHT==

## ==**CORRECTION**==

==**"I never let my schooling interfere with my education."**==

==–== _==Not actually Mark Twain.==_

==Well, shoot. We shared this quote misattributed to Mark Twain last week. But according to the meticulous sleuths at== ==[Quote Investigator](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/09/25/schooling-vs-education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=mark-twain-summer-reading-edition)====, the real credit likely belongs to Grant Allen, a Canadian science writer who was railing against rote schooling in the 1890s. Did Twain ever echo this powerful sentiment?==

==The debate is murky. Some say he advised a friend with a young son, “==_==Don’t let his schooling interfere with his education,”==_ ==but we can’t find any hard evidence or primary source (if you can, we’ll send you a free Ed the Horse t-shirt).==

==Does it actually matter who said it? The words are no less powerful. And while we aren’t any less likely to pick up a Mark Twain book for summer reading, we== _==are==_ ==more likely to look into this Grant Allen character.==

### ==📊 2 TRENDS==

==**[School Districts Ban Deepfake Creation](https://www.wmur.com/article/bedford-schools-ban-deepfakes-52825/64908792?utm_source=chatgpt.com)**== ==- Speaking of convincing fakes: Bedford, New Hampshire joins a growing list of school districts prohibiting students from making or sharing AI-manipulated images, with punishments up to suspension or police action. While the trend itself is worrisome, the strict legal enforcement and “zero tolereance” also raises some questions about the appropriate punishments for what in some cases might amount to a youthful indiscretion.==

_==[Why “Sit Still and Pay Attention” Doesn’t Work](https://lauragraceweldon.com/2024/05/05/why-sit-still-and-pay-attention-doesnt-work/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=mark-twain-summer-reading-edition)==_ ==- Laura Grace Weldon reminds us that kids learn better when they have ample time for movement. From crawling to cartwheeling, the body teaches the brain what to do. Grant Allen would approve. So would Tom Sawyer, we suspect.==

==**IN THIS EDITION**==

==🍎 The tutoring myth that's keeping kids behind  
🍎 Why some "reading problems" need an eye doctor, not a reading specialist  
🍎 Three new weapons for your reading arsenal==

### ==💡 1 THOUGHT==

## ==**THE 'LESS IS MORE' APPROACH FOR READING SUCCESS**==

==We've been overdosing kids on tutoring.==

==Traditional wisdom says struggling readers need TONS of help—longer sessions, extra hours, weekend work. But what if small doses of the perfect 'medicine' is all they need?==

==Most reading tutor solutions available to families only offer 60-minute sessions.==

==But Tony Mickelsen from== ==[Savvy Learning](http://savvylearning.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-savvy-parents-are-tutoring-their-kids)== ==makes a point that seems obvious once it’s said out loud:==

_==**"What child is going to have fun learning to read for 60 minutes? That's tough for me as an adult."**==_

==The solution isn't long tutoring sessions—it's shorter, more frequent tutoring sessions. Like medicine, there's an optimal amount that produces maximum results. For reading, that dose is surprisingly small: 25 minutes, four times weekly.==

=="At the end of a session with Savvy, the kids are hyped," Tony reports. "They want to come back. In part, because the shorter sessions aren't leaving them burned out."==

==The key word here is "dosage," not "duration." It's about consistency and engagement, not endurance.==

### ==📊 2 TRENDS==

==**1. THE ADULT LITERACY CRISIS CREATES GENERATIONAL CYCLES -**== ==The reading crisis doesn't end at graduation. According to the== ==[U.S. Department of Education](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2019/2019179.pdf?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-savvy-parents-are-tutoring-their-kids)====,== ==**54% of American adults**== ==read below a 6th-grade level.==

==This creates a vicious cycle: Parents who struggle with reading often can't help with homework, skip bedtime stories, and pass on reading anxiety. The== ==[National Assessment of Educational Progress](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-savvy-parents-are-tutoring-their-kids)== ==shows== ==**66% of 4th graders**== ==now read below proficiency—and== ==**70% never catch up**== ==without intervention.==

==The pattern repeats: Parent avoids reading → Child misses early literacy exposure → Child struggles in school → Becomes an adult who avoids reading. Breaking this cycle requires treating family literacy as interconnected, not isolated problems.==

==**2. HIGH-DOSAGE TUTORING -**== ==Harvard economist Roland Fryer's award-winning== ==[research on high-dosage tutoring](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23792?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-savvy-parents-are-tutoring-their-kids)== ==found that 130+ hours of small-group tutoring significantly improved outcomes—but only when delivered in the right "dosage."==

==**The key finding:**== ==It's not about total hours but frequency and engagement. Schools implementing Fryer's model—high-dosage tutoring—saw gains equivalent to eliminating the racial achievement gap in three years.==

==Before you can fix a problem, you need to know exactly what you're dealing with. Savvy's free assessment takes just 15 minutes and gives you concrete data on your child's reading level.==

==Designed by experts using Science of Reading principles, it evaluates key skills and provides actionable insights. You'll need two devices (or can share one), and your child reads while you record responses. Parents are often surprised by the results—sometimes relieved, always with a clear action plan.==

==Best part for OpenEd families: Once you know where your child stands, you can access Savvy's high-dosage tutoring (25 min, 4x weekly) using education funds with zero out-of-pocket costs. This is the tool we wish every parent had access to.==
