# 🐴 Why art history grads are beating engineers (1)

==**IN THIS EDITION**==

==🍎 A math-hating teen sprints to grade level in 90 days  
🍎 A former teacher warns: “These kids cannot read”  
🍎 Art history beats engineering in a surprise job market shift==

### ==💡 1 THOUGHT==

==My 30+ years in education have shown me that the most powerful learning happens at the intersection of three things:==

==–== ==**Choice**====: Some control over how, what, and when learners learn  
–== ==**Competency**====: Adequate time and support to master key skills  
–== ==**Connection**====: Learning tied to topics students care about and that relate to the real world==

==A story: Isaac’s son refused to do math for years. He considered it boring and irrelevant. Then at 13, he wanted to attend a part-time school program with his friends. The only catch? He had to be at grade level in math.==

==He said:== _==“I’ll catch up this summer.”==_

==What happened next surprised everyone.==

==Starting at the kindergarten level on Khan Academy, and spending just 1–2 hours a day, this teenager who “hated math” reached grade level in== ==**less than three months**====.==

==He wasn’t a prodigy. He just had:==

- ==His own motivation (not external pressure)==
- ==The right tools==
- ==Freedom to progress at his own pace==
- ==No artificial timelines==

==When kids have real motivation and the right environment, they learn faster than we expect. This is why I believe in learning sprints rather than endless marathons. Our new book== _==[Open Education](https://geni.us/opened?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-art-history-grads-are-beating-engineers)==_ ==shows how to create the conditions for this kind of breakthrough learning.==

🍎 Ken Coleman: "The world doesn't pay for 5s. It pays for 9s and 10s"

### 💡 1 THOUGHT

## THE WORLD DOESN'T PAY FOR WELL-ROUNDED

In his new book _[Find the Work You're Wired to Do (Student Edition)](https://ter.li/krbn8l)_, bestselling author, radio personality and career coach Ken Coleman delivers a message that might make you uncomfortable: Stop trying to fix your kid's weaknesses.

"I'm so sick of hearing 'I want a well-rounded kid.'" Coleman told Isaac on the most recent episode the podcast.

"Nobody goes to Lowe's or Home Depot and walks in and goes, 'I want a well-rounded sander. I want a well-rounded blade.' **Anything that does really good work has an edge to it.**"

**Consider this:** If your kid is naturally a 3 in math and busts their tail, they might become a 5.

"The world doesn't pay for 5s," Coleman insists. "The world pays for 9s and 10s."

Instead of endless tutoring to bring that C up to a B, Coleman suggests telling your hardworking-but-struggling math student: "Nice job. You're never going to do that after school. No one's ever going to pay you for that."

Then help them find their 7s and 8s—and sharpen those into 10s.

_Get Ken Coleman's [Find the Work You're Wired to Do (Student Edition)](https://ter.li/krbn8l) with the included career assessment._

### 📊 2 TRENDS

**1. THE ANXIOUS GENERATION: HOW WE BROKE OUR KIDS**

Ken Coleman frames the generational shift perfectly: "Boomers said 'you skinned your knee? Walk it off.' There were no bike helmets." Then Gen X became the anxious parents, and "we've raised the anxious generation."

[Jonathan Haidt's research](https://www.anxiousgeneration.com/) in his book of the same name backs this up—youth anxiety increased 50-200% since 2012. His four solutions: No smartphones before 14. No social media before 16. Phone-free schools. More unsupervised play.

**2. 81% OF EMPLOYERS PRIORITIZE SKILLS OVER DEGREES**

Coleman also cited [LinkedIn's latest data](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/linkedin-most-in-demand-hard-and-soft-skills) on what employers care about: "Adaptability is the #1 soft skill employers want—for two years running."

Google, Apple, IBM no longer require degrees. Why? Skills-based hires stay 34% longer than degree-based hires. People with high emotional intelligence earn $29,000 more annually.

As Coleman says: "They don't care where you went to school. Nobody cares."
