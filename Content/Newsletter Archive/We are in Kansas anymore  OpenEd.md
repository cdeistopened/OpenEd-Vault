==We’ve got a big announcement, and would love your help!==

==OpenEd is expanding into Kansas next year, and applications are open now. If you know anyone in Kansas who might be interested, please forward this email or pass this link along –== [==opened.co/kansas==](https://opened.co/kansas?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=091-we-are-in-kansas-anymore)

==Thank you for being a part of this movement!==

==– Isaac==

==And now, let’s take a look back at the week that was.==

## ==💡 THOUGHTS==

### ==The Great Tech Debate 🖥️== 

==While== [==Sweden invests €100M to bring back textbooks==](https://glassalmanac.com/government-study-confirms-screen-time-significantly-lowers-student-achievement/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=087-screen-time-quality-over-quantity-spacex-s-math-revolution)==, the SpaceX-adjacent== [==Synthesis program==](https://www.synthesis.com/teams?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=087-screen-time-quality-over-quantity-spacex-s-math-revolution) ==is revolutionizing math education through screens. Our take? It’s not about the medium – it’s about the message. Quality over quantity.== [==Some screen time can be valuable when the content is right==](https://twitter.com/petergyang?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1861560610867290114%7Ctwgr%5E7eebfa4e29c14c106c38fefb934bcdbc10dcef62%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fopened-daily.beehiiv.com%2Fp%2F087-screen-time-quality-over-quantity-spacex-s-math-revolution&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=091-we-are-in-kansas-anymore)==.==

### [==**Raised to Obey or Learn to Think?**==](https://www.educationnext.org/exceptionally-important-role-of-american-schools-book-review-raised-to-obey-paglayan/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=088-the-case-against-grammar-worksheets-and-what-to-do-instead) ==🤔==

==A Stanford professor marshalls historical evidence that public schools weren’t created to spread literacy or boost economies but to create compliant workers. Maybe that’s why the factory model of education – with its bells and rigid rows – feels so outdated for modern learners.==

### [==**Back to Basics: The Only 3 Non-Negotiables**==](https://youtu.be/cBf3u0U1NQ8?si=TtqULy5O-fU8BdjH&t=1538&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=090-the-3-r-s-are-all-you-need) ==📚==

==We still stand by the importance of reading, writing, and basic math (the 3 R’s) – but not as you remember them. One student mastered writing by documenting gaming strategies, another through sports commentary.==

### [==**The Magic of Stepping Back**==](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-023-the-apogee-approach-to-modern-education-a-former-teachers-journey-to-microschooling/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=089-when-teachers-stop-teaching) ==🪄==

==Veteran educator Peggy Lowe discovered something remarkable: when teachers stop teaching and start guiding, students unlock capabilities they never knew they had.==

## ==📊 TRENDS==

### [==**The Memory Revolution**==](https://www.tes.com/magazine/teaching-learning/general/what-is-working-memory-educations-unfinished-revolution?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=089-when-teachers-stop-teaching) ==🧠==

==New research shows working memory varies dramatically among same-age students. In a class of 30 third-graders, some match college students while others process like kindergarteners. Time to rethink one-size-fits-all education?==

### [==**The AP Empire Strikes Back**==](https://www.goldwaterinstitute.org/the-college-board-academic-rigoror-progressive-grift/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=090-the-3-r-s-are-all-you-need) ==💰==

==Following the money in education reveals some interesting patterns. The College Board’s “nonprofit” status comes with a $1B revenue stream and a CEO salary 30x that of typical teachers. Some states are pushing back – Florida is even exploring AP alternatives.==

### [==**Trust and Independence: A Walking Case Study**==](https://letgrow.org/kids-walk-success/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=088-the-case-against-grammar-worksheets-and-what-to-do-instead) ==👣==

==Want your kids to succeed? Let them walk! New research links neighborhood walkability to economic mobility. Eight states have already passed “Reasonable Childhood Independence” laws, recognizing that real education happens through real responsibility.==

## ==⚒️ TOOLS==

### [==**Note-Taking Reimagined**==](https://k12blog.hillsdale.edu/note-taking-in-history-a-classical-guide/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=090-the-3-r-s-are-all-you-need) ==📝==

==Forget frantically copying everything. Try the QUEN method:== ==**Qu**====estion (what are you trying to learn?),== ==**E**====vidence (key points only), and== ==**N**====arration (explain it back in your own words).==

### [==**Grammar Without Tears**==](https://twitter.com/HippyMomPhD/status/1857080800430506255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1857080800430506255%7Ctwgr%5E77e923cd2df4a1b110e1f0d6a4ae68d38e17b3d6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fopened-daily.beehiiv.com%2Fp%2F088-the-case-against-grammar-worksheets-and-what-to-do-instead&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=091-we-are-in-kansas-anymore) ==📖==

==Most kids don’t need grammar worksheets – they need great books. Focus on practical skills (yes, knowing where commas go matters) and save the pluperfect subjunctive (i.e., “If I had known…”) for when they’re learning a second language.==

### [==**The Ultimate Reading List**==](http://code.org/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=072-weekly-roundup-from-bullies-to-night-owls) ==📚==

==That’s all for this week, folks! Have a great weekend.==
