## ==💡 THOUGHT==

### ==Curiosity > Curriculum==

==Humans will and must learn. It can’t be stopped. From the youngest age, toddlers constantly observe their surroundings, watch what others do, and experiment themselves.==

==They push, pull, and test things, always asking: “What happens if I do this?”==

==They’ve seen people use footstools and they’ve seen people reach for things on high shelves. In a moment of inspiration, they combine these ideas: move the footstool to the shelf and use it as a step to reach what they want. This is learning in action—the perfect blend of theory and practice.==

==But there’s also complex reasoning at play. When a child uses an object in a new way (like standing on a footstool they’ve only seen used for sitting) they’re making analogies and understanding systems. They connect dots in ways that demonstrate a deep, intuitive grasp of the world.==

==When you let children explore their interests, they can’t help but learn.==

==– Isaac==

## ==📊 TREND==

### ==The Rapid Rise of Pandemic Pods==

==The word “revolution” gets thrown around a lot. In a recent interview with Bill Gates, Sal Khan (yes, that Khan from Khan Remember when “pod” was just something you listened to on your morning commute? Well, times have changed, and now it might just be your kid’s new classroom. Since the pandemic of 2020-2021, these DIY learning groups have been popping up faster than sourdough starters. But unlike that bread you abandoned, these pods are proving they’re here to stay.== [==EducationNext reports==](https://www.educationnext.org/rapid-rise-pandemic-pods-will-parent-response-covid-19-lead-to-lasting-changes/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=034-pandemic-pods-kaipods-and-ipods) ==that this trend has gone hand-in-hand with soaring enrollment in online learning platforms. (==[==Outschool==](https://outschool.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=034-pandemic-pods-kaipods-and-ipods)==, for example, saw a 275% increase.)==

==What does this tell us? Parents are eager to take charge of their children’s education, but they’re not going it alone. Pods provide the perfect mix: the flexibility of customized learning, the support of like-minded families, and a blend of online resources with good old-fashioned face-to-face interaction. For parents working part- or full-time, pods allow them to share their time commitment and create a sustainable learning environment that fits their schedules.==
