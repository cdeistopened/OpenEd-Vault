=="Many very high net worth individuals are shifting to homeschooling," reveals Robert Gamble in our latest podcast.==

==They’re not sending their kids to elite private schools anymore. Instead, they're becoming educational architects and customizing their kids’ education. It seems the wealthy are now waking up to something our families have been saying for years:== ==**personalization > standardization.**==

=="If people with close to unlimited resources are choosing to homeschool their kids, then that tells me that it's probably one of the best routes," Gamble notes.==

==These wealthy families often hire educational consultants or dedicate significant time to researching the perfect educational fit. But how can we make this level of informed customization accessible to every family… without the fancy consultants?==

==Apart from programs like== ==[OpenEd](https://opened.co/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=silicon-valley-s-education-secret-is-leaking-and-it-s-not-coding)====, the answer might lie in technology that democratizes what previously required significant time, money, and connections to achieve.==

### ==🔨 TOOL==

## ==**SMARTPATH: MAPPING THE EDUCATION LANDSCAPE**==

==The explosion of educational resources in the last few years has created a new challenge: how can you curate and architect the best education for== _==your==_ ==child from the thousands of teaching resources out there?==

=="It's crazy how many options are available," explains Jonathan Chizick. "That's tough for a parent to navigate for a decision that's so important. It's your kid's education."==

==Enter== ==[SmartPath](https://smartpath.school/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=silicon-valley-s-education-secret-is-leaking-and-it-s-not-coding)====, a free AI-powered tool that matches your child's unique learning profile with curriculum recommendations tailored to their needs.==

==The platform works by collecting information about your child's learning style, interests, and goals, then generates personalized curriculum recommendations in minutes—revealing options many parents might never discover on their own.==

==While currently focused on curriculum matching, SmartPath plans to expand into helping families discover local learning options as well—from co-ops to micro-schools in your area.==

=="The fact that I don't even know about things that are two miles from my house, that's an issue," explains Jonathan Chizick. "How do we help parents know what these options are in their neighborhoods?"==

### ==**WORD OF THE DAY**==

## ==DECISION FATIGUE (n.)==

==The mental exhaustion resulting from making too many choices, depleting your willpower and leading to poor decisions or decision avoidance. First identified by social psychologist Dr. Roy Baumeister, it explains why choosing between 347 homeschool curricula makes even the most dedicated parents consider the merits of unschooling.==

==**EXAMPLE:**== =="After three hours of curriculum research, Jessica succumbed to decision fatigue and enrolled her children in 'whatever math program had the prettiest logo.'"==

=="For every five tradespeople who retire this year," Rowe notes, "two will replace them."==

==But what some call a massive market inefficiency, we call an opportunity. It’s just basic supply and demand:== ==**reduce the supply of workers, and the price (wage) rises.**==

==[Alternative education podcaster Kerry McDonald recently joined the Hannah Frankman Podcast to talk about unexpectedly large decline in public school enrollment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXuzYFenDGU&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=your-child-isn-t-broken-but-their-chair-might-be)====:==

=="We knew there would be a dip in enrollment," notes McDonald, citing the decline in birth rates, "but that dip has been far deeper than expected because families are choosing alternatives."==

==Nearly 6% of U.S. students now homeschool—matching public charter school attendance—while new categories like microschooling and open education are growing even faster.==

=="Parents are fed up with one-size-fits-all education," McDonald explains. "They want something responsive to individual needs and aligned with their values."==

==Thankfully, a growing number of public schools are also adapting and embracing the open education model of flexible, hybrid, customized options.==

## ==**75%: PASS OR FAIL?**==

==We don't build houses with 75% complete foundations.==

==We don't fly planes with 75% complete safety checks.==

==We don't perform surgery with 75% complete procedures.==

==Yet in education, we advance students with 75% understanding, every day, in every school. Then we wonder why learning seems so difficult for so many.==

==In a traditional academic model, as Sal Khan explains, we group students by age and shepherd them at the same pace. A student gets a 75% on a test—missing a quarter of the material—and the class simply moves on to the next subject.==

=="Imagine if we built homes that way," the Khan Academy founder muses.==

=="You have two weeks. Do what you can. Inspector shows up, it's 75% complete. Great! That's a C+. Start the second floor, then the third floor. And all of a sudden, that whole structure collapses."==

==The alternative? Mastery learning—where time is variable but competency is fixed. Students work until they truly master the material, building solid foundations before advancing.==

### ==📊 TREND==

## ==**THE GREAT GRADE CHARADE**==

==A Tennessee student identified as "William A." graduated with a 3.4 GPA—solidly in B+ territory. Just one problem: he couldn't read the words on his diploma. He couldn't even spell his own name.==

==Now== ==[he's suing the Clarksville Montgomery County School System](https://www.wwnytv.com/2025/03/02/former-student-sues-school-saying-he-graduated-with-34-gpa-couldnt-read/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-3-4-gpa-student-who-couldn-t-read)== ==for denying him the "free appropriate education" guaranteed under federal law while awarding him grades suggesting competence he never achieved.==

==We wish this was merely an isolated case of one student falling through cracks. But it’s not, and it exposes the façade of our entire grading system—where compliance, assignments completed, and attendance often count more than actual learning.==

==According to court documents, William (who has dyslexia) frequently used AI software to complete assignments.==

=="To write a paper," the ruling states, "William would dictate his topic using speech-to-text software, paste it into ChatGPT, which would generate a paper, then run that through Grammarly."==

==His teachers accepted these papers while apparently never addressing his inability to read.==

==To be honest, we have to give William props for the sheer ingenuity.== ==[Like Barbara Corcoran—the real estate mogul who credits her dyslexia with fueling her ambition to prove she wasn't stupid](https://www.instagram.com/p/DHlhogaOdUW/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-3-4-gpa-student-who-couldn-t-read)====—this young man's resourcefulness may well lead him to success despite the system's failures. But that doesn't excuse what happened.==

==The court determined that the school's "accommodations" didn't help William learn—they simply "did the work for him."==

==How many other students are receiving passing grades—even excellent grades—without mastering fundamental skills? And who bears responsibility when a student graduates without the ability to function in society?==

==The judge's ruling was clear: Despite William's 3.4 GPA, the school failed to provide an education "tailored to the student's needs." In other words, grades without learning are meaningless credentials.==

==The excessive reliance on academic qualifications as proof of ability, even when those credentials may not represent actual knowledge or skills.==
