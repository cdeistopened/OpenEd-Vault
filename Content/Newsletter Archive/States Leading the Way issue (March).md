==Dear Readers,==

==I often share with you the stories of specific schools, communities, and organizations that are doing a fantastic job bridging the gap between education and the workforce. This month, I’m excited to zoom out a little and share that ASA has teamed up with national nonprofit Bellwether to launch a new report. In it, we highlight 10 states that have significantly progressed work-based learning initiatives in recent years. These states are following unique approaches to creating and fortifying work-based learning programs and policies, but they adhere to a few common principles. At the core of each state’s success? A belief in an expanded definition of work-based learning; one that focuses as much on accountability and reporting as it does on the ins and outs of programs.== ==**(**====**[Read the report](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/report-american-student-assistance-bellwether-140000370.html?)**====**.)**==

==Work-based learning offers us a chance to build real equity into the education and employment landscapes by connecting the two. Yet, a recent story of two friends demonstrates that when programs are too sporadic or small in scale, some kids thrive while others needlessly miss out.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://www.the74million.org/article/shut-out-high-school-students-learn-about-careers-but-cant-try-one-that-pays/)**====**.)**== ==I’m therefore encouraged to see bi-partisan examples from states that are expanding access to pathways like apprenticeship and technical education, such as the recent legislation introduced in New Mexico and Kansas.== ==**(**====**[Read the story](https://ladailypost.com/heinrich-moran-introduce-legislation-to-create-pathways-to-stable-careers-expand-access-to-apprenticeships-technical-education/)**====**.)**== ==I’m excited to see tech companies like Transfr Trek making strides towards accessible and engaging digital career exploration and support for many more kids.== ==**(**====**[Read their announcement](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250204937960/en/Transfr-Launches-the-First-XR-Based-Multi-Modal-Solution-for-Career-Exploration)**====**.)**== ==And, I’m moved to see more schools and organizations rethinking the nature, value, and purpose of credentials — a concept explored by my colleague Judy Goldstein in her recent article.== ==**(**====**[Read the article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/credentialing-landscape-setting-stage-judith-l-goldstein-n8i6e/?trackingId=mF3SrfYIQfGwwPuH1qeeYQ%3D%3D)**====**.)**== ==In light of so much activity that’s transforming the status quo, I truly believe that this is an exciting time to work in and around education.==

==In closing, I invite you to check out what’s been happening on the One Question Podcast series — my collaboration with author Michael Horn. Recently, Michael and I were joined by Roy Spence, the founder of the Purpose Institute and the Make It Movement. Roy explains why ‘What do you want to be?’ is simply the wrong question to ask of kids.== ==**(**====**[Watch our interview](https://michaelbhorn.substack.com/p/roy-spence-show-dont-tell?utm_source=podcast-email&publication_id=35034&post_id=156879832&utm_campaign=email-play-on-substack&utm_content=watch_now_button&r=17drao&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email)**====**.)**== ==In another episode, we were joined by Aaron Rasmussen, the founder of MasterClass, and reminded to help kids look for the common themes that connect their diverse interests.== ==**(**====**[Watch our interview](https://michaelbhorn.substack.com/p/aaron-rasmussen-stay-curious)**====**.)**== ==And most recently, we spoke with actor John Pankow of the hit TV series== _==Mad About You==_==. John talked about harnessing the power of gratitude and explained how this mindset has helped him in his career journey.== ==**(**====**[Watch our interview](https://michaelbhorn.substack.com/p/john-pankow-the-power-of-gratitude?utm_source=podcast-email&publication_id=35034&post_id=157470907&utm_campaign=email-play-on-substack&utm_content=watch_now_button&r=17drao&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email)**====**.)**==
