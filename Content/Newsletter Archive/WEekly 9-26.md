# ==**DEEP DIVE:**== ==Maria Montessori's 117-Year-Old Secret==

==In 1907, Dr. Maria Montessori walked into a Roman tenement filled with children everyone else had written off. The authorities called them "unteachable." Within months, these same children were teaching themselves to read, solving complex math problems, and—most shocking to observers—choosing to work rather than play.==

==What Montessori discovered in that first== _==Casa dei Bambini==_ ==(Children's House) wasn't just a teaching method. It was a truth about human nature:== ==**children are born scientists, desperate to understand their world.**== ==Give them real tools instead of toys, respect instead of condescension, and freedom within prepared limits, and they'll exceed every expectation you never knew you had.==

=="The greatest sign of success for a teacher," she wrote, "is to be able to say,== _==the children are now working as if I did not exist.==_=="==

==More than a century later, something unexpected is happening. In an age where AI can generate essays and solve equations, the skills Montessori develops—creativity, independence, critical thinking—matter more than ever. As Ben Mann, co-founder of AI company Anthropic,== ==[recently explained why his daughter attends a Montessori school](https://x.com/lennysan/status/1947810003169292371?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--bHmZdWFL12K4DnYKKkYu4um-Ai4vdmARPY9xxrRuXmFS_LkHUPAEzMZYVRVbS1iW9XADN)====:==

==**"Learning facts is going to fade into the background. What matters is that she's happy, thoughtful, curious, and kind."**==

==The method centers on five interconnected areas. Practical Life builds concentration through real work—a three-year-old spending twenty minutes transferring beans with tweezers is developing the pincer grip for writing, the left-to-right movement for reading, and the focused attention for mathematics. The famous== ==[Pink Tower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXFwOcfdLIM&utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--bHmZdWFL12K4DnYKKkYu4um-Ai4vdmARPY9xxrRuXmFS_LkHUPAEzMZYVRVbS1iW9XADN)== ==helps children internalize mathematical relationships through their muscles long before they encounter numbers.==

==But here's what might surprise you: Montessori believed that after age 12, adolescents don't need more academics—they need real work that matters...==

# ==**PODCAST HIGHLIGHT:**== ==How to Reclaim Your Teenager's Affection==

==Is it really "normal" for teenagers to pull away, preferring friends over family and treating their parents with disdain? Former public school teacher== ==[Janae Daniels](https://opened.co/blog/teenage-rebellion-is-a-myth-or-it-can-be?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--bHmZdWFL12K4DnYKKkYu4um-Ai4vdmARPY9xxrRuXmFS_LkHUPAEzMZYVRVbS1iW9XADN)==  ==once thought so, until she witnessed a striking contrast: a mother crying over her distant daughter, followed by a homeschool dance where teens eagerly pulled their moms onto the floor. The difference, she discovered, was their primary attachment.==

==Drawing from the work of Dr. Gordon Neufeld, Janae shares the transformative idea that== ==**"we cannot parent children whose heart we don't have,"**== ==arguing that what we accept as normal teenage behavior is often a symptom of a lost connection.==

==Pushed into homeschooling by the pandemic, Janae’s journey began with a disastrous, tear-filled attempt to replicate school at home.==

==The turning point came from an unlikely source: the piano tuner, whose visit taught her more about education than her teaching degree ever had. By prioritizing her relationship with her teens and giving them the freedom to be bored, she watched them blossom—learning instruments, developing real-world business skills, and reigniting a deep love of learning.==

==Her story is a powerful testament to how slowing down and focusing on connection can help you reclaim your teenager's affection and transform your family.==

# ==**THOUGHTS OF THE WEEK**==

==**Success Theater**====We judge restaurants by whether the food tastes good. We judge gyms by whether people get fit. But in education, we applaud the credential—not the life that follows. Parents proudly announce their kid graduated with honors, even if that kid is 27, unemployed, eating chicken wings in the basement. But the diploma on the wall…== _==that's==_ ==success! Weird, huh? (====[From Isaac Morehouse on the Hannah Frankman Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jk9sdqL__wg&utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--bHmZdWFL12K4DnYKKkYu4um-Ai4vdmARPY9xxrRuXmFS_LkHUPAEzMZYVRVbS1iW9XADN)====)==

==**The Gift of Boredom**====  
"Boredom leads to brilliance," Janae discovered. When her kids had nothing to do, that's when her daughter started devouring books and her son picked up guitar. "We've overbooked our kids and robbed them of the gift of boredom, because that's where genius happens." Her 18-year-old told her: "You blessed me with the gift to think."

==**Children Are Born Scientists**====  
Montessori's core insight: children don't need to be taught how to learn—they need to be given the freedom to explore. When you see a toddler repeatedly pouring water or a six-year-old obsessed with counting everything, you're witnessing the scientific method in action. The job isn't to teach them. It's to get out of their way.

# ==**TRENDS OF THE WEEK**==

==**Indiana's Microschool Revolution**== ==Indiana had 6 microschools in 2023. Today they have over 130. The twist?== ==[Public school superintendents are now leading the charge](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerrymcdonald/2025/05/27/public-microschooling-gains-popularity-and-support/?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--bHmZdWFL12K4DnYKKkYu4um-Ai4vdmARPY9xxrRuXmFS_LkHUPAEzMZYVRVbS1iW9XADN)====. Phil Hauer runs Eastern Hancock school district and just launched the state's first network of public charter microschools—while keeping his superintendent job. Kerry McDonald calls people like Phil "intrapreneurs"—entrepreneurs working inside the system.==

==**[The 17-Year-Old Who Solved the Unsolvable](https://www.quantamagazine.org/at-17-hannah-cairo-solved-a-major-math-mystery-20250801/?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--bHmZdWFL12K4DnYKKkYu4um-Ai4vdmARPY9xxrRuXmFS_LkHUPAEzMZYVRVbS1iW9XADN)**== ==Hannah Cairo learned calculus on Khan Academy at 11. By 17, she'd disproved the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture that stumped mathematicians for 40 years. Six PhD programs rejected her for not having a bachelor's degree. The lesson? Nobody told her it was impossible, so she did it anyway.==

==**The Montessori Mafia Takes Over Tech**== ==Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Amazon's Jeff Bezos. Wikipedia's Jimmy Wales. When Barbara Walters asked if having professor parents explained Google's success, Page credited something else: "We both went to Montessori school... not following rules and orders, being self-motivated, questioning what's going on in the world." The== ==[Wall Street Journal calls it the "Montessori Mafia."](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-IMB-2034?utm_campaign=14243626-OpenEd%20Daily&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--bHmZdWFL12K4DnYKKkYu4um-Ai4vdmARPY9xxrRuXmFS_LkHUPAEzMZYVRVbS1iW9XADN)==

Schools spend zero time on life skills like relationships or money management. Twelve years of test prep for jobs that might not exist. When an 11-year-old can learn calculus on Khan Academy, you have to wonder: are we optimizing for education or convenience?==
