## ==📊 TREND==

### ==Is Technology Improving Educational Outcomes?==

==A provocative== [==new report from After Babel==](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-edtech-revolution-has-failed?r=5d1ba&utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true) ==suggests that the so-called “EdTech revolution” has been nothing of the sort. Global test scores are declining, and research shows that students using computers “very frequently” at school tend to perform== ==_worse_====.==

==What’s interesting is that the same research shows that technology’s impact varies dramatically depending on how it’s used:==

- ==Science showed minimal gains (0.18)==
- ==Reading showed small gains (0.25)==
- ==Writing and Math showed modest gains (0.32 and 0.33 respectively)==

==None of these are considered impressive metrics.==

==The one area where the study found a sizable positive impact from technology was for students with specific learning needs==

==**What’s going on here?**== 

==It should be obvious: technology isn’t a magic wand you can wave over a classroom of 30 diverse learners. It’s a== ==_tool_== ==that only works when matched to specific student needs and learning goals. At OpenEd, we don’t just throw technology at kids – we help them integrate it into a== ==_personalized learning plan._==

### ==Exploring Big History==

==“Mom, why do we have to learn about dead people?”==

==(👆️ Sound familiar?)==

==Have you heard of the== [==Big History Project==](https://www.oerproject.com/Big-History?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=078-education-school)==? Instead of starting with ancient civilizations, Big History zooms== ==_all the way out_== ==to the Big Bang, taking students on a 13.8-billion-year journey from the formation of stars to the rise of complex societies (think Carl Sagan’s famous “Cosmos” series meets World History).==

==And if you make it all the way through, you can continue with the== [==World History Project==](https://www.oerproject.com/World-History?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=078-education-school)==, which picks up the human story (yes, the dead people) in more detail.==

==**At a glance:**==

- ==Adapts for grades 6-10==
- ==50+ lessons across 10 units==
- ==62 videos, 117 texts, 40 activities==
- ==Built-in support for all learning levels==

==**Perfect for:**==

- ==Students who need to see the “big picture” of the day for deep dives into personal interests, projects, and real-world learning.==
- ==Kids who ask “big questions”==
- ==Science lovers who think history is boring==
- ==Visual learners (thanks to excellent multimedia content)==
