    ==**Isaac Morehouse**====: Your book is called "The Parent Revolution," not "The Education Revolution." Why parents specifically?  
    ====**Corey DeAngelis**====: Parents have woken up. They're never going back to sleep. For decades, the only organized group in education represented the employees. Now there's a new sheriff in town. They're called parents. And in the past four years, we've had more advancement on school choice than in the preceding four decades.  
    ====**Isaac**====: I live in Florida and we homeschool, I guess, but my daughter attends a three-day-a-week school, plays volleyball at a different private school, does some online learning... I don't even know what to call it anymore.  
    ====**Corey**====: That's exactly right. And that's the future of education. Not everyone's doing this hybrid approach yet, but more families are discovering they can customize education to fit their child's needs. You can use some funding for home-based education, some for private school courses, some for online learning. The rigid categories don't matter anymore.  
    ====**Isaac**====: This seems to challenge the whole premise of traditional education.  
    ====**Corey**====: Think about how we actually learn. How do people learn to walk? How do kids learn to talk? The reality is most of our learning, even now, happens outside the traditional school system. It should be self-directed. It should be based on interest.  
    When I was in school, I'd go home and read about topics that interested me, then come to class prepared. I didn't absorb information being force-fed in class. That's how human beings naturally learn.  
    ====**Isaac**====: What changed to make this possible now?  
    ====**Corey**====: Parents got to see behind the curtain. They saw their kids could learn more in a fraction of the time. Kids were less anxious. Parents realized they were more capable than they'd been told.  
    You know, parents were always told, "You're not an educator, you can't figure this out." But you don't have to be an engineer to choose your child's math teacher. You don't have to be a surgeon to choose your child's doctor. And you don't need a teaching degree to know what's best for your child's education.  
    ====**Isaac**====: Tell me about the teachers in all this. It seems like this could benefit them too.  
    ====**Corey**====: Absolutely. The Washington Post of all places wrote about this occurrence during COVID in New Jersey. They were covering a public school teacher who had been in the system for decades, decided to leave and created her own micro school. She was making the same amount of money as a tenured school teacher but had a fraction of the class size—I believe like 10 as opposed to 30. And she didn't have to deal with all the red tape.  
    This isn't just a win for parents and students. It's also a win for teachers too. They get more autonomy, smaller class sizes, and can focus on what they do best—actually teaching kids.  
    ====**Isaac**====: What about parents who feel overwhelmed by choice? Who worry they're not qualified?  
    ====**Corey**====: Look, in Chicago they have 30 to 40 schools with zero percent math proficiency rates. Zero percent. Come on, you can do better than zero percent.  
    How did you figure things out before kindergarten? You are your child's first and foremost educator, and I would argue the best educator your child's ever going to have. You taught them to walk, to talk, to navigate the world. Why would that suddenly stop at age five?  
    ====**Isaac**====: So what can parents do right now, regardless of their state's policies?  
    ====**Corey**====: First, look at which policies are already available in your state. Most states—I believe like 48 of them now—have charter schools, for example. And even states like California have virtual charter schools where, if you're doing home-based education, you can have like three or four thousand dollars per student per year. A lot of people just don't know about these things.  
    Second, trust yourself. You know your child better than any system ever could. You see their struggles, their interests, their potential. No standardized approach can match that knowledge.  
    Finally, connect with other parents. This revolution is happening because parents are sharing information, supporting each other, and demanding better. Your voice matters more than you think.  
    ====**Isaac**====: Any final thoughts for parents considering their options?  
    ====**Corey**====: The question isn't whether traditional schools are good or bad. The question is: which of these adults get to decide what's best for a particular child? And I think parents are in the best position. They have the most information on the ground. They're the closest to that member of their family. It's their child. No one else is.  
    Just because you live in a state that doesn't have education savings accounts right now, I think that's going to change soon, but it's going to rely on people like you working alongside other parents and grandparents and members of your community to push for the right thing.  
    You figured out how to raise your child before they turned five. There's no reason that wisdom suddenly disappears when they reach school age. Trust yourself. You've got this.  
    ==_==The parent revolution isn't about tearing down what exists—it's about building what our children actually need. As more states embrace educational freedom, families are creating learning experiences as unique as their kids. And that's exactly how it should be.==_==  
    ==_==Listen to the full conversation on== ==[the OpenEd Podcast.](https://open.spotify.com/show/6Kf7SZ8XASA6tSqMEuHmVC?si=f789cdee70314085)==_==  
    ‍==
    

==Something unexpected is happening in American education. Parents are taking control, and the results are nothing like what anyone predicted.==

=="It's not one size fits all," says Corey DeAngelis, author of the best-selling book== _==[The Parent Revolution](https://a.co/d/gm4KYwT)==_ ==and one of the nation's leading advocates for educational freedom. "It's one size fits none. We should let a thousand flowers bloom instead."==

==DeAngelis joined us on the OpenEd podcast to discuss how 17 states have quietly revolutionized education by doing something simple yet profound: letting education dollars follow the student rather than the system.==

==When asked to identify the single most transformative change that could fix American education, Corey DeAngelis doesn't hesitate: "Fund families directly instead of systems."==

==It sounds deceptively simple, but this fundamental shift in how we allocate the $800 billion spent annually on K-12 education could create a cascade of positive changes throughout the educational landscape.==

=="When you fund families directly, you create a market that actually responds to their needs," DeAngelis explains. "Right now, the government has a monopoly on education funding, and that money is locked into institutions regardless of their performance."==

## ==The Pandemic's Silver Lining==

==While COVID-19 brought unprecedented challenges to education, it also created what DeAngelis calls a "transparency event" that accelerated the school choice movement dramatically.==

=="The teachers unions really stepped on a rake when they fought to keep schools closed," he notes. "Zoom school showed parents what was happening in the classroom for the first time. They saw the curriculum, they saw the quality of instruction, and in many cases, they weren't happy."==

==This newfound awareness created a groundswell of parental activism that has transformed the educational landscape. "Parents became a new interest group," DeAngelis says. "They showed up at school board meetings, they voted differently, they started demanding options."==

==The results speak for themselves: 17 states now have universal school choice programs, up from just one state five years ago. DeAngelis calls it "the fastest civil rights movement in modern American history."==

==These programs typically work through education savings accounts, tax-credit scholarships, or vouchers that allow education dollars to follow the child to whatever learning environment best meets their needs—whether that's a private school, homeschool, microschool, or hybrid model.==

=="We're seeing innovation explode in states like Arizona and Florida," DeAngelis says. "When families have options, satisfaction increases and costs actually go down because providers have to compete for students."==

## ==The Unbundling of Education==

==One of the most exciting developments DeAngelis highlights is the "unbundling" of education—the ability for families to mix and match different educational services rather than accepting the one-size-fits-all approach of traditional schooling.==

=="We're seeing families create customized learning experiences," he explains. "Maybe your child attends a microschool three days a week, takes online courses for certain subjects, and participates in a homeschool co-op for others."==

==This flexibility allows education to be tailored to each child's unique needs, interests, and learning style—something the traditional system has struggled to provide.==

==DeAngelis emphasizes that parents don't need specialized credentials to make good educational choices for their children. "You are your child's best teacher," he insists. "Nobody knows your child better than you do, and nobody has a stronger incentive to see them succeed."==

==He points to research showing that parents across all demographic groups prioritize academic quality, safety, and values alignment when choosing schools—the same factors education experts would recommend considering.==

==While the school choice movement has made tremendous progress, DeAngelis acknowledges there's still work to be done, particularly in states like California and New York where teachers unions maintain significant political influence.==

==However, he remains optimistic: "The genie is out of the bottle. Parents have seen what's possible, and they're not going back to the old system."==

==The message is clear: when we fund families instead of systems, we empower parents to create educational environments where their children can truly thrive.==

==Greetings!==

==[A reclusive AI billionaire just broke a 20-year silence with a 3-hour podcast that is breaking the internet](https://x.com/patrick_oshag/status/1960311266762703054)====. Joe Liemandt—the founder of Trilogy Software who vanished from public view at the height of his fame—has emerged as the unlikely "Principal" of== ==[Alpha School](https://alpha.school/)====, and he's backing a radical vision for education with over a billion dollars of his own money.==

==Let's dive in.==

==**THOUGHT:**== ==Learning Happens at the Limit====**TREND:**== ==Your Textbook is a Relic====**TOOL:**== ==The Time-Back Machine==

# ==Learning Happens at the Limit==

==Joe Liemandt boils his philosophy down to one line:==

==**[Learning happens at the limit](https://x.com/patrick_oshag/status/1960311266762703054)**====**.**==

==Real growth occurs when students operate at their personal edge, not the comfortable middle where traditional classrooms aim. At Alpha School, this means second-graders running 5Ks, fourth-graders passing Wharton MBA simulations, and kindergarteners climbing 40-foot rock walls.==

==Expanding the "limit" isn't about increasing academic pressure. Instead, it's about giving children the dignity of high expectations paired with the support systems to meet them. As Liemandt puts it: "The key to every kid's happiness is high standards combined with high support."==

# ==Your Textbook is a Relic==

==Liemandt claims:== ==[All educational content is obsolete](https://x.com/patrick_oshag/status/1960311266762703054)====.==

==The classics might disagree (Shakespeare and Euclid aren't exactly outdated). But the the one-size-fits-all delivery that assumes a mythical "average student" is no doubt obsolete.==

==In the 1990s, Liemandt built SalesBuilder, the world's first commercially successful AI system. Now he's applying those same principles to education through the "Incept" platform, which generates personalized lesson plans:==

==A baseball kid learns fractions through batting averages.==

==A Taylor Swift fan explores WWI through concert analogies.== 

==Alpha's data shows when taught to true mastery (90%+ comprehension), using personalized curricula, students can complete grade levels in 20-40 hours instead of 180+ classroom hours.==

==Content endures. Delivery methods don't have to.==

# ==The Time-Back Machine==

==At== ==[Alpha School](https://alpha.school/)====, students complete academics in 2 hours daily, then spend the rest of their day on passion projects, life skills, and hands-on workshops.==

==Now Alpha is packaging this system as== ==[Alpha Anywhere](https://alphaanywhere.co/)====—bringing their famous 2-hour learning engine directly to families. The platform combines AI tutoring with vision-based analytics that monitor learning patterns and provide real-time coaching to eliminate time-wasting habits.==

==Think of it as getting your child back. Instead of six hours trapped in a classroom, they get two hours of efficient learning followed by four hours of freedom to pursue what they actually care about.==

## What kind of homeschool parent are you? | OpenEd (1)

[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e31168e49f5b7e6f76f0e5/68c4e84502d0a19ec1a90cbe_Michael%20Gibson%20\(1\).png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67e31168e49f5b7e6f76f0e5/68c4e84502d0a19ec1a90cbe_Michael%20Gibson%20\(1\).png)

==If you're looking for a detailed, step-by-step tutorial on how to homeschool, this isn't it. That kind of guide wouldn't be possible even if it were desirable, because the foundational principle of open education is that every child is unique.==

==Instead, this is a guide to becoming a different kind of educator—not a CEO who manages every variable, but a gardener who cultivates conditions for natural growth.==

==This mindset shift emerged from a recent Open Education breakthrough event featuring CEO Isaac Morehouse, Founder Matt Bowman, and special guest Janae Daniels, host of the== _==[School to Homeschool](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/school-to-homeschool/id1696133528)==_ ==[podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/school-to-homeschool/id1696133528)====. Their collective wisdom reveals how the gardener's approach isn't just a nice metaphor—it's a complete operating system for education.==

## ==The Gardener's First Principle: You Can't Force Growth==

=="I just want to share this message," Isaac Morehouse began. "Your kids are going to be okay. You can relax a little bit."==

==This is the gardener's starting point. While the CEO-parent tries to optimize and control every outcome, the gardener understands a fundamental truth: you cannot force a seed to grow. You can only create the right conditions and trust the process.==

=="Don't over-analyze and stress how to perfectly tailor everything," Isaac advised. "And please, don't compare yourself to others... Comparison is the thief of joy."==

==This principle is especially crucial for parents beginning with older children.==

==As Janae Daniels explained, "We cannot parent children whose heart we do not have. If you're starting to homeschool your teenagers, the very first thing that you have to focus on is the relationship. That has to come before everything else."==

==The relationship is your soil. Without healthy soil, nothing else can take root.==

## ==Creating the Growing Conditions: Space, Time, and Observation==

==Every gardener knows that seeds need darkness and quiet to germinate. In education, that darkness is boredom—a condition we've almost eliminated from modern childhood.==

=="I learned that boredom leads to brilliance," Janae shared. She discovered this when her children only picked up musical instruments after experiencing profound boredom. "We've overbooked our kids so much that we've robbed them of the gift of boredom, because that's where genius happens."==

==But how do you know what conditions your unique seedling needs? You observe. Matt Bowman suggests a simple tool from the== _==Open Education==_ ==book: the== ==**Sticky Note Exercise**====.==

==For one week, leave sticky notes around the house and have everyone—parents included—jot down answers to key questions:==

- ==What do you think about when you have free time?==
- ==What do you believe you're good at?==
- ==What do you want to get better at?==
- ==What do you genuinely dislike?==

==This isn't data collection for the CEO-parent to analyze. It's the gardener learning to read the signs of what each plant needs.==

==[Download the full Sticky Notes Exercise here](https://opened.co/book)====.==

## ==Building the Trellis: Structure That Supports Without Constraining==

==Here's where the gardener metaphor becomes especially powerful. Plants need support structures—trellises—but these must be flexible enough to allow organic growth.==

=="The more you structure learning, the less that learning actually lasts," Matt Bowman explained. Yet as Janae countered, "If my nine-year-old with sensory processing disorder had zero structure, her little brain would go haywire."==

==The secret? Your trellis must adapt as the plant grows. Isaac Morehouse offered a brilliant developmental map:==

- ==**Early Years (0-10):**== ==Minimal structure, like ground cover that allows maximum exploration==
- ==**Middle Years (10-14):**== ==Stronger support during rapid growth and change==
- ==**Teen Years (14+):**== ==Gradually shifting to structures they build themselves==

==Matt added crucial context: "Children change more between 10 to 14 than any other time in their lives except zero to three." During these years of dramatic transformation, they need more support—not more control, but more structure to climb.==

## ==The Piano Tuner Principle: Recognizing Unexpected Fruit==

==The gardener's greatest skill is recognizing value in the unexpected. Janae's story of her disastrous first day of homeschooling perfectly illustrates this principle.==

==After a morning of tears over carefully prepared worksheets, an unexpected piano tuner arrived. As her children abandoned their work to watch him discuss sound waves, geometry, and octaves, Janae had an epiphany: "I realized they had no interest in the beautiful lesson plans I had prepared. I had to rethink how my kids learned."==

==The CEO-parent would have seen this as a disruption. The gardener recognized it as the whole point—authentic learning sprouting in unexpected directions.==

## ==From Interest to Harvest: The Practical Formula==

==To make these "piano tuner moments" intentional rather than accidental, Matt Bowman offers a practical formula: connect an== ==**interest**== ==to a genuine== ==**need**== ==in your family or community.==

=="That's where entrepreneurship begins," Matt explained. "That's where community service begins."==

==If your child loves baking (interest), can they start a cookie business for neighbors (need)? If they're obsessed with video games (interest), can they learn coding to build a website for a local charity (need)?==

==This transforms random growth into purposeful harvest—not by forcing it, but by creating connections between what naturally emerges and what the world needs.==

## ==Seasonal Wisdom: Knowing When to Prune and When to Let Grow==

==Perhaps the most sophisticated aspect of the gardener's approach is understanding seasons. Your role changes as your children grow, and what worked last season may not work now.==

==Isaac shared how his son needed near-complete freedom when young, more structure in middle school, and eventually chose public school at 14—a decision that required Isaac to "swallow his pride" and trust the process. "It's about him. It's about each kid at each stage."==

==Janae described the constant recalibration: "Each year I'm learning something new or what worked last year doesn't work this year." Her son recently admitted he needed more structure, saying, "I feel like I want more to do, but not too much."==

==The gardener watches for these signals—when a child gravitates toward technology might indicate they need more engaging activities, when they seem overwhelmed might mean it's time to prune back commitments.==

## ==Your First Step in the Garden==

==The journey from stressed CEO to patient gardener is one of the most rewarding shifts a homeschooling parent can make. You don't need a perfect plan. You need the gardener's tools: patience, observation, and trust in the natural process of growth.==

==**Your First Step:**== ==This week, begin with observation. Try the Sticky Note Exercise, but approach it as a gardener would—not gathering data to control, but learning to read the signs of what wants to grow.==

==Remember what Isaac said about his mother reading homeschool magazines and feeling inadequate: "Don't compare. You can take joy in what others are doing... without feeling like that should be you."==

==Your garden will look different from everyone else's. That's not a bug in the system—it's the entire point.==

==Greetings!==

==We've all seen it, felt the pressure, and asked ourselves the same nagging question:== _==Am I doing enough for my child?==_

==It can be tempting to add more activities, lesson plans, and overall structure.==

==But in the recent== ==[open education breakthrough event](https://opened.co/blog/how-to-homeschool-the-open-education-way)====, Matt & Isaac talk about how the obsession with structure can go wrong. They’re also joined by school teacher-turned-homeschool mom Janae Daniels, who shares what she learned from her disastrous first day of homeschooling.==

==[You can watch the whole recording, or read the article version](https://opened.co/blog/how-to-homeschool-the-open-education-way)====.==

==Let's dive in.==

==**THOUGHT:**== ==CEO or Gardener====**TREND:**== ==The Un-Scheduling Arc====**TOOL:**== ==The Sticky Note Method==

# ==CEO or Gardener?==

==The homeschool CEO tries to manage every variable. They optimize, dictate, and control. The gardener does something different. They know you can't force a seed to grow. You just cultivate the right conditions and trust the process.==

==As Isaac put it, "Your kids are going to be okay. You can relax a little bit."==

==The foundation of a great education isn't a perfect schedule; it's a loving, engaged environment. Everything else is just fine-tuning. Don’t compare yourself to some other family you see on Instagram.==

==Fire the CEO. Become the gardener.==

# ==The Un-Scheduling Arc==

==How can you kill the schedule without creating chaos? The key is to replace rigidity with an== _==adaptable==_ ==framework that changes as your kids go through different phases.==

==Isaac laid out a simple roadmap for the appropriate amount of structure based on his own experience.==

==**Early Years (0-10):**== ==Minimal structure, leaning into unschooling and play.==

==**Middle Years (10-14):**== ==A bit more parent-led structure to guide them through the pre-teen funk.==

==**Teen Years (14+):**== ==They build their own structure, driven by jobs, sports, or projects.==

==Of course, even this framework isn’t to be taken too rigidly. Janae notes that her 9-year-old daughter with a sensory processing disorder thrives with more structure, while her other kids benefit from ample unstructured time to get bored.==

==Even the appropriate level of structure resists one-size-fits-all structure.==

==Think of structure like a trellis – it's there to support growth, not confine it. Different plants need different amounts of support, and the same is true for kids.==

# ==The Sticky Note Method==

==Once the trellis is in place, you need to know what the kid actually wants to climb toward. Matt shared a simple tool for this:== ==**The Sticky Note Method**====. For one week, have your kids jot down answers to a few questions:==

- _==What do you think about in your free time?==_
- _==What are you good at?==_
- _==What do you want to get better at?==_
- _==What do you dislike?==_

==This makes their inner world visible. Then, the magic happens when you connect their interest to a real-world need. For example, a kid who loves baking (interest) can start a cookie business for neighbors (need).==

## The Lost Art of Play | OpenEd (1)

==**Ela Richmond (00:00)**====  
Welcome back to the OpenEd podcast. I'm your sometimes host, Ela, and today I'm joined by Kristin and Ginger of the Scola Microschool. I'm so excited to have this conversation and shed light on the microschool side of open education—what is happening in this world, how Scola was started, and what it has done for your community. Welcome to the podcast.==

==**Kristin & Ginger (00:22)**====  
Thanks, Ela, for having us. We appreciate it.==

==**Ela Richmond (00:26)**====  
Okay, so just dive straight in. What is your story? How did you even get started with microschools? Were you an educator ahead of time? Were you a mom? Where did you start?==

==**Kristin (00:36)**====  
Yeah, good question. Both Ginger and I are moms. We also were educators, mostly in a private school conventional classroom. We worked together really closely, and I think that matters as part of our story. We knew each other's giftings. We're pretty opposite people who are just really appreciative of the other person's skill set and learned how to work together that way.==

==When we started Scola in 2022, if I'm being really honest, it's probably a seed that started in my master's program, possibly even a little bit longer than that. I tend to be a creative thinker, engineer, inventor, big-picture type of personality—like, let's blow it up and just see what happens. And Ginger is practical, like, "What's the next step?" and, "Okay, let's just try to get one thing done today." Together, our skill set was really powerful and important in getting Scola started.==

==I got my master's degree in educational leadership before I had my two kids. I was a middle school teacher. I loved middle school. I loved the creativity I got to have in my classroom. And then I think there were two motivations for me. One was my own children, just seeing how my daughter and my son were different and probably needed different things from schooling. But second was obviously teaching through COVID and just knowing that there were some constraints in the conventional classroom that I had always felt, but those were put under fire. It was a ridiculously hard but also very fruitful time to teach. I was the optimist that was like, "Something good can come out of this." And it was just the right time to let the seed of Scola actually start to take root. So we put legs on it and a framework around it in the fall of 2021 and opened our doors in September of 2022.==

==**Ela Richmond (03:08)**====  
How many students did you start with?==

==**Kristin (03:10)**====  
Yeah, that's a good question. When we originally started to shape our school, we wanted 24. We both really wanted to stay teaching, and effective teaching was a common big theme for us. With effective teaching, you always have to talk about student-to-teacher ratios, right? So we thought 24 was the right number. We didn't start with that. We started with 16. It grew to 18, then it grew to 23, and now we have between 30 and 35 students, but with three teachers involved. I think we found a good sweet spot.==

==**Ela Richmond (04:00)**====  
Wow. Paint the picture of how it started. I mean, it seems easy to teach a lot of kids, especially if you're a teacher, but then you get into the weeds and I bet there were a lot of challenges you didn't expect.==

==**Ginger (04:18)**====  
Ella, that's a great question. I'm just going to go back a little bit. Kristin and I were teaching together for years, and there was a moment before Scola was a dream that I put on a post-it—I don't even know if Kristin remembers this—I put, "Kristin, you need to start a school and I'll come work for you."==

==Fast forward years later, post-COVID, and COVID was a catalyst for something different. I am someone who actually does not love change. I really feel comfortable in the knowing, in what to expect. And after COVID, when I went back into a classroom for a few years, there was definitely a shift in me. I was really exhausted. COVID, with the technology and all the things involved, just took a lot out of me. Going back into the classroom, I recognized our students have shifted. They are not the same.==

==I think there was just some exhaustion and I was close to burnout. I'm like, "Okay, something needs to change," because I still loved teaching. I got my master's in educational leadership and I hit this point of, "Okay, something's gotta change. I wanna stay in education." Kristin and I would meet and go on walks, and that's when she started sharing the idea of Scola with me. And I'm like, "That's a great idea for you. Yes, you could totally do this." And slowly but surely, it just came to be that I would come alongside and help start Scola. It was that exhaustion that led me to the "yes." Like, "Okay, something's gotta change. I think this is it." So I just embraced it.==

==We were both working full time, so to get Scola off the ground, we would meet on Saturdays and make a checklist. The first question was, "What type of a school are we going to be? Private? Charter? Homeschool?"==

==**Kristin (06:50)**====  
On our Saturday morning meetings, we had to come up with those big questions. Who do we want to be? What's going to rise to the top? You realize quickly you can't be all the things. In fact, that was part of why we were leaving. The demands of our current situation were just piling up and there wasn't any meaningful subtraction. So we were like, "Okay, let's start with a clean slate."==

==That was way more vulnerable than it sounds. You're giving up pieces of your identity, pieces of what you prided yourself in. I even tear up just thinking about how much courage it took to be like, "Okay, all the measuring sticks I had about being a good teacher? I'm actually going to lay these down." Now, they might be good, we might pick them back up again, but let's just at least try to start with a clean slate. What's actually important to us?==

==It was so nice to have space to let the important things rise to the top.==

1. ==We knew that we wanted to be== ==**outside more often**====. We wanted movement. And outside is more than just outside; it's kids connected to their space, it's part of teacher health, it's natural, good things happening.==
2. ==We really wanted to== ==**meet students where they were at**====. We wanted to take the pace pressure off. We had to take words like "gifted," "talented," "accelerated," "behind," "ahead"... and I still catch myself sometimes, those things are really embedded. But meeting students where they're at, giving them an authentic learning sweet spot.==
3. ==Third, we really wanted a== ==**social-emotional component**====. To us, that means community. Friendship, relationship skills. How do we interact with our neighbor? We want to be part of a neighborhood. We want that veil between school and community to mesh a little bit more.==

==Those were the three things that floated to the top. And then every choice after that... this sounds super clear in retrospect, but in the middle of it, we just had a commitment to let these things be our North Star. That led to how many students we want, what type of organizational structure we'd be. Technically, we are a nonprofit that serves homeschool families. That is satisfying the law in Minnesota right now. It may change, and we'll learn to pivot. So we sound like a school, we breathe like a school, but technically we are a nonprofit that serves homeschool families. All those basic decisions—budget, materials, calendar—we made on these Saturday mornings, but these three things were always leading the way.==

==**Ela Richmond (11:51)**====  
That makes sense. It's fascinating that it started with the sentiment question: How do we increase and better the sentiment of teachers and students? Were you all ever afraid? You said that you let go of all these measuring sticks you had used for so long. Was it hard in the beginning to be like, "Okay, but what if we let them go outside more often? Are we still serving the purpose that we are hoping to serve?"==

==**Ginger (12:38)**====  
Absolutely. I think there was some apprehension on my end. Part of it was having each other. I trust that between the two of us, what's going to happen is actually best for students. And research backs that up. Research backs up that play is so important, that kids need to feel safe, seen, and connected in order to learn. So I think there was some fear, but all of those other things outweighed the fear. Also, the first time we got paid, our first paycheck was reassuring to myself and my husband. It's like, "Okay, yes, we are getting paid for this."==

==This is my 26th year of teaching, so I've had touchpoints with pretty much K through 8th grade. I know where kids need to be when they leave first grade, when they leave eighth grade. I feel confident in knowing where kids need to be and supporting them to get there. So there was a level of confidence and excitement that outweighed the fear.==

==That first day... part of me wishes we would have recorded it for our sake. We really did start with bare bones. What does it look like to really see kids and build a program around what they need? We started without a lot of the structure we typically have in the classroom. And slowly but surely, we started adding components back. So if you come in on a typical morning, you'll see three different small groups, and you'll see components of a typical classroom, except kids are working independently and you have multi-age students working on different things. You still see that structure.==

==**Ela Richmond (15:32)**====  
That's so fascinating. Have you seen a sentiment change in your students? What has the reaction been to this more flexible type of learning?==

==**Kristin (15:49)**====  
Well, we have two types of students. You have students that have been in different institutions that come to Scola, and you have students that have been here since kindergarten, for whom Scola is their only framework for education. For our kids who have been in other institutions, just like there had to be some undoing for us, there is this undoing process for them.==

==Our admissions process tries to honor that it's going to take some time to shed the old in order to try on the new thing. Early on, we listened to a lot of podcasts, trying to fill our backpack with inspiration. We heard this quote: "For however many years you're in a system, it's going to take that many months to actually shed everything off before you can rebuild." I was coming out with 18 years of teaching, so I needed to give myself 18 months. That's like two years of undoing these things.==

==Again, the unique group here is the kids who start in Scola and that's all they know. They're going to walk into a traditional school building for a sports practice and== _==that's==_ ==going to feel weird. Then we have students coming from a homeschool situation, and this is actually== _==more==_ ==structured than what they're used to, so they have a different learning curve. The hard part is usually the shift in where the pressure points are, or where all the measuring sticks went.==

==**Ela Richmond (18:51)**====  
Is there a sentiment difference between the students you used to teach and the students at Scola? I'm curious, because all the research says play and flexibility are so important. When you do that, what does it look like in the classroom?==

==**Ginger (19:18)**====Absolutely. As educators, we've always had the philosophy of seeing the whole child. But in typical classical education, academics gets the majority of the focus. In this space, academics is important, but kids are confident because we've shed the old ways. We understand, "Okay, this is important, but who you are as an image-bearer of God is== _==most==_ ==important." This is how we're going to see each other. When kids learn that, and they start to see each other in their unique giftings, there's a confidence that allows them to be vulnerable and make mistakes in ways that I couldn't tap into when I had 26 students and was being evaluated on getting them from point A to point B.==

==The pressure for our students is off, and the pressure for us is off to fully see them. We have progress reports, but we don't do letter grades, even in middle school. We look at where students should be for their grade level, and then we have a narrative side that gets into social skills and play. The narrative is most important because we're small. We get to really know students and come alongside them in a way I've never had the ability to do before.==

==And that correlates with getting to know the families. Families are our number one. Mom and dad are in the driver's seat. It is a partnership. In real-time, if a question comes up, I can give mom and dad a call or a quick text. To have this real-time understanding of what's going on socially and emotionally with a child—I cannot overemphasize the value of that. When it comes to academics, our students will face challenging moments. There is a grit that's required. And I think our students are able to tap into that grit because these other things, which are actually more important, have been checked.==

==**Ela Richmond (23:38)**====  
Has the way that Scola is structured, versus a traditional approach, changed the way that students and parents think about education? Has it changed their relationship with learning?==

==**Kristin (24:32)**====Yeah, that's really interesting. For so many families, mine included at one point, the relationship with school was actually about the outcome and the grades. That's where everyone—teachers, learners, parents—was prioritizing. Everyone was== _==trying==_ ==not to. There were huge efforts to say, "It's not about the grade," but the current was so strong that no matter how hard you tried, it still was so much time, so much money, so much emphasis put on the grade.==

==So I think we're still trying to find the right words for what shifts. Outcomes will happen, but when you put more time and investment in the process, there's just a different posture towards outcomes. And a different posture towards what learning can look like.==

==**Ela Richmond (25:56)**====  
I find that fascinating because in every other aspect of our lives, we understand that's true. In something as simple as working out or our marital relationships, we understand that everything becomes true in the moment. The habit of choosing your husband, the habit of showing up to the gym—all of that matters so much more than a physique or a weight. It will come. But it's funny because from a school perspective, we all just focus on the outcome as opposed to nurturing the moment. It's unreasonable to assume that if we do that consistently for five-plus years, the outcome won't be good.==

==**Kristin (26:56)**====I mean, Ella, now you're getting into a philosophy podcast here. The== _==telos==_==, the main component of why we educate, has shifted. And we all kind of see the historical benefit of that. I don't want to get too deep into that, because I want everyone to have access to this. And that might mean we have to shift some things or create schools that as many people as possible have access to. That's where our dream is. We love Scola, but we do get frustrated. How could every kid have this opportunity? We see the limitations in what we've built.==

==**Ginger (28:00)**====  
Just tapping a little bit on access. Our heart's desire is that every kid has access to a meaningful education where they are taught by healthy educators, their needs are being met, and they're learning. Thankfully, in the Twin Cities, we have access to lots of different choices. There are thriving public schools, great charter schools, wonderful private schools, and microschools popping up. But again, being a tuition-driven school, not everybody has access. So access is really important. We don't have a solution to that, but we are thankful to live in a place where there are options.==

==And this ties back to your question of how this changes people's posture. When we speak about teacher health, our families have started really caring about it. We talk about it a lot. Our school is better when we stay healthy and effective. And we encourage people—some of our families have students in more than one school model—how can you help the health of teachers in other schools? Effective, healthy teachers make a significant impact on the education of your neighborhood, of your city. The reach of an effective teacher can go a long, long way. We are pro-education. We don't plan to be in competition with anyone. We want more healthy options, more sustainable schools, more healthy teachers. We're doing our little micro part here, but we want to be in a positive relationship with school districts, learn from them, and help this whole thing grow.==

==**Ela Richmond (31:22)**====  
I fully agree. That's the whole concept of open education. Every student needs something a little bit different. How do you find exactly what a student needs? And how do we increase options for families? You mentioned some families do lots of different models of education at once. What does that look like? And how would you recommend people find the approach that works for their kids?==

==**Kristin & Ginger (32:09)**====  
Good question. For parents doing different models, there is a cost. These parents are keeping track of different calendars, different start times, different end times. There is a frazzled approach. We try to support them, but they are leading in the posture of being less concerned with an outcome and more concerned about the wellbeing and growth of their kid. It really is the privilege of being able to see each child as an individual and recognize, "This kid is thriving in this institution, but this kid is not. What are some other options?"==

==As for how to pick the right model, convenience is a really strong factor. We had some good school years where our top value was just picking the convenient option. My kids were okay, and we supplemented. I do think it's about tapping into your kids' motivation. What gets them motivated? One thing that has been really cool, but has taken time, is that student motivation in my previous classrooms was really dependent on me. In the way we've structured Scola, it has shifted the motivation onto students a lot more. They still need us for an on-ramp, for direct instruction, for feedback. But there are many times, several times a week, where suddenly there are 32 different things going on in this room, and we just stare at each other and go fill up our coffee. We bask in it, because this is the teacher's dream. This is us doing our job in the way we love doing our job. It's this level of student independence, student motivation. They have the right resources and they get to drive it. Now, those moments don't last the whole day, but it's a lot more like gardening. It's a tending job, more than a "drive the train" type of job.==

==**Ginger (36:00)**====  
Going back to what we'd say to parents trying to pick the right fit... when we meet with parents of kids going into kindergarten, we just try to put them at ease. There's this pressure: "I have to get it right." So, especially for kindergarten parents, just putting that pressure off. We say, "Here's what you can expect at Scola." When you're looking at institutions, try to get physically in the building during a typical school day. You can get a sense of the culture. Can you see your child in the hallways? In this classroom? I recommend parents get in for a tour and trust their gut. When it comes to standardized tests, I recommend looking at that, but it should not be the driving factor. There are so many things behind the scenes. I would put that lower on the list.==

==**Ela Richmond (38:02)**====  
That makes sense. I wonder about student motivation. There's natural motivation, but then there's motivation by osmosis, where a student is around other students or a family member they look up to. How do you help a kid foster those motivations?==

==**Kristin (39:00)**====I think Ginger's so good at this. I've learned a lot from her about how to ask kids what they're proud of. There is something about specific praise, really helping kids feel internally proud. A lot of this comes from teaching kids about emotions, about the way they feel, even frustration. Having them aware of those things is a huge part of motivation. Students have to recognize what "proud" even feels like—not because someone else told them it was good, but because== _==they==_ ==feel proud.==

==**Ginger (40:35)**====  
My mind goes to teaching kids that intrinsic motivation. It's not about them making me proud; it's about them feeling accomplished for the work they've done. In my small group, a kid might finish ten math problems in 20 minutes, and another kid might finish one. We've set up a culture where, whether it's one or ten, you get to feel proud. I'll notice that kiddo who finished one problem, but he focused and stuck with it. I'll say, "Hey, how does that make you feel? Look at what you did on your own."==

==Working in a multi-age group, they get to bring that out in each other. They're not in a hurry. There isn't one student getting the gold star. They learn to coach each other, not just give an answer. It's really special. I can just picture that kid who comes up to me, so excited because they did X, Y, Z, and just turning that around with a big smile on my face and saying, "How does that make you feel?"==

=="I feel so excited! Look what I did!"==

=="Why don't you go share that with your teammate at your table?"==

==It takes intentional reframing. The teacher is not the center. They're not doing this for me. It's about establishing the habit, the process, the learning, and feeling that feeling so that when they try something new tomorrow, they remember what it felt like.==

==**Ela Richmond (43:08)**====  
That is huge. It is so easy as a parent or a teacher to be the person they turn to for validation. But it's so important for it not to be the end of it, for it to be, "I am so happy for you, you should also be happy for you." Creating that line between "this is not just about pleasing me" and "this is about doing something inherently good." I've never heard that before, but it's a subtle thing that's so important.==

==**Kristin (44:11)**====  
Yeah, well, it's the adult paycheck world, too. We do this for the paycheck, but also because of the good work that's done in me and that I can do for other people. There's a lot of research on motivation. We're probably more the labs, hands-on, experiencing these things. We may not have all the scientific words, but you can see that kids go in and out of different types of motivations. When you know a student, when you are known and belong, there's a lot of space to take risks and grow. That's what's so nice about narrative reporting, not just grades. This is the character development people talk about. Motivation is a vulnerable place for students. Many have learned to hide or cope or only be motivated by the prize or the bribe. I have been the prize and bribing teacher, so I'm not exempt. But to start to see that shift is something we love writing about in reports to parents.==

==**Ela Richmond (47:02)**====  
I absolutely love that. So, a question about play. As adults, we recognize that being in a hurry is not great. When kids play, it feels as an onlooker that they're not being productive. We ask ourselves, "What else could I be doing?" Why do you all say yes to play? What is in play that makes it so useful?==

==**Kristin (48:31)**====  
Observing play... there's so much research here. Again, we want to honor that there are real scientists who have language around this. We just haven't found their book yet. This was a vulnerable shift for us. As a conventional teacher, you're taught that efficiency drives the system, and play isn't efficient.==

==**Ginger (49:15)**====  
If I took my kids outside for an extra recess, I felt like I'd be judged. "My kids are not working enough." Just shedding that.==

==**Kristin (49:25)**====  
Yeah, earning and deserving. There's such a currency required in play, and that's not honoring that play is actually the heavy hitter when it comes to skills. Peter Gray says it: play is the job of children.==

==On average, we do about three hours outside. We're Minnesotan, so sometimes that's difficult. At different ages, that time looks different. We'll hold classes out there, we'll hike, but we also want to honor that unstructured outside time is important. My job changed when we made this a priority. At recess duty, I know where my eyes are, but this felt different. I'm actually watching students and all these skills emerge. I'm not just managing conflict.==

==It was in one of my times outside as a researcher. I saw pockets of kids, all 100% engaged. I noticed the projects they were doing and came up with four categories:==

1. ==**Imagination:**== ==They were playing store, playing city, using walnuts as currency. A lot of times, the stories we're reading in books get played out here.==
2. ==**Competitive Structured Games:**== ==Games with rules, like hide-and-seek or football.==
3. ==**Civil Engineering:**== ==Digging holes, gathering branches, making a path for water in a dam. One time, they gathered every dead branch in the entire woods. I had to call the city office like, "I don't know if you wanted this project done, but we gathered all the dead sticks for you."==
4. ==**Social:**== ==Just the hangout. Talking, telling jokes, bantering.==

==We've used these four categories to help students see their time management, their skill set, their communication. What's interesting is, when we talk about kids... we don't really have staff meetings. Ginger and I are outside, getting fresh air, standing back-to-back, and we have the time and space to name every kid we see and make observations. This is what you dreamt about in teacher meetings. "Okay, I'm a little concerned, it feels like anxiety is present here," or, "They're in conflict a lot with this person." We can also observe what category of play they prefer and which ones are challenging. We have students begging for an organized game—they want the rules, the winner, the loser. Challenging them to join the imaginary group stretches them. This is what we'd write a book about.==

==**Ginger (57:05)**====  
It also gives students an opportunity to think about what they want to engage in. We might notice a student off by themselves, and we'll go over and say, "Hey, I noticed you're spending time by yourself. Can you tell me about that? Is this a choice? Do you just need some quiet alone time? If so, that's okay. Or is there a game you'd like to join? Would you like some help?" It's about getting to know them as individuals and helping them understand their own wiring. If you want to be by yourself, that's okay. But if there's a conflict, let's talk about it and work through it in real-time. In other settings, after recess, I'd spend half an hour trying to get to the bottom of all the social things. Here, we can help students gain the skills to work through it themselves.==

==**Ela Richmond (01:03:29)**====  
That's the perfect note to wrap up on. A practical question: most children tend to over-watch screens. It's high dopamine. It's hard to get that 45-plus minutes of, "I'm bored, what do I do?" You're saying you don't discover these things until after that time. How do you recommend a parent instill this as a habit?==

==**Ginger (01:05:11)**====  
First, as a parent, if you're trying to grow a child's stamina, think about where you're at. You don't go from zero to 50. If you typically get outside 10 minutes a day, make a goal of 20 and build from there. I've gotten comfortable with my son saying, "I'm bored." Actually, that's okay. The best stuff comes from boredom. I'll give him a few ideas, but he has very limited screens during the day. It takes about five, ten minutes, and then he has his Legos out, or he's on his bike, or taking his fishing pole to the lake. I guarantee if screens were an option, he wouldn't be doing those things. So I'm okay with him being bored.==

==As educators, we didn't start with three hours a day outside. The kids had to grow their stamina. We had to grow our ability to trust the research. And as we walked through it, we're like, "My goodness, the research is right." We have validation that this is really important. We have tech in Scola, too. We'll have math games, even brainless games. We have carved-out times for it. They know when it's coming. Every Thursday, we end the day with laptop time. We put boundaries around it, but we honor that screens are here to stay.==

==**Kristin (01:08:15)**====  
Also, we had some interesting supplies that are just helpful. But hold off on purchasing stuff right away. See what shapes up. Do you need to buy the nice shovel because digging holes is the thing? All of our jump ropes are rarely used for jump-roping. They're used for slingshots, for measuring. A lot of natural materials. Our kids know how to collect sticks and make things out of them. And some kids will increase their stamina faster if they have people to do it with. So for a family, pair up with another family. Bring them to a creek or a climbing place.==

==**Ela Richmond (01:09:54)**====  
My last question: you're talking about going over to a student who is alone. It sounds like you've done a very good job of building trust. But a lot of parents wonder, how much should I be stepping in versus giving them space to figure it out? How do you determine when to step in?==

==**Kristin (01:13:51)**====  
That's such a good question. It really comes from knowing the student and what skills they have. It can be the same age child, but one student understands how to confront another, express their feelings, and come to a compromise, and another needs help. It comes from knowing the student.==

==And that trust starts with the families. In this style of learning, there has to be a level of trust established with families. It's okay if families aren't feeling that from us or want something different. We're not offended by that. The trust starts with the parents, and then it takes time to build with students. But students can see right past it when you, as a teacher, just want to get onto the next thing and put a band-aid on it. That band-aid doesn't last. It's going to be torn off and show up as a disruptive behavior later.==

==Teaching is so formational. We use that word, and we are a faith-based school, but even a friend who isn't would probably agree. There's such forming and shaping in a school setting, no matter the model. Formation takes time, care, and seeing. We're going to be shaped whether we're intentional about it or not. That's how powerful classroom settings can be. We take that seriously. And this is why teacher health is so important. When we're healthy, we're going to approach the formation of students as whole people we care about. We have patience and trust for your family.==

==**Ela Richmond (01:17:58)**====  
This was an incredible episode. I'm so happy for Minnesotan families that they get to go to your school. Is there anything else you want to leave our listeners off with?==

==**Kristin & Ginger (01:18:26)**====  
I would just say if there are any other educators out there who are getting this idea of, "What if? Could I?" We would love to hear from you. We have a model school, so other educators reach out to us and are curious about how we did this. We would just encourage them to reach out. We'd love to chat with them.==

==**Ela Richmond (01:18:59)**====  
I love it. Okay, we'll leave all of your links in the description. Thank you all so much for coming on the episode.==

==**Kristin & Ginger (01:19:15)**====  
Thank you, Ela.==

==**Karalee Sartin: Welcome to the Open Ed podcast. I'm thrilled to introduce our guests today, Chet and Fletch from Sneak on the Lot. Fletch, would you start by telling us about your background?**==

==**Fletch:**== ==I got my start in the business when I was about 16 as a layout artist for Saturday morning cartoons on television – back when you could only see cartoons on Saturday mornings. After that, I jumped into live action film as a storyboard artist for many years. My first studio picture was a little film called The Sandlot, and then I jumped from studio picture to studio picture after that.==

==In 2000, Chet and I connected after the shooting at Columbine. We wanted to do something for students, not knowing how to do anything as far as education was concerned. We thought, "Well, we can teach them how to make movies, if that makes a difference." What it did was give students an opportunity to express themselves in a nonviolent, productive, creative way. It was far more effective than I originally would have thought.==

==From that time forward – 25 years ago – we've hosted Sneak On a Lot while running our careers and making movies. Now we're producers and directors on multiple series at Angel Studios, with more coming next year.==

==**Karalee: Fantastic. Chet, would you give us a brief bio, please?**==

==**Chet:**== ==My route was a little different than Fletch's, which makes our partnership great. I did start in production – Fletch got me my introduction to my first job many moons ago. I worked on a couple of what were called "movies of the week" to put myself through college.==

==After finishing college, I saw an article in Times Magazine with Spielberg, Katzenberg, and Geffen forming DreamWorks SKG. I didn't know much about Hollywood, but I decided that's where I wanted to go. I moved to LA without a job and eventually got into the story department at DreamWorks.==

==While in the story department, I got to work on Saving Private Ryan, Amistad, Mouse Hunt, and a couple of other films. Then I jumped to feature development, which was the core group trying to find the next feature film. My boss's office was the busiest at the studio – we had about 20 films in various stages of development at any given time. I worked on Meet the Parents, Small Soldiers, The Terminal, Road to Perdition, Blendstones, and others.==

==I later wanted to watch Steven Spielberg work on set, so I moved to work on Minority Report. It was fascinating watching him work with Tom Cruise and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, who won Oscars for Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan.==

==Most recently, we produced The Best Christmas Pageant Ever for Lionsgate, which was quite successful in theaters and is now streaming.==

==**Karalee: You two have managed to create an atmosphere that, while making a movie and still focused on the bottom line, somehow rises above the stress and not only makes really great film, but lifts everybody up around you. How do you do that? And why have you decided to make a curriculum that lifts up kids instead of just focusing on the bottom line?**==

==**Fletch:**== ==That's a good question. You do get really close when working on a film because you're with the same people day in, day out for 12-18 hours a day for many months. Often you'll go on to the next project with those same people.==

==But you're right – it is a stressful place and not ideal for bringing out the best in people. Chet and I saw early on what that looked like when we were working on "movies of the week," which are even more stressful because they have less money and tighter schedules. We both thought, "I don't like that environment and don't want to work in it for the rest of my life."==

==Occasionally you'd find a crew that worked well together, and what a pleasure that was. Those sets brought out everyone's best talent because no one was afraid to speak up. Everyone felt they could bring their creative self to work every day. Those were some of the seeds planted early in my career.==

==**Chet:**== ==Like you said, it's a stressful environment, and some people don't handle stress well. Usually, you only work with those people once and don't bring them back on the next film. Over time, your crew gets better and more like family.==

==Life is just too short to create more stress than necessary when it's already a high-stress environment. It's great to have fun while getting things done and lifting others. That's something we've tried to implement into Sneak on the Lot. We've put certain values and concepts into the curriculum that build rather than add stress or tear down.==

==Nothing against horror movies, but we've decided to make films that impact positively. They don't always have to be uplifting – you might tell a story with a downer ending – but we try to have a positive impact with everything we do.==

==All the filmmakers in Sneak on the Lot are young and usually don't have much life experience, but hopefully we can instill this great foundation that gets them started off right and helps them continue to rise, rather than having the wrong attitude.==

==**Karalee: I love that. Will you tell me a little bit more about the backlot? How does that tie into the curriculum, and what's the heart behind creating it?**==

==**Fletch:**== ==The backlot is a long journey. When we first started 25 years ago, before the internet was really anything, we reached a point where we had to get back to work. I had spent all my savings opening a little office running kids through from local high schools, trying to figure out how to teach filmmaking. The kids would not go home – you had to turn out the lights to send them home!==

==Eventually, we had to shut down the office, but we had built the curriculum we needed. Chet suggested putting it online, which was prophetic because that's where everything was going. I wanted to create an environment where just navigating the website would teach you how the film industry worked – so you'd understand how a movie studio backlot functions simply by using the site.==

==It worked well, but then they killed ActionScript, which was a backward step for designers. We moved to standard curriculum, but we always wanted to revisit the idea of creating an environment that teaches as you navigate it.==

==Twenty years later, it became apparent that a game was the best way to do this. The technology was now in place for what we'd dreamed of doing in those early days. We started building in Unity, and as we developed it, our vision started coming to life. You can walk around, meet people, have your own building, and talk to non-player characters who teach you about their jobs and roles – cinematographers, first assistant directors, PAs, and so on.==

==You can upload your movie, watch others' movies, and hear about opportunities. We wanted to implement a way for students to interact with the backlot – posting their posters for marketing, having people click on the posters to watch their movies, and connecting with real-life opportunities like reading for roles or finding collaborators.==

==We're still in a beta stage with "Sneak On" (the 3D version), but it's obvious that's our direction because kids love navigating and playing in the environment. Most of our development cycles will probably go into that now.==

==**Karalee: And you have actually cast students out of Sneak On, haven't you?**==

==**Chet:**== ==It's our goal to cast everything we do from people in the lot. For Mystic Hollow last year, we cast from people in the lot. We did all the casting for The Best Christmas Pageant Ever on the backlot too.==

==Our plan is to cast through the lot, hire editors, and hire all our crew through the backlot. For people in Hollywood, it's strange and hard to grasp – "What? It's a game? I have to upload my audition in this environment with avatars?" We say, "Trust us. We might be ahead of our time, but that's okay. We've always been ahead of our time."==

==It will not just be a game where students rise in the ranks through their efforts – it will lead to jobs and breaking into the industry. We've already had some successes with students breaking into the industry through Sneak on the Lot, even before the current version existed. We've helped talented students we've identified get into the industry, and we plan to continue that with what we're doing now.==

==**Karalee: I love that. You are literally helping students sneak onto the Hollywood lot, which is exactly what your name suggests.**==

==**Fletch:**== ==That's the idea.==

==**Karalee: I want to go back a little bit. Fletch, you mentioned in the beginning the origins of Sneak on the Lot, especially relating to Columbine. Can you take me back to that? You obviously had busy lives and successful careers. Why would you take time to create a curriculum?**==

==**Fletch:**== ==Part of it is because we're stupid! We're always taking on more than we can handle, and a year later we're like, "Hey, we did it. I can't believe we pulled that off."==

==When Sneak on the Lot started, it was born from a desire to make a difference. I was driving to set – I think I was working on Touched by an Angel – listening to the Columbine shooting live on the radio. All I could think was, "When was it okay to suddenly bring a gun to school?" That was totally foreign to me. And here we are 25 years later.==

==I thought, "We have to do something." My brother was a high school teacher, so I went to talk to him. Three days after Columbine, I had his class write an essay about their feelings on what happened, or how close they might be to doing something similar. I still have those 60-70 papers, and three or four of them said, "I'm pretty close." That shocked me – these were my brother's students!==

==I thought, "If there are three students of my brother's who are close, how many more are out there around the country, around the world?" That was the motivation that propelled us to want to make a difference somehow.==

==All we knew how to do was make movies, which on the surface might seem pathetic – "You're just entertainers." But when you realize what it takes to make a movie, you can employ every single classroom of a high school or middle school in the process – marketing, business, advertising, acting, music, sciences, you name it.==

==Once we realized that, we started thinking about how far we could take it. What would it take to make a film with students? We'd need to teach them because they don't know how, and teachers don't know either. That's why the workshop was born.==

==Chet went to film school while I went straight into the industry, so we came at it from different perspectives. Together, it meshed well. Through a year of working with students, making 40-50 short films, we noted what kids understood and what they didn't. Our curriculum evolved from that, particularly emphasizing development and writing because students generally understood editing and technical aspects, but absolutely loathed writing – even though that's some of the most fun stuff in the business.==

==We also noticed students often wanted to tell stories about suicide and dark topics. We'd say, "No, we're not going to let you make one of those. Make something nice, something funny – everybody loves to laugh." We encouraged a positive view: bring something to light that's good, that people want to see, that'll make their lives better.==

==We wanted to guide students not just through making movies, but through life – how to make good decisions and bring light to the world. It's easy to bring darkness; there aren't many people bringing light.==

==**Chet:**== ==Over the years, the curriculum has grown. We focused initially on development because students' stories weren't that great. Once they started getting development, we noticed their films weren't looking that great – they weren't using practical lights or camera movement. So we created curriculum on practical lighting, off-screen lighting, contrast, and camera movements.==

==Then we noticed sound problems, so we focused on that. Green screen was big, but students weren't pulling good keys, so we created curriculum on that. Kids were ripping off music, so we developed material on copyright. The curriculum has grown layer by layer over 25 years.==

==**Karalee: I love how film can give everyone a place – no matter what your talents are, no matter your abilities, whether you fit a traditional mold or not, there's a place for you, and you are valued and needed.**==

==**Chet:**== ==Absolutely. Filmmaking takes all types. It takes the creative kind who maybe aren't accepted by others as much in high school, allowing them to really shine and show what they can do. It takes the analytical person who's great at math – we'll slide you right in as a line producer doing the budget, keeping those creative types who have no sense of budget in check.==

==There's a place for that super social person – we'll put you on the marketing team building social media platforms and getting the word out. We need to build sets, so the construction department and welding teams are essential.==

==One of the most important parts on set is food – we need culinary skills for lunch and craft services, with options for those who want to eat healthy and those who don't.==

==Any class can be part of filmmaking. History is essential for any film not set in the present day. English and creative writing are obvious for screenplays. Even that typing class I took was the most valuable for my filmmaking career because now I can type!==

==**Fletch:**== ==There are athletes too – I know many stuntmen who were just jocks in high school who liked physical activity. You'd make a great stuntman!==

==Literally every classroom you can possibly imagine can be integrated into the film industry. It reaches every type of person and allows people of every walk of life, color, and height to have an important part in the filmmaking process.==

==**Karalee: Would you each share a success story of a student or school for whom your curriculum or film has really made a difference?**==

==**Fletch:**== ==One of those early students reached out to me recently. He was in the acting program at the same high school I attended and participated in those first years of Sneak on the Lot. Now he's been on Broadway for about 20 years. He messaged me saying, "You changed my life. That one year in that building changed my life. It made me realize I could do this for a living."==

==Another kid was kind of a goth kid – wore trench coats, dyed his hair black, wore makeup. He was a dark soul but would come to the building almost every day, driving 45 minutes to get there. I knew right away he was a talented writer – way ahead of his age. I kept telling him, "If I were you with your skill, I'd start as a writer. Directing will come, but start with writing – that's what you're really good at."==

==He wrote several films that year, and we entered them in a local festival where these kids cleaned up. It was fun watching him – this hunched-over, short kid – go down the aisle repeatedly to collect his awards. He won about five trophies that day, and with each one, he grew a little taller. By the end, that kid was ten feet tall – it changed his life. Now he sells his scripts for six figures in Hollywood and has been produced multiple times.==

==The other kid who used to come with him owns a movie equipment rental company in Los Angeles, and the girl who came with them is now an anchor for Fox News in LA.==

==**Chet:**== ==We've had lots of kids with success stories. Steve, who you met at the workshop, was a former student, and he's worked on about ten Steven Spielberg movies – he's working on the biggest movies in Hollywood.==

==**Fletch:**== ==With Sneak On, we're already talking about how to create opportunities where we can hire directors, producers, and writers right off the lot. We've got our eye on a couple of students who've proven themselves. We have about six or seven television series going over the next year and a half, and we can't do them all ourselves.==

==So we're considering bringing in students who've proven themselves to see how they'd respond under pressure with money and bigger names on the line. That's what Sneak On is built to do – filter out and find the best of the best. If we can do that, we'll pluck them out and put them in our own projects.==

==**Karalee: I just want to say a sincere thank you, not only for your time today but for what you do. Thank you for being so inspirational and living out bigger values than just the bottom line. We have the utmost respect for you and are honored to work with you and use your curriculum.**==
