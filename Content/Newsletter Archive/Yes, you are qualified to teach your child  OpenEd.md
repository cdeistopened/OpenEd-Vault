## ==💡 THOUGHTs==

### ==“Why don’t I feel qualified to teach my child?”==

==_You’re more qualified than you think._==

==Your job isn’t to be an expert in every subject. It’s to curate experiences and create an environment where learning can flourish. You’re already doing that every day.==

==Humans are naturally curious. Your child doesn’t need you to impart everything from your brain to theirs. They’re learning because that’s what humans do. Your role is to be a curator, protector, and guide.==

==Resources are nearly endless – from online platforms to books to community-based learning. Your job is twofold:==

1. ==find the right resources for your child==
2. ==remove the roadblocks to their natural curiosity.==

==Relax, and trust in your child’s innate desire to learn.==

==_**NOTE:**_== ==_This segment was taken from the_== [==_first Q&A podcast conversation between founder Matt Bowman and OpenEd CEO Isaac Morehouse_==](https://opened.co/?p=737&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=045-yes-you-are-qualified-to-teach-your-child)==_._==

## ==📊 TRENDs==

### ==“Can Homeschoolers Go to College?”==

==**Fun story:**== ==I don’t have a high school diploma. I never took the ACT or SAT. Yet I have an associate’s, bachelor’s, and master’s degree.==

==I started at a community college in high school (they didn’t care about diplomas) and transferred those credits to a four-year college, which also didn’t care about a diploma because I already had college credits.==

==So, can homeschoolers go to college?== ==**Absolutely.**==

==Will they be limited in their future?== ==**Not at all.**==

==Now, pretty much every college has a homeschool pathway for applications. Don’t just take my word for it –== [==a 2015 article in Business Insider calls homeschooling the “New Path to Harvard”==](https://www.businessinsider.com/homeschooling-is-the-new-path-to-harvard-2015-9?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=045-yes-you-are-qualified-to-teach-your-child) ==(yes, that Harvard). Colleges value self-directed learners over applicants who wait to be told what to do.==
