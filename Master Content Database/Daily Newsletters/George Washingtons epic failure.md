Greetings Open Eddies!

Can you believe that the year is almost halfway over? (Or, for the optimists… that we still have another 6 months to make good on our overly-ambitious New Year’s resolutions.)

With 4th of July weekend around the corner, and workers everywhere phoning it in this week, Ed thought he’d take the opposite tack and **OVERDELIVER** – taking stock of the most popular content from the first half of the year… all before taking a big exhale and starting his own summer break (yes, horses take vacations too).

This month, you’ll still get weekly digests and special podcast editions. And if you’d like to continue receiving just the weekly Friday edition after the break, you can always [**change your subscription settings here**](https://share.hsforms.com/1e70j6rWTRSSw2dPqCXZxSgrd4fh?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=031-weekly-roundup-the-most-watched-lesson-never-learned).

Without further ado, let’s take a walk down memory lane.
