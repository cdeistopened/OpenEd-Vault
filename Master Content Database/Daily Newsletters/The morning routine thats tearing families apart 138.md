## **DOES IT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY?**

A [**clip of Naval Ravikant on the Tim Ferriss Podcast recently went viral**](https://x.com/joelrafidi/status/1882152338376532222?s=51&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-morning-routine-that-s-tearing-families-apart-138) with that claim that non-homeschool parents’ lives “suck.” Why? because they're trapped in an exhausting cycle:

"They have to wake up at six in the morning... grab the kids out of bed screaming... Their lives are run around the school... And they don't get along with their kids... and for what?"

Loved this conversation with @astupple and @naval on the @tferriss podcast.

While I would never tell someone their life sucks (only they can know that), the rant hit on something crucial: **We often accept difficult patterns as inevitable.**

But it's less about homeschooling versus traditional school, and more about having the courage to ask: "Does it have to be this way?"

It's easy when choosing an education to focus only on the academic outcomes. But just as important - if not more - is the quality of your life, family time, ability to enjoy your kids, and stress levels. Don't discount the upgrades that can come beyond just academics when you tailor education.

Opening up education is about more than learning. It's about improving life for the whole family.

## **THE RISE OF EDUCATIONAL ARCHITECTS**

Peter Gray, a research professor at Boston College and author of [***Free to Learn***](https://www.amazon.com/Free-Learn-Unleashing-Instinct-Self-Reliant/dp/0465025994?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-morning-routine-that-s-tearing-families-apart-138), has spent decades studying self-directed education. One of his core findings is that children are innately driven to learn—if we create the right conditions. As Gray explains:

“Children come into the world exquisitely designed to direct their own education. They do not need to be forced to learn; they need to be **free to learn.**”

– Peter Gray

Following Gray’s lead, parents are becoming **“educational architects.”** Instead of accepting a one-size-fits-all curriculum, or feeling pressure to teach their kids every subject, they piece together a personalized learning plan by:

- Mixing online platforms with in-person classes
- Adding real-world projects alongside traditional academics
- Balancing structured lessons with self-directed exploration
- Adapting approaches as their children’s interests evolve

These families recognize that education doesn’t have to be all-or-nothing.

## **THE TWO-QUESTION RESET**

When families come to me feeling stuck, I ask them two simple questions:

1. "What's not working right now?" (Be specific. "Morning battles" is more useful than "everything.")
2. "If you could change just one thing without consequences, what would it be?" (Don't worry about how yet. Just dream a little.)

Start there. Then let's talk about what's possible.
