## Summary
Learn what’s driving the shift to open education: eclectic homeschooling ideas, the rise of parent “customizers,” and a LEGO-backed study revealing kids want more hands-on, self-directed, creative learning.

## Content

We've all been there - someone sends you a long article/email/podcast, and you think, “*who has time for this??*”

Enter **tl;dr Tuesday**. Tl;dr used to stand for "**Too Long; Didn't Read**" but for us, it means "**today's learning, directly relevant**." We’ll break down long, complex educational topics into quick, skimmable summaries – so you can absorb the latest trends and research (without needing to read/listen on 3x speed).

In this edition:

- Pam Barnhill's podcast reminds us that there's no one 'right way' to educate.
- When switching schools isn’t enough.
- Kids are craving creativity and hands-on learning. Are we listening? (**Plus, how OpenEd is already making it happen.**)

Let’s dive in.

### 🎨** The ‘Eclectic’ approach (aka Open Education)**

Montessori... Waldorf... Acton… Deschooling, Unschooling, Worldschooling... and don't forget Classical Education!

The variety of alternative schooling methods can be intriguing – but also overwhelming. [**Pam Barnhill’s latest episode of the Homeschool Better Together podcast**](https://pambarnhill.com/homeschool-methods-thoughts/?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=homeschool-methods-thoughts) reminds us that there's no one 'right way' to educate.

Barnhill introduces a catch-all term: **Eclectic**. This approach combines elements from various methods to create a personalized curriculum for each child. Sound familiar? We call this "open education" – tailoring learning to fit the child (instead of the other way around).

**Key Takeaways:**

- Embrace diversity in educational approaches
- Mix and match methods to suit your child's needs
- Remember: What works for one child may not work for another

***Coming soon: ****We'll be doing deeper dives into these different approaches in future editions. Reply to this email if there’s a specific schooling approach you’re curious about.*

### 🚸** When one-size-*doesn't-*fit-all**

The recent [**2024 *Choose to Learn* report**](https://tytonpartners.com/choose-to-learn-2024-press-release/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday) sheds light on how parents are reimagining education nationally. It breaks down "Open-minded" parents (a whopping 48% of all K-12 parents!) into three categories:

1. **School Supplementers (64%)**: Enhancing their child's current school experience with additional programs and resources.
2. **School Switchers (10%)**: Moving from public to private or charter schools, hoping for greener educational pastures. (Sometimes, they find it's just a different shade of the same challenges.)
3. **Customizers (26%)**: The educational innovators, mixing and matching 'a la carte' options to create a personalized learning experience.

While we support expanded choice in all directions, we're particularly excited about the growth of "customizers." Want to blend online courses with hands-on apprenticeships? Go for it. Fancy a mix of homeschooling and part-time classroom experiences? That's on the menu too.

### 🇩🇰** What kids really want from education**

Ever wonder what would happen if we actually asked kids what they want from their education? [**A Danish media company teamed up with the LEGO Foundation and surveyed over 1,000 young people in Denmark**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/loniatimagineif_pbl-projectbasedlearning-activity-7196757683188707329-5NHr?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday). Here's what they found:

#### **What Kids Want MORE of:**

- 55% want to choose their own topics for assignments
- 62% crave creative use of technology (video making, coding, etc.)
- 56% desire learning outside the classroom
- 51% want more hands-on, creative activities

#### **What Kids Want LESS of:**

- Passive lectures with teachers talking at the front
- Individual work
- Standard online learning programs

We're glad to see research backing up what we've already known: kids learn best when they're engaged, challenged, and having fun.

*Check out our kit-based programs, like the ***Code, Craft, and Create with Minecraft and LEGO Robotics.*** These programs are available through Dreamlink at a discount for those enrolled in the OpenEd program in Oregon or Utah, or can be purchased *à la carte*. See how we're enabling project-based learning for all grade levels.*

That's all for this edition of tl;dr Tuesday!

Until next time,
