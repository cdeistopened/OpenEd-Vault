## Summary
Why the best homeschool parents are firing the micromanager. PLUS: A simple exercise to uncover your child's true passions.

## Content

Greetings!

We've all seen it, felt the pressure, and asked ourselves the same nagging question: *Am I doing enough for my child?*

It can be tempting to add more activities, lesson plans, and overall structure.

But in the recent [open education breakthrough event](https://opened.co/blog/how-to-homeschool-the-open-education-way), Matt & Isaac talk about how the obsession with structure can go wrong. They’re also joined by school teacher-turned-homeschool mom Janae Daniels, who shares what she learned from her disastrous first day of homeschooling.

[You can watch the whole recording, or read the article version](https://opened.co/blog/how-to-homeschool-the-open-education-way).

Let's dive in.

**THOUGHT:** CEO or Gardener**
TREND: **The Un-Scheduling Arc**
TOOL: **The Sticky Note Method

# CEO or Gardener?

The homeschool CEO tries to manage every variable. They optimize, dictate, and control. The gardener does something different. They know you can't force a seed to grow. You just cultivate the right conditions and trust the process.

As Isaac put it, "Your kids are going to be okay. You can relax a little bit."

The foundation of a great education isn't a perfect schedule; it's a loving, engaged environment. Everything else is just fine-tuning. Don’t compare yourself to some other family you see on Instagram.

Fire the CEO. Become the gardener.

# The Un-Scheduling Arc

How can you kill the schedule without creating chaos? The key is to replace rigidity with an* adaptable* framework that changes as your kids go through different phases.

Isaac laid out a simple roadmap for the appropriate amount of structure based on his own experience.

**Early Years (0-10):** Minimal structure, leaning into unschooling and play.

**Middle Years (10-14):** A bit more parent-led structure to guide them through the pre-teen funk.

**Teen Years (14+):** They build their own structure, driven by jobs, sports, or projects.

Of course, even this framework isn’t to be taken too rigidly. Janae notes that her 9-year-old daughter with a sensory processing disorder thrives with more structure, while her other kids benefit from ample unstructured time to get bored.

Even the appropriate level of structure resists one-size-fits-all structure.

Think of structure like a trellis – it's there to support growth, not confine it. Different plants need different amounts of support, and the same is true for kids.

# The Sticky Note Method

Once the trellis is in place, you need to know what the kid actually wants to climb toward. Matt shared a simple tool for this: **The Sticky Note Method**. For one week, have your kids jot down answers to a few questions:

- *What do you think about in your free time?*
- *What are you good at?*
- *What do you want to get better at?*
- *What do you dislike?*

This makes their inner world visible. Then, the magic happens when you connect their interest to a real-world need. For example, a kid who loves baking (interest) can start a cookie business for neighbors (need).
