## **WHEN "OBSTACLES" BECOME SUPERPOWERS**

"I think in hindsight, if I wasn't dyslexic and I didn't have a hard time in school, I don't think I would have been successful."

What we often label as "learning disabilities" might actually be learning differences that create unique advantages.

## **THE FORMULA THAT'S RESHAPING EDUCATION (NOT FOR THE BETTER)**

[**Alpha Schools Founder MacKenzie Price**](https://x.com/mackenzieprice/status/1894454448875082188?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-4-minute-video-that-teaches-quadratic-equations-better-than-most-schools) highlights how a single mathematical equation—the Value-Added Model (VAM)—has been silently transforming American education for decades.

In the 1970s, a math equation was created to determine a kid's success.

And it's still used today...

Here's how ONE flawed formula has ruined the future of millions:

Developed in the 1970s and later embedded in education policy through programs like No Child Left Behind (2001) and Race to the Top (2009), the VAM attempts to measure teacher effectiveness through student test scores. The model uses complex statistical analysis to predict how students "should" perform, then evaluates teachers based on whether their students exceed or fall short of these predictions.

But here's where it gets problematic: the formula assumes all children learn the same way and at the same pace. It fails to account for unique learning styles, individual circumstances, and personal growth patterns.

The consequences? As Price notes, "Real learning? Replaced by test preparation. Critical thinking? Sacrificed for memorization. Life skills? Left behind entirely."

## **COMPLETING THE SQUARE**

Speaking of frightening formulas, if the words "quadratic equation" trigger flashbacks of high school math trauma, I’ve got good news! There's a reason one particular math tutorial has amassed over 4.4 million views since 2008.

Patrick J's lo-fi [**"Completing the Square" video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGOQYTo9AKY&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-4-minute-video-that-teaches-quadratic-equations-better-than-most-schools) has garnered over 1,000 comments, including:

- "This 4-minute video made A LOT more sense than my professor tried teaching us in an hour."
- "I was 6 when you made this video, and now I'm watching it today at 16."
- "I wasn't even born when you posted this, and now I'm watching it at 14 for my exams."

What makes this 16-year-old video so timeless? It’s certainly not the production values… In just four minutes, Patrick breaks down the "complete the square" method into simple, repeatable steps that actually make sense—something that often gets lost in traditional classrooms.
