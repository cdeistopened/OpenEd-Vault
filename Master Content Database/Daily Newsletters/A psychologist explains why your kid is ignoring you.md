# DEEP DIVE:[ ](https://opened.co/blog/best-homeschool-math-curriculum)[Best Homeschool Science Curriculum](https://opened.co/blog/best-homeschool-science-curriculum)

Science is the study of how the world works—it should be the most exciting subject of all. So why do so many students find it boring?

Adam Savage, the former MythBusters host, [diagnosed the disconnect](https://www.tiktok.com/@openedhq/video/7493709540093971754) in our most viral social media videos of all time:

*"When we teach kids that science and math and engineering are all things to memorize, we're missing the point. These are unfettered landscapes of the untried and the untested."*

In an analogy that Ed the Horse would love, Savage reminds us that we call math and science "fields of knowledge" because they're open-ended—ripe for curious minds to explore.

At [OpenEd](https://opened.co), we've watched thousands of families rebuild their relationship with science. [This week's deep dive](https://opened.co/blog/best-homeschool-science-curriculum) gathers the most-loved recommendations from our teachers and families—tested, hands-on programs organized by type and grade level, honest trade-offs, and high-quality free resources.

Stop trying to replicate the traditional science classroom when you can do something *better*.

# PODCAST HIGHLIGHT: Why Your ADHD Kid "Won't Listen"

Psychologist and education specialist Dr. Amy Moore [joined Ela Richmond on the OpenEd podcast](https://opened.co/blog/why-your-adhd-kid-wont-listen-its-not-what-you-think) to unpack something that frustrates countless families: a child who seems to ignore you the moment you raise your voice. Turns out that's not a coincidence. It's not always defiance, either. Sometimes it's just neurology.

Dr. Moore explains that when we yell, our kids' brains literally can't hear us the way we think they can. There's something called "auditory exclusion" that kicks in during fight-or-flight.

What can you do instead? Lower your voice. Soften your posture. Remove the noise. Then invite problem-solving: "I notice this seems really hard for you. I wonder what we could do to make it easier."

# Trends We're Following

**Every Hour Costs Them - **A new study tracking 5,400 kids from early childhood through grade six found that **every additional hour of daily screen time was associated with a 9-10% lower likelihood of achieving higher test scores in reading and math**. Of course, not all screen time is created equal. Doomscrolling isn't the same as focused work in an adaptive learning app or creating worlds in Minecraft. But the data is clear: [quantity matters, and quality matters more](https://www.newsweek.com/children-kids-parents-screens-hampering-learning-10869823).

**Curiosity Doesn't Die from Lack of Enrichment - **[**Austin Scholar**](https://austinscholar.substack.com/p/austin-scholar-190-why-school-kills) breaks down the real culprit behind dead-eyed teenagers lacking curiosity: it's parents who light up about report cards but yawn through explanations of how ant colonies work. [Research shows curiosity drops dramatically around third grade](https://sk.sagepub.com/book/mono/beautiful-questions-in-the-classroom/chpt/what-discourages-student-questioning#_) (right when standardized testing kicks in). The *steepest* drops happen in households where parents frequently ask about grades and rarely ask about interests.

**Homeschooling Growth by State Since 2017 - **[@rebeleducator shares a visualization tracking homeschool growth state by state](https://www.facebook.com/openedhq/posts/pfbid026aVMZPrp6NeWNNGuumcj8z4K62SWHRp5ijJWAZERMckaFwpAKhu5GQnWr6nE3a8Cl?__cft__[0]=AZWsswoUt8_BJPqQovl65rfoTyggMCqwbaC4RzN_54evht-O5VRaquSwtwZkaozaqr52xAXSzFcOuJY6TK2qiEjRRrroUi6qCsTA0rZsyL7o7RnTog5gJPbMxThvqvHEM-gQM-OVXX8AkIVXnmX1FqHU&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R) since 2017-2018. Judging by the color scheme, the chartmaker seems alarmed. Is your state in the "danger zone"?

**Teach Your Child, Not a Grade Level - **From [Simply Charlotte Mason](https://simplycharlottemason.com/blog/teach-your-child-not-a-grade-level/): *"It's very common for a child to be ready for, say, third-grade math skills while at the same time be working on second-grade or even first-grade reading skills. That's fine!"* Grade levels persist not because they're good for kids but because they're efficient for institutions. Charlotte Mason understood this over a century ago: Kids don't develop like cogs on an assembly line.
