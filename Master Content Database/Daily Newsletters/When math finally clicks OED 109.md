## **Fast Math**

This video showing an *allegedly* superior multiplication method used by students in China has been making the rounds:

Fast numeracy

We dug into the method. It works. But before jumping to the conclusion that we should change the way we teach multiplication, we should note that this clever hack ***only works for a very specific kind of problem*** – 90-something x 90-something. The irony is that China’s education system actually embraces a foundations-first “Mastery Method,” where students only move on to the next concept after mastering each skill.

**True:** American math comprehension just hit a 30-year low.

**False: **The solution lies in faster ways to long multiplication.

Should we question the way things have always been done? Yes! But let’s not throw the baby (long multiplication) out with the bath water (one-size-fits-all learning).

## **Math Academy**

While the traditional classroom tries to teach everyone math at the same pace, [**Math Academy**](http://mathacademy.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=when-math-finally-clicks-oed-109) takes a different approach: You move forward when you're ready. Not before. Not after.

Many students advance multiple grade levels in a single year. One parent, watching their child go from struggling with basic algebra to mastering calculus in under a year, put it this way: "It sounds hyperbolic, but it's not—I saw it happen with my own eyes."

According to the company, this is what happens when you solve three core problems:

**Problem #1: Moving too fast (or too slow)** Most students are either bored or lost in math class. Math Academy's AI adapts to each student's exact level - not their grade level or age.

**Problem #2: The forgetting curve** Remember learning something in math class only to forget it by next semester? Spaced repetition system ensures concepts stick.

**Problem #3: Shaky foundations** You wouldn't try to build a house on sand. But that's what happens when we push kids forward before they've mastered the basics.

If you’re looking for a change, you can try it out for** **$49/month, with a 30-day guarantee.

### **(PUN) OF THE DAY**

Today I told the "why is six afraid of seven" joke to a class of first graders who had either never heard it, or just suddenly understood it. Three kids literally fell out of their chairs and rolled on the floor. Apex moment, never topping it.

No wonder kids want to skip 7th-grade math...

That’s all for today!
