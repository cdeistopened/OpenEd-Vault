## **Main Street Millionaires**

While most career counselors are still pushing the "college or bust" narrative, Codie Sanchez is building [**a media empire**](https://contrarianthinking.co/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=skip-stanford-buy-a-business-the-new-success-formula-118) around a contrarian idea:

**For most people, "boring" businesses like plumbing, electrical work, and local services are a faster and safer path to wealth than fancy degrees or Silicon Valley startups.**

She’s on “a mission to help 1 million people become financially and philosophically free.”

In her new book [***Main Street Millionaire***](https://www.amazon.com/Main-Street-Millionaire-Extraordinary-Businesses/dp/0593718615?utm_campaign=Contrarian%20Thinking%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=340848624&utm_content=340848624&utm_source=hs_email), Sanchez demolishes the myth that you need a revolutionary app idea or a prestigious MBA to build wealth. Instead, she advocates for buying existing, profitable businesses – the ones providing actual services people need – and then growing them.
