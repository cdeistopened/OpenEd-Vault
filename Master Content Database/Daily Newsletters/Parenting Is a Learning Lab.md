# Parenting is a learning lab

Parenting has never felt like a manual to me—it’s a learning lab. With five kids (and now an army of grandsons), my wife and I learned the hard way that you can’t standardize an unstandardized population. We kept the chores and job charts consistent, sure, but when our two basketball-loving sons asked for different schools, I let them choose—even as the district tried to guilt me into keeping them together so the town could chase a championship. The result? Two confident young men who know their education wasn’t copied from my playbook; it was co-designed with them. We’re all learning out loud; the experts are the kids in front of us.

# Learning Labs Are Everywhere

Spaces like the [Wichita Learning Lab](https://www.golearninglab.org/) – a parent-built hub tucked inside a renovated warehouse – are changing the default. It operates like a mash-up of co-op, makerspace, and community center: weekday workshops in one room, self-directed learners prototyping in another, and parents co-working along the perimeter. Families map interests, swap mentors, and schedule field trips as a collective. We hope (nay, expect!) to see 1,000 similar learning labs blossom in the years ahead, as parents demand and then build alternatives to one-size-fits-all. Until then, keep learning and exploring with whatever you have, wherever you are.

# The Learning Landscape Worksheet

As Matt advised in his talk, the first step toward map your child's interests is to give them unstructured time – so you can observe what they actually do when nothing is assigned. Then, layer in the non-negotiables—family budgets, chores, caregiving, screen rules—and note them alongside the interests. Finally, take inventory of the resources at your disposal – from free-to-fee.

What’s in your home? Who lives in your neighborhood? What community hubs (like the [Learning Lab](https://www.golearninglab.org/)) are available?

Our Open Education toolkit guides you through that conversation. [Download the template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FlbK2z4wbfvJhc0ibj9kWOwnR24DR7Dc/view?usp=sharing), run a two-week learner-led sprint, and celebrate the share-out over pizza.

# Question of the Week

“Where did your child learn the most in the last two weeks—and what made that moment possible?”
