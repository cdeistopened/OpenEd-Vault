## THE WORLD DOESN'T PAY FOR ‘WELL-ROUNDED’

In his book [***Find the Work You're Wired to Do***](https://ter.li/krbn8l?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stop-raising-well-rounded-kids), bestselling author, [**radio personality**](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/shows/front-row-seat-with-ken-coleman?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stop-raising-well-rounded-kids) and all-around legend Ken Coleman delivers a message that might make you uncomfortable: **Stop trying to fix your kid's weaknesses.**

"I'm so sick of hearing 'I want a well-rounded kid,'" [**Coleman told Isaac**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feG5uOlSgGs&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stop-raising-well-rounded-kids).

"Nobody walks in to Lowe's or Home Depot and goes, 'I want a well-rounded sander.' **Anything that does really good work has an edge to it.**"

**Consider this: **If your kid is naturally a 3 in math and busts their tail, they might become a 5 – average.

"The world doesn't pay for 5s," Coleman insists. "The world pays for 9s and 10s."

Instead of endless tutoring to bring that C up to a B, Coleman suggests you help them discover their 7s and 8s—and sharpen those into 10s.

### 📊 2 TRENDS

**1. THE ANXIOUS GENERATION: HOW WE BROKE OUR KIDS**

Ken Coleman notes an generational shift in parenting strategies:

"Boomers said 'you skinned your knee? Walk it off.' There were no bike helmets."

Gen X became the anxious parents, raising “the anxious generation."

[**Jonathan Haidt's research**](https://www.anxiousgeneration.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stop-raising-well-rounded-kids) in his book of the same name backs this up—youth anxiety has increased 200% since 2012 (the year Apple introduced the front-facing “selfie” camera). Haidt’s four solutions:

1. No smartphones before 14.
2. No social media before 16.
3. Phone-free schools.
4. More unsupervised play.

**2. 81% OF EMPLOYERS PRIORITIZE SKILLS OVER DEGREES**

[**LinkedIn's latest data**](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/linkedin-most-in-demand-hard-and-soft-skills?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stop-raising-well-rounded-kids) reveals what employers *really* care about: "Adaptability is the #1 soft skill employers want—for two years running."

Google, Apple, IBM no longer require degrees. Why? Skills-based hires stay 34% longer than degree-based hires. People with high emotional intelligence earn $29,000 more annually.

What’s not high on the list? Degrees.

"They don't care where you went to school,” Coleman emphasizes, “Nobody cares."

### 🔨 3 TOOLS

**1. KEN COLEMAN'S "FIND YOUR WIRED WORK" BOOK + ASSESSMENT**

Perfect for teens asking "what should I do with my life?" Or more pressingly, “how can I get paid to do something I love ***and*** am good at?“
