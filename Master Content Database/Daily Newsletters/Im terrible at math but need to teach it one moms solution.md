## **YES, YOU CAN TEACH YOUR KIDS**

"An alarming number of parents appear to have little confidence in their ability to "teach" their children.

Such caring is usually the greatest teaching, especially if caring means sharing in the activities of the home.”

Raymond S. Moore

Your children don't need a perfect teacher. They need a present parent who includes them in their daily activities.
