If you have a child enrolled in the program, you’ll still get program-related emails regardless.

Good morning!

I'm Isaac Morehouse, the new CEO of OpenEd (yes, I'm still getting used to not saying My Tech High!). I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself and address some of the questions that have come up from the families who have been a part of the program for a number of years.

A bit about me: I grew up homeschooled in the 80s and 90s when it was barely legal. I've been married for 20 years, and we have four kids who've experienced just about every educational model you can imagine – homeschool, public school, private school, co-ops, online courses, you name it.

I've known Matt and Amy Bowman for a decade, and taking this role at OpenEd is a huge honor. I'm excited to build on the amazing foundation all of you have created.

## **A few of your program questions answered**

The OpenEd Daily is not primarily about our program, but a broader newsletter on all-things-open-education. But I've seen quite a few program-related questions pop up since our rebrand, and I want to take a moment to address them. My goal is to ensure that you feel informed, reassured, and excited about the future of OpenEd!

1. **Is the program changing?** No! The core program remains unchanged. We've just updated some language here and there, and actually added more flexibility.
2. **Where are Matt and Amy?** They're not going anywhere! In fact, part of the reason I'm taking on day-to-day operations is so they can focus more on writing, speaking, and advocating for education options. (Rumor has it they might be working on a book...)
3. **Why the rebrand?** OpenEd reflects our mission to open up educational possibilities for every learner. We're hoping to grow into new states and offer unique opportunities over time, but our core program remains unchanged. This newsletter is part of that mission and has a broader focus than just program related stuff.

I'll be recording a Q&A episode for our podcast soon. If you have any questions for me, send them to [**imorehouse@opened.co**](mailto:imorehouse@opened.co). I'll try to answer as many as I can!

Thank you for being part of this amazing community. I look forward to learning and growing with you all.

Best,
Isaac

As with curriculums, our goals isn't to dictate your choices, but to open up a world of possibilities for you to explore.
