## **You don’t need to find the “right” curriculum**

A radical idea from [our latest podcast guest](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-014-stop-outsourcing-your-childs-education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=060-you-don-t-need-to-find-the-right-curriculum&_bhlid=fae36355a597a6c514642dfdeeae85067606f9b9):

You don’t need to “find the right curriculum”.

You need to ask yourself what the life is you want to build, and what the best version of each family member looks like.

Then, you find the people and pursuits to surround yourself with so you can stay consistent in your build.

## **Helicopter Parents: Now with Extended Range**

Move over, drones. The latest in surveillance technology isn't coming from Silicon Valley—it's coming from Mom and Dad's smartphones. [A front-page Wall Street Journal article reports](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/helicopter-parents-college-freshman-ac32970f?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=060-you-don-t-need-to-find-the-right-curriculum&_bhlid=5750fe604ca80af8c5aa5fae79db9853172d59f5) that helicopter parenting has officially entered the college years:

- 44% of parents now interact daily with their college kids.
- One parent support group on Facebook has 24,000 members.
- Ohio State now sends parents helpful tips on how to remind their adult children about class registration deadlines (Because nothing prepares you for the real world like having your parents manage your schedule from three states away.)

Education experts suggest a radical new approach called "letting go." Its side effects may include increased independence and problem-solving skills.

Remember: Thomas Edison's mom never once texted him about changing a light bulb and he turned out fine.

## **Making Books Come Alive**

[In our latest podcast episode](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-014-stop-outsourcing-your-childs-education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=060-you-don-t-need-to-find-the-right-curriculum&_bhlid=1de2eaf0779f79ed4525d3bf82bf6aaa801074fe), Matt Beaudreau – founder of the [Apogee Strong schools network](https://apogeestrong.com/apogee-schools?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=060-you-don-t-need-to-find-the-right-curriculum&_bhlid=20dac13a5ecdbc359186e013454a723d01793c01) – shared some brilliant insights on fostering a love for reading in children. Here's how to transform reading from a chore into an adventure:

1. **Model the behavior:** Let your kids see you enjoying books.
2. **Freedom of choice:** Let your kids pick books that interest them.
3. **Curate classics:** Introduce timeless stories with conversational potential.
4. **Engage in dialogue:** Ask thought-provoking questions about their reading:
- "What would you do if you were the main character?"
- "How would you have handled that situation differently?"
5. **Create scenarios:** Present enticing or challenging situations based on their reading and ask them to defend their choices.
6. **Make it a family affair:** Discuss books together, turning reading into a shared experience.

He emphasizes that most kids naturally love stories - our job is to maintain that "factory setting" of curiosity and excitement.

**Bonus tip:** Try audiobooks for long car rides or while doing chores. It's a great way to sneak in extra "reading" time!
