## **FIRST WATCH, THEN CREATE**

For all our apps and algorithms, the most powerful learning method remains unchanged:

Watch.
Practice.
Create.

It's how Renaissance artists learned from masters. How composers learned from Bach. How entrepreneurs learn from mentors. The tools change. The process stays the same.

## **CLASSICAL EDUCATION’S QUIET REVOLUTION**

[**Classical schools have doubled in number over the past decade, now reaching nearly 1,000 nationwide**](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/opinion-classical-education-is-taking-off-whats-the-appeal/2024/05?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=a-fresh-look-at-classical-education-133). While private schools still make up about 75% of classical schools, it's public charter versions that are leading the expansion, often serving 2-3 times more students than their private counterparts.

## **GREAT HEARTS ONLINE**

Classical education has traditionally required rigid schedules and in-person attendance. [**Great Hearts Online**](https://greatheartsonline.org/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=a-fresh-look-at-classical-education-133) (available through OpenEd) removes those constraints. Their full classical curriculum offers asynchronous, self-paced courses for families wanting maximum independence from standardized testing.

The model combines traditional liberal arts with advanced math and science, delivered through instructional videos and independent assignments.

That’s all for today!
