Turns out, we instinctively arrange adjectives in a specific order: *opinion, size, age, shape, color, origin, material, purpose*. Yet we rarely notice these linguistic rules until they're broken.

## **AI TUTORS: PROMISE OR PREMISE?**

Back in 2023, [**tech investor and Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen made a bold prediction**](https://a16z.com/ai-will-save-the-world/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ai-tutors-are-advancing-quickly-should-you-try-one) about AI in education:

***"Every child will have an AI tutor that is infinitely patient, infinitely compassionate, infinitely knowledgeable, infinitely helpful."***

Some would say this vision is already taking shape. [**One parent on X**](https://x.com/jeremykauffman/status/1894066643883470887?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ai-tutors-are-advancing-quickly-should-you-try-one) recently shared that Synthesis Tutor was blowing Khan Academy out of the water for his 5-year-old's math learning:

For home school math, we've done Khan Academy, a variety of workbooks, and tutoring from dad.

Synthesis Tutor is blowing them out of the water. We're on vacation in Florida and 5yo asked if he could do math.

Could technology actually respond to your child's unique learning style in ways a standardized curriculum (or even a human being) can't? Might AI handle the repetitive practice while humans focus on inspiration, wisdom, and character development?
