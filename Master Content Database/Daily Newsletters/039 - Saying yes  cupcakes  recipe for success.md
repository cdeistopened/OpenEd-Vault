## Summary
The surprisingly delicious connection between baking and STEM education

‍**💡 THOUGHT**
## The power of saying 'Yes' (plus cupcakes) 🧁

Your willingness to say 'yes' in life creates your reality. Just ask Daniella Park, who left high school – severely dyslexic – with just a business plan.

"I begged my parents and teachers to just give me a chance," she recalls.

In this podcast clip, Daniella tells the story of how she landed Malaysian Airlines as her first client. She'd bake ornate cupcakes, put them in clear boxes, and walk around Sydney, Australia's business district (pretending to be on a delivery). Curious onlookers would ask for her card. She'd say she ran out, but give them a cookie instead and ask for their email.***‍***

*** Dyslexic Dropout turned Top Chef ***

Daniella now runs her own company and is the head baker and spokesperson for an *a la carte *education company called [Baketivity](https://baketivity.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=039-saying-yes-cupcakes-recipe-for-success&_bhlid=eeaa55ff468fb7fb338d627101421f376c3caae5) (see more below).

Daniella’s advice to young entrepreneurs:

**"Say yes to everything. Most times it works. Sometimes it kills you. But it always gives you lessons."**

📊 TREND
## Hands-on STEM

[STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education](https://www.snhu.edu/about-us/newsroom/stem/what-does-stem-mean-for-you?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=039-saying-yes-cupcakes-recipe-for-success&_bhlid=57c20e9028a04394516c4adec72c3c4b310e9ac2) has been perhaps the biggest trend in learning in the past 20 years. Google N-grams shows mentions starting to climb around 2001 and then exploding around 2010.

Mentions of the term “STEM” (all-caps) since 1900.

The push for STEM education comes partly from the recognition that many of the best-paying jobs and opportunities lie in these fields. However, there's also a growing awareness that STEM focus should be balanced with creative thinking, leading to the inclusion of “Arts” in many so-called “STE**A**M” programs. There's also been a shift towards hands-on, experiential learning in STEM to make abstract concepts more concrete and to engage all five senses to make lessons stick. Which brings us too this week’s tool…
