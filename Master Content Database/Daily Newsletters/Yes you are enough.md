💡 THOUGHT
*"Am I enough?"*

This question haunts every parent at some point—especially those who decide to take more ownership over their child's education. For [**Laura Feller**](https://opened.co/blog/overcoming-self-doubt-why-you-are-enough-to-homeschool-your-child-laura-feller/?utm_medium=email&_hsmi=2&utm_content=2&utm_source=hs_email), whose son struggled with learning disabilities and whose youngest didn't speak until age three, that doubt felt overwhelming.

Her answer to this question should be framed on every homeschooling parent's wall: "Yes, I am enough to help him."

Why? Because we don't have to do it alone.

The myth of the superhero homeschool parent—the one who masters every subject, never loses patience, and always knows exactly what their child needs—has discouraged too many families from taking control of their children's education.

The truth is both simpler and more powerful: You don't need to be an expert in everything. You just need to be an expert in connecting your child with the right resources and community.

## **MAGIC WORDS THAT STOP HELICOPTER PARENTING**

"*"It's a learning opportunity.”*

According to [**a new Yale study**](https://letgrow.org/yale-helicopter-parenting/?utm_medium=email&_hsmi=2&utm_content=2&utm_source=hs_email) these four simple words might be the cure for helicopter parenting. Researchers asked kids to put on hockey gear while giving parents different instructions:

- Half were told this was a chance for their child to learn a life skill
- Half were simply told it was a way to engage with the museum

Parents who saw it as a "learning opportunity" intervened 50% less often (4.4 times vs. 8.6 times for the control group).

Same task, different framing, dramatically different parental behavior.

## **15-MINUTE NATURE STUDY HACK**

[**Beautiful Feet Books' "Seasons Afield"**](https://www.bfbooks.com/Seasons-Afield-Pack?tap_a=30494-e48ebf&tap_s=3752140-8c17f0&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=2&utm_content=2&utm_source=hs_email) nature study curriculum has earned numerous accolades, including 1st place in the 2024 Practical Homeschooling Magazine Reader Awards. This K-4 program combines "school, nature, and home" through a year-long exploration of seasons with 72 science lessons covering biology, chemistry, botany, and more.

But what if you don't have time for the full curriculum? [**Cassie Shepherd from Home-Centered Learning blog**](https://www.homecenteredlearning.com/blog/bfb-nature-study-review?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=yes-you-are-enough) offers this streamlined approach:

**The Essentials:**

- **Nature backpacks**: One per child with basic supplies (magnifying glass, small sketchbook, colored pencils)
- **Field note system**: Use simple index cards for observations and tape them into a nature journal later
- **Digital assistant**: Download the [**free "Seek" app**](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/seek_app?utm_medium=email&_hsmi=2&utm_content=2&utm_source=hs_email) to identify plants and creatures on your walks

"This study really was the perfect balance of some indoor school work, some hands-on projects, and outdoor fieldwork," notes Cassie. Her practical experience revealed that binding field notes together from the start simplifies the entire process.

**Pro tip: **If traditional nature journaling feels overwhelming, try a simple "weather watch" to start - just record temperature, cloud conditions, and one nature observation during your outdoor time.

That’s all for today! See you tomorrow.
