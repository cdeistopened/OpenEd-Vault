Michael B. Horn on the "unbundling" of standardized schooling

## Content

#### **"One-size-fits-all was never the right way to educate kids or serve families."**

That's [**Michael B. Horn**](https://michaelbhorn.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=substack_profile), co-founder of the Clayton Christensen Institute and author of [***From Reopen to Reinvent***](https://michaelbhorn.com/portfolio/reopenvideos/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-end-of-one-size-fits-all), on the latest episode of the OpenEd podcast.

It's 2024. You can customize everything from your coffee order to your car's playlist. So why are kids still stuck in a one-size-fits-all classroom?

Imagine Amazon only sold one product, or Netflix had just one show. It sounds ridiculous, but that's how we've been doing education for a century.

Horn argues that while big changes are happening, the transition won’t take place overnight. You’ll have to tune in to find out why.

**In this episode, we cover:**

- Why the current education system is so resistant to change (it's more complex than you think)
- How Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) are driving an "unbundling" of education (and OpenEd is accelerating it)
- The importance of building sustainable, innovative models outside the existing system

**The future of education is already here; it’s just unevenly distributed.**

Education Savings Accounts are opening doors, while other models (like OpenEd) are helping families realize that they *can* craft a unique learning journey for each child.
