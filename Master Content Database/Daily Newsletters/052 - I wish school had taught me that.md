💡 THOUGHT
## **The Hidden Curriculum**

[**The 50-State Campaign for Achievement Now (50CAN) has released its annual report, "The State of Educational Opportunity in America."**](https://50can.org/education-opportunity-survey/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=052-i-wish-school-had-taught-me-that) This survey of 20,000 parents across all 50 states offers way more insight than we can cram into a single newsletter. Still, we wanted to share one particular finding: **students who excel academically are far more likely to participate in extracurricular activities**.

Which way does the causation run? Do high achievers get more opportunities? Or do those who participate in extracurriculars find themselves more engaged with their studies?

Either way, it's time we stopped thinking of art, sports, and community service as "extras."

In the real world, there are no extracurriculars. There's just life.

## **The Gap Between School and Life**

"I wish school had taught me that."

How many times have you heard (or felt) this? [**The 50CAN report**](https://50can.org/education-opportunity-survey/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=052-i-wish-school-had-taught-me-that) also discusses the widening gap between what schools teach and what life demands:

- 59% of families want more college prep programs.
- 66% desire career readiness courses.
- Only 32% feel confident their kids are prepared for the workforce. (We’d like to know what the other 68% are doing differently!)

From tutoring to summer programs, families are seeking more than schools currently offer.

(WORD) OF THE DAY
## Pareidolia (pair-i-DOH-lee-uh)

From the Greek para- ("beside" or "beyond") and eidōlon ("image" or "form"), pareidolia is the tendency to perceive a specific, often meaningful image in a random or ambiguous visual pattern.

Okay… but that’s clearly a horse, right? (Ed, is that you?)

That’s all for today!
