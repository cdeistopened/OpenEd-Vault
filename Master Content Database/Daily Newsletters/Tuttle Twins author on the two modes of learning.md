### 💡 THOUGHT

Your refrigerator breaks. What do you do?

"The traditional school system works on the 'just in case' model," he explains. "Just in case you become a rocket scientist, memorize the quadratic equation now."

But is that how humans usually learn?

Again, when your fridge breaks: what do you do?

*“You pull up YouTube. You call Uncle Bob. You figure it out."*

The real world rewards those who can find and apply information when they need it.

**What it is:** [**The wildly popular educational series**](https://tuttletwins.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tuttle-twins-author-on-the-two-modes-of-learning) that's sold over 6 million copies and spawned [**an Angel Studios show**](https://www.angel.com/watch/tuttle-twins?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tuttle-twins-author-on-the-two-modes-of-learning) – teaching complex concepts through adventure, not lectures.

**How they work:** The Tuttle Twins don't preach about entrepreneurship – they *live* it. Through their adventures, kids absorb lessons that textbooks can't teach:

- **Problem-solving under pressure.** When the twins' lemonade stand faces competition or regulation, they adapt. Kids see resourcefulness in action.
- **The power of persistence.** Failed ventures aren't endings – they're data. Characters dust off and try again with better strategies.
