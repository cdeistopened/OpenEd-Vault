## **Screen Time Isn't the Enemy - Low-Quality Content Is**

This tweet from tech founder Peter Yang gets at the heart of what we often misunderstand about technology and learning. The issue isn't the screen - it's what's on it. Just as we carefully choose books for our children's reading level and interests, we should be equally discerning about digital content.

Technology itself is neutral - it's how we wield it that matters.

## **Sweden's Screen Time Wake-Up Call**

Last week we shared [**some research**](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/the-edtech-revolution-has-failed?r=5d1ba&utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true) that revealed the mixed effects of technology in the classroom. Overall, screens didn’t seem to help much. Now, [**the Swedish government is investing over 100 million euros to bring textbooks back to classrooms after seeing declining academic performance in their heavily digitized schools**](https://glassalmanac.com/government-study-confirms-screen-time-significantly-lowers-student-achievement/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=087-screen-time-quality-over-quantity-spacex-s-math-revolution).

As our study last week showed, tech integration works best when truly personalized to each child. This raises an interesting question: Why stick 25 kids in a one-size-fits-all classroom just so they can receive personalized education through an iPad?

The solution might be simpler than we think. Instead of full days of screen-based learning, imagine a space where students spend a focused two hours on self-paced digital academics, followed by group projects, hands-on activities, and real-world problem solving. What Sweden reminds us is that effective education isn't about choosing between old and new - it's about finding the right tool for each learner at each moment.
🛠️ TOOL
## **Synthesis: SpaceX-Grade Math Learning**

Speaking of the right tools at the right time - let's talk about [**Synthesis**](https://www.synthesis.com/teams?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=087-screen-time-quality-over-quantity-spacex-s-math-revolution), born from Elon Musk's experimental school at SpaceX. As Peter Yang noted, some screen time can be valuable when the content is right, and Synthesis exemplifies this principle.

Instead of just digitizing worksheets, Synthesis creates an engaging, personalized experience focused on deep understanding rather than rote memorization. The AI tutor turns abstract math concepts into hands-on play, adapting in real time to how your child thinks and learns.

Beyond the math tutor, Synthesis also offers "Teams" - where kids can join other young learners from around the world in collaborative problem-solving sessions led by expert coaches.

Parents report their kids going from "hating math" to begging for more Synthesis time (perhaps the ultimate measure of educational technology done right).

They're [**running a fall special for $35/month**](https://www.synthesis.com/teams?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=087-screen-time-quality-over-quantity-spacex-s-math-revolution), and you can try it free to see if it's a good fit for your family.
