## Summary
College at 16? Rethinking higher ed & forging new paths.

## Content

One of the most common worries we hear from parents is around college readiness.

- Am I doing enough to prepare my child?
- Will he/she be competitive with other applicants if they don’t have a traditional diploma?
- Is college even worth the price of admission these days?

**Let’s explore…**

In this edition:

- 📜 What’s a diploma worth without the skills to back it up?
- 🎓 How do homeschooler’s get into college?
- 🚀 Early College Programs: Earning Your Degree While Still in High School

Before getting into the advantages homeschoolers often have in college admissions (including the flexibility to take college courses early), let's take a step back and ask: Is college the best path for everyone?

Here's a sobering stat: **52% of college graduates are underemployed.**

Now, let's get real about what a degree actually does for you in the job market. Outside of fields where it's legally required? Not much. There are often better ways to showcase your skills to employers. (**Pro tip:** Send a video pitch demonstrating your abilities. Nine times out of ten, they won't even ask about your degree.)

So why the near-universal push for college? Often, it's parents feeling the heat pressure to signal to society they did a good job.

There are plenty of good reasons to go to college, but social pressure isn't one of them!

Make sure you know what your goals are and whether it's truly the best way to reach them.

### 🎓 College Admissions Myth-Busting: Homeschoolers Edition

If your child is determined to go to college, the question arises… [**how do homeschoolers get in?**](https://www.joinprisma.com/blog/how-do-homeschoolers-get-into-college?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=is-a-college-degree-still-worth-it) The Prisma blog debunks the myth that you need a traditional diploma to stand out in admissions. A few datapoints:

- Homeschoolers graduate college at a 10% higher rate than public school peers
- UNC Chapel Hill admits 47% of homeschoolers vs 17% overall admission rate
- Homeschoolers are also well-represented at Ivy League schools like Yale, Harvard, and MIT

Beyond test scores and an official-looking transcript, colleges are increasingly interested in "spiky" applicants. But what does that mean?

A "spiky" application showcases deep expertise or passion in a specific area, rather than being well-rounded but average across the board.

For example:

- A student who's published research on local water quality
- An aspiring filmmaker with a portfolio of short films and festival submissions
- A budding entrepreneur who's already launched a small business

So instead of forcing your 14 year old into weekend SAT prep classes, consider encouraging them to start a portfolio showcasing their projects and passions or seek out mentorship or internships in their field of interest

Use the flexibility of an open education to develop these distinctive "spikes" – they might just be their secret weapon.
