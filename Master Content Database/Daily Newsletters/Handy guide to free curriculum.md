💡 DEEP DIVE
## **FREE HOMESCHOOLING CURRICULA**

Our SEO (Search Engine Optimization) guy demanded we write an article about [**"the best free homeschool curriculum."**](https://opened.co/blog/free-homeschool-curriculum-the-opened-complete-guide-to-quality-resources-on-a-budget/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=handy-guide-to-free-curriculum) Who are we to refuse a guy with a fancy analytics dashboard?

He also told us that Google's algorithms now prioritize four factors in determining whether a result will show in search "EEAT" - Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. And after reviewing learning plans from more than 100,000 OpenEd students over the past decade, we've actually got the data to back this one up!

**Here's the surprising truth:**

*The most successful families often spend almost nothing on curriculum.*

While public schools drop an average of $16,000 per student annually, resourceful parents are building exceptional learning environments using free resources. Once families master the art of combining high-quality free materials, the correlation between educational spending and learning outcomes vanishes.

Furthermore, the pandemic sparked an educational innovation explosion. As millions of families got their first taste of learning at home, entrepreneurs, teachers, and parents began creating and sharing resources at an unprecedented scale.

Two powerful movements have accelerated this transformation:

1. The open source revolution (hello, Khan Academy)
2. The broader open *education* movement, which is breaking down walls between traditional and alternative approaches

As a result, the best resources aren't necessarily the most expensive or polished.

However, the key to success isn't just finding resources – it's *combining them effectively*. We’ve found that the most successful families follow some version of the following formula:

- Choose one primary resource per subject
- Add supplementary materials for different learning styles
- Incorporate hands-on projects and real-world applications
- Use community resources to enrich learning

You’ll have to [**read the full article**](https://opened.co/blog/free-homeschool-curriculum-the-opened-complete-guide-to-quality-resources-on-a-budget/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=handy-guide-to-free-curriculum) to see the actual list, but here’s a sample.

**For Math:** Khan Academy, CK-12's interactive "FlexBooks", FreeMath Program

**For Language Arts:** Project Gutenberg (60,000+ free eBooks), K12 Reader, Starfall

**For Science:** Discovery K12, Smithsonian Learning Lab, CK-12

**For History:** The Big History Project, PBS Learning Media

The journey to quality home education doesn't begin with an expensive curriculum package—it starts with a curious mind and resourcefulness.

The most valuable investment isn't money—it's your time and attention in creating the right learning environment.
🧠 MINDSET MATTERS
## **Yes, You ARE Enough**

*"Am I enough?"*

This question haunts every parent who takes ownership of their child's education. Laura Feller, whose son struggled with learning disabilities and whose youngest didn't speak until age three, found her answer: "Yes, I am enough to help him."

Why? Because you don't have to do it alone.

The myth of the superhero homeschool parent—mastering every subject, never losing patience—has discouraged too many families. The truth is simpler: You don't need to be an expert in everything. You just need to connect your child with the right resources and community.

As Raymond S. Moore wisely noted: "We should help parents understand the overriding importance of incidental teaching in the context of warm, consistent companionship. Such caring is usually the greatest teaching."

**Practical Insight:** Laura discovered she didn't need a classroom with "a chalkboard and the whole nine yards." Learning happened in the driveway with hopscotch math, in the car with audiobooks, at museums, parks—everywhere. "Learning became second nature in everything that we did."

[**Listen to Laura's full journey on this week's podcast**](https://opened.co/blog/overcoming-self-doubt-why-you-are-enough-to-homeschool-your-child-laura-feller/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=handy-guide-to-free-curriculum) and learn the simple observation technique that transformed her approach to home education.

[**The "Learning Opportunity" Effect →**](https://letgrow.org/yale-helicopter-parenting/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=handy-guide-to-free-curriculum) Yale researchers found that parents who viewed tasks as learning opportunities intervened 50% less often (4.4 vs 8.6 times).

[**The Great Happiness Flip →**](https://www.the74million.org/article/a-leading-economist-echoes-psychologists-warnings-against-screens/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=great-writers-think-first) Dartmouth economist finds the happiness curve has inverted - no longer high in youth, low in midlife, rising in age. Teens now report record low wellbeing as daily 4+ hour screen time exploded from 8% to 61% since smartphone adoption.

🤔 PARTING THOUGHT
## **GREAT WRITERS THINK FIRST**

As neuroscience professor-turned-homeschool-mom [**Dr. Claire Honeycutt reminds us: before your child can write well**](https://x.com/HippyMomPhD/status/1861421905388920841?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=handy-guide-to-free-curriculum), they need to think well.

David McCullough put it this way: "Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That's why it's so hard."

Maybe the key to raising exceptional writers isn't more grammar worksheets, but more thoughtful conversations around the dinner table.
