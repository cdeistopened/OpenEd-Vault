## Summary
Homeschool art curricula, what to do with a kid who won't practice their instrument, and the four most popular searches in the OpenEd marketplace.

## Content

**Greetings Eddies!**

Have you ever wondered why five-year-olds tend to draw people as circles with stick legs and houses as squares with a triangle roof?

A psychologist named Viktor Lowenfeld spent his career studying this. [He called this the "schematic stage": ](https://thevirtualinstructor.com/blog/the-stages-of-artistic-development)kids draw what they *know*, not what they see. A house is a square with a triangle roof. A person is a head with arms and legs coming out of it (roughly). Representing these things in this way is developmentally appropriate.

Trying to teach realistic rendering to a kindergartner is like teaching calculus before multiplication. You're working against biology. [More on this in our Deep Dive on homeschool art curriculum](https://opened.co/blog/homeschool-art-curriculum-opened)—including which programs actually work at each age, according to OpenEd's teachers and seasoned families.

Also this week: a music teacher explains why those "wasted" years of piano lessons might not be wasted at all, and a Japanese goal-setting method that created baseball's greatest player.

Now let's dive in.

# DEEP DIVE: [Homeschool Art Curriculum](https://opened.co/blog/homeschool-art-curriculum-opened)

When you're teaching art at home, you know that there's no answer key.

Math has right answers. Reading has fluency scores. Science has a method. But art? You're staring at a drawing of a horse that doesn't quite look like a horse yet and trying to figure out if that's creative expression or a cry for help.

This ambiguity can make art uniquely daunting. Push the wrong curriculum at the wrong time and you can watch creative confidence evaporate in real time. Ask any adult who decided at age 11 that they "weren't artistic"—that decision usually traces back to a specific moment when what they made didn't match what they imagined.

The transition happens somewhere in elementary school. Kids go from happily drawing stick figures to wanting their horse to actually *look* like a horse. When it doesn't, many quit entirely. **This is the moment that makes or breaks a young artist**—and it's also the moment where actual technique instruction (perspective, shading, proportion) becomes useful instead of soul-crushing.

The good news: you have more flexibility here than anywhere else. No tests. No required sequence. Just a kid, some materials, and permission to explore. Our new guide organizes curriculum recommendations by age and format—subscription boxes, video instruction, book-based programs, co-op options—tested at actual kitchen tables by OpenEd families.

# PODCAST HIGHLIGHT: [When (Not) to Quit Music Lessons](https://opened.co/blog/the-wasted-years-of-music-lessons-and-why-they-matter)

Music teacher Deborah Pratt has watched a variation of this story unfold dozens of times:

Kid starts piano in elementary school. Practices inconsistently. Cycles through a few instruments. Parents wonder if they're wasting money on lessons. From the outside, it looks like a dead end.

Then, the patterns click. The years of exposure to rhythm and melody and muscle memory finally have somewhere to go.

In one case, a 16-year-old who had been taking lessons from her for eight years decided to buy a bass guitar.

He starts practicing for hours—not because anyone's pushing him, but because he's found his thing.

The takeaway isn't "force your kid to practice." It's closer to the opposite: if his parents had required practice to "earn" lessons, he might've quit before the breakthrough. Sometimes the click comes at 16, not 8. Don't quit during a normal lull.

Kerry McDonald has the full story ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerrymcdonald/2025/12/01/meet-the-founder-who-started-a-church-to-run-her-microschool/)).
