## **STUDENT-LED CHANGE**

OpenEd students are proving that education goes beyond textbooks. Through our [**Community Service Program**](https://www.mytechhigh.com/serve?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=my-kid-can-t-read-yet-should-i-panic)—created in memory of beloved team member Stephanie Hess—students are turning their passions into projects that make real impact.

From environmental initiatives to community support programs, these young changemakers are showing what's possible when we trust kids to tackle real problems. Want to join them? Applications for this year's service projects are open through March 31.

As one student put it: "With enough people and enough help and enough time, great projects like this can happen and work and make the world a better place."

🔨 TOOL
## **SMART BOARDS: A $1,600 SOLUTION TO $16?**

A [**recent review of the HKMLC 55-inch Smart Board**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXVZaSN-Q-Y&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=my-kid-can-t-read-yet-should-i-panic) caught our attention, highlighting both the promise and pitfalls of bringing classroom tech into home learning spaces.

**The good:** Built-in apps, screen sharing capabilities, and Home Assistant integration make it a powerful hub for daily learning. One homeschool parent praised how it lets their child "work out math problems on the board like he was in regular school."

The not-so-good: At $1,649, it's a significant investment. And as one reviewer noted, pen sensitivity issues and unresponsive customer service can turn this "smart" solution into a frustrating experience.

**Our take:** While interactive whiteboards can enhance the learning experience, consider whether a simpler solution might work just as well:

- A standard whiteboard ($20-50)
- A TV or monitor you already own with an iPad and screen mirroring apps

Remember: Technology should solve problems, not create new ones. If you're considering a smart board, start by asking: What specific learning challenges am I trying to address? Often, the most effective solutions are the simplest ones.

That’s all for today!
