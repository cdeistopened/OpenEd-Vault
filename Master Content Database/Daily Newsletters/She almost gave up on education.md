## Summary
From college dropout to leading thousands of OpenEd learners, Andrea Fife explains how personalization changes everything—along with episode highlights and details on available Makerspace classes at Thanksgiving Point.

## Content

Andrea Fife – VP of Learning at OpenEd – was once on the verge of becoming another casualty of a rigid education system. Five years ago, as a passionate 5th-grade teacher trying to meet the diverse needs of her students, she found herself suffocating within the confines of traditional schooling.

"I was so burned out," Andrea shared in our recent podcast conversation. "I considered leaving education entirely."

Andrea's story is not unique. Our education system often pushes out its most creative and passionate students and educators simply because they don't fit a predetermined mold.

As a student, Andrea had experienced firsthand the shortcomings of traditional education.

"School was always very easy for me until I graduated from high school," she recalls.

Then came college, where she lost a full-ride scholarship and found herself completely disengaged.

"I just stopped going," Andrea admits.

"It wasn't serving me. It wasn't engaging."

These experiences led Andrea to an ‘a-ha’ moment: the problem wasn't with the students or teachers who didn't "fit in" – it was with a system that failed to adapt to individual needs and passions.

Today, Andrea is at the forefront of the open education revolution. Her goal? To ensure that no matter the learner's goal, she has a way to help them achieve it.

In our latest podcast episode, she shares the remarkable turn of events that took her from college dropout to educational innovator and advocate. She also reveals the unconventional approach that reignited her passion for learning, ultimately leading her to OpenEd.

"If I could give any piece of my experience to all parents," Andrea says, "it would be to see what I get to see."

Her role at OpenEd has given her a unique perspective:

"Because I have access to thousands of families and their weekly learning logs, the variety I've seen has changed my entire perspective on education."

This exposure to hundreds – if not thousands – of different learning approaches has reinforced her belief in the power of personalized, open education.

Curious about how Andrea's journey could change your perspective on education?
