💡 THOUGHT
## **Public vs. Private? How about BOTH?**

The Public vs. Private school war is over

The winners? Everyone who stopped choosing sides.

In Utah, a homeschooled kid takes robotics at the local high school. In Florida, a private school student joins the public school band. In Arizona, a public school offers à la carte classes to anyone with an Empowerment Scholarship Account.

It’s not about choosing public OR private anymore. It's about choosing what works for YOUR child.

The future of education isn't about walls - it's about bridges.

📚 "Public vs. Private? How about BOTH?"

Families across the nation are reshaping education.

## **From Builder to Architect: Dads Redesigning Education**

Brooks Sullards, a construction industry veteran and father of eight, recently shared how dads are finding new ways to engage in their children's education. In [**a thoughtful piece for Classical Conversations**](https://classicalconversations.com/blog/homeschooling-from-a-dad-to-a-dad/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=101-when-builders-become-architects), he describes his journey from being hands-off to becoming an active architect of his kids' learning.

"It's easier for me not to be involved," Sullards admits. "It is easier for me to simply 'bring home the bacon' and leave the homeschooling to my beautiful wife."

But like many fathers, he's discovered something more valuable than easy – the power of intentional design. The new education architects are:

- Breaking down complex subjects into manageable pieces
- Mapping learning paths based on each child's wiring
- Creating space for failure and iteration

🛠️ TOOL
## **Physics in a Minute (or Three)**

Need to explain why the solar system is flat to your curious 10-year-old? (Or maybe you're the one wondering…)

Enter the [**MinutePhysics**](https://www.youtube.com/@MinutePhysics?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=101-when-builders-become-architects) YouTube channel: Where complex science meets simple stick figures.

Created by Henry Reich, these bite-sized videos have racked up over 500 million views explaining everything from quantum mechanics to why stars are star-shaped. Reich’s secret is breaking down mind-bending concepts into digestible pieces using nothing fancier than marker drawings (okay, and occasionally some killer visual effects).
