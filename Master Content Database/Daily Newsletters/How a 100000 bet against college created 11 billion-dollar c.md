## **PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE**

Standardized education prepares children for a world that *no longer exists*.

Open education prepares them for a world that *doesn't exist yet*.

## **CHALLENGING THE COLLEGE REQUIREMENT**

"Harvard requires you to take 32 credits to graduate, some 16 in a major, electives... we decided none of that is required to find success in life, especially when it comes to working in technology."

— Michael Gibson, co-founder of [the Thiel Fellowship](https://thielfellowship.org/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=how-a-100-000-bet-against-college-created-11-billion-dollar-companies&_bhlid=61afc32b6d7ac2dc07d896f47ae8b91616a96f62)

In 2010, Peter Thiel launched a radical experiment: pay talented young people $100,000 to skip or leave college and build something important.

Michael Gibson, a co-founder of the fellowship, describes being inspired by Elon Musk's approach to engineering: challenge requirements, remove what can't be justified, then optimize what remains. Applied to education, they questioned whether traditional degree requirements actually lead to innovation and success.

Critics called it "the most misdirected philanthropy of the decade," but the results suggest otherwise.

The program has launched 11 companies worth over $1 billion, including Figma (acquired by Adobe for $20 billion), Ethereum, and Luminar. All this while student debt has ballooned to $1.7 trillion and college costs have increased 1000% in real terms over 40 years.

** 🔨 TOOL**
## **ROBLOX UNLEASHES CREATIVITY**

[Roblox just released Cube 3D](https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/03/introducing-roblox-cube?utm_source=www.therundown.ai&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=roblox-s-open-source-3d-generator&_bhlid=c248df6f8add264135baed26bf089262adcaa6a8), an open-source tool that lets anyone create 3D objects with simple text prompts like "/generate a motorcycle."

Last year, one of [the YEA! competition](https://www.yea.education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=how-a-100-000-bet-against-college-created-11-billion-dollar-companies&_bhlid=deb892e71333cc113365cfd4cb81cf7653e8a49a) winners built a thriving Roblox store that earned him real money.

With the democratization of these creative tools, knowledge and skills that were once locked behind institutional walls are now available to anyone willing to explore them.



That’s all for today! See you tomorrow.
