💡 THOUGHT
## **The Half-Life of Facts**

We still teach kids like facts never change.

Here’s our list:

- Humans only use 10% of their brains
- Dinosaurs were cold-blooded
- The Great Wall of China is visible from space

(Speaking of space, don’t get us started on Pluto’s claim to planethood.)

While closed education often presents facts as carved-in-stone truth, open education embraces the idea that information sometimes comes with an asterisk.

All the more reason to teach kids *how to think*, not *what to think.*

***What’s something you were taught in school that turned out to no be so?***

## **The Next Million-Dollar Business Might Be Cleaning Gutters.**

A boring service business will set you financially free.

These are the top 10 right now:

1) Pool Cleaning

[**We've been enjoying following @cleanwithmike on X**](https://x.com/cleanwithmike/status/1819350405224042992?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=103-boring-businesses-ftw), who shares these oddly satisfying threads showcasing "boring" service businesses. His latest hit 34.5M views. But here's what's fascinating: while millions watch these mesmerizing cleaning videos, few are connecting the dots to the massive opportunity they represent.

Pool cleaning. Pressure washing. Landscaping. Sign cleaning. Gutter cleaning.

Not exactly the careers your guidance counselor pushed, right? But [**as Mike Rowe (no relation to @cleanwithmike) has been preaching for years**](https://mikerowe.com/2024/11/reinvigorating-the-skilled-trades/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=103-boring-businesses-ftw): while everyone fights for desk jobs, skilled trades and service businesses are quietly minting millionaires.

The numbers don't lie. These "boring" businesses often have:

- Low startup costs
- High profit margins
- Zero student debt
- Endless demand

Plus, who doesn't love a satisfying before/after video?
🛠️ TOOL
## **The Independence Kit**

This holiday break, instead of planning activities for your kids, let them plan their own.

The free [**Let Grow Independence Kit**](http://letgrow.org/join?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=103-boring-businesses-ftw) helps kids identify something new they'd like to do on their own but haven't tried yet.

Not another curriculum. Not another schedule.

Just a simple prompt: **What would you like to try?**

Maybe it's making breakfast. Or shoveling snow for neighbors. Or learning to do laundry.

The kit includes lists of age-appropriate ideas. But the real magic happens when kids come up with their own. Because independence, like muscles, grows when you use it.

**Grab the free kit at **[**letgrow.org/join**](https://letgrow.org/join?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=103-boring-businesses-ftw)** and check out **[**their list of winter break activities**](https://letgrow.org/christmas-break-child-activities/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=103-boring-businesses-ftw)** for bored kids and harried parents.**
(WORD) OF THE DAY
## **Hygge (hoo-gah)**

Danish word describing a quality of coziness and comfortable conviviality that engenders a feeling of contentment or well-being. Perfect for winter breaks spent indoors with family, hot chocolate, and maybe a good book about starting a pool cleaning business.

That’s all for today!
