**🎧 THIS WEEK'S EPISODE**
## **THE HOMESCHOOLING MISNOMER**

"I think homeschooling is a misnomer for us. The amount of time that we're home is maybe three hours for the book work academics. Everything else is out, about, with friends, field trips, co-ops… fun things."

[– Maecy Palkki](https://opened.co/blog/is-homeschooling-the-wrong-word-were-only-home-3-hours-a-day-maecy-palkki/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=is-homeschooling-the-wrong-word-when-you-re-only-home-3-hours-a-day&_bhlid=f4d800d3121060e73993b7350c5336b4a0cef3b7)

In this week's episode, veteran homeschool mom (and OpenEd support team member extraordinaire) Maecy Palkki [shares how her family abandoned the "school at home" approach for something far more powerful: education as a lifestyle](https://opened.co/blog/is-homeschooling-the-wrong-word-were-only-home-3-hours-a-day-maecy-palkki/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=is-homeschooling-the-wrong-word-when-you-re-only-home-3-hours-a-day&_bhlid=e93f8c74db08d3094765e6847dfd8a84069340a9).***‍***

***The 3-Hour School Day: How Homeschoolers Really Spend Their Time ***

After 13 years homeschooling five children (including four adopted with special needs), Maecy discovered that traditional academics need only a fraction of the day—while the real learning happens everywhere else.

## **THE THREE-HOUR SCHOOL DAY**

Forget the image of kids sitting at the kitchen table for 6 hours straight. For most families, homeschooling looks radically different:

"We ski several times a week with friends. They do kayaking, we go see the salmon when they spawn at our lake," says Maecy.

This lifestyle approach transforms education from isolated academics into immersive, real-world learning:

- Science happens while observing salmon spawning
- Physics principles come alive on ski slopes
- History unfolds during travel

The family even spent six months living in a trailer and traveling across the United States—a form of "roadschooling" where geography wasn’t just studied, it was experienced.

## **THE DIPLOMA MYTH DEBUNKED**

When Maecy's oldest daughter applied to work at the Mayo Clinic, a moment of panic struck: they requested a high school diploma, but as a homeschooler, she never received an official one.

The solution was surprisingly simple:

"I printed a homeschool diploma out and I signed it and they accepted that. They don't care if it's accredited or not. They just want a paper to file in their diploma spot."

Increasingly, we’ve seen that employers are less concerned about credentials than skills and a readiness to learn new things.

(In case you’re wondering, she got the job.)
