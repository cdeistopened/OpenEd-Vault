## Summary
A 50+ year-long study reveals the secret sauce of parenting and educating

## Content

Hope everyone had a great long weekend!

I've been marinating on a juicy study I wanted to share last week, but I wasn't sure how to plate it. So I let it simmer over the weekend, and now it's ready to serve up.

So, grab a beverage of your choice, and let’s dig in.

**In this edition:**

- The buzz about a 50-year study on parenting
- What "autonomy-supportive parenting" really means
- How this connects to self-directed learning (featuring insights from our own Andrea Fife)

Daniel Pink, bestselling author of "Drive" and "When," sparked some lively discussion on Twitter (er... X) about [**a recent study on parenting styles. Published in the American Psychologist**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381667336_Disentangling_Autonomy-Supportive_and_Psychologically_Controlling_Parenting_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Self-Determination_Theory), this meta-analysis examined 238 studies spanning 51 years and involving over 126,423 families across 38 countries. Here’s Pink’s ***Tl;dr***:

Want happier, healthier kids?

Offer them autonomy.

Massive new meta-analysis makes it plain:

In every culture, control leaves children worse off — but autonomy helps them people engage, learn, and grow.

The replies to Pink’s tweet were amusing and insightful.

One comment suggested that the conclusion didn’t need a 50-year meta-study to back them up:

“Observe all of recorded human history > This massive new meta-analysis”

Another questioned the results, wondering if the study had confused correlation with causation:

“It's likely that kids that are healthier and doing well allow parents to give them more autonomy, and kids that are having problems cause parents to tighten control.”

(A fair point, though the researchers claimed to have controlled the data to eliminate that potential source of bias.)

Others just wanted clarity on what the term "autonomy-supportive parenting" even means:** like, do you just let your kids do whatever they want??**

Here, we would do well to read the paper itself, but since nobody's got time for that we asked [**Claude**](http://claude.ai/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday-the-new-science-of-raising-happy-kids) (our trusty AI assistant) to give us some highlights:

- **Self-Determination Theory: **A psychological framework proposing that autonomy, competence, and relatedness are universal human needs. In parenting and education, it suggests that supporting these needs fosters intrinsic motivation and well-being.
- Autonomy-supportive parenting involves considering the child's perspective, encouraging **age-appropriate choices**, and providing rationales for rules and limits.
- It's about nurturing a child's sense of self and decision-making skills **within appropriate boundaries**.
- This approach is consistently linked to better well-being and mental health outcomes across cultures.

In short, autonomy-supportive parenting isn't about letting your kids run wild. It's about supporting their growing independence and self-determination within specific structures and limits.

## Connecting the Dots to Self-Directed Learning

In the context of education, self-determination (the theory) lends itself well to self-directed learning (the practice). A schooling experience that puts test scores and arbitrary learning outcomes ahead of a child's natural curiosity is likely to be linked to decreased well-being and motivation.

This brings us back to the message of [**the recent podcast episode with Andrea Fife**](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-005-she-almost-gave-up-on-education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tl-dr-tuesday-the-new-science-of-raising-happy-kids), our VP of learning at OpenEd. When asked about her goals for the program, she said:

"For any student who can identify their goal, I want for us to have a way to get them there. ... Part of that is understanding that they can have goals that they've never heard of before. There's sort of a deconstructing the traditional narrative that has to happen before someone can truly tell me their goal."

– Andrea Fife

Andrea's words speak to the spirit of autonomy support in education. It's about expanding horizons – showing learners that there are more choices than they might have realized – and then providing the *support* to pursue those choices.

Do we need a 51-year meta-study to validate this approach? Probably not, but if any researchers out there are looking for a long-term project, a study on the outcomes of self-directed learning could be huge.

That's all for this edition.

Do you have thoughts on this format or anything else? **Reply to this email – we always love hearing from you!**

Until next time,
