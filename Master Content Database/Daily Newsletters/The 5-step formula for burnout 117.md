## **The AI Tutor Paradox**

[**Edutopia's top 10 educational findings of 2024 highlights**](https://www.edutopia.org/article/the-10-most-significant-education-studies-of-2024/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-5-step-formula-for-burnout-117) a bombshell study with a crucial lesson about AI tutoring:

High schoolers using ChatGPT outperformed peers by 127% during practice... but bombed the actual test.

Why? They used AI as a shortcut instead of a teacher, skipping straight to answers instead of understanding.

**But there's hope:** AI tools that refuse to give away answers and instead ask probing questions showed promise. The difference? They're designed to *guide* thinking, not replace it.

Check out [**the full roundup of educational findings at Edutopia**](https://www.edutopia.org/article/the-10-most-significant-education-studies-of-2024/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-5-step-formula-for-burnout-117), including how "pandemic babies" are faring and the surprising truth about teen mental health trends.

## **Your Students' Next Field Trip? Piloting Drones Over Iceland**

Nothing replaces the hands-on magic of a real field trip. But what about the places that have always been out of reach – African savannas, volcanic craters, cloud forests?

[**NatureEye**](https://www.natureeye.com/education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-5-step-formula-for-burnout-117) is making these impossible destinations possible through live, interactive drone flights. This isn't passive video watching – students actually take turns piloting the drones themselves, guided by local experts on the ground.

**What makes it special:**

- Real-time drone control
- Local guides as co-pilots
- Built-in safety features
- Curriculum-aligned materials
- High-res photo capture

We're exploring adding NatureEye as a community perk for OpenEd families. **Interested?** Reply to this email and show your enthusiasm!
