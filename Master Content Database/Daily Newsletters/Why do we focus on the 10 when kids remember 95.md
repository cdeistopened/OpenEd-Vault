### 💡 1 THOUGHT

**WE REMEMBER**

10% of what we read
20% of what we hear
30% of what we see
50% of what we see and hear
70% of what we discuss with others
80% of what we personally experience
**95% of what we teach others**

*– Edgar Dale, *education psychologist who created the "Cone of Experience"

### 📊 2 TRENDS

**1. **[**AI Tutors Kill Language Learning Anxiety**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjGk7EmYuxY&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-do-we-focus-on-the-10-when-kids-remember-95) - A language instructor / YouTuber Xiaomanyc demo’d an AI Chinese tutor (see below). **Top comment:** "Perfect for me. Social anxiety holds me back." AI = judgment-free practice zone. How often does fear prevent learning more than the actual difficulty of the subject? 🧐

**2. **[**20-Minute Walks Transform Kids' Brains**](https://x.com/SahilBloom/status/1598366165113380865?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-do-we-focus-on-the-10-when-kids-remember-95) - New research shows dramatic cognitive gains in children after brief walks. **Take note, taskmasters:** Movement isn't a break (brake?)—it's the accelerator.

### 🔨 3 TOOLS

**1. **[**Teacher AI - The $1 Language Practice App**](https://yourteacher.ai/schools/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-do-we-focus-on-the-10-when-kids-remember-95) - Xiaomanyc’s app (the same one he used to tutor himself) let’s anyone practice speaking with AI tutors for less than $1 per 30-minute session. The tutor speaks both English and your target language, so you can mix languages when you get stuck. One user went from beginner-intermediate to conversational Spanish in just one week.

**2. **[**64 of the Best Free Harvard Courses**](https://mashable.com/article/free-harvard-courses-jan-2025?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-do-we-focus-on-the-10-when-kids-remember-95) - From CS50 to Chinese philosophy. Skip the tuition and come for the knowledge.

**3. **[**Recess.gg - Where Kids Build Real Tech Projects**](https://recess.gg/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-do-we-focus-on-the-10-when-kids-remember-95) - Recess connects kids as young as 7 with expert mentors and peers worldwide to build actual AI games and coding projects. One mom reports: "Jack brings a computer on every vacation. He 'can't' miss Recess. This has been life changing."
