### 💡 DEEP DIVE

## **THE MYTH THE BUSTER COULDN’T BUST**

Adam Savage built a career on explosions, experiments, and exposing what's fake. For 14 seasons of *MythBusters*, he showed millions that our default assumptions are often wrong.

But when it came to his own ADHD son, even the professional skeptic fell for the oldest myth in education: that *one size fits all*.

"I spent too much time trying to help him fit into the mold of our current education system; because it's easier that way," Savage admits in a [**video**](https://www.tiktok.com/@openedhq/video/7516705536700714283?lang=en&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=mythbusting-one-size-fits-all) that's racked up over 200,000 views and 386 comments since we posted it. "And the education system is an inertial mass that wants everyone to roll along with it."

Why did the video strike such a nerve? Perhaps it’s because it names what so many parents feel but can't articulate: becoming an accomplice in your children's suffering.

"When you work really hard to fit your kid into the mold of the school, it's stressful for everyone and your kid feels that stress," Savage continues. "They feel it first of all in themselves from the school work and the difficulties of fitting the mold, but secondarily they feel *your* stress."

This is the trap. We see our child struggling. We want to help. So we double down on the very system that's causing the struggle. More tutoring. More structure. More pressure.

Savage's revelation cuts deeper: "My kid saw our family’s stress at dealing with him in school and internalized some of that as like … he was the problem."

The comments tell the same story hundreds of times over:

*"We destroyed our daughter's self esteem trying to follow the advice of schools and autism 'experts' to cram her into a mold she was never built for," one parent confessed.*

*"I am that kid. Except I am the mom," wrote another.*

*"Going through this right now with my 8-year-old."*

And last, but not least:

*"Thank you for sharing your regret so we don't have to have the same one."*

"That's the thing about the neuro-spicy," Savage says, using his affectionate term for neurodivergent kids, "is that so often in attempting to get them to fit a mold, they take on the disappointment of not fitting that mold as a personal failure, and it's not."

We saw this same pattern throughout the week. On the podcast, [**Tony Mickelsen asked**](https://opened.co/blog/5-myths-keeping-your-child-from-reading-success-and-the-25-minute-solution?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=mythbusting-one-size-fits-all) why we force 60-minute tutoring sessions on kids who learn better in 25-minute bursts? A [**homeschool mom discovered**](https://letgrow.org/free-play-fridays-weidmer/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=mythbusting-one-size-fits-all) her daughter thrived when given space to create.

What makes Savage's confession so powerful is that he had every advantage. Fame. Resources. A platform built on questioning assumptions. And still, he fell for it.

"If I could go back to tell myself, to tell my 20-year-older self how to best support my kid through grade school, middle school, and high school," he reflects, "it would be to allow more space, whatever that means, for him to find his own journey through it."

Not solutions. Not fixes. Just space.

*If you have a friend who’s struggling to fit their kid into a certain mold, forward this email to let them know that their options are more open than they might think; or, reply with your own stories (including the regrets!).*
