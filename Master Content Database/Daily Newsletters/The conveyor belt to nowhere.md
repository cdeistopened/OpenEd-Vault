## Summary
Why your honor student still lives in the basement. PLUS: Public schools go rogue with microschooling model, and Mario still teaches typing?

## Content

Happy Monday!

Remember Mario Teaches Typing? That pixelated plumber who taught us to type while jumping on Koopa Troopas? Well, typing instruction got a serious upgrade.

And [Indiana just went from 6 microschools to 130 in one year](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerrymcdonald/2025/05/27/public-microschooling-gains-popularity-and-support/)—with public schools now leading the charge.

Let's dive in.

**THOUGHT:** Success Theater**
TREND: **The Rise of the Intrapreneurs**
TOOL: **Fix Your Kid's Hunt-and-Peck Problem

# Success Theater

We judge restaurants by whether the food tastes good.
We judge gyms by whether people get fit.
But in education, we applaud the credential—not the life that follows.

Parents proudly announce: "My kid graduated with honors from this university."

Their kid could be 27, unemployed, eating chicken wings in the basement. But the diploma on the wall? *That's* success.

The educational conveyor belt claims to prepare kids for life. Yet we measure its success by grades, test scores, and acceptance letters—never by whether kids actually thrive afterward.

# The Rise of the Intrapreneurs

Indiana had 6 microschools in 2023. Today they have over 130.

[A public school superintendent saw families making the shift and thought, "We should build those too."](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerrymcdonald/2025/05/27/public-microschooling-gains-popularity-and-support/)

Phil Hauer runs Eastern Hancock school district in rural Indiana. He just launched the state's first network of public charter microschools—while keeping his superintendent job.

Instead of fighting innovation, he's embracing it and bringing microschool flexibility to families who can't afford private options.

Kerry McDonald calls leaders like Hauer ["intrapreneurs"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerrymcdonald/2025/05/27/public-microschooling-gains-popularity-and-support/)—entrepreneurs working inside the system. They're proof that open education works everywhere: in your living room, at a learning pod, or even in a public school that decides to reinvent itself.

# Fix Your Kid's Hunt-and-Peck Problem

Your kid thinks at 150 words per minute, but types at 15.

That's a ten-to-one bottleneck between brain and screen.

Alicia Hutchinson from Learning Well discovered [Typesy](https://www.typesy.com/homeschool/) and calls it "[the best typing program for homeschool.](https://www.aliciahutchinson.com/the-best-typing-program-for-homeschool/)"

"My middle schooler actually looks forward to typing practice—something I didn't expect!" she says.

Her high schooler uses it differently—brushing up on accuracy and speed before tackling writing-heavy assignments. Same program, different goals. Both kids making progress.

Beyond typing, kids learn Microsoft Office skills, Google Drive, even time management. Fifteen minutes each morning after Morning Meeting. Parents track progress with one click.

$67 gets your entire family lifetime access.

And if you’re still nostalgic for the pixelated plumber who taught *you* typing—well, [there’s an app for that](https://playclassic.games/games/educational-dos-games-online/play-mario-teaches-typing-online/) too.

# WORD OF THE DAY: Intrapreneur

**In·tra·pre·neur** (IN-truh-pruh-NUR)

Someone who acts like an entrepreneur inside an established organization. The safer cousin of entrepreneurship—sometimes just as effective.
