💡 THOUGHT
## **The case for ‘lighthouse parenting’**

You’ve heard of Tiger Moms and Helicopter Dads, but what about Lighthouse Parents?

❝

“Sometimes, the best thing a parent can do is nothing at all.”

– Russell Shaw

Russell Shaw – head of Georgetown Day School – recently [**made a strong case in *The Atlantic***](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2024/09/lighthouse-parents-have-more-confident-kids/679976/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=048-from-moon-head-to-main-character) that our efforts to smooth every bump in our children's paths might make life harder for everyone.

**You’ve seen it before:** a child falls while playing… the parents rush in, causing the child to sob hysterically… A calmer reaction might have led the child to dust himself off and keep playing.

Sometimes our need to fix a situation blows it out of proportion.

Watching our children struggle goes against our protective instincts. But discomfort is part of our job as parents.
📊 TREND
A movement led by [**Dream a Dream**](https://dreamadream.org/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=048-from-moon-head-to-main-character) in India challenges us to redefine what success means in education. They asked over 100 students, parents, educators, and policymakers what success looks like to them.

Here's what people said:

- Sense of Belonging (18%)
- Happiness (16%)
- Wellbeing (16%)

- Sense of Agency (16%)
- Financial Security (13%)
- Having a Purpose (7%)

What’s most interesting to us is *how evenly distributed the responses are*. The traditional definition—financial security—ranks on the lower side, and none of the answers dominates.

How do you define success? **Reply to this email - we’d love to hear!**

## **From Moon Head to Main Character**

Remember the sting of a schoolyard taunt? For [**Joey Mascio**](https://www.joeymascio.com/sidekicktohero?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=048-from-moon-head-to-main-character), it was "Moon Head" – a nod to McDonald’s forgotten mascot “Mac Tonight.” Fortunately, Joey discovered a secret weapon in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).

Never mind the power of positive thinking. CBT is about *accurate* thinking:

- Distinguishing facts from fiction in your mind
- Identifying (and replacing) thought patterns that sabotage success
- Crafting new narratives that fuel confidence

Most teens lack this toolkit. They're trapped in a mental cage, mistaking opinions for facts:

- "I'm weird-looking."
- "Nobody likes me."
- "I'll never succeed."

But what if they could rewrite these thoughts?

As an adult, Mascio created a gamified virtual program called [**Sidekick to Hero**](https://www.joeymascio.com/sidekicktohero?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=048-from-moon-head-to-main-character) to teach kids CBT and other life skills.

### (VIDEO) OF THE DAY

Speaking of Moon Head, what was the deal with that McDonald’s mascot, anyway?

[**Weird History Food has the scoop:**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=xPtTi-gHL7o&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=048-from-moon-head-to-main-character)

It’s videos like this that remind us why the internet was made.

That’s all for today!
