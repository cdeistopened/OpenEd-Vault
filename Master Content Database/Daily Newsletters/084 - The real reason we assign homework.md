💡 THOUGHT
## **The Myth of "The Quiet Child"**

Have you ever noticed how your "quiet" child suddenly becomes a chatterbox around certain friends or family?

Kevin’s post hits something deeper about learning and personality: There's no such thing as "the quiet child" or "the social child." There are only children in different contexts.

Just like how a kid might be "bad at math" in a traditional classroom but [**excel when dividing Storm Troopers regiments**](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-016-how-to-transform-everyday-moments-into-powerful-learning-experiences-with-charlynn-chambers/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=084-the-real-reason-we-assign-homework) or "struggle with reading" until they find Harry Potter – what we often label as personality traits are actually responses to the environment.

## **Podcast: Homework is a form of signaling.**

Many parents complain about their kids’ homework loads. But few question it. We've taught ourselves to believe that seven hours of school isn't enough. Kids need more practice. More worksheets. More sitting still.

More of what's not working.

Former teacher Keri Mae noticed something that most of us miss – worksheets are among the worst ways to learn. So why do we keep assigning them? Maybe it’s because homework is less about learning than proving we're serious about education.

It's signaling.

But while we're busy signaling, real learning is happening elsewhere. In garages where kids take apart drones. In bedrooms where they design 3D-printed inventions. In kitchens where families cook together.

[**Listen to our full podcast conversation with Keri**](https://opened.co/podcast/episode-022-how-this-working-mom-ditched-homework-transformed-her-kids-education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=084-the-real-reason-we-assign-homework) and tell us whether you agree or disagree. How do you define homework in the era of open education?
🛠️ TOOL
## **Give Me that Old-Time Education**

Want to give your kids a rigorous, classical education without spending a fortune on curriculum? Many of the best educational materials ever created are completely free.

They're called "public domain texts" – books published before 1923 that are now copyright-free. And they offer some surprising advantages:

- Higher expectations (No dumbing down)
- Time-tested quality (They've survived 100+ years!)
- Fully customizable (Edit and adapt as needed)
