## **PERSONAL TUTORS FOR ALL (SAL KHAN’S PROMISE)**

Khan Academy's "[**Khanmigo**](https://www.khanmigo.ai/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=personal-tutors-for-all-sal-khan-s-latest-promise)" AI tutor is making waves—but can it truly revolutionize education as Sal Khan claims [**in his recent TED talk**](https://www.ted.com/talks/sal_khan_how_ai_could_save_not_destroy_education?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=personal-tutors-for-all-sal-khan-s-latest-promise)?

Khan points to [**Benjamin Bloom's famous "2 sigma problem,"**](https://web.mit.edu/5.95/www/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=personal-tutors-for-all-sal-khan-s-latest-promise) which showed one-on-one tutoring could dramatically improve student performance. The challenge has always been scaling personal tutoring economically. Khan believes AI is the answer.

The demos are impressive:

- It identifies specific math misconceptions rather than just flagging wrong answers
- Students can debate historical figures and literary characters (one student apologized to Jay Gatsby for taking up his time)
- It provides writing feedback by highlighting text and asking Socratic questions

For teachers, it generates lesson plans and handles administrative tasks.

But questions remain. Can AI replicate the emotional intelligence of great human tutors? Will it reinforce existing educational inequalities? And what about student privacy with all these recorded conversations?

While it's easy to get caught up in the techno-optimism, the real test will be in the real world, not TED stages.

We want to know from our families who have tried it. Does the tool live up to the hype?

🛠️ TOOL
## **CROWDSOURCED BOOK SCREENING**

Ever picked up a children's book only to discover content you weren't ready to discuss with your 8-year-old? A new platform called [**ScreenItFirst**](https://screenitfirst.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=personal-tutors-for-all-sal-khan-s-latest-promise) aims to eliminate those awkward moments.

This crowdsourced site lets parents anonymously flag and view potentially sensitive content in children's books across multiple categories:

- Sexual content
- Violence/death
- Foul language
- Dark content (demons, witches)
- Potty humor

Users upload actual screenshots and images from books with the questionable content highlighted. You see exactly what appears on the page, allowing you to make your own judgment.

The site’s tagline is, "The right book at the right time builds a healthy mind"—emphasizing timing and appropriateness rather than censorship.
