## Summary
“Apple Vision Pro. Like, what even is that?”

## Content

‍**💡 THOUGHT**
## **“Screen Time: Friend, Foe, or Frenemy?”**

We’re going with *frenemy*. Like any new technology, it brings challenges and opportunities. It's easy to treat it as utterly unique, but in many ways, the patterns of past technological disruptions hold true.

We started too loosey-goosey with my first three kids, thinking, "He's playing Minecraft. He's learning. It's all good."

Then we wondered, "Why is he acting so rude and impatient and zombie-like?"

It turns out screen time needs limits.

But don't throw the baby out with the bathwater, or move off-grid. We need to master these technologies, not let them master us. After all, you're probably reading this on a screen.

**The bottom line:** Any behavior taken to extremes isn't healthy. Be intentional about how you use devices as tools. But don’t forget the value of unstructured, outdoor play. (it’s worth noting that young boys, in particular, might learn math better after an hour-long recess than with extra study time.)

Every child is different. What works for one may not work for another.


📊 TREND
## “Apple Vision Pro. Like, what even is that?”

Not all young people are rushing to embrace the newest technologies.

We recently spoke with a group of young people from [the Nature Kids Connect program](https://naturekidsconnect.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=042-what-parents-and-teens-think-about-screen-time&_bhlid=55bbb6b9738f48d941bbcf5aa7e493c669a5b509) – a part-time outdoor education program in Utah that meets every Friday – and asked their thoughts on screens. Here are some highlights:

“It's kind of becoming a dystopian world. Apple Vision Pro. Like, what even is that?""Technology can be a vortex. It can suck you in and you can get addicted to it. When you're on your phone it's just a really big distraction and it just gets in the way.""Technology can be a really useful tool, but it has to have its place. When you have these physical interactions, the friendships are just on a deeper level and they last a lot longer."

The general consensus seemed to be that “IRL” interaction (in real life, in Gen Z speak) beats texting, but that real connection takes practice.
