💡** THOUGHT**
## **How to Start a Business (with no ideas)**

**You don't need a groundbreaking idea to start a business. You just need to start.**

**I remember when OpenEd was just a glimmer in my eye. There was no clearly defined roadmap, just a driving feeling that we could do education better for our children. So **[**this recent Forbes article**](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/want-start-business-but-no-ideas/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=038-how-to-start-a-business-with-no-ideas&_bhlid=ba5d22173640f7eb7e5b3e62c3b5ed621f2fdebc)** titled *‘How to Start a Business with No Ideas’* caught my eye, and I had to share some of the lessons that resonate most with me:**

1. **Be a problem detective. The best businesses solve pain points. What irks you daily?**
2. **Passion + skill = potential goldmine. What do you love? What are you good at? That intersection is your sweet spot.**
3. **Network like your business depends on it (because it does). Ideas spark from conversations.**
4. **MVP = Minimum Viable Product, not Most Valuable Player. Start small, iterate fast.**
5. **Feedback is your new best friend. Embrace it, even when it stings.**

**Remember: **Every expert was once a beginner. Successful leaders didn't start there—they started by starting.

So, what challenge will you begin to solve this week?

Aiden Prout, an OpenEd alum who did all K-12 years in the program, exemplifies the trend of young entrepreneurs creating innovative solutions to real-world problems.

Using skills from [our 3D Modeling course](https://www.mytechhigh.com/3d-design-modeling-animation-and-printing?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=038-how-to-start-a-business-with-no-ideas&_bhlid=4f052a79c51bd8c36cec4a8e3344b53c98b45a37), 17-year-old Aiden developed garden boxes that use 93.5% less water and require no weeding.

Aiden's business earned over $150,000 in its first year (!), far exceeding his initial $10,000 goal. We love to see it. Keep it up, Aiden!
