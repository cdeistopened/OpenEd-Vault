Learning centers find their groove, the perfectionism paradox, and a bonus meme/word of the day

💡 THOUGHT
## **The Perfectionism Paradox**

The more you chase the perfect day, the fewer productive learning days you have.

The real transformation comes from understanding:

- Consistency > Perfection
- Progress > Plans
- Showing up > Giving up

[Pam Barnhill’s latest podcast offers a formula for what she calls the “Minimum Viable Day”](https://pambarnhill.com/why-perfectionism-is-sabotaging-your-homeschool/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=why-perfectionism-is-sabotaging-your-homeschool&_bhlid=83347af16e4619b257a5623346f91cd816ab25e4):

1. Define non-negotiable subjects for YOUR family
2. Create flexible time blocks (not rigid schedules)
3. Build in buffer time for real life
4. Focus on learning momentum, not daily completion

A consistently "good enough" routine accomplishes more than the occasional perfect day.

## **Learning Centers Find Their Groove**

It looks like in-person "learning centers" for homeschool families weren’t just a pandemic phenomenon. The [74 reports](https://www.the74million.org/article/why-church-based-homeschool-learning-centers-are-gaining-popularity-in-massachusetts/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=063-math-without-the-misery&_bhlid=ee5f1a383817428339dc9f6fe23f7ab7b02d1413) that they're still growing in 2024. And they're getting creative with space.

Empty karate dojos, art studios, and church buildings – spaces often vacant during school hours – are being transformed into vibrant learning environments. The [GROW Christian Learning Center](https://www.cavidanueva.com/grow?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=063-math-without-the-misery&_bhlid=82348ac796cccc93819f62bb3ba8fdc82d284d9e) in Worcester, MA, started with just six students in 2022. They now serve 84 students, with 40 more on the waitlist. Annual tuition? Just $2,400.

Erika Serrano saw her daughter struggling with peer pressure and behavioral changes during her freshman year of high school. Since switching to a learning center, "She has flourished into such a beautiful, kind young woman... "

This mirrors what we're seeing across the country: Parents aren't looking to replace traditional schools – they're looking to find the right fit for their kids. Whether that's public school, private school, homeschool, or hybrid models, the key is having options.

## **Math Without the Misery: Math Inspirations**

Is math a daily battleground in your household? [Math Inspirations](https://mathinspirations.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=063-math-without-the-misery&_bhlid=62d4a5bab618887f6ec68929b1c3d94977f11d91) takes a refreshing approach:

**Instead of:** "Here's how to solve it"

**They teach:** "Let's discover how to solve it"

It's a curriculum built around thinking, not calculating; discovery, not memorization. But what caught our eye was the 24/7 support.

Parents report their kids getting excited about math (no, really!). As one mom in Alberta put it: "We discovered the music and artistry, the elegance and playfulness... that can be REAL math!"

Want to test it out? They offer a free starter kit to see if their discovery method matches your teaching style.

(WORD/MEME) OF THE DAY
## **orthogonal (or·thog·o·nal)**

From Greek orthogōnios: orthos (straight, upright) + gōnia (angle), orthogonal usually refers to things that are independent, and uncorrelated – “of different or unrelated natures.”

Oh yeah, it can also be a fancy way of saying “two lines at right angles.”



That’s all for today!
