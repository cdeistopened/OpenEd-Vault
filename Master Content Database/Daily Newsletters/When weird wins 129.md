💡 THOUGHT
## **“When normal is broken, weird wins."**

"In a time when normal is broken, weird actually wins."

That’s Matt Barnes – entrepreneur, father of 3, and co-founder with Matt Bowman of the annual [**Youth Entrepreneur Award!**](https://www.yea.education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=when-weird-wins-129)

The “double Matt B’s” [**teamed up on today’s podcast**](https://youtu.be/5Mimv_vwyQ8?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=when-weird-wins-129) to share tips for winning up to $5,000 in prize money.
Here are 3 highlights:
**1/ Matt and Matt aren’t looking for the next ‘unicorn’ startup (think Facebook).**

They're looking for young people who can articulate what they're LEARNING through entrepreneurship.

**2/ The best applications they’ve seen?**

Kids who openly share their failures, pivots, and lessons learned (not the ones with heavily-rehearsed pitches like you see on Shark Tank.)

**3/ What they *really* want to see:**

- How you solve real problems
- How you handle money/decisions
- How you deal with failure

**YEA is open to ANY entrepreneur 18 or under, anywhere on the planet **(community projects and social entrepreneurship count too).

Apply at [**yea.education**](https://yea.education/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=when-weird-wins-129) before March 15th, and forward this to any teens you know who might fit the bill.

## **The Surge**

Traditional wisdom says tough times crush small businesses. [**These compiled stats from ThinkImpact**](https://www.thinkimpact.com/entrepreneur-statistics/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=when-weird-wins-129) tell a different story: **Entrepreneurship jumped 29% during the pandemic.**

Women now make up nearly half of all new business owners (up from 29% in 2019). Perhaps most tellingly, a whopping 95% of self-employed people plan to stay self-employed.

The most interesting part? Despite economic uncertainty, 63% believe self-employment is the *smartest* choice in turbulent times.

## **Kid-Run Markets Are Taking Over**

Remember when a lemonade stand was peak kid entrepreneurship? The [**Children's Entrepreneur Market**](https://childrensentrepreneurmarket.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=when-weird-wins-129) is rewriting that playbook.

Starting with just 3 locations in Utah in 2017, they've now hosted over 400 markets across the country, giving 43,000+ young entrepreneurs their first taste of real-world business. This year, they plan to operate in 44 states.

**Here's how it works:**

- Ages 5-17 can participate
- Kids sell anything from handmade crafts to services
- Parents help set up, then step back
- Young entrepreneurs handle everything else

These aren't just cute craft fairs. They're serious business incubators where kids learn:

- Real-world pricing strategies
- Customer service skills
- Basic market economics
- Sales techniques
- Confidence in public speaking

Visit [**Children's Entrepreneur Market**](https://childrensentrepreneurmarket.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=when-weird-wins-129) to find a market near you or help bring one to your area.

H/t to Charlynn Chambers for bringing this incredible organization to our attention.

That’s all for today!
