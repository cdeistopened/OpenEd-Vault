## **Albert Einstein on his early education**

Albert Einstein on his school and Education system💡

It bored me. The teachers behaved like sergeants. I wanted to learn what I wanted to know, but they wanted me to learn for the exam. What I hated most was the competitive system there, and especially sports. Because of this, I… x.com/i/web/status/1…

In a world overflowing with misattributed Einstein quotes, it’s refreshing to find one he actually said that speaks so pointedly to the state of modern education:

"The teachers behaved like sergeants. I wanted to learn what I wanted to know, but they wanted me to learn for the exam... I felt that my thirst for knowledge was being strangled by my teachers; grades were their only measurement. How can a teacher understand youth with such a system?"

– Albert Einstein, as quoted in *Einstein and the Poet: In Search of the Cosmic Man* (1983) by William Hermanns

## **Public Schools Are Getting the Hybrid Memo**

[**A public school in Tennessee is experimenting with a new model:**](https://www.the74million.org/article/what-happens-when-public-school-districts-embrace-hybrid-schools/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=098-what-einstein-actually-said-about-school) students attend brick-and-mortar classes just one day a week, learning from home the other four.

- Teachers love it (90%+ satisfaction vs just 18% in traditional schools).
- Parents get the best of both worlds: professional guidance + family time
- Kids benefit from personalized attention and flexible pacing

It’s great to see public school districts embracing the idea that education doesn't have to be all-or-nothing. You can blend the structure of traditional schooling with the flexibility of home learning.

Could this be the beginning of a bigger shift in public education? With teacher burnout at record highs and more families seeking alternatives, hybrid models might just be the bridge many have been waiting for.

## **Outschool.com**

Just when you thought you'd figured out the difference between unschooling and deschooling, along comes [**Outschool**](https://outschool.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=098-what-einstein-actually-said-about-school). But don't let the name fool you – this isn't about avoiding education, it's about reimagining it.

Think of Outschool as the Netflix of learning, except instead of binge-watching trashy TV shows, your kids might find themselves binge-learning about anything from Minecraft coding to medieval history.

Here’s what makes Outschool special:

- Small group classes (typically 2-8 students)
- Passionate teachers who create their own courses
- Flexible scheduling (one-time classes to ongoing courses)
- Real-time interaction with experts and peers
- Market-driven quality (poorly rated classes don't survive)

[**As the company’s founder Amir Nathoo recently shared on the LiberatED podcast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLm6_wKLKh8&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=098-what-einstein-actually-said-about-school): "When parents realize that letting kids pursue their interests is a way to get them excited about learning and is a better way to help their kids thrive in the world, that's really powerful to see."

**OpenEd families get 20% off all classes and tutoring with code OPENED20 at checkout. **You can also try classes before you commit. Teachers post video introductions, and most offer single-session classes so you can test the waters before diving into longer courses.
