And now, let’s take a look back at the week that was.
💡THE BIG IDEA
## **‘My kid hates learning.’**

Your kid doesn't hate learning. They probably never did. They just know – like Albert Einstein did – that there's a better way.

When Einstein wrote about his early schooling, he didn't mince words:

❝

"The teachers behaved like sergeants. ***I wanted to learn what I wanted to know, but they wanted me to learn for the exam***... I felt that my thirst for knowledge was being strangled."

Albert Einstein

More than 100 hundred years later, the same system Einstein suffered under is still the norm. That's why so many of us are choosing a different path. We’ve seen that same thirst for knowledge in our kids and refused to let it be strangled.

In a world full of fake Einstein quotes, it’s refreshing to find one we can verify.

That's all for this week, folks! Have a great weekend.
