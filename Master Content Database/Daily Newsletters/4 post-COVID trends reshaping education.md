**Greetings Eddies!**

What happens when you run an experiment on millions of families without their consent?

In 2020, we found out. The conveyor belt stopped. Kids stayed home. [And parents learned something they weren't expecting](https://www.instagram.com/p/DSAv1dNlU4L/).

Today we explore what they discovered, the four trends reshaping education as a result, and some tools that invite curiosity without forcing it.

Let's dive in.

P.S. Stay tuned for the official OpenEd gear launch on Thursday, December 11th!

**THOUGHT**: 2 Big Realizations
‍**TREND**: 4 Trends Reshaping Education
‍**TOOL**: 3 Tools That Invite Curiosity

# 2 Big Realizations

When COVID hit, [families suddenly found themselves at home doing online school](https://www.instagram.com/p/DSAv1dNlU4L/).

This led to many realizations about what their kids were really learning (or not learning). But the biggest realization for many families was that if kids missed a few days of school, nothing terrible would happen. They didn't fall behind, and they were happier than ever.

They also learned that they* liked* having their kids home more*.* The kids felt the same. They started doing more things together, like baking.

Isaac Morehouse shares the thought process he saw unfold in parent after parent on the Minimalists Podcast.

# 4 Trends Reshaping Education

Hannah Frankman ([@hannahfrankman](https://x.com/hannahfrankman)) writing for [The Daily Economy](https://thedailyeconomy.org/article/four-post-covid-trends-are-reshaping-american-education/) identifies four post-COVID shifts quietly rewriting American education:

**1. Zoom school revealed the truth.** Parents watched their kids' classrooms in real-time and were horrified. ("Wait... *this* is what they do all day?")

**2. Homeschooling lost its stigma.** Overnight, it went from fringe practice to shared cultural experience. ("You can't say 'homeschoolers are weirdos' without a tinge of irony if you yourself were once a homeschooling parent.")

**3. Remote work broke the childcare trap.** If parents work from home, they don't need school as daycare. The default crumbled.

**4. Families migrated to choice-friendly states.** 18 states have implemented universal school choice since 2020. Policy is catching up to culture.

COVID is becoming history. But its fingerprints are still everywhere.

# 3 Tools That Invite Curiosity

[Claire Honeycutt (@HippyMomPhD](https://x.com/HippyMomPhD)), a 20-year classroom teacher turned homeschool mom, compiled some [tools that earn their shelf space](https://www.clarified.life/p/tools-that-build-a-curious-home). Not curricula. Not systems. Just things that shape atmosphere and invite curiosity.

Her top picks:

**National Park Pass ($80/year).** The Junior Ranger program turns every hike into a self-guided nature and history lesson. Bonus: 4th graders get a free pass.

**Anywhere-school backpacks.** Keep them packed with school books. When you want to take learning on the road, there's no friction. "Grab your bags, let's go."

**Build the home library.** "If you do nothing else on this list: build the home library." Books within reach summon learning in ways worksheets never will. It doesn't have to be fancy - just present.

The insight behind all of it: "You don't need a room full of gadgets to build a rich, beautiful life with your kids. You just need a handful of well-chosen tools.

Curiosity can't be forced. But it can be invited.
