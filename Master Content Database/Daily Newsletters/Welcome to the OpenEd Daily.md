## Summary
The world is changing. Education is catching up.

## Content

Welcome to the first edition of the [OpenEd](https://opened.co?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=welcome-to-the-opened-daily&_bhlid=8a517dac3aeddd2f8e339e7c67f5eae68917c11a) Daily! We’re so glad you’re here.

When we launched My Tech High back in 2009, we had a simple question for the first 92 families who enrolled:

‍

#### **"What's your favorite core curriculum for math, English, history, and science?"**

Not only did we get 92 completely different responses, we got different responses *within the same family*.

One mom had chosen a different provider for each of her three girls: Susie enjoyed using ALEKS math; Janie preferred ST Math; and their sister chose a BYU Independent Study math course.

Oh – did I mention that her three daughters were triplets?

That really brought it home: education is not a one-size-fits-all experience. Raising 5 children of our own at the time helped us further realize “our children are not standard.”  We built My Tech High around this vision:

#### **"Customize the world's greatest education plan for your child, and we'll help source it – at no cost to you."**

Fast forward 15 years, with a cumulative enrollment of over 100,000 students later, our core model hasn't changed: education should be as unique as your child. But the world has evolved, and so have the needs and aspirations of our families.

That's why I'm thrilled to introduce you to [OpenEd](https://opened.co?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=welcome-to-the-opened-daily&_bhlid=ffab30a308a34ed90e19c80bfd969f81111ac69d) – the next evolution of My Tech High. We're expanding our mission under a new brand and leadership team to open up a world of possibilities for every kind of learner.

This newsletter is one of those new things!

#### **What to Expect from OpenEd Daily:**

- Practical tips for customizing your child's learning
- Success stories from families like yours
- Deep dives on the latest trends and learning approaches, from preschool through higher education and career pathways

#### As we evolve, we want to keep learning from families in the trenches - you!

First, a quick question for you: Does your child benefit from personalized education?

Reply to this email with just one word – **Yes **or** No**.

With that question in mind, I'd like to pass the mic to Isaac Morehouse, OpenEd's incoming CEO, to share more about this next evolution and why it matters now more than ever.

Matt and Amy Bowman, Co-Founders of OpenEd (formerly My Tech High)

P.S. Don't worry – we aren't going anywhere; we're going to be spending even more time on advocacy as the program grows and improves based on your feedback.

💬 Why OpenEd, Why Now?

As Matt shared, My Tech High's journey began with a simple insight: every child learns differently. Now, as we rebrand to [OpenEd](https://opened.co?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=welcome-to-the-opened-daily&_bhlid=3a15bf17d79c733a7ca755cf7dcad96a3ef33f83), we're doubling down on that truth and expanding our mission.

The world has changed dramatically since 2009. Technology has transformed how we live, work, and learn. Families are demanding more flexibility and choice in their children's education. And a wave of innovative learning models - from microschools to hybrid programs to Education Savings Accounts - is rising to meet that demand.

At OpenEd, we're not just riding this wave; we're helping to create it - with you! We believe the future of education is open, personalized, and learner-driven. It's about empowering each child to learn in the way that works best for them, with the support and resources they need to thrive.

That's why we're expanding our partnerships, developing new tools for families, and advocating for policies that put more power in parents' hands.

## 💡 Lightbulb moment

In the opening podcast, Matt Bowman relays how often he has seen kids struggle with math (or any other subject) only to have their lightbulbs turn on when they finally find the right curriculum that “clicks with their brain.”
