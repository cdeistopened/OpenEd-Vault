And why industry isn't satisfied with the current educational system

## Content

**"What do employers actually want?"**

It's a question that's becoming harder to answer in today's rapidly evolving tech landscape.

As Aaron Osmond, CEO of [**Knowledge Pillars,**](http://knowledge-pillars.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tech-savvy-teens-will-win-the-future) put it in the latest episode of the podcast, **"Industry has not been satisfied with the quality of the education system for decades."**

Ouch.

It used to be that a Computer Science degree was the key to the tech kingdom. Now, the path isn't so clear-cut.

You’ve heard coding boot camps are the way forward.

Then, just when you think you've got it figured out, AI comes along and threatens to code us all out of a job. It's enough to make you want to throw your laptop out the window and take up basket weaving instead.

But before you swap your keyboard for a loom, let's take a step back.

**The tech industry isn't dying; it's evolving – says Osmond.**

And with that evolution comes a shift in what employers are looking for.

Aaron and I started our conversation by discussing the changes we've both seen in the tech world in our careers, but our conversation expanded into much more.

**We ended up covering:**

- The truth about what tech employers really want (it's not just coding skills)
- Why your network might be more valuable than you think (even if you're homeschooled)
- How AI is changing the game (and why hands-on problem-solving is more important than ever)

The days of following a predetermined path to a tech career are over. But here's the good news:** you don't have to wait for the system to catch up.**

Young people can take control of their learning journeys right now.
