## **THE OPTIMIZATION PARADOX**

Too many options can be just as challenging as too few.

In this week's podcast with Robert Gamble and Jonathan Chizick, co-founders of [**SmartPath**](https://smartpath.school/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=silicon-valley-s-education-secret-is-leaking-and-it-s-not-coding), we talk about how open education's greatest strength—endless customization—can become its most overwhelming challenge for many families.

As options multiply, so does the pressure to make the "perfect" choice for your child. Finding the right fit shouldn’t take weeks of research. [**Learn more about the potential shortcut SmartPath is cooking up.**](https://opened.co/blog/smartpath-the-ai-powered-homeschool-curriculum-finder-that-eliminates-decision-fatigue/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=silicon-valley-s-education-secret-is-leaking-and-it-s-not-coding)

## **FOLLOW THE SMART MONEY**

"Many very high net worth individuals are shifting to homeschooling," reveals Robert Gamble in our latest podcast.

They’re not sending their kids to elite private schools anymore. Instead, they're becoming educational architects and customizing their kids’ education. It seems the wealthy are now waking up to something our families have been saying for years: **personalization > standardization.**

"If people with close to unlimited resources are choosing to homeschool their kids, then that tells me that it's probably one of the best routes," Gamble notes.

These wealthy families often hire educational consultants or dedicate significant time to researching the perfect educational fit. But how can we make this level of informed customization accessible to every family… without the fancy consultants?

Apart from programs like [**OpenEd**](https://opened.co/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=silicon-valley-s-education-secret-is-leaking-and-it-s-not-coding), the answer might lie in technology that democratizes what previously required significant time, money, and connections to achieve.

## **SMARTPATH: MAPPING THE EDUCATION LANDSCAPE**

The explosion of educational resources in the last few years has created a new challenge: how can you curate and architect the best education for *your* child from the thousands of teaching resources out there?

"It's crazy how many options are available," explains Jonathan Chizick. "That's tough for a parent to navigate for a decision that's so important. It's your kid's education."

Enter [**SmartPath**](https://smartpath.school/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=silicon-valley-s-education-secret-is-leaking-and-it-s-not-coding), a free AI-powered tool that matches your child's unique learning profile with curriculum recommendations tailored to their needs.

The platform works by collecting information about your child's learning style, interests, and goals, then generates personalized curriculum recommendations in minutes—revealing options many parents might never discover on their own.

While currently focused on curriculum matching, SmartPath plans to expand into helping families discover local learning options as well—from co-ops to micro-schools in your area.

"The fact that I don't even know about things that are two miles from my house, that's an issue," explains Jonathan Chizick. "How do we help parents know what these options are in their neighborhoods?"

WORD OF THE DAY
## DECISION FATIGUE (n.)

The mental exhaustion resulting from making too many choices, depleting your willpower and leading to poor decisions or decision avoidance. First identified by social psychologist Dr. Roy Baumeister, it explains why choosing between 347 homeschool curricula makes even the most dedicated parents consider the merits of unschooling.

**EXAMPLE: **"After three hours of curriculum research, Jessica succumbed to decision fatigue and enrolled her children in 'whatever math program had the prettiest logo.'"

That’s all for today! See you tomorrow.
