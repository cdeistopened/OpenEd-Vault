## **Your brain can't multitask (but here's what it can do)**

Remember being told your brain can juggle multiple things at once? Turns out that's a myth.

[**Cognitive scientist Megan Sumeracki explains**](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/multitasking/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=108-what-happened-in-2012) we *can* multitask! But only when one activity is on autopilot (like walking while listening to a podcast). It’s when we attempt to engage in two activities requiring focused attention that we miss crucial parts of both (like trying to watch two movies simultaneously).

This matters because traditional classrooms often force kids to multitask without realizing it: Taking notes while listening to lectures. Reading slides while processing explanations. Even having a phone nearby (not using it, just nearby) creates a cognitive tax.

## **What happened in 2012? (The “Great Rewiring”)**

Something changed dramatically for young people in the early 2010s. The data is striking:

- Depression and anxiety rose >50%
- Academic achievement reversed decades of steady gains
- Social connection and dating plummeted

So… what happened? Sometime around 2012, [**social psychologist Jonathan Haidt notes**](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/teen-childhood-smartphone-use-mental-health-effects/677722/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=108-what-happened-in-2012), smartphones went from luxury to necessity. Social lives moved online; constant connection became the norm.

We're not just seeing "kids these days" struggling – we're witnessing the first generation to grow up with ***perpetual digital connection***, and their development looks fundamentally different.

This isn't about demonizing technology (it’s here to stay). It's about recognizing that how we structure learning environments matters more than ever.

🛠️ TOOL
## **Using rewards strategically**
[***Read the full tweet***](https://x.com/NielsHoven/status/1874913708025303190?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=108-what-happened-in-2012)
‍**A common trap in education: **Creating reward systems that frame learning as "the bad thing I need to get paid to do."

Instead, try a framework from education innovator Niels Hoven:

Use ***temporary*** rewards strategically when at least one of the following criteria applies:

1. The activity becomes more fun with practice
2. The skill becomes easier with time
3. You're building initial momentum

**Real example**: Temporary rewards for ski lessons until the natural thrill of skiing takes over.

Think of it as a jumpstart, not a bribe. The goal is to help them discover what naturally motivates them.

The best reward is discovering you don't need the reward anymore.
🤓 **(TRIVIA) OF THE DAY**
## **Q: In what year did the first iPhone come out?**

(Hint: It was before things went sideways in 2012...)

Answer: ㄥ00ᄅ 'ㄣ ʎlnſ

Fun fact: When Steve Jobs unveiled it, he actually presented it as three revolutionary products: "A widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough Internet communications device." Then he revealed it was all one device. The audience went wild.

That’s all for today!
