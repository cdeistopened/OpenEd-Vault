### 💡 THOUGHT: MODEL T EDUCATION FAILS MODEL Y HUMANS

**STANDARDIZATION: GREAT FOR CARS, AWFUL FOR KIDS**

Todd Rose escaped a 0.9 GPA to become a Harvard professor with a revelation: our education system treats unique humans like interchangeable Model Ts.

"We've standardized everything," Rose explains, "what kind of jobs are valued, what we should aspire to, and how we do it."

It's efficient—just like Ford's assembly line. It's also completely backward.

"People's individuality is not selfishness," Rose insists. "That distinctiveness is everything."

The manufacturing mindset creates schools with "a singular goal: prepare kids for college." The casualties? Everything that makes learning meaningful: "We don't care what kids care about, we don't care about teaching the value of work that's meaningful."

Imagine designing education around humans rather than factories—celebrating differences instead of smoothing them away. Crazy idea: what if schools adapted to children instead of forcing children to adapt to schools?

### 🔨 TOOL: MONUMENT VALLEY

**THE GAME THAT TEACHES FRUSTRATION IMMUNITY**

What do you do when your 5-year-old gets "very frustrated and impatient" with a puzzle game?

Most parents might put the iPad away. Education researcher @gt_dad had a different response: "Makes me want to give her more video games. Good for getting over feeling stuck and incapable."

Monument Valley accidentally teaches something most schools actively avoid: how to push through frustration to breakthrough.

In this award-winning puzzle game ($3.99 on iOS/Android), players manipulate impossible architecture to navigate mind-bending worlds. Unlike traditional education, it creates a space where:

- Failure comes with beautiful visuals and soothing sounds, not red ink
- Every puzzle guarantees a solution (persistence always pays off)
- There's no penalty for multiple attempts
- The reward is the satisfaction of figuring it out, not external validation

The video game to real-world accomplishment pipeline? It might just run through learning to handle being stuck—and pushing forward anyway.

### 📊 TREND: EDUCATION'S BREAKING POINT

**THE END OF EDUCATION MONOPOLIES**

A seismic shift is underway: 40% of American students no longer attend their assigned neighborhood schools.

According to Harvard innovation expert Michael Horn, we're witnessing the first true disruption of K-12 education after decades of resistance. The catalyst? Families gaining direct control of education funding through choice programs.

This isn't just another education reform—it's fundamentally rewiring the power dynamics:

- When families control education dollars, they weigh value vs. cost for the first time
- Innovation emerges from the bottom up as providers compete to serve families
- Customized learning becomes financially viable at scale
- The "free" public school illusion fades as opportunity costs become visible

The most striking statistic: While college enrollment declines, alternatives are experiencing unprecedented growth. Technical education enrollment is up 32%, apprenticeship programs have doubled since 2020, and homeschooling has tripled from pre-pandemic levels.

For families seeking personalized learning, this shift means more options and resources than ever before—if you know where to look.

### TRIVIA OF THE DAY

**THE PUZZLE THAT STUMPED Ph.D.s**

You're on a game show with three doors. Behind one is a car; behind the others are goats. You pick Door #1.

The host (who knows what's behind each door) opens Door #3, revealing a goat.

Should you:
A) Stick with Door #1
B) Switch to Door #2
C) It doesn't matter—the odds are the same

The answer (and why thousands of mathematicians got it wrong) in tomorrow's newsletter!
