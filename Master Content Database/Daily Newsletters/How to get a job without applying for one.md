## Summary
How an 18-year-old landed a tech career without applying. PLUS: A playbook for the other path—getting into college.

## Content

**Greetings!**

Today we're talking about a story that feels like it shouldn't be possible. An 18-year-old with no degree just landed a full-time job in tech sales.

He never submitted a resume.

Let's dive in.

**THOUGHT: **From the source**
TREND: **The Inbound Job Offer**
TOOL: **The College-Bound Playbook

# From the Source

"Someone who's in school their whole life... they go to college and then they're like 24, then they get to work. Then they get to figure out what they like to do. I already know what I want to do and now I'm 18 and doing it."

– Kade Hinkle

# The Inbound Job Offer

Kade Hinkle didn't get his job by submitting a resume. He created the sales industry calls an inbound opportunity.

After months of networking on LinkedIn, he made a single, authentic post: ["Hey I'm 18, just graduated high school, ready to work. I'm hungry, ready to fail... DM me some numbers I can call."](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kadehinkle_im-actively-seeking-an-sdrbdr-role-i-activity-7338697163973058560-4OLI?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAEl7jKgB836oApdm64_DH4kKGWK_vMPVK-8)

That post got seen by a colleague of his future manager. Soon he had an inbound interview request. Two weeks later, after a skills test that involved mock calls and writing sample emails, he had an offer. [He didn't ask for permission; he created proof and let the job come to him](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369434788132208640).

# The College-Bound Playbook

Kade's path is one way to win. For those on the traditional college path, the game is different, but the principle of creating proof is the same.

Our friends at [Prisma wrote the definitive guide for homeschoolers getting into college](https://www.joinprisma.com/blog/how-do-homeschoolers-get-into-college). Here are the key takeaways:

1. **Build a "Spiky" Portfolio:** Colleges are tired of "well-rounded." They want kids with a deep, demonstrated passion in one area. A simple portfolio website showcasing projects is the best way to prove it.
2. **Treat the Transcript as a Story:** You have the power to craft a transcript that tells a unique story, not just a list of courses. Plan it from the start of high school.
3. **Lean into Standardized Tests:** For non-traditional students, the SAT/ACT is a crucial, objective data point that validates your entire application. Don't skip it.
