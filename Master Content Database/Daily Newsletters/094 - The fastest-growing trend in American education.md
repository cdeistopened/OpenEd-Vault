## **The Public is Catching Up**

[**Dr. Phil recently just called it "the fastest growing trend in American education."**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S98fZa6Bh1Y&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=094-the-fastest-growing-trend-in-american-education) But the real trend is visible in the comments section of his recent episode on “unschooling," where dozens of former skeptics are saying: "Wait... maybe those parents were right all along."

The segment featured a family living on a farm, where the children learned through immersive experiences - from building fairy villages (geometry) to managing fires and caring for livestock.

"I'm a former public school teacher with a Master's Degree in Education," wrote one viewer. "I left teaching in 2021... and I believe without a shadow of a doubt that unschooling is the future of education."

Another commenter noted, "We live in a day and age where information is free... It's up to us as parents to take our children's education into our own hands."

Of course, when this family first shared their unschooling journey on social media, the trolls came out: "Educational neglect!" "Save these children!" But their fury only proved the point: When you challenge people's assumptions about learning, you discover how deeply those assumptions run.

Unschooling might be perfect for some families, while others thrive with more structure. What matters is finding what works for your child.

## **Train Your Brain: A Mom's Review of Infinite Mind**

"If you're a reader, you can learn anything," says Sonja, a mother of four boys who used [**Infinite Mind (formerly eyeQ)**](https://infinitemind.io/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=094-the-fastest-growing-trend-in-american-education) with her children. "And after [using the program], you're an amazing reader."

Unlike traditional speed reading programs focusing on pacing exercises, Infinite Mind takes a "whole brain" approach. Through a mix of reading therapy, vision exercises, and brain-training games, it aims to strengthen the connection between both sides of the brain.

The sweet spot seems to be around fourth grade – that crucial time when kids decide if they're going to "really care about school or just slide through," as Sonja puts it. Ten years later, her son still credits the program for his academic success and is using it again to prepare for college.

**Key Features:**

- 7-minute daily brain training sessions
- Combines reading, visual, and brain-strengthening exercises
- Available as a mobile app

The program costs around $199 for a lifetime license (accessible at no cost via OpenEd).
