### 💡 DEEP DIVE

## **THE CASE FOR MORE (OF THE RIGHT) SCREENS**

According to [***The Wall Street Journal***](https://archive.is/RCVto?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-case-for-more-screens#selection-1868.0-4977.49), students now spend an average of **98 minutes daily** on school-issued devices. In 6th grade, it's over **2 hours and 20 minutes**—more than a third of the school day.

Parents and teachers are worried. Comment sections fill with fear:

"Screens are the new smoking."

"It's the end of the world as we know it."

But [**Outschool founder and CEO Amir Nathoo **](https://opened.co/blog/dont-limit-screentime?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-case-for-more-screens)offers a crucial distinction most miss: **Not all screen time is created equal.**

"Just watching YouTube is completely different from building a virtual world or learning a tool," he explains.

The difference is visible in the children themselves:

"If a kid spends an hour watching YouTube videos, they have a different look on their face and need a few minutes to detox," OpenEd CEO Isaac Morehouse observed after watching his son complete an [**Outschool “Modding with Minecraft,”**](https://outschool.com/classes/modding-with-minecraft-beginner-modding-ages-9-13-xiE0ykkw?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-case-for-more-screens) and coming away brimming with creativity and excitement.

“You could not convince me that was a bad use of screen time," Morehouse said.

This connects with what Nathoo calls "networked schooling"—connecting children with specialized teachers and learning experiences across platforms rather than relying on a single institution.

Of course, we have a name for this too: *open education.*

The box is closed if you're in one school all day, every day. Anyone doing two or more education approaches has opened the box, even if just a crack.

The irony? While we worry about kids' screen time, it's often adults who model the worst habits.

As Nathoo observes, "We blame our kids for our issues," with Morehouse adding he's seen parents in their thirties and forties on their phones the whole time at kids’ soccer games.

The solution isn't necessarily fewer screens—it's better ones, used more intentionally.

### 🔍 THOUGHTS WE'RE PONDERING

#### **THE WORTH TEST FOR COLLEGE**

[**When a young woman told Dave Ramsey**](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI_v7FdJzZ3/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-case-for-more-screens) she wanted to attend an out-of-state university (tripling her cost) because "It's a pretty town," his response was blunt: "That would be known as stupid."

The college debate isn't yes/no—it's about value. "Think about what you'll get for what you pay. Is this in your budget? Am I getting quality for what I'm paying?"

#### **THE LEGO LESSON**

Like LEGO's interchangeable blocks that build almost anything, open education provides simple, flexible building blocks for learning. As Matt and Isaac [**write in their upcoming book**](https://opened.co/book/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-case-for-more-screens), "The key isn't finding every possible resource—it's identifying the right ones for your child's interests and needs."

#### **BEYOND SIDES**

The wisest families don't pick sides—they pick what works. Public, private, hybrid, homeschool, unschool... There's no right tribe. Only right fit.

### 🛠️ TOOLS OF THE WEEK

#### **MONEY SKILLS SCHOOLS DON'T TEACH**

[**Ramsey Solutions' homeschool curriculum**](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/education/homeschool?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-case-for-more-screens) is coming to the OpenEd marketplace! This program for grades 8-12 teaches saving, budgeting, debt avoidance, and investment basics—skills most adults learn only after making costly mistakes.

#### **THE BOOK THAT CALMS PARENTS' BIGGEST FEAR**

Every day Isaac talks to parents worried about their children being "on track." Dr. Peter Gray's [***Free to Learn***](https://www.amazon.com/Free-Learn-Unleashing-Instinct-Self-Reliant/dp/0465025994?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-case-for-more-screens) consistently blows their minds. If children with no formal instruction can learn reading and math, then your child doing a twice-weekly co-op certainly can! Everyone needs this perspective.

#### **THE WEIRD AND WONDERFUL WORLD OF OUTSCHOOL**

When Isaac's son wanted to learn Minecraft modding, he found a six-week [**Outschool**](https://outschool.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-case-for-more-screens) class. The result? His son learned to create custom blocks and ended up teaching Isaac.

Here are three classes you'd never find in traditional school:

- **Cryptozoology: Do Mythical Animals Exist?** - Kids practice critical thinking by analyzing "evidence" of creatures like Bigfoot, learning media literacy through monster hunting.
- **Cook Like a Wizard** - Harry Potter fans make Exploding Bon Bons and Pumpkin Pasties, combining math, chemistry, and following instructions.
- **Escape from Math Mystery Mountain** - Solving for X feels more urgent when you're trapped on a virtual mountain with only math problems as your escape.
