💡 THOUGHT
## **Agency Starts Earlier Than You Think**

Be careful infantilizing your kids – even the infants.

A [**recent article in *Getting Smart *claims that* *even 9-month-old babies show more agency**](https://www.gettingsmart.com/2025/01/23/agency-for-nine-month-olds-yes/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=baby-agency-transforming-screen-time-128) when you:

- Let them initiate interactions
- Respond to their cues
- Give them choices

Don't wait for "school age" to respect their learning capacity.

## **New Study: The Secret to Making Tech Work in Education**

While many parents worry about screen time, a [**new study from Bath Spa University (it’s legit - we checked) and Liberty University**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11159-023-10041-x?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=baby-agency-transforming-screen-time-128) found that when children are given agency in their learning, they develop different relationships with technology:

- They tend to use devices for active learning rather than passive consumption
- They naturally develop digital literacy through interest-driven projects
- They find ways to collaborate with other learners across distances

The key finding wasn't about the technology itself - it was about the learning environment. When students are given the freedom to pursue their interests, technology becomes a tool for exploration rather than just task completion.
🔨 TOOL
## **Want to transform how your child uses technology?**

Try these 3 shifts:

1. Let them choose topics that fascinate them
2. Show them how technology can help explore those interests
3. Connect them with other learners who share their passions

That’s all for today!
