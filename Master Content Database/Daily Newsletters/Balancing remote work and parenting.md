### 💡 THOUGHT

## **THE PRESENCE PARADOX**

It started with a simple prompt in our #teachers-bulletin-board on Slack… Megan asked: "How do *you* make it work with kids at home?"

What followed was a masterclass in collective parenting wisdom on the topic of "being present" with our children.

Turns out, the "always be present" mantra might not tell the full story. Our teachers aren't trying to be everywhere at once—they're creating clear boundaries followed by undivided attention.

As Liz put it: "I try to be VERY present when not working. So we are actively doing lessons, playing a game (no phone or computer near me), cooking together, whatever it is so that I don’t feel as bad when I do need to be looking at a phone/computer even while they are there.”

**Translation**: Quality beats quantity every time.

But here's the plot twist: When those boundaries inevitably collapse (like when Jordan's 3-year-old son chose her big presentation moment for an epic meltdown) something unexpected happens.

Instead of disaster, a colleague offered this consolation: "I love when people can see your kids, it humanizes us."

So, how do *you* work from home? Reply to this email with your answers!

### 📊 TREND

## **WORKSPACE REIMAGINED**

Move over treadmill desks… The greatest workplace innovation of 2025 is happening in minivans, gymnastics studios, and swimming pool bleachers.

Working parents have stopped fighting geography and started turning every waiting moment into an opportunity for productivity.

Hayley's approach is simple: "Our local gymnastics place has open gym every week for 2 hours, and I just sit there and work while they play."

Julie reclaims transit time while her husband drives.

We’re witnessing a reimagining of the work "day" as a series of strategic sprints that fit *around* the family’s schedule, not despite it.

### 🔨 TOOL

## **THE ENGAGEMENT ARSENAL**

The most effective working parents aren't just managing time—they're building systems that make their work periods the highlight of their kids' day. Their secret arsenal:

**1. The Special-Occasion Activities Box**

Nicole's approach is brilliant: "I have a box full of things she does when I am working, and that is the only time that box comes out. It makes it a little more exciting for her. Some of the things that it includes are puzzles, books, kinetic sand, bubbles, Leapfrog tablet, lacing animals, etc."

*Why it works: This limitation creates anticipation rather than deprivation.*

**2. The Mess-Permitted Zone**

Rachael harnesses children's love of sensory activities: "I set up a fun activity ahead that I know will keep them occupied like bubble foam, mud pit in the yard, kinetic sand, etc. They make a mess, but it buys me an hour of time to work completely uninterrupted."

Emily shared one of Rachael's brilliant hacks: "get dry erase markers and have them make a masterpiece on the washer or dryer!"

*Why it works: When mess is part of the plan, everyone wins.*

**3. The Independence Builder**

Hayley shares a game-changing strategy: "A huge flex was teaching them to make their own lunches since a lot of meetings/events fall during those hours."

Tammy leverages technology: "We make good use of our Alexa. They add items to the shopping list (better to be on the Alexa list than languishing in mom's memory!) and we use it as an intercom."

Becca establishes clear communication: "if mom's door is closed, she is probably on a Zoom call and they need to wait until it is opened."

*Why it works: Far beyond just "keeping kids busy," these strategies teach crucial life skills that serve families long after work hours end.*

Again, what strategies do *you *use to balance work and parenting?
