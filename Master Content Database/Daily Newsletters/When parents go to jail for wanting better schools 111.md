## **When Your Address Matters More Than Your Aspirations**

"I remember my mother and grandmother having this conversation about whose address we might use so I could attend Mount Royal," [**50CAN**](https://50can.org/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=when-parents-go-to-jail-for-wanting-better-schools-111) President Derrell Bradford recalls with a knowing smile. "Looking back now, I realize - that was highly illegal. But it was also deeply subversive in an important way."

Bradford, now a leading voice in education reform, breaks down how families typically access school choice:

"There are really just four ways: You're lucky. You're connected. You're rich enough to buy in the right neighborhood or pay tuition. Or you lie - which is how most families actually do it."

His conclusion is stark: **"A system that prioritizes a child's address over their aspirations is not one I aspire to."**

## **Zoning Out: Schools Drop the ZIP Code Game**

In 2011, [**Ohio mom Kelley Williams-Bolar spent 10 days in jail**](https://availabletoall.org/report-when-good-parents-go-to-jail/?et_fb=1&PageSpeed=off&utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=when-parents-go-to-jail-for-wanting-better-schools-111). Her crime? Using her father's address to enroll her daughters in a better school district.

In nearly half of U.S. states, parents can face criminal prosecution – including jail time – for using a different address to access better schools. Some districts even hire private investigators to track down families they believe "don't belong."

But the tide is turning. States are finally recognizing that a child's potential shouldn't be limited by their postal code. Here's what's happening:

- [**Colorado: More than 199,000 students (28% of public school enrollment) now attend schools outside their assigned zones**](https://www.the74million.org/article/last-year-200k-colorado-kids-used-open-enrollment-to-pick-their-district-school/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=when-parents-go-to-jail-for-wanting-better-schools-111)
- Florida: 273,000 students use open enrollment to choose their schools
- Arizona: All districts must accept transfer students tuition-free, with buses allowed to cross district lines

Instead of criminalizing parents for seeking better opportunities, we should be breaking down the barriers that force them to make such desperate choices in the first place.🛠️ TOOL
