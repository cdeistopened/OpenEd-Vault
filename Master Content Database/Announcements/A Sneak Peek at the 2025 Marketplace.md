You may have heard ([or read](https://opened.co/announcements/a-new-approach-to-curriculum-access/)!) about our new approach to curriculum access — a dynamic **marketplace of resources** coming to the OpenEd platform for the 2025-2026 program year. Today, I’m thrilled to take it one step further and give you a **sneak peek** at what’s inside!

## **More Flexibility, Less Stress**

We’ve been working closely with curriculum providers to lock in **pre-order pricing**, helping your wallet go further while giving you more options and less pressure. Just the way it should be.

🗓️ **Pre-order pricing is guaranteed through July 31, 2025, **so now’s a great time to start exploring!

[**Click here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18BQIxqBZ-urOMASfpgq7xKoDgF9Poj8t/view?usp=sharing) to review our sneak peek. Each resource is linked so you can:

- Browse provider sites
- Set up preview accounts (when available)
- Get a feel for which tools fit your students best

The marketplace offers everything from full curriculum packages to enrichment add-ons, with the freedom to **mix, match, and personalize** your child’s education plan. Go ahead and take a look!

**Important Reminder!** With OpenEd, **you’re never limited to marketplace options**. You can always choose the tools that work best for your student — whether it’s from our marketplace or not.

Our goal? To be a strong partner in making **access easier and more affordable**.

**Have Feedback or Questions? **Send us a note at [help@opened.co](mailto:help@opened.co). We share every message with our Curriculum Team. Your voice directly shapes what comes next.

Thank you for being part of this journey. The 2025-26 program year is already shaping up to be our biggest (and best!) yet, and we’re so glad you’re with us.
