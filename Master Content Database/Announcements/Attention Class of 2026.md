**Attention High School Students!**

For 15 years, OpenEd has brought you innovative high school options – but for too long, you’ve been restricted to an either/or experience. That’s why we’re reimagining what open education means for your high school experience.

For all high school students who complete the program, we’re excited to provide you with an **OpenEd Certificate of Completion**. The OpenEd Certificate represents the culmination of a student’s achievement in the most flexible, student-tailored education program in the world and can be used to mark an important milestone for OpenEd students.

Looking for additional ways to document or certify your student’s learning? We’ve got you covered. From transcripts to portfolio reviews, we offer a variety of customizable options—so you can mix, match, and make it work for your family.

### + OpenEd Endorsements

Submit a portfolio demonstrating skills mastery and life experiences in a predetermined area of focus. Standard endorsements will be available in areas such as technology, entrepreneurship, and service. Students will also have the opportunity to define their own endorsement pathways and demonstrate personal achievement.

### + Industry Certification

Demonstrate real-world skills acquisition through industry certification preparation courses and exams. Select from options available in the OpenEd Marketplace, including certifications in Adobe, Microsoft, cyber security, project management, and communication. You can also use available resource balances toward the certifications that are unavailable in the Marketplace.

### + State Certified Diploma

Receive a diploma certified by your student’s School of Enrollment and recognized by the state board of education. This includes completing a minimum number of credits selected from a catalog of courses approved for the certified diploma program and satisfying all other graduation requirements. Students participating in the certified diploma program will work directly with a Certified Diploma Specialist to blend these traditional education requirements into an open education experience.

### + Early College Options

Get a head start on college credits with options available in the OpenEd Marketplace, including SNHU-CBE, Ignite Learning, OC Online, and Bottega University. Additionally, students may use available resource balances toward technical colleges and universities unavailable in the Marketplace.

And the good news doesn’t stop there. The class of 2026 will be our first ever class invited to attend a commencement event to honor their open education journey. What we’ll intentionally lack in pomp, we’ll more than make up for with our unique ability to put each student at the center of their own experience. If you have any ideas about how you’d like to celebrate, you can reach out to our head of Student Engagement directly at [bclukey@opened.co](mailto:bclukey@opened.co). She’ll work to design your graduation exactly the way you picture it.

Class of 2026, buckle up. It’s going to be an incredible journey.
