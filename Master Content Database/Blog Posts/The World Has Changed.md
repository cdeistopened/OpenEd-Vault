## Summary
Education Is Catching Up.

Today, I'm thrilled to announce that My Tech High, the pioneering education company founded by Matt and Amy Bowman in 2009, is [rebranding as OpenEd.](https://opened.co/my-tech-high)

For 15 years, the Bowmans have been at the forefront of personalized learning. Their powerful idea - letting families find the best education for their kids, free of cost - has grown from 92 families in the first year to serving over 100,000 students cumulatively across multiple states, all through partnerships with innovative public and charter schools.

This explosive growth reflects a seismic shift in K-12 education. No longer are parents limited to the local public school, private academies, or homeschooling. They're now mixing and matching from a buffet of options, creating custom learning journeys for each child.

Homeschooling has doubled in five years, but that's only part of the story. Microschools and learning pods are exploding in popularity nationwide. This is thanks in part to the rise of Education Savings Accounts (ESAs) – state-led initiatives empower families to direct education funds to tutoring, courses, materials, and tuition at participating schools. Many of these models trace their genesis back to the My Tech High model pioneered by the Bowmans.

**Amid this transformation, OpenEd's philosophy remains clear and constant:**

1. Every student learns differently, and that's a strength, not a weakness.
2. Education should fit the student, not the other way around.
3. Real-world skills are as important as traditional academics.
4. Technology should enhance learning, not replace human connection.

These principles drive everything we do. Our mission is to open up every educational option to every learner, making education as unique as each child.

Through our district partnerships, students access world-class curricula, courses, and experiences from the comfort of home, at no cost to families. But we're not pushing a single model. We're championing choice, tearing down the barriers between traditional schools, homeschooling, and alternative education. Public, private, charter, homeschool, unschool - we say ‘yes’ to it all.

**As OpenEd, we're dreaming even bigger:**

- Expanding to more states, bringing personalized learning to more families
- Creating tools to help parents navigate the growing options landscape
- Partnering with more districts to provide customized learning to all students, regardless of income
- Pioneering hybrid learning models for ESA states, balancing structure and flexibility

The open education revolution offers unprecedented freedom and flexibility. But with choice comes challenges. From managing screen time to fostering social engagement, we're committed to equipping families with the tools and guidance to harness edtech's power without being overwhelmed by it.

Matt and Amy's vision has always transcended education - it's about empowering families to shape their children's futures. As OpenEd, we're doubling down on that mission.

Join us at [OpenEd.co](https://opened.co) and help write this exciting new chapter in learning.

Onward and upward!
