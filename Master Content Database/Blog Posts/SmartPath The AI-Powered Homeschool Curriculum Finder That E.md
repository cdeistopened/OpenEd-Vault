When you first decided to homeschool, you probably didn't realize the most challenging part wouldn't be teaching—it would be choosing *what* to teach.

The homeschool curriculum marketplace has exploded in recent years. Parents now face thousands of options across dozens of teaching philosophies, making the simple question of "what should my child learn?" surprisingly complex.

"It's crazy how many options are available," explains Jonathan Chizick, co-founder of [SmartPath](https://smartpath.school/). "That's tough for a parent to navigate for a decision that's so important. It's your kid's education."

This overwhelming array of choices leads to what experts call "decision fatigue"—the deteriorating quality of decisions after making too many of them. As [Simple Homeschool](https://simplehomeschool.net/decision-fatigue/) notes, "By now enough studies have proven that making decisions is exhausting, and as a homeschooling mom, you're probably making a whole lot more of them than you realize."

## The Silicon Valley Education Secret (Now Available to Everyone)

There's a quiet revolution happening in education, especially among tech elites and Silicon Valley investors.

"Many very high net worth individuals are shifting to homeschooling," reveals Robert Gamble, SmartPath co-founder. "Especially amongst Silicon Valley types and the venture capital crowd—their kids are not going to public school. They're not going to private school either."

This trend has been growing for years. As [Wired reported](https://www.wired.com/2015/02/silicon-valley-home-schooling/) back in 2015, "There is a way of thinking within the tech and startup community where you look at the world and go, 'Is the way we do things now really the best way to do it?'"

These families with nearly unlimited resources often hire educational consultants to design personalized learning plans for their children. Why? Because they understand that personalization beats standardization every time.

"If people with close to unlimited resources are choosing to homeschool their kids, then that tells me that it's probably one of the best routes," Gamble notes.

But what about families without connections to professional educational consultants or the time to research countless curriculum options? That's where SmartPath comes in.

## What is SmartPath?

SmartPath is a free AI-powered tool that matches your child's unique learning profile with curriculum recommendations tailored to their specific needs and your family's situation.

Think of it as having a personal educational consultant at your fingertips—one that can process and compare hundreds of curriculum options in minutes rather than the weeks it might take you to research on your own.

The platform works by collecting key information about:

- Your child's learning style and preferences
- Their interests and strengths
- Your educational goals and philosophy
- Practical constraints like budget and time
- Your preferred format (online, textbook, hands-on, etc.)

From there, SmartPath's sophisticated algorithm generates personalized curriculum recommendations that align with your child's unique needs—no more sifting through endless Facebook groups, homeschool blogs, or convention materials trying to find the perfect fit.

## How SmartPath Works: A Simple 3-Step Process

Getting started with SmartPath is refreshingly straightforward:

1. **Fill out a simple questionnaire** about your child and your homeschooling needs (takes about 5-10 minutes)
2. **Receive tailored curriculum recommendations** based on your child's learning style, interests, and your family's preferences
3. **Explore your matched options** with direct links to learn more about each recommended curriculum

The questionnaire is designed to be flexible—you can provide basic information for quick recommendations or dive deeper with more detailed responses for even more personalized results.

## The Minds Behind SmartPath

SmartPath was created by Jonathan Chizick and Robert Gamble, two tech professionals who understand the challenges of navigating educational choices.

Jonathan experienced the curriculum overwhelm firsthand when transitioning his children from public school to homeschooling. Despite his research skills, he discovered that finding the right educational fit was unnecessarily time-consuming and complex.

"The fact that I don't even know about things that are two miles from my house, that's an issue," Chizick shares from personal experience. "How do we help parents know what these options are in their neighborhoods?"

Robert brings his extensive background in business operations and data analytics to ensure the platform delivers truly personalized recommendations. His interest in homeschooling was sparked after seeing the excellent outcomes achieved by well-educated homeschool families.

Together, they've created a tool that democratizes access to personalized education—bringing the advantages previously available only to families with significant resources to everyone, regardless of budget or connections.

## Beyond Curriculum: Future Expansions

While currently focused on curriculum matching, SmartPath plans to expand into helping families discover local learning options as well—from co-ops to micro-schools in your area.

This broader vision addresses another common challenge for homeschooling families: finding community resources that complement your home education approach.

## SmartPath + OpenEd: The Perfect Combination for Homeschooling Success

While SmartPath helps you identify the ideal curriculum for your child's unique needs, [OpenEd](https://opened.co) provides the support system to implement it effectively.
