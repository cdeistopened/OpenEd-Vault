## Summary
A Living List

## Content

Welcome to our ever-growing collection of educational resources, curated by the OpenEd community!

This list is a testament to the diverse, creative, and passionate approaches our families take to education.

When we asked for your favorite resources, we were amazed by the response. From blogs to YouTube channels, Instagram accounts to podcasts, you've shared a wealth of inspiration that spans all aspects of learning and child development.

This list isn't about promoting "influencers" or prescribing a one-size-fits-all approach. Instead, it's a buffet of options for you to explore, mix, and match as you craft the perfect educational journey for your unique learners.

Whether you're looking for hands-on science experiments, literature-based curricula, outdoor adventure inspiration, or strategies for neurodivergent learners, you'll find something here to spark your interest.

Remember, this list is a work in progress, just like education itself. We've organized the resources into categories for easy browsing, but feel free to jump around and discover new favorites.

Don't see your go-to resource listed? This list is always growing! Email [cdeist@opened.co](mailto:cdeist@opened.co) to suggest additions at any time.

Happy exploring, and here's to the joy of lifelong learning!
