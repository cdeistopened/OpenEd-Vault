## Summary
College without a high school diploma? Yes! Learn alternative paths including early college credits, portfolios, and non-traditional routes to success.

## Content

Last week, we received an email from a parent, Joanna, who was grappling with a familiar dilemma:

I would love resources about college after homeschool/online school. My student did 9th grade last year on the diploma path, but we are planning to do non-diploma-seeking status this year. My child needs options and flexibility more than we felt was available on the diploma seeking path. However, I worry a lot about not following the traditional, earn a diploma and go to college path. I would love help specific to college and/or other training when doing school through OpenEd.

Joanna is not alone. Many parents struggle with this decision, and society has long pushed a linear path:
**High school diploma → college degree → good job → success!**
But as education and work evolve, so must our approach to preparing kids for the future.

### **The New Landscape of Post-High School Options**

The four-year degree isn't the only path to success anymore. The options have multiplied.

Several experiences shared in a recent student panel discussion highlight this:

- Elise earned an associate's degree through Southern New Hampshire University while in high school.
- Jordan, a ballet dancer, found non-diploma seeking gave him flexibility “to fit in as much educational work as I wanted while still managing a ballet life.”
- Then there's Olivia, who started a business breeding hypoallergenic dogs at age 15, earning $30,000 in profit within six months – more than her parents had ever made in a year.

“I've gotten my associate's degree through Southern New Hampshire University. It has been a huge help to me in my educational journey."

**Success in the 21st century isn't about following a preset path.** It's about aligning your education with individual talents, interests, and goals.

Still, Joana’s question remains: How do you prepare for college when you're not on the traditional diploma-seeking path?

First, let's dispel a myth:

### **A high school diploma isn't always necessary for college admission.**

Contrary to common fears, a non-traditional high school path doesn't close these doors either. Colleges and universities *want* diverse experiences and skills that students from alternative educational backgrounds bring to their campuses.

Many colleges accept alternatives such as a GED or a well-documented homeschool transcript. What matters more is demonstrating your readiness for college-level work.

Here's how some successful non-traditional students have done it:

1. **Build a Compelling Portfolio:** It's crucial to maintain detailed records of all educational activities, projects, and achievements in lieu of a traditional diploma.

Destiny, another student on our panel, shared that the flexibility afforded by OpenEd allowed her to pursue projects and experiences that showcased her skills and interests more effectively than a transcript ever could.

2. **Leverage Early College Credits:** Remember Elise? Her associate's degree is proof positive that she can handle college-level coursework. Even without pursuing a diploma, students can access early college credit options. For instance:

- Bottega University offers a Full-Stack Development Certificate worth 18 university credits.
- Southern New Hampshire University provides competency-based education programs in various fields.
- OC Online through Oklahoma Christian University offers competency-based courses.
3. **Standardized Tests Still Matter:** While some colleges are moving away from requiring SAT or ACT scores, these tests can still be a valuable tool for homeschoolers to demonstrate their academic abilities on a standardized scale.

4. **Embrace Your Uniqueness:** Jordan's dedication to ballet alongside his studies shows a level of discipline and time management that many traditional students struggle to develop. Colleges value these soft skills just as much as academic prowess.

*For diploma-seekers, note the required Civics Test administered by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

### **But what if traditional college isn't the goal?**

The beauty of the non-diploma-seeking path is that it opens up a world of alternatives outside of college:

- **Vocational Training:** For hands-on learners, programs in everything from culinary arts to cybersecurity offer direct paths to lucrative careers.
- **Apprenticeships:** Many industries, particularly in the trades, offer paid apprenticeships that lead to well-paying, stable careers.
- **Entrepreneurship:** Olivia's dog breeding business is just one example. With the right skills and mindset, starting a business can be a viable alternative to college.
- **Gap Year Programs:** Structured gap years can provide valuable life experience and clarity about future goals.

While the options may seem overwhelming, tools like the "Own It!" mini-course can help students navigate their unique educational paths. This 10-unit course offers a journey of self-discovery that goes beyond academic planning.

Students engage with:

1. Interactive video scenarios that challenge their problem-solving skills
2. Personality reflections to understand their strengths and preferences
3. Mindset skills instruction to develop resilience and adaptability

Perhaps most importantly, Own It! helps you generates a unique student profile that showcases:

- Career interests
- Learning-style preferences
- Key skills to develop

This profile becomes a roadmap for students, parents, and educators to tailor the educational experience. The Own It! program is available by request for OpenEd students through InfoCenter. Just reach out to your homeroom teacher or the parent support team to get started.

In closing, let's circle back to Joanna's worries about "not following the traditional path."

The reality is that the definition of a "traditional path" is becoming more and more slippery. Colleges and employers want skills, experiences, and the ability to learn over credentials.

Approach education as a canvas for growth, not a checklist of requirements. Whether that growth happens in a classroom, online, through an apprenticeship, or via self-directed projects is less important than the fact that it happens at all.
