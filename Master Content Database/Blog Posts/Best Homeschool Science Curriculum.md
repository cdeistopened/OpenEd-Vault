## Summary
Best Homeschool Science Curriculum | OpenEd

## Content

Science has the potential to be the most exciting subject of all. It's literally the study of how the world works.

So why do so many students find it boring?

Adam Savage, the former MythBusters host, [diagnosed the disconnect with painful accuracy](https://www.tiktok.com/@openedhq/video/7493709540093971754): "When we teach kids that science and math and engineering are all things to memorize, we're missing the point. These are unfettered landscapes of the untried and the untested."

He points out that we call these "fields" of learning because they are inherently open-ended—ripe for curious minds to explore and discover.

At [OpenEd](https://www.notion.so/OED-Tues-Nov-11-2a7afe52ef5980c8bce8dc5dd9e7d490?pvs=21), we've watched thousands of families rebuild their relationship with science. Our team of teachers has seen patterns emerge: programs that spark wonder, kits that engage reluctant learners, and free resources that make high-quality science accessible to everyone.

This guide gathers the most-loved recommendations from our teachers and families—tested, hands-on, and grounded in real success stories. You'll find programs organized by type and by grade level, along with honest trade-offs families navigate, and high-quality free resources that rival paid curricula. Throughout, we'll stay grounded in one goal: not to get through the material, but to keep *wonder* alive.

## Understanding Homeschool Science Curriculum

The way science is taught in most schools is backwards.

[Jack Casdorph](https://opened.co/blog/have-we-been-teaching-stem-completely-backwards-the-case-for-project-based-learning), an engineer who [designs hands-on science kits](https://www.cleanyourcraft.com/), spent years in formal education only to discover that a show aimed at toddlers had already nailed the correct progression.

"My favorite version of the scientific method comes from Sesame Street,” he told Chief Academic Officer Andrea Fife on [the OpenEd podcast](https://opened.co/blog/have-we-been-teaching-stem-completely-backwards-the-case-for-project-based-learning).

So, what's this method?

“['I wonder… What if? Let's try!'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7hBlSbh4BY)" (**Warning:** if you watch the video, you will never get this song unstuck from your head).

Compare this simple mantra to what you find in a typical science class. Jack’s third grade science teacher still brings back bad memories.

"We spent a half hour doing a writeup where she dictated verbatim what we were supposed to write,” he recalls.

Though matter and energy were neither created nor destroyed in the process, his interest in science at the time was (temporarily) destroyed.

Traditional education frontloads theory, hoping curiosity will follow. Natural learning does the opposite—curiosity first, then facts stick. Kids are born scientists. Every toddler dropping their spoon to see what happens next is running an experiment.

The best science curricula flip the order: wonder first, explanation later.

What your homeschool lacks in large lab equipment and specialized facilities, it can make up in time for deep projects, and the flexibility to go off-script when curiosity takes you somewhere unexpected. Most 'lab work' in traditional schools is performative anyway—following recipes to get expected results, often fudging observations to match the textbook "hypothesis" you're trying to confirm.

Stop trying to replicate the traditional science classroom when you can do something *even better*.

After reviewing dozens of threads in OpenEd's internal recommendation channels, five main approaches emerged. As usual, families are usually blending several rather than committing to just one.

## Online Self-Teaching Programs

These platforms let students work independently with video lessons, interactive practice, and automated grading. They're designed to minimize parent prep time while providing structured progression through content.

The trade-off: engagement varies wildly. One parent captured it perfectly in a conversation with OpenEd teacher Amy R.:

"[Generation Genius](https://opened.co/tools/generation-genius) is too flashy for my sensory-sensitive kid. Kids Discover felt too dry. [Mystery Science](https://opened.co/tools/mystery-science) was okay but not science-y enough and didn't really teach itself."

What works depends on your child's learning style and sensory needs.

[Generation Genius](https://opened.co/tools/generation-genius) delivers highly engaging videos… but this can overstimulate some learners. [Study Island](https://www.studyisland.com/) provides solid structured practice for students who do well with clear assignments, but might be too dry for others.

[CK-12](https://opened.co/tools/ck-12-foundation) offers customizable modules that work particularly well for students who need text-to-speech or other accessibility features.

[BrainPOP](https://opened.co/tools/brainpop) provides quick concept introductions that work best as supplements to deeper learning.

## Virtual Labs and Simulations

Not every home has dedicated lab space, and not every experiment needs one. Interactive simulations let students manipulate variables, run experiments, and see results in real-time—often teaching concepts more effectively than cookbook labs where students follow recipes without understanding.

[Gizmos](https://www.explorelearning.com/) from ExploreLearning offers comprehensive simulations across all sciences. Amy R. notes the platform's strong interactivity but flags an accessibility concern: "I have a better feeling about Gizmos, but I just wish there was a way to use a screen reader (assistive technologies that read digital text aloud for students with learning impairments)."

[PhET Interactive Simulations](https://phet.colorado.edu/) from University of Colorado Boulder provides similar functionality completely free.

These work best for students who grasp concepts visually and need to see cause-and-effect relationships. They're particularly valuable for chemistry and physics, where manipulating variables safely matters more than memorizing procedures.

## Hands-On Kits and Maker Projects

While simulations have their place, some students need to build things to understand them. Maker-based science puts engineering and experimentation first, with theory following naturally from what students discover through building.

Mark Rober's [CrunchLabs](https://www.crunchlabs.com/) subscription has become wildly popular. "Mark Rober has become a household name for his amazing science and engineering videos," writes Jeanne M. His kits transform the physics and engineering concepts from those eye-popping videos into hands-on play—students build projects that demonstrate force, motion, and simple machines.

[KiwiCo](https://opened.co/tools/kiwico) provides age-tiered monthly projects with thorough directions, making them ideal for independent learning. Liz K. notes that "Kiwi crates are always good if you want your kid learning while doing something on their own because the directions are thorough."

[Mel Science](https://opened.co/tools/mel-science) offers chemistry and physics kits with AR (augmented reality) components that let students visualize molecules and reactions in 3D through a smartphone or tablet, while [Rock by Rock](https://opened.co/tools/rock-by-rock) provides project-based thematic kits for geology and earth science.

## Outdoor and Observation-Based Learning

The best science lab might be your backyard. Nature study, field observations, and citizen science projects teach scientific thinking without requiring specialized equipment or curriculum.

Liz K. recommends an approach that starts with curiosity: choose a book about rocks, animals, heat, or magnets, then "deep dive after reading" through field observations and experiments. Nature journals become primary science notebooks—tracking weather patterns, recording phenology, documenting soil composition, observing water flow.

[NASA's resources](https://www.nasa.gov/) make space and earth science particularly accessible. "NASA's website is a great place to explore the latest discoveries and projects," says Jeanne M. "The imagery is incredible." Pair that with National Geographic or Disney+ documentaries for context, and students have professional-quality science education built around observation and wonder.

## Enrichment and Community Science

Science improves with community—other students to compare results with, mentors with specialized knowledge, competitions that provide goals and structure.

[Outschool](https://opened.co/tools/outschool) offers over 140,000 live online classes including thousands of science courses—from marine biology with actual marine biologists to coding camps to astronomy taught by enthusiasts worldwide. The platform connects students with specialized instructors they'd never find locally, turning niche interests into deep learning opportunities.

Emily G. highlights university programs like the University of Utah's Saturday Academy for grades 4-12, which offers hands-on health sciences courses. Science fairs give motivated students outlets for deep independent projects. Local homeschool co-ops often organize lab days where students can access equipment and work collaboratively on experiments that wouldn't work at home.

Chief Academic Officer Andrea Fife notes that science fairs don't need to be competitive. They can be family projects—an excuse to spend weeks investigating something your child genuinely wonders about, then sharing discoveries with others doing the same.

## Elementary Homeschool Science Curriculum

Elementary students (K-5) learn best when science feels like play. Keep lessons short, balance screen time with hands-on activities, and follow curiosity wherever it leads.

Programs that work well at this age include [Mystery Science](https://opened.co/tools/mystery-science) (engaging question-based lessons), [NOEO Science](https://www.noeoscience.com/) (comprehensive with lab manuals), and [Generation Genius](https://opened.co/tools/generation-genius) (video-based but potentially overstimulating for some). [Time4Learning](https://www.time4learning.com/) delivers animated lessons with automated grading at $19.95-30/month, while [Khan Academy Kids](https://www.khanacademy.org/kids) offers free, mastery-based early science education. For families on tight budgets, [Discovery K12](https://www.discoveryk12.com/) provides a complete free curriculum.

[KiwiCo](https://opened.co/tools/kiwico) subscription boxes work particularly well for independent learners—Liz K. notes "the directions are thorough," making them ideal for children who want to explore on their own. [Outschool](https://opened.co/tools/outschool) offers thousands of live science classes for elementary ages, from marine biology to volcanoes to engineering challenges, connecting students with specialized instructors worldwide.

See the detailed program descriptions in the Types sections above to find the right fit for your child's learning style and sensory needs.

## Middle School Homeschool Science Curriculum

Middle schoolers (6-8) can handle abstract concepts but still benefit from hands-on work to cement understanding. [Study Island](https://www.studyisland.com/) provides structured practice, [Gizmos](https://www.explorelearning.com/) offers interactive simulations, and [CK-12](https://opened.co/tools/ck-12-foundation) delivers free comprehensive content—all covered in detail above. The key question at this stage: does your student understand concepts well enough to teach them back to you? If not, enrich laterally with projects and co-op labs before advancing grades.

## High School Homeschool Science Curriculum

High school science (9-12) must balance college prep requirements with maintaining genuine curiosity. [CK-12](https://opened.co/tools/ck-12-foundation), [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/), and [Bozeman Science](https://www.bozemanscience.com/) provide rigorous content at no cost. Lab science requirements can be met through virtual simulations ([PhET](https://phet.colorado.edu/), [Gizmos](https://www.explorelearning.com/)), co-op labs, or dual enrollment at community colleges. Document everything: curriculum used, lab hours completed (virtual counts), and any co-op or dual enrollment components. Colleges care that students understand scientific reasoning—not where the Bunsen burner was located.

## Free Homeschool Science Curriculum

Quality science education doesn't require a budget. These resources rival paid curricula:

### How to Build a Complete Program from Free Resources

Combine resources by function:

- **Core instruction**: [CK-12](https://opened.co/tools/ck-12-foundation) or [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/) textbooks
- **Visual learning**: [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) or [Bozeman Science](https://www.bozemanscience.com/) videos
- **Hands-on practice**: [PhET simulations](https://phet.colorado.edu/)
- **Enrichment**: [NASA resources](https://www.nasa.gov/), nature documentaries
- **Documentation**: Create your own lab notebook for observations and experiments

This combination costs nothing and covers the same content as programs charging hundreds of dollars annually.

## Tips for Homeschooling Science

### Science for Neurodiverse Learners

Julie R. found that [CK-12](https://opened.co/tools/ck-12-foundation) works particularly well for dyslexic students because the digital format allows text-to-speech and formatting adjustments. For ADHD learners, Andrea recommends keeping lessons to 20-30 minute blocks with movement breaks and gamification—science that happens in the kitchen or backyard often works better than workbooks at a desk. Bailey G. observes that many autistic students naturally prefer science, making it an ideal entry point for deep, focused learning.

### When Screen Time Needs Balance

Amir Nathoo, the founder of [Outschool](https://opened.co/tools/outschool), makes an important distinction about virtual options: "Just watching YouTube is completely different from building a virtual world or learning a tool or building with others. If a kid has spent an hour watching YouTube videos, they have a different look on their face and need detox time. Versus coming away from Outschool classes brimming with creativity and excitement."

Use video as a launching pad, not the destination, and follow every digital lesson with something physical—an experiment, a nature walk, a building project. If your kid is into Mark Rober, invest in a Crunch Lab subscription. Outschool also has hundreds of hands-on classes with live instructors – something for every grade level and interest.

### When Your Curriculum Stops Working

You'll know when a curriculum isn't working: your student dreads science time, rushes through lessons without engagement, can't explain what they just "learned." Check whether it matches their learning style, whether pacing is wrong, or whether their interests have shifted. The beauty of homeschool science: you can switch mid-year without it being failure.

## Build Science Education That Sparks Wonder

Adam Savage set the stakes when he described what happens when we get science education wrong: "When we have standardized testing and it is so pervasive that teachers have to abandon their lesson plans in order to teach to a test, what you really are teaching kids is how to memorize things long enough to get to the next thing. That's not knowledge."

Science need not be about memorization. It should be exploration of "unfettered landscapes of the untried and the untested"—the exact opposite of worksheets and test prep.

The best homeschool science curriculum isn't a single program. It's the combination that keeps your specific child asking "I wonder..." and then giving them the tools to find out.

Through OpenEd, families access funding for science resources—from comprehensive programs like [NOEO Science](https://www.noeoscience.com/) to individual [Outschool](https://opened.co/tools/outschool) courses, from virtual simulations to hands-on kits. Whether you want structured lessons with clear progression or the freedom to follow curiosity wherever it leads, we provide the support and community to make it sustainable.
