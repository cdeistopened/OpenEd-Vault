# The OpenEd Holiday Gift Guide 2025

## Summary
Discover OpenEd’s 2025 Homeschool Holiday Gift Guide—10 community-tested picks that blend fun and learning, from classic building toys and STEM kits to books, outdoor gear, and teen tech.

## Content

Some gifts are fun. Some gifts teach something. The best gifts do both.

That's the idea behind this guide. We asked our community of OpenEd teachers and homeschool families what they're giving this year - what's worked, what their kids keep coming back to, what's earned its place in homes where space is shared between living and learning.

**What we found:** the gifts that last aren't the ones marketed as "educational." They're the ones that inspire genuine curiosity. The ones kids choose to play with on their own. The ones that reward exploration and self-directed learning without announcing it.

We organized everything into ten categories, each with an OpenEd Favorite and a handful of runner-ups.

1. Classic Building Toys
2. STEM & Robotics
3. Maker & Craft
4. Board Games
5. Nature & Science
6. Active & Outdoor
7. Books & Audio
8. Imaginative Play
9. Music & Instruments
10. Tech & Screen Time

Let's dive in!

## **1. Classic Building Toys**

The toys that have worked for generations. Open-ended, endlessly reconfigurable, no batteries required.

**OpenEd Favorite: **[**Magna-Tiles**](https://a.co/d/9ogFWHL)** / **[**Picasso Tiles**](https://a.co/d/9ogFWHL)

*Why we love it:* Magnetic building tiles that let kids create structures, learn geometry, and develop spatial reasoning - all without instructions. They're the rare toy that works for toddlers and still interests ten-year-olds.

**Runner-ups:**

- [**Lego**](https://www.lego.com/) - Still the gold standard for building. Classic sets, themed sets, or just a big bin of bricks.
- [**K'NEX**](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=knex) - Rods and connectors for larger structures. Great for kids who want to build big.
- [**Keva Planks**](https://a.co/d/7DPg94y) - Simple wooden planks, infinite possibilities. Architecture and physics in one box.

Gravitrax adds magnetic rails and launchers for older kids.

**Stocking Stuffer:** [Plus Plus](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Plus-Plus/page/CAF851FC-D7D9-4C6A-AA6F-B0F25B42CD5B) - tiny interlocking pieces that punch above their weight.

## **2. STEM & Robotics**

For kids who want to know how things work - and maybe build something that moves.

**OpenEd Favorite: **[**EL10T Robot Kit**](https://opened.co/marketplace/products/product-r411s6m9guglzdu3mgusi7nz)

*Why we love it:* EL10T uses physical coding blocks combined with ScratchJr, so kids learn programming logic through hands-on play.

## **4. Board Games**

## **Bonus: For the Homeschool Parent**

Three books worth giving - or asking for.

[***Open Education***](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Education-Reimagine-Learning-Curiosity/dp/1961801787)* *by Matt Bowman and Isaac Morehouse - The definitive guide to crafting an education that's as unique as your child. The Kindle version is free for a limited time; the paperback is currently half off.

Every gift on this list has been recommended by someone in our community - a teacher, a parent, a family who's used it. They're fun enough to be genuine gifts, useful enough to support learning, and built to last longer than the holiday season.

Happy holidays from the OpenEd team.
