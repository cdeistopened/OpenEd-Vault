# The Etsy Effect: How (Not) to Kill Your Child's Passions

## Summary
Educational technologist Brenna Clarke Gray unpacks when external rewards replace genuine curiosity. Learn how to foster intrinsic motivation and lifelong learning in children.

## Content

During the pandemic lockdown, Brenna's son was around four years old, just starting to read. As he got older, he developed an obsessive interest in mythology. Greek. Roman. Egyptian. Norse. Hindu. Chinese. All of it.

Stacks of books appeared. He listened to podcasts. And he accumulated an encyclopedic knowledge that quickly surpassed his mother's understanding.

Brenna Clarke Gray knows something about how learning breaks. As a critical educational technologist at Thompson Rivers University, she sees it every day in her college classroom: students who've learned to treat education as a series of hoops to jump through. Students who aren't curious—they're compliant. Students who care about grades but not learning.

She hosts the [*Community of Praxis* podcast](https://www.wlupress.wlu.ca/Scholarly-Podcasts/Community-of-Praxis), where she explores exactly these kinds of questions with some of the most interesting thinkers in education. How do we kill curiosity? How do we protect it?

Watching her son fall in love with mythology, she felt the pride every parent feels when their child discovers something that lights them up. She knew better than most how rare and precious this kind of intrinsic motivation is. Which makes what happened next even more painful.

She had a thought that seemed perfectly reasonable: "Maybe we can make this into a school project."

The moment she suggested it, something shifted.

He stopped.

The books stayed on the shelf. The podcasts went silent.

The realization hit her hard: she'd killed what made it special.

She calls it the "Etsy store effect": someone who's good at a craft opens an Etsy store, and suddenly they hate that craft.

When you do something because you love it, the reward is internal. When you do it for external validation—money, grades, approval—the reward shifts outside yourself. And the original love dies. Psychologists talk about the difference between [*intrinsic* versus *extrinsic* motivation](https://www.verywellmind.com/differences-between-extrinsic-and-intrinsic-motivation-2795384). But those terms don't capture the tragedy. External motivation doesn't just supplement internal motivation—it *replaces* it. The brain makes a different deal with itself. What was "I want to know this" becomes "I have to do this to get that."

Brenna gave me a personal example. She's obsessive about Formula One racing. She has this vast catalog of details about teams, drivers, technical regulations, and race strategy in her head.

Nobody tests her. Nobody grades her. She learns it because understanding the details makes the races more interesting. That's intrinsic motivation in its purest form.

Now imagine someone forced her to write essays about F1. Graded her understanding. Made her defend her interest. The whole thing would become different—less fun, less alive, less hers.

That's what happened to her son's mythology obsession the moment it became a school project.

## Why Homeschool Parents Keep Making This Mistake

We want to support our children's interests. We see something they love and think: "This is a learning opportunity."

So we build a unit study around it. Or require a presentation. Or add it to our homeschool documentation. All of this seems like good parenting—supportive, educational parenting.

And yet Brenna's observation stands: "Do a project on this thing you love, now you hate it and I killed it."

The painful part? She recognizes her own role. Not "the system killed it." But "I killed it."

This happens because homeschool parents operate under enormous pressure. Pressure to prove our kids are learning. Pressure to document progress. Pressure to justify our choices. When we see genuine learning—the kind that emerges from pure curiosity—our instinct is to capture it, formalize it, make it count for something official.

But in doing so, we transform the learning itself. We change the locus of control from internal (the child's desire) to external (our requirements). And children know the difference. By the time they reach college, that difference has calcified into students who are compliant but not curious—exactly what Brenna sees in her university classroom every day.

## What to Do Instead: A Practical Guide

So if turning your child's passion into curriculum kills their motivation, what should you do instead? Brenna's experience points to several practical strategies:

**1. Protect Unstructured Time**

"Boredom is incredibly important to learning," Brenna says. It wasn't coincidence that her son's mythology obsession arose during pandemic lockdown—a young child just learning to read with time to figure things out.

Create space in your schedule where nothing is required. White space on the calendar. Hours where your child can be bored and has to figure out what to do with themselves.

**2. Provide Access, Not Direction**

Stock books on topics they're interested in. Play podcasts in the car. Take library trips and let them disappear into the stacks. Make materials available.

But don't assign projects. Don't require documentation. Don't quiz them on what they learned. Let them lead. Your role is to facilitate access, not to structure the learning.

**3. Keep Their Passions Separate From Your Homeschool Records**

You can document "wide reading" or "self-directed research" in your homeschool portfolio. You don't have to specify that it's 47 books about Pokemon or six months of obsessive Minecraft redstone engineering.

Let them have something that's just theirs.

**4. Resist the Urge to Structure Everything**

This year Brenna added martial arts and flute lessons to her son's schedule. More structure, more discipline. Real benefits: commitment, practice, improvement. But there's a trade-off. "Less time for random interests," she noticed. Fewer afternoons spent reading mythology books for no reason other than wanting to.

Both matter. Structured learning teaches discipline. Unstructured learning teaches curiosity and self-direction. Don't let structured activities crowd out everything else.

## The Long Game

You don't need to turn every passion into a lesson. Sometimes the best thing you can do is get out of the way. The learning that happens from pure curiosity is real learning, even if you can't document it.

Your child is learning observation, pattern recognition, memory, synthesis. They're learning how to learn. That's worth protecting.

Brenna makes a point that's easy to miss: "Motivation and learning don't follow a school-year rhythm." A connection a child makes at age eight might not matter until they're 25. Or 40. Your job isn't to optimize every learning moment. It's to create conditions where curiosity can survive.

The mythology books are still in Brenna's house. Her son still knows more about ancient gods than most adults. But it's his knowledge, pursued on his terms. She learned to step back.
