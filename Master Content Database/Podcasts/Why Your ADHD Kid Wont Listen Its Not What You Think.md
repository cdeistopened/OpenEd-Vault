# Why Your ADHD Kid "Won't Listen" (It's Not What You Think)

## Summary
Your ADHD child isn't ignoring you—they literally can't hear you. Learn the brain science behind meltdowns and how to remediate cognitive weaknesses, not just accommodate them.

## Content

You're standing in the kitchen, trying to finish one math lesson before lunch. Your child has been staring at the same problem for ten minutes. Frustration builds on both sides. Finally, you raise your voice: "Just focus! Why won't you listen to me?"

Your child looks up. Silent. Defiant, you think.

But what if they literally can't hear you?

[Dr. Amy Moore](https://www.thebrainymoms.com/) is a cognitive psychologist and host of the Brainy Moms podcast. She's also the Psychology and Research Director for [LearningRx](https://www.learningrx.com/). But her expertise runs deeper than her credentials. Diagnosed with ADHD in college after failing out twice, she understands the struggling kid from the inside out.

**"It looks like they're ignoring you. Honestly, they're struggling to hear the words that you're saying when you're yelling, because they're in fight or flight."**

## The Brain Science Behind 'Not Listening’ (Attention Isn't the Real Problem)

Dr. Moore explained [auditory exclusion](https://www.freakyscience.com/auditory-exclusion-the-impact-of-high-stress/)—a neurological phenomenon where the brain under stress can't process language. When a parent raises their voice, the child's amygdala sets off an alarm. Danger. Crisis. The prefrontal cortex—responsible for reasoning, thinking, planning—gets hijacked.

"[The brain is] intelligently designed to only be able to hear low-frequency sounds like that tiger rustling in the bush behind us, not mom's voice yelling at us."

When it looks like a kid is ignoring you, they're in neurological shutdown. Their ears can't process words. They're not refusing to listen—they're unable to hear.

This misunderstanding goes even deeper. ADHD stands for "Attention Deficit." So when kids struggle, parents naturally try to fix their focus. But what if we've been targeting the wrong problem all along?

Dr. Moore and her team studied more than 5,000 children and adults with ADHD. They found something shocking: **attention was NOT the weakest cognitive skill.**

"Working memory, long-term memory, and processing speed all fell below the 38th percentile. We have this tendency to go, my kid has ADHD, let me fix his attention and focus, when attention and focus was not the real issue."

ICYMI, this is the same point Andrea Fife—OpenEd's Chief Academic Officer—[made in her recent deep dive on ADHD](https://opened.co/blog/homeschooling-a-child-with-adhd).

Moore and Fife agree that we’ve been attempting to solve the wrong problem.

When a child is frustrated and stressed, they need strong working memory to hold potential options in mind—and strong processing speed to access those options quickly. Without it, they stay dysregulated.

## How to Stop the Meltdown Before It Starts

Dr. Moore talked about mirror neurons—"smart cells in our brains" that make emotions contagious.

"My emotions as a mom are contagious to my child. The easiest way to illustrate that is when someone yawns and you yawn back, that's a mirror neuron kicking in."

When parents are dysregulated, kids become dysregulated. When parents yell, kids shut down. [Research on mirror neurons](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3510904/) shows this emotional contagion is strongest between people in close relationships—like parent and child.

"We cannot access grace when we're emotionally dysregulated. We have to learn how to regulate our own emotions first so that we can help our child co-regulate theirs."

The primary intervention isn't medication or therapy for the child. It's the parent learning to regulate first.

Lower your voice. Soften your facial expression. Relax your posture. Remove excess noise and light. Dr. Moore calls it "lowering the temperature on the fire."

Then get curious. Ask: "I'm noticing this seems hard for you. I wonder what we could do to make it easier."

Invite them into problem-solving. Give them power and control. Build "relational equity"—the sense that you're on their side.

## How to Actually Remediate (Not Just Accommodate)

Dr. Moore's youngest son couldn't spell his own name in fifth grade. Low self-esteem, constant bullying, crushing inadequacy.

Instead of accommodating his struggles—extra time, front-row seating—she remediated the underlying cognitive skills. She put him through 36 weeks of cognitive training and reading remediation at [LearningRx](https://www.learningrx.com/).

By ninth grade, he was earning A's in college-level English. He became a competitive rock climber and elite musician. Now he's a music performance major in college.

"We had to make his bucket so big that it built resilience to that ADHD diagnosis."

What's the difference between accommodation and remediation?

Accommodations work around a weakness. Extra time on tests. Preferential seating. Audio versions of textbooks. These help a child succeed *despite* their struggles, but the underlying weakness remains.

Remediation strengthens the weakness itself through targeted cognitive training—exercises that build working memory capacity, increase processing speed, and improve long-term memory retrieval.

## What does cognitive training look like?

Programs like [LearningRx](https://www.learningrx.com/) use one-on-one brain training exercises delivered by a trained clinician. Sessions typically run 60-90 minutes, three times per week, for 12-36 weeks depending on the severity of cognitive weaknesses.

The exercises are game-like and progressively challenging—designed to push cognitive skills just beyond current capacity. Think of it like physical therapy for the brain: targeted, repetitive, increasingly difficult exercises that force neural pathways to strengthen and new connections to form.

Dr. Moore's research shows measurable IQ gains averaging 15 points after cognitive training, with the greatest improvements in working memory, processing speed, and long-term memory—the exact skills that fall below average in individuals with ADHD.

Homeschool families and those pursuing an open education have an advantage here. Traditional schools must serve 30 kids at once. They can't pause the curriculum for weeks of intensive cognitive training. Accommodations are the only practical option.

Homeschoolers have time and flexibility. You can dedicate three mornings a week to cognitive training sessions—either in-person at a [LearningRx](https://www.learningrx.com/) center or delivered remotely via Zoom. You can adjust your academic pace while building foundational skills. You can remediate, not just accommodate.

## Steps to Support Your ADHD Learner

Here are practical steps Dr. Moore suggests you can take today:

**Start with sleep.** Tired children cannot regulate their emotions. The brain's glymphatic system washes away toxins during sleep and consolidates memories. Without restorative sleep, nothing else works.

**Address sensory needs.** Most ADHD kids are either sensory seekers (running laps at 8 p.m.) or sensory avoiders (can't stand scratchy pajamas). Match the environment to the need—swings for seekers, soft quiet spaces for avoiders.

**Focus on real cognitive weaknesses.** If your child has a formal diagnosis, you have a neuropsych report showing subtest scores. Look at working memory, processing speed, and long-term memory—not attention.

**Build islands of competence.** Neuropsychologist Robert Brooks says "Kids with ADHD swim in oceans of inadequacy." Find what they love and do well. Nurture those passions. Make the bucket big enough that the struggle seems small.

**Regulate yourself first.** Emotions are contagious. Before you can co-regulate a child, you need to regulate yourself.

Dr. Moore's team found that cognitive training delivered over Zoom is as effective as in-person training. Parents can access these interventions from their dining room table without disrupting their homeschool day.
