### 💡 1 THOUGHT

**You don’t need a new curriculum. You need a new foundation.**

[**Meg Thomas**](https://www.coachmegthomas.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-3-part-remedy-for-burnout), a certified life coach and veteran homeschooling mom of 7, has graduated five kids and still loves it. Her secret isn’t the right planner or perfect program.

It’s this 3-part framework: **heart, habits, and home.**

In this [**recent Q&A**](https://youtu.be/rcozKxOF0VU?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-3-part-remedy-for-burnout), Meg walks through these three pillars of a thriving homeschool:

- **Heart**: Connection is what makes kids teachable
- **Habits**: Smooth days come from invisible routines
- **Home**: Behavior often changes when the environment does

She covers everything from how to build trust without yelling, to how to get siblings to stop misbehaving at the dinner table.

### 📊 2 TRENDS

**1. THE GREAT TOY REDUCTION** Meg Thomas shared that reducing toys and clutter has improved her kids’ focus, emotional regulation, and reduced anxiety. [**Our friend Claire Honeycutt echoes this in her latest piece**](https://substack.com/home/post/p-161898400?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web), sharing how her kids became "happier, more playful, & calm" after decluttering their rooms—even though they initially resisted. Less stuff = calmer, more focused kids.

**2. ARE SCREENS SABOTAGING REGULATION?**

Meg points out how screen time affects behavior, attention span, and sleep: **“It actually makes them have a shorter attention span... it can create anxiety and it lowers social skills.”**

This echoes [**research showing links between screen exposure and emotional dysregulation**](https://www.kqed.org/education/532207/screen-time-how-much-is-too-much?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-3-part-remedy-for-burnout).

### 🛠️ 3 TOOLS

**2.** [**Simple Joy Art**](https://simplejoyart.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-3-part-remedy-for-burnout) — Beautiful, free printable artwork Meg uses to create a peaceful, inspiring homeschool atmosphere.

**3.** [**Spotify**](https://open.spotify.com/?utm_source=opened-daily.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=the-3-part-remedy-for-burnout) — Meg mentions how music shifts the energy in her home. She uses upbeat showtunes for moods and classical playlists for calm and focus.
