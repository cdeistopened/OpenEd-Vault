# The Genius We Engineer Away

There's a story that should haunt every educator in America.

It's 1939, and a graduate student at UC Berkeley rushes into his statistics class, late. The professor has already finished his lecture and left two problems on the blackboard. The student assumes they're homework assignments, copies them down, and heads home to work on them.

Turns out—they *weren't* homework. They were two of the most famous unsolved problems in the field of statistics.

The student didn't know that. So he solved them both.

His name was George Dantzig, and he later said that if he had known the problems were supposed to be unsolvable, he probably never would have attempted them.

## The Unicorn Hunter

The man who [shared that story](https://www.instagram.com/p/DOd-ZaEERUB/) on our podcast was [Michael Gibson](https://x.com/william_blake?lang=en)—an Oxford grad school dropout and self-described "academic apostate" who has built a venture capital firm ([the 1517 Fund](https://www.1517fund.com/)) around a very specific, very contrarian bet. Gibson previously served as Vice President of Grants at the Thiel Foundation, where he helped run the [Thiel Fellowship](https://thielfellowship.org/)—Peter Thiel's radical program that pays brilliant young people $200,000 to drop out of college and build something instead.

The Thiel Fellowship has a better track record than Y Combinator at finding founders of so-called "unicorn" companies—those rare billion-dollar startups that venture capitalists spend their careers hunting for (and sometimes never once finding).

Consider Dylan Field, the Thiel Fellow who dropped out of Brown University to build Figma. [The design software company recently went public in a deal that valued it at over $20 billion](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/figma-ceo-now-worth-5-151742597.html). Field was 19 when he started the company. If he had stayed in school, graduated, maybe gotten an MBA, he would have been 26 or 27 before he even started building. In technology, those years matter. They might have been the difference between creating the next generation of design tools and arriving too late to a market already dominated by others.

Now Gibson continues that contrarian mission through his venture capital firm, [the 1517 Fund](https://www.1517fund.com/), providing grants and investments to young, brilliant minds who have chosen to build things outside of traditional university structures.

Through 1517, Gibson is betting on the same philosophy that made the Thiel Fellowship so successful: that genius flourishes best in the wild, outside the very institutions we've built to certify it. In other words, Michael doesn't just tell the story of George Dantzig; his fund actively searches for the next one. He is betting his career on the idea that genius flourishes best in the wild, outside the very institutions we've built to certify it.

## The Academic Apostate

We live in what Michael calls a culture of "brittle dependence"—a system designed to create experts who know all the reasons something *can't* be done. We teach our children to color inside the lines, to follow the rubric, to wait for permission. We tell them that the path to success is clear: good grades, good college, good job. We've turned education into a risk-mitigation strategy instead of a curiosity-cultivation system.

Breakthrough thinking doesn't come from knowing all the rules. It comes from not knowing them—or, more precisely, from being willing to ignore them.

The greatest innovations in history have come from outsiders, from people who didn't know they were supposed to fail. The Wright brothers weren't aeronautical engineers. Steve Jobs wasn't a computer scientist.

They succeeded not despite their ignorance, but because of it.

We've created a generation that is incredibly good at being students and incredibly bad at being pioneers.

And for many young geniuses, the window is closing. Michael talks about this a lot—the narrow window young people have to build real capability. The years between 15 and 25 are when the brain is most plastic, when risk tolerance is highest, when the cost of failure is lowest. But we're telling our kids to spend those years in classrooms, accumulating credentials instead of building things.

By the time they graduate, they're 22, 23, maybe 26 if they get an advanced degree. They're deep in debt, risk-averse, and conditioned to wait for someone else to tell them what to do next. The window for naive audacity has closed.

Are we raising children who can think for themselves, or are we raising children who are very good at thinking the way they've been taught to think?

## Rewilding the Mind

The antidote isn't to abandon education entirely. It's to rewild it.

Just as we've learned that ecosystems need wildness to thrive, minds need intellectual wilderness to develop their full potential.

This means giving children unsolved problems without telling them they're hard. It means letting them build things without instructions. It means celebrating the brilliant question over the correct answer.

Here's what I've learned from watching Michael's work at 1517: Our job as parents and educators is to give our kids the tools to navigate the wilderness, not to pave the road for them.

Because somewhere out there, there's another George Dantzig walking into a classroom late, looking at an "impossible" problem on the blackboard, and thinking, "This looks like homework."

Will we have taught them that it's impossible? Or will we have given them the beautiful, dangerous gift of not knowing any better?
