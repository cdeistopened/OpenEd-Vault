#### ‍Millions of children struggle with reading, yet many parents are being led down the wrong path by persistent myths about dyslexia. While families desperately seek help for their struggling readers, misconceptions about vision therapy, colored overlays, and the very nature of dyslexia itself are preventing kids from getting the research-based interventions they actually need.

[Kris Vassel](https://www.vasselighttutoring.com/), a reading interventionist with over two decades of experience, has seen this pattern play out countless times. After beginning her career as a special education teacher and eventually becoming a Wilson-certified dyslexia therapist, she's dedicated her professional life to helping struggling readers—and correcting the dangerous myths that hold them back.

Having worked with students with moderate to severe disabilities and implemented school-wide reading interventions, she understands both the complexity of reading instruction and the hope that proper intervention can bring.
