# Finding Your Child's Superpower: Why 'Average' Students Need Specialized Attention

## Summary
Charter school founder Mike Goldstein reveals education's blind spot: Schools have programs for struggling students and gifted kids, but the vast middle—the "average" students—get nothing. Here's why that's a crisis.

Mike Goldstein has a theory that will make most parents uncomfortable: Your "average" kid might be the most neglected student in the entire education system.

"I think parents get easy information in two ways," Goldstein tells me. He's the founder of Match Charter School in Boston, where he once built a dormitory for 42 tutors above the classrooms—but more on that later. "You get a report card and often standardized test scores on top of that. So you know how your kid more or less is doing from eight to three, and then you go usually every year to the doctor and your kid gets a checkup."

Academic performance. Physical health. Check, check. But then Goldstein says something that should terrify every parent of a B student: "The rest, you're kind of on your own."

### The Myth of One-Size-Fits-All Education

Here's the paradox that Goldstein discovered after decades in education: We think standardized education serves the average student while failing the extremes. The reality is more nuanced.

Walk into any school and you'll find specialized programs for struggling students—reading specialists, learning support, IEPs, extra tutoring. You'll also find gifted programs, AP classes, enrichment opportunities for high achievers. But that vast middle? The kids who get Bs and Cs, who don't cause problems but don't excel, who are "fine" but not thriving?

They get nothing special. They're the forgotten majority.

"There's a number of teens who would describe themselves: I'm not really good at anything. I'm sort of okay and there's nothing I do well enough to kind of enjoy that," Goldstein explains. "I wanna spend additional hours on it, and I feel like that's a, that's a warning sign."

Think about that. These kids can't name a single thing they're genuinely good at. Not one domain where they've experienced real excellence. They float through school in a fog of mediocrity, never failing enough to get help, never succeeding enough to feel proud.

### Every Kid Needs One Win

This brings us to Goldstein's central insight, the one that changed how he thinks about education: Every child needs to find at least one thing they can win at.

"Once you get reasonably good at something, you have a sense of pride, but it also intellectually opens up a whole new world. Like how could I go from good to great?" he explains. "It's fascinating and you can only explore that journey if you first make it to being pretty good, right?"

The magic isn't in the particular skill. It doesn't matter if it's chess or cooking or coding or rock climbing. What matters is the experience of genuine competence, of earned excellence, of being actually good at something.

Goldstein has seen this transformation countless times. A kid finds their thing—maybe it's music, maybe it's martial arts, maybe it's building computers—and suddenly they develop what he calls "momentum." They start to believe they're capable of excellence. That confidence bleeds into other areas of their life.

But here's the tragedy: For many average students, school actively prevents this discovery. They're so busy being mediocre at seven different subjects that they never have time to be excellent at one thing.

### The $30,000 Question

Goldstein drops a number that should make every taxpayer furious: Boston spends $30,000 per student per year in public schools. Thirty thousand dollars. Per kid. Per year.

"You start to think, ‘Wow. If those parents had $30,000 cash, and they spent $18,000 to send the kid to the Catholic school, they could still spend $12,000 to help the kid find hobbies or get them a good therapist if they have mental health issues, or whatever they… that could be really cool."

The thought experiment is revealing. What if parents could direct that money toward what their specific child actually needs? Not what the system thinks the average child needs, but what their particular kid requires to thrive?

### The 360-Degree Child Nobody Measures

"How's my kid doing overall?" It's such a simple question, yet Goldstein argues that no one is answering it. Schools measure academic performance. Doctors measure physical health. But who's measuring whether your child has friends? Whether they have a sense of purpose? Whether they have something they love doing?

"It's hard for parents to figure out," Goldstein admits. "You're essentially gathering intelligence through dinner table conversations, going on walks, and trading notes with your spouse or other key people in the kid's life. All the while, you're trying to answer that fundamental question: does this kid have a sense of purpose?"

He envisions a service that doesn't yet exist: a holistic evaluation of your child's overall thriving. Not just grades and test scores, but social skills, emotional health, interests, passions, relationships. A true 360-degree view of whether your kid is flourishing or just floating.

### The Dorm Above the School

This brings us back to that dorm. When Goldstein realized his students needed intensive one-on-one tutoring, he didn't do what most schools would do—hire a few part-timers and call it a day. He built a dormitory on the top floor of his school and recruited 42 recent college graduates to live there.

"These 40, 22 year olds will come downstairs and then all they'll do all day is tutor our students," he explains. "And that was how we built enough capacity for our little school."

It's a perfect metaphor for Goldstein's approach to education: When the standard solution isn't enough, invent something radical. When average isn't working, refuse to accept average.

The lesson isn't that every school should build a dorm. It's that we need to stop accepting mediocrity as inevitable for the kids in the middle. They deserve the same creativity, the same resources, the same attention we lavish on the extremes.

Because here's what Goldstein knows that most educators won't admit: Being average isn't natural. It's what happens when kids never find their thing, never experience excellence, never discover what they could be genuinely good at.

"You gotta get momentum," Goldstein insists. One win. One domain of genuine competence. One thing they can point to and say, "I'm good at this."

For the forgotten middle, that might be everything.
