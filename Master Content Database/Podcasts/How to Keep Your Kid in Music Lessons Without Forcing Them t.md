## Summary
Confession: I quit piano lessons when I was in middle school. My mom thought it would be good for me, but I lost interest. It felt forced. Looking back, I wonder what would have happened if someone had told my mom that keeping me in lessons didn't require perfect practice habits—that showing up itself might have been enough to build a lifelong skill. That realization changed everything for Deborah Pratt, a music educator who runs the Southern Oregon School of Music and teaches 172 students, many from homeschooling families.

## When Homework Battles Become About Music Too

Deborah's perspective shifted when her own daughter hit a breaking point. In high school, her daughter was taking trumpet lessons but struggling with practice at home. As a professional music teacher, Deb was "flabbergasted and embarrassed"—and she made what seemed logical: no practice, no lessons. Her daughter quit.

Thirty years later, her daughter said something that changed how Deb sees everything: "I really wish you'd let me continue to take lessons because I could be playing today if you had let me keep playing."

That decades-long regret taught Deb a counterintuitive truth: **just taking lessons keeps a child in it, even without practice at home.**

This challenges what we've been told. We believe practice is non-negotiable. But Deb discovered something else entirely: there's a crucial difference between ideal practice and the value of continuity. A child who shows up every week—even without practicing—is still building muscle memory, absorbing concepts, staying connected to the instrument. They're not starting from zero.

"There are so many different personalities with kids," Deb explains. "Some love to play at home and it becomes part of who they are. But not all kids are that way." The real insight is that we've made not practicing into a reason to quit. But what if the lesson itself is the anchor point for some kids, and practice is secondary?

## The Real Problem With Forcing Practice at Home

Here's what most of us do: if they're not practicing, lessons feel pointless. So we pull them out. It feels logical. It feels responsible.

But what we're actually teaching our kids is dangerous. We're teaching them that when something gets hard or requires discipline, quitting is the answer.

Deb has watched this cycle hundreds of times. A child hits a frustration point—they need to play with both hands now, songs are getting harder, progress stalls. They say, "I don't want to do this anymore." And parents, respecting their child's autonomy, agree. Lessons stop.

The child never experiences pushing through difficulty to reach mastery. They never feel what's on the other side. They learn that quitting is the default response to struggle.

Most skills have valleys. You learn something, feel good, hit a wall, get frustrated. If you quit in that valley, you never reach the plateau where everything clicks. Stay with it, and everything changes.

## What Actually Works (When Your Kid Won't Practice)

Deb's advice moves beyond the simple "require practice" approach. Instead:

**Talk to the teacher first.** Most parents never do this. They assume lessons are just about the kid and instrument, but teachers have tools. Maybe the songs are too hard. Maybe the approach isn't clicking. Maybe there's something missing from the lesson structure itself.

**Treat practice like homework, not optional enrichment.** Deb makes this clear: "If your child said, 'I don't feel like doing my math homework,' would you say, 'OK, if you don't want to'? You wouldn't." Set the expectation kindly but firmly, and be consistent. Practice becomes something they do, not something they ask permission to skip.

**Don't make practice the condition for continuing lessons.** This is the paradigm shift. Practice should be expected, yes. But not practicing shouldn't end the story—it should prompt a conversation with the teacher about what might help.

## Why Music Changes the Brain (And Your Child's Future)

[Research from Harvard Medical School](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2996135/) shows that music activates the entire brain in a way almost nothing else does. Music engages auditory processing, motor control, language, and emotional centers simultaneously.

Even more significant: [music training physically enlarges the corpus callosum](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/3/1282)—the part of your brain connecting your left and right hemispheres. This structural change has lasting implications for how your child thinks, processes information, and solves problems throughout life.

But there's more than neuroscience here. A teenager processing emotional turmoil through an instrument isn't just learning music. They're developing [emotional intelligence and regulation](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8037606/). They're learning that feelings can be channeled into something meaningful.

And then there's the long view: Deb's daughter at 45, looking at her hands, thinking "I could be playing right now."

Most parents don't want that regret for their kids. They want them to look back and feel grateful. The way to make that happen isn't punishment or forcing practice. It's keeping them in. Showing up. Having hard conversations. Adjusting when needed. But not letting them quit in the moment of difficulty.

Your kid might not love clarinet or piano. But if they stay long enough—through the hard parts—they might discover they love the bass. Or they might discover they love learning itself. That discovery only happens if they don't quit.

# How to Keep Your Kid in Music Lessons Without Making Them Practice

**Ela Richmond**

Confession: I quit piano lessons when I was in middle school.

My mom had put me in when I was younger, thinking it would be amazing for me to learn, but somewhere along the way, I just... didn't care anymore. It felt forced.

Looking back, I wonder what would have happened if someone had told my mom that keeping me in lessons didn't require perfect practice habits. That the act of showing up, of taking the lesson itself, might have been enough to keep me connected to something that could have been lifelong.

This exact realization came to Deborah Pratt, a music educator who runs the Southern Oregon School of Music and teaches 172 students—many of them from homeschooling families.

## When Practice Became a Breaking Point

Deborah's perspective on music lessons was fundamentally shaped by her own daughter's experience. In high school, her daughter was taking trumpet lessons but wasn't practicing at home. As a professional music teacher, Deb was "flabbergasted and embarrassed." She made what seemed like the logical decision: no practice, no lessons. Her daughter quit.

Thirty years later, her daughter shared something that changed everything: "I really wish you'd let me continue to take lessons because I could be playing today if you had let me keep playing."

That decades-long regret reshaped how Deb approaches music education. She learned that **just taking lessons keeps a child in it, even without practice at home.** This challenges the conventional wisdom that practice is absolutely non-negotiable—that without home practice, lessons are pointless.

Practice does matter. But there's a crucial difference between ideal practice and the value of continuity. A child who shows up every week, even without practicing, is still building muscle memory, absorbing concepts, and maintaining their connection to the instrument. They're not starting from zero.

"There are so many different personalities with kids," Deb explains. "Some love to play at home and practice and it just becomes part of who they are. But not all kids are that way." The insight here is that we've turned the absence of practice into a reason to quit. But what if, for some kids, the lesson itself is the anchor point, and practice is secondary?

## The Hidden Cost of the Practice Rule

Most teachers and parents operate from this premise: if you're not going to practice, there's no point in paying for lessons. It feels logical. It feels responsible. But what this rule actually teaches kids is something more dangerous: that the moment something gets hard or requires discipline, the appropriate response is to quit.

Deb has watched this cycle play out hundreds of times. A child hits a frustration point in their learning—now they have to play with both hands, or the songs are getting harder, or their progress plateaued. They tell their parent, "I don't want to keep doing this." And the parent, wanting to respect their child's autonomy, agrees. Lessons stop.

The child never learns what it feels like to push through a difficult phase and come out the other side with a new skill. They don't experience the satisfaction of mastering something that once felt impossible. And critically, they learn that quitting is the default response to difficulty.

This isn't about forcing your kid to hate music. It's about understanding something deeper: most skills have valleys. You learn something, you feel good, then you hit a wall, it gets harder, and you feel frustrated. If you quit in that valley, you never reach the plateau on the other side where everything clicks.

## What to Do When Your Kid Says They Don't Want to Practice

Here's where Deb's advice shifts from "require practice" to something more nuanced:

1. **Talk to the teacher.** This is the move most parents never make. They think lessons are just about the kid and the instrument, but actually, teachers have tools. Maybe the songs are too hard. Maybe the approach isn't clicking. Maybe there's something missing from the lesson structure that would make the kid excited about playing at home.
2. **Treat it like homework, not like optional enrichment.** Deb is clear on this: "If your child came home and said, 'I don't feel like doing my math homework,' would you say, 'OK, if you don't want to do it'? We wouldn't say that with math homework." And you don't have to say it with music either. If you set the expectation kindly but firmly, and you're consistent about it, practice stops being something your kid asks permission to skip and starts being something they just... do.
3. **Don't make practice the condition for continuing lessons.** This is where the paradigm shifts. Practice should be expected, yes. But not practicing shouldn't be the ending of the story. It should be a conversation with the teacher about how to make it happen, not a sentence of termination.

## The Long View: Why Staying in Music Matters

There's something Deb mentioned that's worth sitting with: music is the only thing neuroscience has found that lights up the entire brain. Not exercise. Not math. Not art. Music. It also enlarges the corpus callosum—the part of your brain that connects your left and right hemispheres. This physical change has implications for how you think, how you process, how you solve problems across your whole life.

But beyond the brain science, there's something more personal. A teenager going through emotional turmoil who learns to pour their frustration and confusion into an instrument isn't just learning music. They're learning how to process their interior world. They're developing emotional literacy.

And then there's what Deb's daughter, now an adult, understands: regret. Not the kind of regret you get over quickly, but the kind that stretches across decades. The kind where you look at your hands and think, "I could be playing right now."

Most parents don't want that for their kids. They want their kids to look back and feel grateful. The way to do that isn't to make practice mandatory and punishing. It's to keep them in. Keep showing up. Have the conversations when it gets hard. Talk to the teacher. Make adjustments. But don't let them quit in the moment of difficulty.

Because the truth is, your kid might not love the clarinet. They might not love the piano. But if they stay with something long enough—really stay with it, through the hard parts—they might discover they love the bass. Or they might discover that they love learning, period. And that discovery? That's only possible if they don't quit.
