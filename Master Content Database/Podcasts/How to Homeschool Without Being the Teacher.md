## Summary
Homeschool mom Dalena Wallace shares how burnout led her to build co-ops, microschools, and a community-first approach to sustainable homeschooling.

## Content

Dalena Wallace has been homeschooling for 13 years. She has six kids. And she'll tell you straight up: she's not gifted at teaching.

That admission would terrify most homeschool moms. For Dalena, it became the key to everything.

### Weepy Wednesdays

Five or six years into homeschooling, Dalena hit a wall. Her husband travels one to two weeks a month, which meant she was carrying the full weight of six kids alone - feeding, clothing, teaching, managing everything.

She noticed a pattern. Mondays were great. She could start the week strong. Fridays were fine too - she could finish what she started. But by Wednesday? The wheels came off. She called them her "Weepy Wednesdays."

Most homeschool moms try to push through the hard days. Dalena did something different: she stopped scheduling herself to teach on the days she knew she'd fail.

### One Friend Changed Everything

It started small. She invited one friend to come over on Wednesdays. The arrangement was simple: one mom would take the younger kids while the other taught geography to the older ones. Then they'd switch.

That single swap saved her sanity.

Three families became five. Five became twelve. Eight years later, that Wednesday arrangement had grown into a full co-op with sixteen families and hired teachers. Dalena was the founder and director for years. Now others run it, but her kids still go.

She also ran a [Prenda Microschool](https://www.prenda.com/) out of her home for a year as part of a pilot program. That experience changed how she thought about education entirely. She realized anybody can organize families and start a school. You don't need a building. You need a living room and someone willing to show up.

### The Curriculum Trap

Early on, Dalena did what a lot of homeschool moms do: she tried to be everything. For her oldest daughter - an avid horse lover - she created custom curriculum. Horse-themed flashcards where A was Andalusian and B was Bridle. Little horse manipulatives instead of coins for math.

Beautiful. Completely unsustainable.

Now she looks for one thing: does this program grade itself? [Teaching Textbooks](https://www.teachingtextbooks.com/) handles math without her touching it. The kids log in, watch the lesson, do the problems, and she checks their progress online. No prep, no grading, no sitting beside them explaining fractions.

The curriculum industry wants you to believe the right workbook will solve your problems. Dalena spent 13 years learning otherwise. Good curriculum that requires all your time isn't actually good curriculum - not for a family like hers.

### People Over Programs

Her top suggestion for struggling homeschool moms? Find the people.

She's hired retired teachers who miss working with kids. She's brought in homeschool graduates who want teaching experience before college. She's found neighbors willing to teach home ec - sewing, baking, making candles and soap.

You don't need certified teachers. You need people in your community with skills to share. Most of them would love an excuse to teach what they know.

Now, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, a tutor comes to her house and works with five kids together - her four plus one other family's child. They hire the tutor collectively, splitting the cost. The kids get instruction from someone who isn't mom. She gets time to work or just breathe.

### Permission to Pivot

Dalena's two oldest are in private Christian schools now. Her son is class president. Both are excelling academically. The transition proved what she'd suspected: homeschool kids can handle any environment when they're ready.

Sending them felt like failure at first. She thought she hadn't been able to meet their every need. But watching them thrive changed her perspective.

She sent her third daughter to private school this fall. Six weeks in, she pulled her out. The girl was waking up at 6:30, leaving by 7:15, at school until 3:30, then staying for basketball practice. She wasn't getting home until 6:30. Twelve-hour days were crushing her.

Most parents would agonize. Stick it out for the semester. Give it time. Dalena didn't hesitate. The experiment failed. She ended it. Her daughter is back home and much happier.

Trial and error is the method, not the mistake. Things can shift year after year - and sometimes within the same school year.

### Building the Network

When Dalena started connecting micro school founders in Wichita, she discovered something surprising: they all thought they were the only ones doing it. Each founder had been operating in isolation, assuming their little school was unique.

She started introducing them to each other. Now they meet monthly through [WISE (Wichita Innovative Schools and Educators)](https://www.wisetogether.org/) to share resources, discuss challenges, and help each other grow. The network has inspired similar hubs in Topeka and Kansas City.

Public schools in Wichita closed six buildings last year. Families are looking for alternatives. And there's a whole community of people building them - they just didn't know each other existed until someone started talking.

### The Village Is the Point

Dalena isn't homeschooling alone anymore. She's designing an education - with tutors, co-ops, neighbors, hired teachers, and online curriculum all playing their parts.

The homeschool mom who admits she can't teach everything isn't failing. She's finally being honest about what works. And that honesty is what makes the village possible.

### GUEST BIO

**Dalena Wallace** is a homeschool mom of six and founder of [WISE](https://www.wisetogether.org/) (Wichita Innovative Schools and Educators) and [HERO](https://www.heartlandhero.org/) (Heartland Education Reformation Organization). After 13 years of homeschooling - including running a [Prenda Microschool](https://www.prenda.com/) pilot, founding a 16-family co-op, and nearly quitting from burnout - she developed a hybrid approach that combines home instruction, micro schooling, and community classes. She now helps families find creative learning environments and supports micro school founders across Kansas.
