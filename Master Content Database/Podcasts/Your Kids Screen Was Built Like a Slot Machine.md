## Summary
Explore how screens affect children's nervous systems with Daylight Computer founder Anjan Katta. Learn about e-ink technology creating healthier alternatives for education, ADHD support, and personalized learning.

## Content

Anjan Katta was the kind of kid who couldn't tolerate what everyone else accepted uncritically.

He was sensitive. Probably ADHD. Fluorescent bulbs made him want to crawl out of his skin. In a small town with not much to do, he found refuge in books. His dad was a psychiatrist, so their house was covered in texts revealing what Anjan calls the "deep truth" behind surface reality—about the way the world actually works versus the story we're told.

Computers promised even more knowledge—a Library of Alexandria times a hundred, all accessible from a glowing rectangle.

He thought he'd found a way to get smart enough to understand everything.

Then came the eye strain so severe that doctors thought it was glaucoma.

"I was so dysregulated," he told me.

He spent hours spent reading online, absorbing nothing.

The promise of digital enlightenment had been a mirage. The limiting factor wasn't the information or even the interface. It was literally the screen.

At first, he blamed himself—not enough willpower, not enough discipline. Next he blamed the software—the diabolically designed algorithms, the slot machines of YouTube and infinite feeds.

But he also stumbled upon a deeper root cause: "I didn't quite appreciate how the light and appearance of a computer screen actually deeply plays a role in the way it's dysregulating."

This insight would take him on a six-year journey to solve a technological problem that every expert in the field said was impossible: creating a screen that's as fast as any other device, but with the e-ink technology that's so much easier on the eyes.

By the time he finished, he'd built the [Daylight Computer](https://daylightcomputer.com/)—a screen that works like paper, readable in direct sunlight, with none of the mechanisms that put your nervous system on high alert.

## Your Computer Is a Vegas Casino

The simplest way to describe it: your computer is trying its best to simulate a Vegas casino.

Casinos figured out how to design a light environment that makes people most susceptible to dopamine loops:

1. Block out all natural light
2. Crank the brightness
3. Make everything flicker
4. Oversaturate the colors
5. Keep people trapped indoors

Your kid's Chromebook or iPad was designed—unwittingly or not—the same way.

Anjan breaks down the five mechanisms with the precision of someone who's spent years studying the physics of displays:

**Blue light** affects your vagal tone, nervous system, breathing patterns, and blink rate. It disrupts your dopamine system, melatonin production, and circadian rhythms. Your body thinks it's noon when it's midnight. Every screen session is a small jetlag.

**Flicker** is invisible to your conscious perception, but your nervous system detects the LED backlight pulsing on and off hundreds of times per second. Your brain registers this as subtle, chronic stress. Even "flicker-free" screens aren't actually flicker-free—they just flicker faster than you can consciously detect.

**Brightness mismatch** forces constant adaptation. Your screen is always either brighter or dimmer than your environment, creating what researchers call "accommodation stress." Your pupils are perpetually adjusting, your eye muscles perpetually straining.

**Oversaturated colors** are engineered to be more vivid, more intense, more attention-grabbing than anything in the natural world. This isn't by accident—it's by design. Oversaturated colors overstimulate your dopamine centers. Your brain gets a little hit of novelty with every scroll.

**Indoor captivity** comes last. Backlit screens are nearly impossible to read in direct sunlight, which means you're trapped inside. The screen doesn't just occupy your attention—it dictates your physical location.

The combination of these five mechanisms leads to something called "screen apnea" (like sleep apnea, but for screens).

"Basically, because you have sympathetic overregulation and not enough parasympathetic," Anjan explained, "you actually breathe less when you're on a computer. You take less breaths per minute, and your tidal volume is less, meaning you breathe shallower."

That post-iPad meltdown is your kid's nervous system crashing after being in subtle fight-or-flight mode.

## Finish Your Work and Go Outside

I have a mantra taped to my computer monitor: "Finish your work and go outside."

Ever notice your best ideas never come when you're hunched over a laptop? That's not a coincidence.

When you stare at screens for hours, your eye muscles lock. You lose peripheral vision, awareness of your environment. Your whole sensory experience narrows to a tunnel.

"Unstructured time is the fundamental substrate for creativity," Anjan told me. Your clearest thinking happens with a notepad under a tree, looking up occasionally, letting your eyes relax into the distance.

The logical conclusion of hypertrophy might be the [Apple Vision Pro](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/)—just strap the computer directly to your face. Big educational bets are being made on VR, millions flowing toward kids learning in headsets. (Think Zuckerberg lets his kids hang out unsupervised in the metaverse?)

Kids already spend hours on screens outside of class. Adding more during school sounds like a disaster.

Unless the screen itself is different.

[Nassim Nicholas Taleb says technology works best when it's invisible](https://x.com/nntaleb/status/1605255723105284096)—when it gets out of your way. Paper is what he'd call a "Lindy" technology: thousands of years old because it works with human biology, not against it. No flicker. No blue light. No brightness mismatch. It thrives in natural light, pulling you outside instead of trapping you in.

Could you make a screen that worked like paper but was fast enough for real computing?

According to every expert in the field, the answer was no.

E-ink displays—the technology behind Kindle e-readers—had existed since the 1990s. They worked through reflected light, like actual paper. But they were impossibly slow. They couldn't scroll smoothly, or keep up with real-time typing movement.

"It's good for Harry Potter," Anjan said, "and it's not good for what I wanted."

Generations of researchers tried to speed them up, but failed. By 2018, the field was a graveyard. Professors who'd dedicated decades to the problem had run out of funding and moved on. Companies had burned through investor money and shut down. Everyone agreed: fast e-ink was theoretically possible but practically impossible. The breakthroughs always seemed three years away. And they'd been three years away for thirty years.

Anjan didn't know any of this when he started.

He was in his mid-twenties, no formal training in display technology. He started reading papers, going to conferences, and teaching himself the physics of how displays actually work.

Within two years, he'd reached what he calls "the edge of human knowledge" in the field. The field had stagnated for so long that even an amateur could catch up.

And that's when he saw it.

A Japanese professor who'd been working on this for thirty-plus years. Material science breakthroughs from the Netherlands and Florida State. The crucial insights weren't even from display research but from adjacent opto-electronic fields the specialists weren't monitoring. Combining these specific technologies, the math suggested it would work.

Every expert said no. Not because they could disprove his calculations, but because they'd been burned before. "It won't work," they insisted.

"But can you prove my math is wrong?" Anjan would ask.

Nobody could.

"I think the entire reason I was able to come up with this is because I was not in the field," he told me. "I was completely new and completely naive to this."

Two years of prototyping turned into six. But it worked.

The Daylight Computer works like paper but is computational. It's readable in direct sunlight, but fast enough to actually replace your kid's Chromebook. You can write, browse the web, use apps.

In many ways, it's the original "bicycle for the human mind" that Steve Jobs envisioned back in the eighties.

Jobs had read a study about how much energy different species use to move. Unaided by technology, humans ranked poorly. But humans on bicycles crushed everything. More efficient than condors, cheetahs, everything.

"That's what a computer should be," Jobs said. "It should amplify human capability."

Not a car that does the work for you. On a bicycle, you're still doing the work, just more efficiently and joyfully.

Despite their hippie roots, computers have evolved as machines, not tools. It's like commuting in bumper-to-bumper traffic. The car is fast, but for those who get dysregulated by screens, you're stuck. Your Chromebook has processing power, but your creativity is locked down. The speed becomes irrelevant when you can't actually use it.

"The point of Daylight is the least computer possible," Anjan told me. "You do what you need to do and you put it away and you go outside. And you put your hands in the dirt and you play with other people."

He paused, then added: "The high level thing to share here is not to say that because we've made a healthier screen, we've made a healthier computer. That's not the important part. The important part is actually just being outside, being in the dirt, having your hands on physical things, playing with other kids. That to me is the real sauce."

The reason Daylight exists is because it's unrealistic—and probably not in the best interest of your child's development—to be a Luddite, to completely get away from technology. But when technology is needed, it should get out of the way as fast as possible.

It's not about rejecting technology entirely, but choosing technology that doesn't dysregulate.

One mom told Anjan she went from limiting her kids to 45 minutes per week on an iPad to giving them unlimited screen time on a Daylight. Why? The dysregulation disappeared.

As Anjan put it: ***"More interesting than picking on your sister, but less interesting than your backyard."***

That's the sweet spot.

## What You Can Do Today

I used to think it was my fault I couldn't live up to the sticker on my monitor admonishing me to finish my work and go outside.

But in many ways, society has imposed this on us. Want to work? Stare at a screen. Want to communicate? Stare at a screen. Want your kids to access quality education? Stare at a screen.

It's not your fault if you're stuck. But you are responsible for what happens next. Especially for what you pass on to your kids.

For families choosing alternative education—homeschooling, unschooling, microschools, hybrid approaches—this matters. Chromebook versus textbooks is a false dichotomy. The real choice is between technology that enhances without extraction, and technology that extracts without enhancing.

There are adaptive learning apps like [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), [Mentava](https://www.mentava.com/), [Synthesis](https://www.synthesis.is/), and [Recess.gg](https://www.recess.gg/) that offer incredible personalized learning experiences. But on screens that dysregulate nervous systems, the learning comes with a steep cost.

**Before investing in new hardware, try these strategies:**

1. **Turn on grayscale mode** (Settings > Accessibility on most devices).
2. **Follow a 2:1 outdoor-to-screen ratio**. Modern kids average over 5 hours of recreational screen time daily but only 4-7 minutes of outdoor play.
3. **No screens 90 minutes after waking or 60 minutes before bed**. Morning sunlight resets the circadian clock; evening screens destroy it. Children's melatonin is twice as sensitive to evening light as adults'.
4. **Keep sessions to 20-30 minutes**. Use timers with countdown warnings (10 min, 5 min, 1 min) to prevent the deep dive that makes letting go impossible.
5. **Skip the fast-frame content**. Just 9 minutes of a fast-paced cartoon can significantly weaken young children's executive function. One study found preschoolers who watched SpongeBob performed much worse on attention tasks than those who watched Mister Rogers.

The hippie ideals that birthed Silicon Valley—computers as tools for expanding human potential, as bicycles for the mind—never died. They just went underground, waiting for someone uncomfortable enough, and stubborn enough, to bring them back.

Anjan didn't set out to fulfill Steve Jobs' abandoned vision. He just wanted to keep learning without destroying his eyes.

"Our goal is just to show people there can be hope," he told me. "Computers don't need to be so terrible for you. There is another way and these big companies will not let you know this."
