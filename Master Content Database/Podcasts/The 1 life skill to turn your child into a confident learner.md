## Summary
Is cooking the solution to America's youth anxiety crisis? Katie Kimball thinks so.

## Content

America just fell off the list of top 20 happiest countries in the world.

The reason? Our kids.

No – our kids aren’t making us less happy. It’s our teens, whose anxiety levels are so staggeringly high that they're dragging down our entire national happiness ranking. We're talking about a generation that reports feeling more anxious, helpless, and overwhelmed than any generation before them.

Katie Kimball has been watching this unfold for over a decade. As a former teacher turned life skills educator and founder of [Kids Cook Real Food](https://kidscookrealfood.com/), she's worked with thousands of families struggling with anxious, dependent kids who can't seem to handle basic life challenges.

"We look at our stats on anxiety, and it just breaks my heart," Kimball told me recently. "America has fallen off the list of top 20 happiest countries in the world, and it's because of the kids in their teens and twenties - their anxiety is so high."

Unlike many commentators, Kimball doesn't blame screens, social media, or economic uncertainty for the anxiety epidemic. She blames something much more fundamental.

Us. The parents.

## The Helicopter Paradox

The story starts with love. Parents who wanted to give their kids better childhoods than they had. Parents who saw struggle and decided their children shouldn't have to experience it.

"When we bubble wrap our kids, when we engage in helicopter parenting - which is super well intentioned - parents are simply thinking, 'I want to keep my kids safe,'" Kimball explains. "But it actually makes kids really anxious when people are doing everything for them and when they feel like the world is a very scary place."

Think about what we've done over the past two decades. We removed risk from childhood. Eliminated failure from school. Made sure every kid got a participation trophy. Drove them everywhere. Did their projects. Called their teachers. Solved their problems.

In doing so, we created kids who feel fundamentally incompetent to handle life.

"If you perceive the world as more dangerous than it truly is, and you lack the skills to care for yourself because others have always done everything for you, you'll navigate life with constant anxiety due to that lack of control."

No control. That's the key insight here.

Anxiety isn't really about fear - it's about the feeling that you can't handle whatever comes next. And we've systematically taught an entire generation that they can't handle things by... handling everything for them.

Kimball has a theory about how we got here. She calls it the "skipped generation" phenomenon.

"Our generation was a little bit skipped," she observes. "Our mothers, very well intentioned, wanted our childhoods to be easier than their childhoods. In so doing, they skipped teaching us basics of cooking and household chores, and they made our adulthoods harder."

Here's the pattern: Easy childhood leads to hard adulthood. And those adults, having struggled to figure out basic life skills themselves, decided their kids shouldn't have to go through that struggle either.

So they skipped even more.

The result is college students who can't do laundry, can't cook a meal, can't handle conflict, can't solve basic problems. They've been so protected from failure that they never learned how to recover from it.

But here's what's wild: The solution isn't more therapy or anxiety medication (though those have their place). The solution is embarrassingly simple.

Teach them they're capable.

## The Confidence Bucket

In teaching kids to cook, Kimball discovered something remarkable: confidence is transferable.

"We have this one bucket of confidence," she explains clearly. "When your kids build skills and competency in the kitchen that raises their confidence, and it naturally flows into their academics, social lives, and the way they interact with adults."

This means you don't need to fix every area of your kid's life separately. You just need to give them genuine competence in one area, and it spills over everywhere else.

But - and this is crucial - it has to be real competence. Not fake self-esteem. Not participation trophies. Not "you're amazing just as you are" platitudes.

Actual skills. Actual capability. Actual evidence that they can handle things.

Kimball saw this pattern over and over with the families in her [cooking courses](https://kidscookrealfood.com/): Kids who learned to use sharp knives safely, who could make meals independently, who could handle the "failure" of burnt biscuits, suddenly became more confident in completely unrelated areas.

"Cooking is more than just food," she realized. "This is a huge sandbox for teaching kids how to fail, how to really raise those competencies and raise that confidence."

## The Low-Stakes Training Ground

Here's the genius of Kimball's approach: She's not advocating for throwing kids into high-stakes situations. She's advocating for the opposite.

"We want our kids to fail when the stakes are really low, before we hand them the car keys and the fully unlocked iPhone," she says. "The stakes are much higher then, and they need to develop risk management skills with things like a chef's knife, a paring knife, or a hot stove first—before they're taking risks behind the wheel of a car."

This is brilliant risk management. Instead of eliminating all risk (which creates anxious, incompetent adults), you create graduated risk experiences that build genuine competence.

A 7-year-old learning to cut vegetables with a sharp knife under supervision? Low stakes. They might get a small cut, learn to be more careful, and develop knife skills.

An 18-year-old who's never handled any real responsibility suddenly given a car and complete freedom? Extremely high stakes.

The problem is we've eliminated the low-stakes practice opportunities, then wondered why our kids can't handle the high-stakes real world.

This isn't just about individual families. Kimball sees a broader threat to American competitiveness.

"I see a growing sense of entitlement, particularly in the younger generation, where the mindset is often 'others should do things for me,'" she warns. "This isn't an attitude that will sustain a country's future. We need problem solvers. We need to continue innovating."

She's connecting dots that most people miss. The same helicopter parenting that creates anxious individuals also creates a culture of dependency. Kids who grow up expecting others to solve their problems become adults who expect the same thing.

That's  bad for the entire economic system that depends on innovation, entrepreneurship, and problem-solving.

America's historic advantage has been our "can-do" culture. The belief that individuals can figure things out, take risks, and create solutions. If we raise a generation that doesn't believe they can handle basic life challenges, we lose that advantage.

## The Practical Fix

So how do you reverse this? Kimball's approach is refreshingly practical.

"Try to follow your kids' interests," she suggests. "If they are still at the age that they're showing interest... just what might they be able to accomplish? Something simple, little, little steps."

The key is starting where kids are naturally curious and building from there. Not forcing arbitrary responsibilities, but channeling their existing motivation into genuine skill development.

For Kimball, the kitchen became the perfect laboratory because it combines multiple learning opportunities: following directions, handling tools safely, managing time, dealing with failure, and creating something valuable.

But the specific skill matters less than the approach: Give kids real responsibilities with real consequences in environments where failure is safe and learning is inevitable.

The ROI on this approach is remarkable. As Kimball puts it: "Yes, it will take five to 10 more minutes here and there to slow down and teach your kids. You get that time back in spades because when the whole family is helping, then you actually get more time to go climb the tree together."

Short-term investment in teaching. Long-term payoff in capable kids. Plus better family dynamics when everyone contributes instead of one person doing everything.

One insight that stood out from my conversation with Kimball was her emphasis on creating family culture around competence and contribution.

"I'll say things like, 'Kimball's do this and Kimball's do that. And Kimball's don't do this,'" she explains. "Having that family culture and using phrases like that with your last name gives kids roots."

This isn't about creating rigid rules - it's about establishing identity around capability and contribution. Kids need to know they belong to something that expects good things from them.

The alternative is what we have now: kids who don't know what's expected of them, who have no clear path to earning genuine respect and confidence, who are anxious because they have no role to play in their own lives.

## The Choice We Face

Here's where we are: We've tried making everything easy for kids. We've tried eliminating all challenges, all failures, all struggles.

And we’ve created the most anxious, least capable generation in American history.

The alternative is what Kimball calls "competence culture over comfort culture." It means accepting that some struggle is necessary for development. That kids need to learn they can handle things by actually handling things.

"I really do want my kids and your kids to grow up to be independent, competent human beings who contribute," Kimball says. "The only way to do that is to give them skills."

The anxiety epidemic isn't inevitable. We created this problem through well-intentioned but misguided choices. We can fix it by making different choices.

Your anxious kid isn't broken. They just need to learn they're more capable than anyone ever told them.

What's one small skill you could teach them this week? What's one way you could let them fail safely and learn they can handle it?

The future of American innovation might depend on how you answer those questions.
