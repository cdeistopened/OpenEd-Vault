## Summary
Why children need unstructured play, not more screen time: How microschools are engineering play back into education with 3 hours outside daily.

## Content

Ginger Montezon still has the Post-it note, yellowing at the edges now. She'd stuck it on Kristin Fink's desk during a particularly brutal week in 2019, back when they were both teaching at a conventional private school in Minnesota. The note read:

***"Kristin, you need to start a school and I'll come work for you."***

At the time, it felt like wishful thinking—the kind of thing exhausted teachers say to each other during lunch duty while managing 26 kids who'd rather be anywhere else. But three years later, that Post-it note would become the founding document of [SKOLA](https://skolamicroschool.com/): a microschool where children spend three hours outside every day, where there are no letter grades (even in middle school), and where boredom is celebrated as the gateway to discovery.

"COVID was the catalyst," Ginger tells me, "but honestly, we were already burning out." After eighteen years in traditional classrooms, she'd hit a wall.

The kids had changed—they came to school already exhausted from overscheduling, anxious about performance, and more comfortable interacting with screens than with each other. They'd lost something essential: the ability to create their own fun, to resolve their own conflicts, to simply *be* without adult intervention.

Meanwhile, the system hadn't changed at all. Something had to give.

What Kristin and Ginger discovered—and what a growing body of research confirms—is that the screens aren't the real problem. They're a symptom. The actual crisis runs deeper: we've systematically eliminated the one thing children's developing brains need most. Not more structure. Not better curriculum. Not earlier academics.

Play.

Unstructured, child-directed play. The kind where kids negotiate their own rules, assess their own risks, and solve their own problems. The kind that looks, to anxious modern eyes, like a waste of time.

## Screens Are the Default, Not the Desire

According to the 1000 Hours Outside blog, [American children now spend just 4-7 minutes a day playing outside](https://www.1000hoursoutside.com/blog/children-should-be-outside-for-4-6-hours-everyday)—less time than maximum-security prisoners spend in the yard. They're in front of screens for [over 7 hours daily](https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/nccdphp/dnpao/multimedia/infographics/getmoving.html).

Not surprisingly, there have been consequences for mental health: [anxiety disorders affect 31.9% of adolescents](https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/facts-statistics), and [rates of adolescent depression doubled from 8% in 2009 to 16% in 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8868033/).

Jonathan Haidt, the social psychologist who's been tracking this crisis, argues that this is a direct result of replacing a "play-based childhood" with a "phone-based childhood."

But here's what makes the situation even more tragic: when you actually ask kids what they want, [they don't choose screens](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/08/kids-smartphones-play-freedom/683742/). They choose real, physical, social play with other children.

"Being glued to screens is their DEFAULT not their DESIRE," [says Lenore Skenazy](https://letgrow.org/let-grow-in-the-atlantic-the-surprising-reason-kids-are-glued-to-their-phones/), founder of [Let Grow](http://letgrow.org) and one of the leading voices in the childhood independence movement.

Think about it: How often do you find yourself scrolling when you'd rather be walking, creating, or connecting with others? We fall into screen habits not because we prefer them, but because they're the path of least resistance.

And for kids, it's even worse. Screens are simply filling a void we've created by eliminating real-world freedom. Most children today aren't allowed in public spaces without adult supervision. One in five aren't allowed to play in their own front yard.

If the problem is that we've engineered play out of childhood, the solution is straightforward (even if it's not easy): we need to engineer it back in.

## “You Have the Most Beautiful Dataset”

For decades before Kristin and Ginger's revelation, researchers had been documenting what we were losing.

[Peter Gray](https://www.petergray.org/) has spent his career studying play from an evolutionary and developmental perspective. In the 1950s, he'd grown up in small Minnesota towns like the one where Kristin and Ginger now teach. Back then, kids disappeared after school and parents didn't panic.

His research revealed something profound: play isn't preparation for learning—it *is* learning.

"Play is, first and foremost, an expression of freedom," Gray [writes](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freedom-learn/200811/the-value-play-i-the-definition-play-gives-insights). "It is what one wants to do as opposed to what one is obliged to do."

In his research, he's documented that play is **quite literally the job of children**—it's how they're biologically programmed to learn. Hunter-gatherer children, who have unlimited time for self-directed play, develop all the skills they need for adult life without a single worksheet or standardized test. They learn to navigate complex social hierarchies, assess risk, solve problems creatively, and regulate their emotions—all through play.

In 1972—the same year that Gray became a psychology professor at Boston College—a revolutionary study about childhood was beginning on the other side of the world.

[In Dunedin, New Zealand, researchers began following 1,037 babies](https://www.science.org/content/article/two-psychologists-followed-1000-new-zealanders-decades-here-s-what-they-found-about-how) born in a single year, tracking everything about their lives—health, behavior, relationships, finances. By the time these children reached their thirties, the study would produce one of the most important datasets in human development research.

Fifteen years into the study, two scientists would take the helm whose love story began over data. [Terrie Moffitt and Avshalom Caspi met at a conference in 1987](https://www.science.org/content/article/two-psychologists-followed-1000-new-zealanders-decades-here-s-what-they-found-about-how), where Caspi, not typically forward, was captivated by Moffitt's research poster.

"You have the most beautiful data set," he told her. She went to the library afterward to check his citations.

"It was very nerdy," Caspi recalled. "We fell in love over our data."

As the Dunedin children grew into adults, the data began to show something extraordinary: [children who demonstrated strong self-control at age 3](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1010076108)—measured by their ability to delay gratification, persist through challenges, and regulate their emotions—were more likely to have better physical health, higher incomes, and fewer criminal convictions three decades later. The effect was so strong it held true even when controlling for social class and IQ.

Here's the crucial connection: [These self-control skills](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3041102/) aren't developed through worksheets or direct instruction. They're developed through play. When children wait their turn in a game, negotiate rules with peers, persist in building a fort despite setbacks, or manage disappointment when they lose—they're building the exact capacities the Dunedin Study found predict life success.

In other words, the ability to navigate the complex social world of childhood play at age three predicts your salary at thirty-three better than your parents' income or your intelligence.

## The Four Pillars of Childhood Play

After opening SKOLA with their three guiding principles—more time outside, meeting students where they are, and building genuine community—Kristin and Ginger had to figure out what "more time outside" actually meant in practice.

Kristin made a decision that would have seemed insane in her previous teaching life: she stopped teaching during outdoor time and started observing instead.

"I noticed pockets of kids, all 100% engaged," she recalls. "But they were doing completely different things."

After months of observation, she identified four distinct categories that emerged naturally when children were left to their own devices:

**1. Imagination Play:** The elaborate games where walnuts become currency in elaborate economic systems, and where stories from morning read-alouds transform into afternoon epics. This is where creativity and narrative thinking develop, where children learn to hold complex scenarios in their heads and negotiate shared fictional worlds.

**2. Competitive Structured Games:** The games with rules, winners, and losers. Hide-and-seek, football, elaborate variations of tag that would make a game designer weep with envy. Here, children learn to handle disappointment, follow agreed-upon structures, and experience the sweet tension between competition and friendship.

**3. Civil Engineering:** "One time," Kristin laughs, "they gathered every dead branch in the entire woods. I had to call the city office like, 'I don't know if you wanted this project done, but we gathered all the dead sticks for you.'" This is applied physics, resource management, and project planning. It's also where children learn that their actions can literally reshape the world around them.

**4. Social Hangout:** Just talking. Telling jokes. Being together without agenda. In our productivity-obsessed culture, this might seem like wasted time. But this is where children learn the subtle art of human connection—reading social cues, understanding humor, building the foundations of friendship.

"We'll stand back-to-back during outdoor time," Ginger explains, "and we can name every kid and what's happening with them. 'I'm concerned about anxiety with this one,' or 'These two have been in conflict all week.' This is what we dreamed about in teacher meetings but never had time for."

## Microschool is Having a Moment

What Kristin and Ginger discovered through observation, a growing movement of educators across the country is putting into practice. Microschools—small learning communities of 5-15 students—are proliferating precisely because they have the flexibility to break the mold of what we think school has to be.

Kerry McDonald, author of [*Joyful Learning*](https://a.co/d/e9TWGBc) and a leading voice in the educational freedom movement, points to research by Harvard education professor Todd Rose that reveals a crucial insight: "Americans don't want 'better'; they want different," Rose found. "They want a way out of the one-size-fits-all approach driven by standardized testing models and elite institutions making us compete in a zero-sum game and instead an educational framework geared towards individualized learning, practical skills, and preparation for a meaningful life."

Unlike traditional schools bound by state regulations requiring specific hours of "seat time," standardized curricula, and rigid schedules, microschools can prioritize what actually works for children. They can spend three hours outside. They can let kids work at their own pace. They can treat play not as a reward for finishing work, but as the work itself.

While Kristin and Ginger were transforming education in Minnesota, Kelly Smith, a software entrepreneur with no formal education training, was discovering the same truths in Arizona. He'd started teaching kids to code at his local library and noticed something remarkable: when children had ownership over their learning, magic happened.

Smith [recalls the exact moment he decided to start a school](https://substack.com/home/post/p-156614559?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web), standing on a sidewalk in a cul-de-sac next to his gold Toyota Avalon. His friend Andy—a calm, logical computer scientist with a math PhD—tried to warn him off the idea. "Starting a school is crazy," Andy told him. Coming from someone who was never wrong about anything, it should have been enough to stop him. But it was already too late. On January 3, 2018, Smith sat at his kitchen table with his son and six neighborhood children, launching what would become [Prenda](https://www.prenda.com/), now the largest network of microschools in the country.

The results speak for themselves. According to [New Hampshire Department of Education data on Prenda microschools](https://www.americafirstpolicy.com/issues/state-policy-actions-to-support-microschools-another-option-for-families), 54% of struggling students showed at least one full grade level of growth in English language arts, and 62% showed similar growth in mathematics.

What makes Prenda's approach work? The same principle Kristin and Ginger discovered: when you give children real freedom and autonomy, when you trust them with unstructured time, they become more focused and productive during structured learning. Play doesn't steal time from learning; it creates the conditions that make deep learning possible.

## The Undoing

For children who transfer from traditional schools to places like SKOLA or Prenda's microschools, there's a process Kristin calls "the undoing."

"We heard this quote: 'For however many years you're in a system, it's going to take that many months to actually shed everything off before you can rebuild,'" she explains. "I was coming out with 18 years of teaching, so I needed to give myself 18 months."

The same is true for students. Those who've spent years being told when to speak, when to move, when to use the bathroom, don't immediately know what to do with freedom. They look for permission. They wait for instructions. They ask, "Is this right?" about things that have no right answer.

But then something shifts: "They learn that intrinsic motivation," Ginger notes. "It's not about them making me proud; it's about them feeling accomplished for the work they've done."

This shift—from external validation to internal satisfaction—is exactly what the research shows is necessary for lifelong success and wellbeing. And it can't be taught directly. It has to be discovered through experience, through the freedom to make choices, take risks, and own the consequences.

The objections are predictable and understandable:

"But what about academic rigor?" "How will they handle structure later?" "Won't they fall behind?" "What about college?"

Children in play-rich, self-directed learning environments don't sacrifice academics—Gray's [research](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter-Gray-11) shows they often outperform their traditionally-schooled peers while developing superior executive function, creativity, and mental health. They develop intrinsic motivation—the desire to learn for learning's sake, not for grades or approval—which predicts lifelong success far better than any test score.

"You can get a lot done in a couple hours a day," Smith notes, referring to the focused academic work that happens when children have had adequate time for play and self-direction. His microschools dedicate just two hours to "Conquer mode"—focused math and reading work—yet students consistently show dramatic academic growth.

Of course, shifting to a play-based approach isn't as simple as opening the door and letting kids run outside. There are systemic barriers—zoning laws that prevent microschools, state regulations requiring specific hours of "seat time," and funding structures that penalize alternatives.

And there's cultural programming to overcome.

"If I took my kids outside for an extra recess, I felt like I'd be judged," Ginger remembers of her days as a conventional teacher. "Like my kids are not working enough."

But perhaps the biggest barrier is our own discomfort with uncertainty. When children play freely, we can't guarantee specific outcomes. We can't check boxes on a standardized curriculum map. We have to trust the process—and trust children themselves.

## Engineering Play Back Into Childhood

For families wanting to reclaim play, Ginger offers practical wisdom: "If you typically get outside 10 minutes a day, make a goal of 20 and build from there."

"I've gotten comfortable with my son saying, 'I'm bored,'" she says. "Actually, that's okay. The best stuff comes from boredom. It takes about five, ten minutes, and then he has his Legos out, or he's on his bike, or taking his fishing pole to the lake."

You don't need to start a microschool or completely upend your life.

Find another family—just one—who's willing to let their kids play unsupervised for an hour a week. Then two hours. Then an afternoon.

Notice which of Kristin's four types of play your child gravitates toward. Which ones do they avoid? What might that tell you about what they need?

Most importantly, start seeing play not as a break from learning but as learning itself. As Peter Gray puts it: "Play is the work of children."

"Several times a week," Kristin says, "there are 32 different things going on in this room, and we just stare at each other and go fill up our coffee. We bask in it, because this is the teacher's dream."

Two veteran teachers, with decades of experience between them, saying that their highest professional achievement is creating conditions where children don't need them.

As I write this, there are approximately 100,000 public elementary and secondary schools in the United States. There are perhaps [a few thousand microschools](https://microschoolingcenter.org/). The revolution is still tiny.

But revolutions don't start with everyone changing at once. They start with someone, somewhere, deciding to try something different.

Ginger still has that Post-it note. She had it laminated.

The front door is right there. All we need to do is open it.
